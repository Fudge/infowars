[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  We're live. Saturday, February 19, 2022, on the verge of thermonuclear war, followed by the tune-in now. Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:26.000 --> 00:34.000]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  We will be ready with Syria's political, economic, and military responses.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump. But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  We came, we saw, we died.
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:13.000 --> 01:22.000]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:27.000 --> 01:35.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  Of course not, because she's...
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  All right, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:08.000 --> 02:32.000]  There are millions now waking up to the fact that they have been used in some sort of nefarious scientific experiment.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  And many are suffering serious physical side effects as a result.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  We can clearly see in the evidence presented by Dr. Yeedon's crew at HowBadIsMyBatch.com
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  that different batches of the same vaccine are being deployed and monitored on a set schedule.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  And studies from New Zealand and Spain have shown that there is cutting edge nanotech in the Pfizer vaccine.
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  It is a massive human experiment. It's killing people, injuring people and destroying people's immune, neurological,
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  cardiovascular and reproductive systems. People who trusted their government and people who trusted the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  Trust is a beautiful thing with someone close but not with strangers we see on the television.
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  And there is never a good reason to trust your government. When a bloated government's main concern is profit and war,
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  then psychopaths with degrees will be funded to research and develop more efficient ways of killing and controlling people.
[03:35.000 --> 03:46.000]  This has been going on for a long, long time. In 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service began the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Patients were lied to about being treated for syphilis and were unknowingly kept sick and made worse.
[03:53.000 --> 04:01.000]  During World War Two, the Russians were using unsuspecting political prisoners to test lethal poisons on.
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.000]  The U.S. tested mustard gas on soldiers. The Japanese tested biological weapons on Chinese prisoners.
[04:10.000 --> 04:19.000]  And the infamous Angel of Death, Dr. Joseph Mengele, was performing all sorts of horrific experiments on people in the concentration camps.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  Researchers at Vanderbilt University gave pregnant mothers radioactive iron in what they were told were vitamin drinks.
[04:28.000 --> 04:39.000]  In the 1950s, Dr. William Sweet was funded by the government to inject unsuspecting patients at Massachusetts General Hospital with uranium.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  Immunology expert Chester Southam injected prisoners in Ohio with cancer.
[04:44.000 --> 04:52.000]  The University of California experimented on newborns by freezing them and injecting air into their brains.
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  Israeli doctors killed tens of thousands of Arab children with radiation poisoning.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  And in Montreal, Canada, Dr. Ewen Cameron was treating hundreds of patients with the same bizarre procedure,
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  whether they were seeking a remedy for schizophrenia, depression or an injured leg.
[05:11.000 --> 05:20.000]  Dr. Cameron treated them all by putting them into a chemical coma for up to months at a time while subjecting their bodies to electroshock.
[05:20.000 --> 05:30.000]  And just a few years prior to this, Dr. Cameron was invited to the Nuremberg trials for a psychiatric evaluation of Rudolph Hess.
[05:30.000 --> 05:37.000]  Perhaps the darkest and most prevalent experiment on humanity prior to covid-19 is MK Ultra,
[05:37.000 --> 05:46.000]  an endless web of inhumane projects primarily involving trauma based mind control and the torture of children.
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.000]  While legacy media often shows you the lurid sex and drugs aspect of MK Ultra,
[05:53.000 --> 06:04.000]  they don't show you the congressional testimony of victims who were kept in cages, raked and tortured as children in part of the U.S. government's human radiation experience.
[06:04.000 --> 06:13.000]  I was a subject in radiation, as well as mind control and drug experiments performed by a man I knew as Dr. Green.
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  The first significant memory took place at Kansas City University in 1966.
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.000]  Don Ebner took me there by plane when my mom was out of town.
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  I was in what looked like a laboratory and there seemed to be other children.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  I was strapped down, naked, spread eagle on a table on my back.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  Dr. Green had electrodes on my body, including my head.
[06:36.000 --> 06:45.000]  He used what looked like an overhead projector and repeatedly said he was burning different images into my brain while a red light flashed aimed at my forehead.
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  I felt drugged because he had given me a shot before he started the procedure.
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  When it was over, he gave me another shot.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  The next thing I remember, I was with my grandparents again in Tucson, Arizona.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  I was four years old.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  The victims were given an apology by a smirking President Clinton, which is more than most victims have ever gotten.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  Nothing has changed.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  These are only a few of the many illegal human experiments that we know of.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  And there has never been any justice as it stands now.
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  Big Pharma is well protected from any liability.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  Governments, corporations and strangers on TV do not deserve our trust.
[07:29.000 --> 07:38.000]  Their role should be to serve humanity and endure our eternal scrutiny and vigilance.
[07:38.000 --> 07:54.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese.
[07:54.000 --> 08:06.000]  To kill and control a brief history of unlawful human experiments by major governments in the last 100 years.
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  It went live just a few hours ago at Band.video, the Greg Reese section.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  It's Saturday, February 19th, 2022.
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  It is 207, now 208, Central Standard Time.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  We are live, teleprompter free.
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  Unfiltered, uncensored, a last ditch effort to save the republic and the world.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  And so don't thank me for being here on Saturday.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  I want to thank the crew and I want to thank all of you that care.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  Out of the 8 billion people on this planet, the billions that are able to tune in,
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  you are the millions that actually care, that are actually awake,
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  and are the spark of light we need to set brushfires on the minds of men and women everywhere
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  that Thomas Jefferson talked about to defeat the tyranny that we face in our time.
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  So please take the live feed links from Infowars.com forward slash show and Band.video
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  and share them with everyone you know.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  If you have trouble sharing those links,
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  the current URL that they're not completely banned yet is future news dot news, future news dot news.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  And the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  If the situation was hopeless, they wouldn't need to do all this brainwashing and censorship
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  if what they were selling was good. But it's not what they're selling is slavery.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  That's why none of it makes sense until you understand what these globalists are actually up to.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  Let me just first tell you what's coming up today in this commercial free live transmission.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  That doesn't mean we might take a few breaks. There might be an ad here or there,
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  but we don't run the standard commercial 14 minutes an hour for TV and radio stations when we do these broadcasts.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  And I told you coming up into March of this year, now only a few weeks away,
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  I'm going to start doing at least three commercial free broadcasts a week on top of the regular show.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  These are very popular. Millions of people are tuning in and there's so much huge news and they're trying to take us off the air.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  They've already taken almost everybody else off the air or trying to censor them or block them.
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  And so we just have responsibility in this day and age to be here and to burn the midnight oil if we're doing it.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  So thank you for your prayers and your financial support and your word of mouth.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  We are truly all in this together. You are the resistance. You are the info war.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  And I want to salute you and thank you again.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  OK, in the order of importance, put all this ties together.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  There's been a proxy war going on for eight years in Ukraine.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  The West is clearly running offensives, pressing the Russians up against the border in Russian held areas to trigger a response by the Russians.
[10:46.000 --> 10:54.000]  And the Russians have been firing off their new Mach eight, Mach nine super missiles.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  And it's it's it's just a real crisis.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  Obviously, we're going to be hitting all of that right here.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  These two stacks. First, then Canada.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  Unbelievable exercise in the Bilderberg Group.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  Club of Rome. Captured elite.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Davos group operation.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  Well, I don't say those terms that sound fancy. You can search and study each one.
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  Just like when I popularized the term false flag 25 years ago.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  They credit me with popularizing it. It's in all the history books. It's in the military manuals.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  Our military's taught false flags in case they have to do them.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  Yeah, the good guys do it, too, folks. The point is, is that.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  They don't want you knowing about this stuff. You have a little kid table at Thanksgiving or Christmas with the three and four year olds and you have the adult table.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  Info wars is the adult table. And I know you know that.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  You'd explain to your friends and family that laugh at folks that are informed like you and I or those of us trying to be more informed.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  None of us are perfect. We all see through rose colored darkly as the Bible tells us.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  We all distort things, but the Holy Spirit gives us more discernment, more clarity.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  That making fun of people that are informed isn't fun and isn't cool.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  And it's going to get.
[12:12.000 --> 12:22.000]  Us in a lot of trouble. It runs the gambit from collapse of civilization to war and to mass death and extinction of life on this planet.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  That's the spectrum we're on here now. It runs from bad to worse.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  So I want to commend everybody that actually cares. So, so, so that's one little quadrant of the massive news that I'm going to hit first here in a moment.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  Let me tell you what else is coming up. These stacks all right here.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  All these stacks right here. Canada is under a corporate martial law training drill, just like China, with its police state.
[12:47.000 --> 12:57.000]  In response to COVID that came out of the lab was a train us about police state, New World Order and biomedical tyranny and world ideas and social credit scores and carbon taxes and martial law.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  This is just the next extension of it with the Davos group.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  Complete operative Trudeau under the command of Klaus Schwab.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  Running over women on mobility scooters with horses, the horses stomping men, women and children.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  It's all on video.
[13:17.000 --> 13:25.000]  To tasering people, to flash banging people, to tear gassing them, pepper spraying them.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  While saying leftist groups are allowed to protest, only anti lockdown folks have been banned and he suspended the parliament.
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  In his emergency declaration, first time in Canadian history with that show that they can't speak, but they still want to be heard parliamentary.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  So they're letting them Skype in or zoom in.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  And when they talk bad about Trudeau or Klaus Schwab, the speaker of the parliament shuts them down.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  This is on international television.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  You're not allowed to talk about the New World Order.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And they cut the guy off and they say you are not allowed to talk about conspiracy theories.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Klaus Schwab goes on TV and says, I control Trudeau.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  I control half the Canadian cabinet of the government, which we know the names.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Look at his cabinet. It isn't half of them.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  He controls almost two thirds.
[14:15.000 --> 14:24.000]  The the the co-chair of his damn Deibos group, the World Economic Forum, is the finance minister that declared the martial law.
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  And yeah, we'll show you the clip where he brags about it with David Gergen on TV.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  But when members of parliament talk about it, they cut their feet.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  And then tell them you are not allowed to speak to that.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  You're like, that's like North Korea. Yeah. Here's how tyranny works.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  Once you go over the edge, it's a free fall.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  And it's a free fall right now. So that's that's coming up.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Unbelievable information in these three stacks.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Then there's the COVID stacks. Three as well.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  Unbelievable good news. Unbelievably horrible news.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  Unbelievably ugly news. It's it's just insane.
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  But the wheels have come off. The house of cards has collapsed.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  I mean, here's just one of them.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  I have two videos of Bill Gates will actually have five or six, but I have two that we're going to definitely play.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  Bill Gates says Omicron, sadly, that's a quote, spreads immunity faster than vaccines and helped everybody not die.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  He actually says that he doesn't even try to hide it, folks.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  He thinks he's invincible for these psychos. That's her favorite thing.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  He also says we should always be forced to wear a mask like pants.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  That's coming up.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  Then we have really good news. Federal Appeals Court, United Airlines vaccine mandate violates the Nuremberg Code,
[15:39.000 --> 15:49.000]  the Geneva Convention and federal law in coercing employees to violate religious convictions and that no medical procedures can be coerced under international, federal and state law.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  We've only told you that like eight thousand times. I know you know that already.
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  We've had top lawyers on like the one that wrote the U.S. biological chemical weapons law and helped write the U.N. law,
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  was the former chief prosecutor at the U.N. telling you this is all illegal on its face.
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  Just, oh, you're crazy. You don't want us to put something experimental in you?
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  And it gets worse. That's only.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Three things out of the stack of more than 50. It gets more insane.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  There are suddenly government announcements everywhere from the CDC and FDA that heart attacks and strokes, including in children, are normal.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  And everybody should just get used to it. And that walking can make you have strokes or die.
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  So walking is now bad. It's not the deadly shots that all the scientists said would cause blood clots.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  Myocarditis, heart attacks. No, no.
[16:41.000 --> 16:50.000]  It's it's just the new the way it is in the coroner's and the pathologist all around the Western world say they're seeing massive increases.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  Multi thousand percent increases in different heart attacks and blood clots. But that's OK.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  Why is it OK? Because Tim Cook's gay.
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  And, you know, I make that joke, but Bill Maher even came out Friday. I got that clip, too.
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  I think I forgot to tell the crew to get it, but go ahead and get it. It's on him for like an eight minute monologue.
[17:09.000 --> 17:17.000]  It's it's good to see him coming on board, just like. Joe Rogan, everybody else, because I mean, you really want to choose productivity and prosperity or total destruction.
[17:17.000 --> 17:28.000]  I'm saying I trust Bill Maher as far as I can throw him, but. He's like, what's up with the left all promoting death camps in China and how it's cute, but it's OK because you're all liberal or you're gay or whatever.
[17:28.000 --> 17:35.000]  He's like, it doesn't matter whether you're gay or straight. If you support death camps, you're a fascist pig. Exactly.
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  Well, Tucker Carlson talk about on Thursday, he said the left knows how to pose in little pink outfits and nonthreatening.
[17:41.000 --> 17:48.000]  And, you know, they got that 70s hair and everything's cutesy, but it's very authoritarian beneath the surface.
[17:48.000 --> 17:58.000]  It's got a velvet glove on it. That's why so many of these executives are doing this fake effeminate thing and acting all friendly and fake and nice,
[17:58.000 --> 18:06.000]  like the number four guy at Facebook that just got fired because he flew to Indiana to have sex with a 13 year old boy and got caught.
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.000]  And he's this big Nelly, like six foot five guy, real sweet. Yeah, I bet he's real sweet behind the scenes, folks.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  It's an act by predators like an alligator or a crocodile act like a log.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  Until a deer comes up by the edge of the pond and then it kills it.
[18:23.000 --> 18:35.000]  The guy's a frickin crocodile, but he puts on that little look because that's how you catch the kids and get them in your car.
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  I've tried to explain this to everybody, but it's OK. He's wearing a black sweater.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  It's almost like a black turtleneck like Tim Cook. So now it's OK.
[18:45.000 --> 18:51.000]  So that's all coming up today. That's four of the stacks.
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  Let me tell you what else is in the stack. Jeffrey Epstein's European right hand man on record,
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  reportedly supplied thousands of children as young as eight to Jeffrey Epstein and world leaders.
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.000]  Well, he got. Found in his jail cell, hung himself, of course, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.000]  Right. You know, there's only a few things out there that hang themselves and it's not Christmas lights.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  It's not drywall and it's not Jeffrey Epstein.
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  Oh, and of course, the cops, the jail guards that the federal president indicted, they dropped those indictments last month.
[19:26.000 --> 19:34.000]  And surprise, surprise, the guards are all getting really lucrative security jobs being paid triple what they were.
[19:34.000 --> 19:45.000]  Gee, that's really interesting. So Jeffrey Epstein's close friend and pimp, Jean Luc Brunel, found dead in a parent prison suicide.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  He allegedly hanged himself. Prison cameras were not working at the time.
[19:49.000 --> 19:57.000]  Oh, just like two years ago with Jeffrey Epstein or I guess 26 months ago now, how time flies.
[19:57.000 --> 20:04.000]  Oh. Oh, there's a lot more. I got like 30 videos.
[20:04.000 --> 20:10.000]  And I've got. Just just just so much stuff here that it makes my head spin.
[20:11.000 --> 20:19.000]  And I'm just asking everyone to tune into the broadcast and to tell your friends and family to tune in because they want this show shut down.
[20:19.000 --> 20:26.000]  Number one. And I've tried to explain to everybody I've been let in by top people that are not with the globalists on their plan.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  That's why I'm able to predict so much is because I actually have sources and I'm able to do my own research.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  And the more successful we get and the more stalwart we get, the more people give us intel.
[20:36.000 --> 20:43.000]  I mean, here's just a little example, not to brag. You know, I told you a year ago, I said Joe Rogan doesn't make one hundred million dollars a year.
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  Joe Rogan makes two hundred million off one contract because he told me all this.
[20:47.000 --> 20:59.000]  And he said, don't get into details. But, you know, I just want people to know that when they're all mad about Joe, like people think that, oh, my gosh, he might have taken the rumble offer of one hundred million.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  Well, I would have to be three hundred million a year. And I said that a few weeks ago.
[21:03.000 --> 21:11.000]  And here's Forbes. Two hundred million a year. Two hundred million a year.
[21:11.000 --> 21:18.000]  Now, stuff like that's not that important intel. You know, Joe told me six months before he was going to Spotify and had done the contract, but didn't don't tell anybody.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  I'm like, well, damn, Joe, why do you tell me all this? Well, I really trust you, Alex, which he does. But I never told anybody. I never insider traded either.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  I just love to rub it into the left and people that you don't get the intel, you don't get the information.
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  Well, that information with Joe Rogan's really not that important, is it? No. But let me tell you the other intel I've got.
[21:36.000 --> 21:42.000]  Oh, I've got the intel. And it's it's not really about Alex Jones.
[21:42.000 --> 21:51.000]  It's about understanding how Hollywood and the scum work and how they steal people's identities, how they lie about people, how they destroy history.
[21:51.000 --> 21:56.000]  And so I've been let in on how these guys work years ago. And I was told about this long term project they're doing.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  I don't think the people even involved in the project.
[22:00.000 --> 22:08.000]  Leonardo DiCaprio's group and the other little creatures even understand the long term plan,
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  but they plan to have me dead in prison, in prison or dead or both long before they roll out their whole fake narrative on me.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  But I'm going to make sure long before that happens, that we stop their whole operation with your help.
[22:21.000 --> 22:27.000]  And if they even win this round of the war, you'll know the truth and you'll know what really happened with all this.
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  But yes, they have appointed my destruction, my imprisonment and my death in jail.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  And then they can roll out their movies all about me.
[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  And because they want to target populace, they want to target you. They don't want Alex Jones to be a folk hero when they kill me.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  They wanted to be a horrible demon bully. And that's why all the scripting is to do that.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  But again, we know from the people in the damn meetings.
[22:54.000 --> 23:00.000]  And so I see how it works. You're not the only people in the world that have access to information.
[23:00.000 --> 23:08.000]  You scum. You damn scum. I am not the Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan Belfort.
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  I'm not saying he's bad compared to the globalist. And I'm sure as hell not.
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.000]  You know, Leonardo DiCaprio, that movie he made where it's the con artist that pretended to be an airline pilot, all that crap.
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.000]  I'm a good person. And the stuff they're putting in these movie scripts is lies. And it's not true.
[23:23.000 --> 23:31.000]  And I'm sure whatever happens to me, I will be avenged politically in a legal, lawful way, whatever happens.
[23:31.000 --> 23:39.000]  But they've got my destruction, my death, all appointed, all prepared. I don't think the Hollywood folks even know that.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  But see, they're collapsing. They're over. They're gone.
[23:44.000 --> 23:54.000]  And that's why they want to target what they believe destroyed them and steal its identity and lie about it and turn an archetype for the people like yours truly.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  Because I am an archetype. You are the archetype. All of us together. This is just a focal point.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  Alex Jones is much bigger than little Alex Jones. But the big Alex Jones is all of us together.
[24:02.000 --> 24:12.000]  The common man with the ingenuity, the smarts, the long term understanding to be able to take on real evil and have a focus and a belief in humanity and then to overcome it as we've done before.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  They need to destroy that image and turn that into something bad.
[24:15.000 --> 24:32.000]  And that's why they need to steal info wars and shut us down and then silence us so they can lie about us once we're silenced and steal our identity and use that identity as a weapon against the people.
[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  But cue this up, because, you know, it was the great Harrison Smith put this together like three years ago.
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.000]  And it was titled Why They Silenced Alex Jones. We're going to play that and come back and hit the big military news and start going over all of it here.
[24:46.000 --> 24:56.000]  But I'm just venting here the first 10, 15 minutes. And some people watch this and they say, wait, Jones says he's captured by the enemy and now being used against the people.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  Is he saying he's got a gun to his head? Is he saying he's he's been compromised?
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.000]  No, that's not what I'm saying in that rant I did three years ago that he turned into a very important report.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  Why they silenced Alex Jones or why they took Alex Jones off the air? I forget the exact name of it. Haven't heard in a while.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  Tell me when you got it, guys.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  It's on Bandau video. OK.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  What I was explaining is, is that by shutting me down off all these platforms, Twitter, Facebook, everything, I can't respond to lies.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  You can't respond. To the lies about you as well when you're taken off there.
[25:34.000 --> 25:44.000]  And then they can say whatever they want about you and they steal your identity and then turn you into something you're not and use you against the people.
[25:44.000 --> 25:58.000]  And that's what's so evil about censorship. It's not just that it silences you about bad drugs the government sold or chemicals in the water or brainwashing of your children or devaluation of currency or, you know, major screw jobs.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that's not the issue.
[26:04.000 --> 26:12.000]  It's that they can then sock puppet and misrepresent who you are, just like the Canadian media.
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.000]  Would not ever show the peaceful truckers and the families and all the multiracial groups out there not wanting medical tyranny against them.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  They would just say they're white supremacist, they're racist, they're misogynist, they're all these things.
[26:24.000 --> 26:33.000]  And because the people didn't have a voice on the main corporate media, a lot of folks actually believe that about them because they're still in the trance.
[26:33.000 --> 26:42.000]  But if you can get people outside of the trance and ever see how they're being scammed, ever see how they're being lied to, well, then it's game over.
[26:42.000 --> 26:57.000]  So I'm going to take a break. And when I come back, I'm going to get to all the different important things that I was talking about with the war and all those issues that are unfolding.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  You guys were going to give me an expanded list. Can I have that? Fantastic.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  Can I just have the longer list, though? Because I know I sent you guys.
[27:07.000 --> 27:15.000]  I know I sent you guys. I know. Is my mic on? Because when you talk to me, I can't hear myself anymore.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  No, no, we're not going to go down. We're just going to stop for a while here.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  Because I don't care. It's just the new system. When you talk to me, I can't hear myself.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  It cuts my mic off. So I just want to know while we're on air, when you talk to me, does that cut my mind?
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  Fantastic. That's what I want to know. Thank you so much. I like it. It's a lot clearer system now when you guys talk to me than it was before.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  Here's the thing. This is commercial free radio and TV, so we can just talk and have fun.
[27:40.000 --> 27:49.000]  That's why when I built all these studios, I put microphones actually in the studios for the crew if they ever wanted to be on air.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  But we don't really use those. So we've got that information for you.
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  But what happened is I got up here a little late today, so I never had time to go over the list.
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  I sent the list to them. We're talking 30, 40 videos. I haven't gotten the other half the list.
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  So that's why part of the roadmap of what I wanted to cover here today.
[28:07.000 --> 28:17.000]  There you go. Let's get to see the studio. Look how cool that looks. Look at all those folks in there researching and getting all the information together in live time and, you know, covering it and going over all of it.
[28:17.000 --> 28:26.000]  And that's what the system's scared of is an independent people's media that gives you transparency into what we are actually doing.
[28:26.000 --> 28:40.000]  Taking you behind the curtain. And one of the plans I've got once we launch these new shows soon is we're going to put a camera even behind the scenes in here before I do the official show.
[28:40.000 --> 28:49.000]  And I think I'm going to stick a camera in my office, too. I think that's really the next level for everybody, because I was thinking about I have nothing to hide.
[28:49.000 --> 28:56.000]  I have nothing secretive other than if I'm doing sources or that type of stuff. And I mainly do that at my house or on the phone or whatever.
[28:56.000 --> 29:04.000]  But that's something we've been talking about, too, is literally giving people a real behind the scenes view on all of this.
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.000]  But like I said, I'm going to go to this special report that's from three plus years ago.
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  And when I come back, I'm going to have the video list. I'm going to be ready to go over all of this for you here today.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  I appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday. Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that things like that.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  Gregory's report that you just saw is so damn powerful and people are just now realizing that's going on and just now waking up.
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  And I just want to thank you all for sharing the videos for my future and your future and all of our children's future together,
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  because we're giving the globalists one hell of a run for their money and they're really starting to buckle.
[29:37.000 --> 29:44.000]  They're really starting to fail. And people know that long term listeners, when stuff's negative and we're behind, I'll tell you right now, we're out ahead of them.
[29:44.000 --> 29:49.000]  And that kind of concerns me because they're going to pull some rabbits out of that filthy hat they got.
[29:49.000 --> 29:54.000]  They're going to pull some cyber attacks, some wars, some mass shootings, you know, some false flags.
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.000]  But we're not supposed to talk about false flags or potential false flags or ask if something's a false flag.
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  We're just supposed to accept all their evil and roll over to die.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  But you see, we're not rolling over and dying. Ladies and gentlemen, we're not.
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  So here's that important report, because, again, if they can steal my identity, that means take us off air,
[30:13.000 --> 30:19.000]  put me in jail so they can then put out all these movies and TV shows they've got in production about us.
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.000]  They will see that as a victory to kill populism and kill you, kill your freedom.
[30:23.000 --> 30:31.000]  But if you see through it, you understand it. And if we're all Spartacus, if we're all Alex Jones, then we have a real shot at beating these people.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  Here it is.
[30:33.000 --> 30:39.000]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, U.S. resistance against a global corporate combine
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood. The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.000]  Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  They've officially become state-run. Apple, 100 percent.
[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[31:13.000 --> 31:19.000]  This is happening. This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[31:23.000 --> 31:29.000]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[31:29.000 --> 31:38.000]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[31:45.000 --> 31:55.000]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  Total internet of things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[32:00.000 --> 32:08.000]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies,
[32:08.000 --> 32:16.000]  blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai comm slash big tech begging combine emergency situation.
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[32:23.000 --> 32:32.000]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[32:42.000 --> 32:50.000]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[32:50.000 --> 32:57.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[32:57.000 --> 33:03.000]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[33:03.000 --> 33:08.000]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[33:08.000 --> 33:10.000]  I have given you the transmission.
[33:10.000 --> 33:15.000]  Now break free.
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God,
[33:18.000 --> 33:24.000]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[33:27.000 --> 33:38.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  And now, my friends.
[33:43.000 --> 34:00.000]  And now, my friends, let's dive into the current crisis happening in Eastern Europe between NATO and Russia.
[34:00.000 --> 34:22.000]  That is the hyper sonic up to nine.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  Mocks nine times the speed of sound.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  And of course, the media is claiming, oh, my God, Russia and China have missiles the U.S. doesn't have.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  Now, the United States had these missiles in the 70s.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  The Russians had them in the 90s.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  The point is, they're being deployed.
[34:39.000 --> 34:46.000]  And when they fly at 200 feet above the ground, you cannot stop them.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  So that again, you can't stop anybody's missiles.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  They can't stop ours.
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  We can't stop theirs.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  They've got nuclear weapons on them.
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.000]  And from 500 miles away in front of the whole world today, Russia blew up a bunch of small buildings with them.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  They weren't carrying the nuclear warheads, the hydrogen bombs, but from the ocean.
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.000]  They were blowing up targets on land to tell the world, leave us alone.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  So here's the bottom line.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  Here's what's really going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  You can pick a side in this.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  You can pick the Russian side, you can pick the Western side that's totally run by the globalist,
[35:30.000 --> 35:40.000]  or you can pull above all it and see how it's being manipulated by the deep state, by the globalist, by chaos, by specter.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  That's not just a character or a group in James Bond.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  That's real.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  Again, I'm not going to go over the whole background of it.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  Call it Hydra.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  That's what it's usually described as during World War Two.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  Call it.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  Specter.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  Which, you know, get smart.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  It's chaos.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  Little comedy shows on TV.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  But this isn't a game.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  And these are very evil forces that are playing everybody off against each other for power and control.
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  And the minute you realize why every James Bond movie there's a secret corporation trying to take over the world,
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  that's because that's the Bilderberg Group.
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.000]  And before it existed in 1954, under that name in the meeting they had in Oosterbeck, Holland,
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.000]  and there was the manager of the whole thing, the young OSS officer, Henry Kissinger.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  And as all the other old spy chiefs died, in the next 30 years, he became the main spymaster of this system.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  And the spymasters of the Western governments decided to take over their governments.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  And they did.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  And that's the new world order.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  But systems like that existed before.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  It's called elite capture.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  That's what the Chinese have done.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  They buy off and infiltrate your elite.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  Your corporate elite.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  Your academic elite.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  Your governmental elite.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  Your military elite.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  Your ecclesiastical elite.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  And if you go back, Rome would do this thousands of years ago.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Then the Roman church would do it.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  Then the British Empire did it bigger and better than anybody.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  And after Bretton Woods, the United States of America officially became the steward of the British Empire,
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  and the Cecil Rhodes world domination plan.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  And everything you see today is a struggle between that global corporate combine,
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  with its horrible, evil ideology of anti-God, anti-West, anti-Christian.
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.000]  Do you see the elites that run our countries in the West empowering our values?
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  No.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  You see them waging war on it because they are more at war with America than they are with Russia.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  And they thought they had China under their full control, and China is fantastically evil.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  Their leadership is fantastically Godless and incredibly bad.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  I'm not endorsing them, but the new world order is worse than Xi Jinping.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  Xi Jinping is like Elon Musk.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  He says we need to have three, four kids or society will collapse.
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.000]  The entire EU leadership are a bunch of damn devil-worshipping pedophiles,
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  who openly say end humans as we know it and merge with machines.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  These people signed on to something very satanic.
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  So, now tell me about Russia and Ukraine.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  I mean, do people know about the borders over there?
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  Do they know about the historic background?
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  Do you think the average American knows that?
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  No, they don't.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  Do you think the average Ukrainian even knows that?
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  No, they don't.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  The average Russian does, and that's why they're strong.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  Because if you don't know where you came from and you don't know who you are,
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  you don't have any power.
[39:06.000 --> 39:13.000]  Because power comes from knowing where you came from, your ethos, who you are, what your mission is.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  And if you don't have any mission, you don't have any power.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  The globalists have their mission of power and control and dominance
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  and scientifically taking control of all human development,
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  which is the final revolution, the final military takeover of men and women together creating new humans
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  and our very institution of our species, the conquering of our species itself.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  That is the logical endgame of a sociopathic group that wants to play God.
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.000]  And they've made the human system as dumb and decadent and mindless and ugly as it is so it falls apart,
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  and now they're locking it down worldwide to make it collapse further,
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  so on the ashes of it, they can extract our minds, extract our energy, extract our creativity,
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  and build their escape system, in their own words.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  At the core of liberalism is the spoiled child, miserable, as all spoiled children are,
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  unsatisfied, demanding, ill-disciplined, despotic, and useless.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats, P.J. O'Rourke, well said.
[40:22.000 --> 40:29.000]  And you know, I was thinking about Prince Andrew being defrocked of his medals and his royal titles
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  and His Royal Highness BS, and I was like, you know, I remember something about him today.
[40:34.000 --> 40:44.000]  I said, let me look up Prince Andrew, you know, Jeffrey Epstein's buddy boy, and stuffed animals.
[40:47.000 --> 40:55.000]  And sure enough, he admits he sleeps with 69 or 72, it's different articles, teddy bears at night,
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  and they must all be arranged around him perfectly or he can't sleep.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  That's the type of people we're up against, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:02.000 --> 41:10.000]  Full grown men who are pedophiles, who obviously got tortured when he was a kid,
[41:10.000 --> 41:19.000]  and has a giant teddy bear collection, an inbred, sniveling, insane person.
[41:19.000 --> 41:27.000]  And I'm not saying adults are bad if, you know, I got stuffed animals in my office that belonged to my daughters when they were little.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  And they had a little favorite thing or they gave me a little toy or something.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  You know, I've got a couple of, not stuffed animals, little toys and stuff in my office,
[41:36.000 --> 41:42.000]  a little Lego thing my middle daughter made and gave to me for Christmas.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  But with him, he literally screams and yells and throws fits.
[41:46.000 --> 41:52.000]  When he travels around the world, he has to have servants with him, butlers that bring chest full of teddy bears.
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  Now there it is, Prince Charles would scream if his stuffed toys were misplaced.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  Really, we can't beat these people?
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  Because he wears admiral outfits, we have to kiss his ass.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  What do you think Klaus Schwab goes and wears?
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  Klingon outfits.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  Because they really believe they're superheroes and that you're an animal and they're better than you.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  And you know what? You keep kissing their ass, so maybe they're right.
[42:23.000 --> 42:30.000]  But here's the deal. I'm not rolling over and crawling to some grave for some dude that sleeps with 70 teddy bears.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  You want me to die? You want me to die Klaus Schwab? You want me to get off the planet so you can have it?
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  I got a better idea.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  You will die.
[42:45.000 --> 42:52.000]  And I'm not going to kill you. But I'm just saying, you got this psycho move, you and Ghislaine Maxwell and all you people,
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  you think we're just here to bend over to you and your sick brother who's about to be the king of England
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  and that damn Jimmy Savelle, where they were killing kids, not just raping them.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Look it up, folks. I don't risk my life to play games here.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  I know full well these people kill people all day.
[43:09.000 --> 43:17.000]  Well, then get it on there, son, because I'm not scared of you and I'm not backing down and I'm going to defeat you with God's help in the end.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  So you want to get back to Russia and nuclear war now?
[43:24.000 --> 43:34.000]  A dude that travels with 70 teddy bears with his brother that's way worse than him, Prince Charles.
[43:34.000 --> 43:44.000]  The Prince of Wales, they're not even, they don't have one drop of English blood or Scottish blood or Irish blood.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  They're a disgusting joke.
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.000]  These people aren't even Western Europeans.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  Sorry, I'm just going off the rails here.
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  It's disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.000]  And they think that you are their slaves. They think you're idiots.
[44:05.000 --> 44:14.000]  And they had cousins, the czars, that ran Russia until 1917, but because the czars wouldn't go along with what they wanted,
[44:15.000 --> 44:23.000]  they went in and killed them and put communists in charge and you know the rest of what Russia went through for 80 plus years.
[44:28.000 --> 44:33.000]  But we're going to be here all day during this live emergency transmission if I don't start drilling down into all of it.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  I'm just giving you some of the background. You can look all this up. It's all there. It's all real.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  No matter how insane it sounds, it's not even debated.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  It's a lot whiter than what I just told you.
[44:44.000 --> 44:51.000]  But they are obsessed with defiling your genetics because you were made by God.
[44:51.000 --> 44:58.000]  They want to vandalize you. They want to mark you with their deadly shot that is self-replicating nanotech.
[44:59.000 --> 45:08.000]  They've already done studies on animals and humans and that they are now implanting the general public with a wireless tracking system that is nanotech readable chips.
[45:09.000 --> 45:17.000]  Not the 1960s little grain of rice chip, but obviously the entire concoction is a self-replicating nanotech in your body.
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  They don't admit it. You know, two years ago we said that's probably the plan.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  Now it's admitted in major journals. I have articles today. We'll be getting to.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  But let's get back to the current situation in Russia.
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  Russia is fabulously corrupt, has incredible entrenched elites, big problems.
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  But it's been going through a Christian renaissance and reforming itself and being pro-family and a lot of things to make the globalists mad.
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  And it's not run by the New World Order completely. It's kind of like the Midwest or something.
[45:51.000 --> 46:01.000]  There's big globalist influences and big globalist groups and a lot of double agents, but it's not completely in the grip say like Los Angeles or New York of the New World Order.
[46:02.000 --> 46:13.000]  It's kind of like Omaha, Nebraska or something. It's got problems, but it's been kind of overlooked. The New World Order hasn't gotten full control.
[46:13.000 --> 46:30.000]  It's like San Antonio, Texas. There's globalists, there's New World Order, there's minions, but there's still people that aren't completely sold out against humanity.
[46:30.000 --> 46:59.000]  And so it's clear eight years ago, a proxy war starts in Russia and Soros goes in and brags, he said it on TV, on CNN with Fareed Zarkaria, that he got $5 billion from Obama and that they overthrew Ukraine and that the Russians then wouldn't let them have a very small area of southern Ukraine and an area of eastern Ukraine that are almost 100% Russian.
[47:00.000 --> 47:13.000]  And that have Russian pipelines and gas systems in them. And I said last week, I said, this is the West moving in more weapons, more troops, they admit, and accelerating attacks on those Russian held areas.
[47:14.000 --> 47:23.000]  And when the Russians push back in any way, it's going to be called a war. And then when the Russians get attacked by artillery and by missiles and weapons.
[47:24.000 --> 47:37.000]  And when there's attempted assassinations of their leaders there in the breakaway areas, they will then claim Russia has staged attacks against itself.
[47:38.000 --> 47:47.000]  Now, obviously you think Russia is perfect. You don't think Putin hadn't staged false flags. You don't think they haven't done that before. Yeah, big governments, they do it. It's a tool people use. It's usually how war start.
[47:47.000 --> 47:55.000]  World War II started with Hitler doing it and Operation Himmler at Gleiwitz. Look it up for yourself. It's declassified. It's public. Nuremberg trials came out.
[47:57.000 --> 48:05.000]  But does Russia even want Ukraine? No, they want their pipelines coming out of the East into Europe, Western Europe.
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.000]  But the West, the globalists are trying to cut those pipelines off just like they've cut off our pipelines. We got the same enemies, folks.
[48:13.000 --> 48:22.000]  So Russia doesn't want to run Ukraine. Russia doesn't. It can already buy all the goods out of it. It can already do business with it. It just wants its gas pipelines it paid for going through there.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  And the New World Order doesn't want that. And so they've been pumping in $5 billion of weapons. They've been attacking it.
[48:32.000 --> 48:44.000]  And the Russians have pulled back wisely, and the Russians have wisely not taken the bait, and are letting them basically ethnically cleanse the men in those eastern areas.
[48:45.000 --> 48:57.000]  And if that won't get Putin to move, well then they're going to attack that area with the Russians only port there on the Black Sea in the south of Ukraine.
[48:58.000 --> 49:15.000]  Crimea. Crimea. So that's where this is, ladies and gentlemen. So I'm not like a guy watching a football game, and I'm for the Steelers, or I'm for the Rams, or I'm for the Bengals, or I'm for the Cardinals.
[49:15.000 --> 49:32.000]  Cardinals. I'm looking at how this really works and what's really going on. And the same globalist interests that don't want peace, and don't want expansion, and don't want Russia's main mission now is exporting fuel and energy and, quote, organic food.
[49:33.000 --> 49:41.000]  And Russia's inviting Europeans and others that want to live in peace to come to Russia and have children, because they've got plenty of land.
[49:42.000 --> 49:50.000]  It's like becoming potentially the new America, like America was 300, 400, 500 years ago.
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  So I've always said if there was some new free country, I'd go there. Well, America is the freest and best. I'm going to stay here and fight for it.
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.000]  And you notice, while everybody else is under restrictions, everybody else is doing forced inoculations, where are they not doing it in Russia and the United States?
[50:08.000 --> 50:23.000]  You couldn't say that about Russia 30 years ago, 20 years ago, but you can now. Russia's not perfect, but they're moving on their clock away from tyranny while the rest of the world's moving towards tyranny.
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  So is Russia a strongman situation? And is it a kind of place that's autocratic? Yeah.
[50:32.000 --> 50:49.000]  And is that a model for us? No. But I can tell you this, Russia has the same enemies that we have, and war with Russia is what people like Klaus Schwab and others want.
[50:50.000 --> 51:01.000]  Oh, the big corporatists at the New World Order act like they're pro-China, pro-Russia, they're not. They act friendly on the surface, but behind the scenes, they want war.
[51:02.000 --> 51:12.000]  While they sell out America at the same time, they are selling out all those other interests, because there's no honor amongst thieves.
[51:13.000 --> 51:21.000]  So let me move through this first group of stories, and I'll move into all the others here. Here it is. I shouldn't have to go to an old history lesson. I know listeners and viewers get all this.
[51:22.000 --> 51:34.000]  It's just that the West is moving weapons in, the West is starting a war, the West is doing all this to, again, destabilize the planet and destroy markets and to make sure energy prices go up,
[51:34.000 --> 51:46.000]  because the private central banks have unlimited currency that they want to loan everybody and bankrupt everybody with, ahead of the global financial collapse they're orchestrating to bring in their new global digital currency.
[51:46.000 --> 52:05.000]  And we need to say no to the Davos Group and no to the UN controllers and no to the big corporations that are absolute devils compared to Midwestern Americans or Christians and conservatives of every race, color, and creed across this country.
[52:06.000 --> 52:13.000]  I mean, our only problem is we're just good, decent, hardworking people like our parents and grandparents, and we can't even imagine people operate and act like this.
[52:16.000 --> 52:29.000]  But that's how things are operating, and that's how things are going all over the world right now, and it is just a nightmare. So here it is. Biden is convinced Putin has decided to invade Ukraine.
[52:30.000 --> 52:40.000]  He just keeps saying that every day, said it yesterday, said it today. Ukraine's Zelensky, that's their president, calls on Putin to meet as tensions soar. That's a good idea.
[52:40.000 --> 52:56.000]  And what did he say again, and what did their defense ministers say? They said it's not true. Yes, there's escalated conflict in the east, but Russia isn't invading. Huge explosion reported, possibly linked to gas pipeline, which is the Russian gas pipeline.
[52:57.000 --> 53:05.000]  Do they blow up their own pipeline? Who knows? I mean, false flags are done. But we're not supposed to talk about false flags, our media told us, because they don't exist.
[53:05.000 --> 53:15.000]  Only when they tell us they exist, we're supposed to flip our brains on them and say they do. NATO raises readiness level for tens of thousands of troops.
[53:16.000 --> 53:28.000]  Seventy plus thousand children and others evacuated out of eastern Ukraine. Then you got articles like this from town hall, if Russia invades, they reportedly have kill lists ready for a variety of dissidents.
[53:28.000 --> 53:40.000]  Meanwhile, they've just blown up cars and a bunch of other stuff, and reportedly, if you believe it's not a false flag, tried to kill the separatist leaders in those two breakaway areas.
[53:41.000 --> 53:49.000]  And then, of course, we started with this information. Putin warns West with launch of nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles.
[53:49.000 --> 53:58.000]  And then, of course, our media always lies so they can get a bigger defense budget to make it sound like, you know, that America's in all this trouble.
[53:59.000 --> 54:10.000]  We're in trouble with open borders. We're in trouble with the devalued dollar. But the United States military has underground bunkers and just huge bases of munitions full of these missiles since the 70s.
[54:11.000 --> 54:18.000]  They were testing the damn things in the 60s. They were deployed in the 70s. But the media tells you only Russia and China have hypersonic missiles.
[54:21.000 --> 54:29.000]  Putin warns West with launch of nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles that goes Mach 9. Now, granted, the stuff we had in the 70s only did like Mach 6.
[54:30.000 --> 54:37.000]  But now God knows what we've got. It's unbelievable. U.S. Senator says a nuclear first strike on Russia should remain an option.
[54:37.000 --> 54:47.000]  Senator Wicker, don't rule out attacking Russia with nukes first and ground troops. Yes, wonderful, wonderful idea.
[54:48.000 --> 55:00.000]  And let me just show you some of the hypersonic weapons that alter the global strategic balance. Here's some of the ones that the U.S. admittedly has.
[55:00.000 --> 55:22.000]  The group running the United States, using our taxpayer money and ingenuity, for at least 30 years has large space planes that drop DU Shabo rounds at 30,000 miles an hour out of orbit and are infinitely more destructive than anything Vladimir Putin's folks ever fielded.
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  And by the way, I'm not happy about that, because that actually encourages the globals to go out and try to decapitate everybody. That's what they call that.
[55:30.000 --> 55:37.000]  There's a whole list here of different countries and different weapons. The Chinese have their hypersonic missiles. The Russians have got theirs right there.
[55:38.000 --> 55:52.000]  But the stuff the United States admits it has is 1980 stuff. Well, you see that big space plane? That flies around and can orbit the Earth in a matter of half an hour or less.
[55:52.000 --> 56:08.000]  And it's only, from what I've talked to some folks about, that was some older technology, was that 100-pound DU Sabos, meteor gun technology, dropped from orbit, can carry hundreds of those and kill hundreds of elite command groups.
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.000]  These things could decapitate world leadership just a couple of these planes in a matter of hours, because they've got to retract where they are while they're in orbit.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  They've got to change orbit. They've got to get in place. But all those deep bunkers?
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  See, it's not a hydrogen bomb or an atomic bomb. Let's say you've got a mountain and it's got a base under it.
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.000]  And you know why — there's sea level right here — you know why they always put bases under mountains, right?
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  You know once you get a mile or two underground, the temperature goes up to 150 degrees or more.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  And it's true, you keep digging, you hit lava, thousands of degrees.
[56:46.000 --> 56:57.000]  Okay? So, you'll have a road coming in and you'll go into a mountain and then it'll go down into a mountain.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  Then you're at like 67 degrees, and then you can have all your nukes and all your weapons and stuff in there.
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  You've got to have some snorkels up at the top. A lot of these have other ways to get oxygen in.
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.000]  But the reason I show you that is, let's say you've got two miles of rock here.
[57:18.000 --> 57:27.000]  You fire a meteor gun with a 100-pound DU Sabo, rocket-controlled, it's going 30,000 miles an hour when it hits.
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.000]  It goes in about a mile, and there's so much kinetic energy that the whole side of the mountain collapses with everybody in it.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  So that's what the U.S.A. has.
[57:39.000 --> 57:45.000]  In orbit, by 1979, at least five have craft. It's got super classified information right there.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  But they leaked it on accident, so I can tell you that on C-SPAN.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  Because the globalists are so stupid, they can't keep their damn mouths shut.
[57:59.000 --> 58:06.000]  So the Russians have fielded some similar systems, and the point is, is you can't win a war like this.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  Okay, so they don't have stuff as advanced as the United States. Why would we want to kill them and do all this?
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  Plus, there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reactors that are nuclear around the world.
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  You have a nuclear war, those are going to melt down, and now it makes Chernobyl look like a walk in the park.
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  So it's untenable, it's not survivable, stop it.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  It's like, I've got a .357 Magnum, and I'm aimed at you, and you've got a .50 caliber.
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  But we both pull the trigger at the same time, you're going to die, I'm going to die.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  I'm just going to have a bigger, that's a great graphic you just put up, I'm just going to have a bigger hole in me.
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  Yes, the Russians will have a bigger hole in them.
[58:46.000 --> 59:04.000]  Because again, I mean the Air Force leaked in 2002 that they isolated at the main nuke lab out in New Mexico.
[59:04.000 --> 59:20.000]  Any matter? And they're not testing it, but they went to NASA and tried to get an authorization to send a space probe out millions of miles from Earth and then detonate it there.
[59:21.000 --> 59:32.000]  But their equations were all hypothetical, so they weren't sure whether or not, because they used these big complex fancy machines they've got that can create new elements, to actually build the new DU.
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.000]  I mean the new antimatter.
[59:36.000 --> 59:44.000]  And even the manufacture of it, they thought might actually trigger it, but they still did it.
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  So we're worried about the Russians, we're probably going to get blown up any minute.
[59:49.000 --> 59:54.000]  I mean, animal, human, clones, super viruses being made in labs, these mad scientists can't stop it.
[59:55.000 --> 59:59.000]  They're completely out of control, they're completely nuts, wanting to become gods.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  And whether Atlantis existed or not, they're about to blow all of us up right along with them.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  So we've got all this.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  And I mentioned this.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Ukraine defense minister refutes Biden, says low probability of major conflict with Russia, so does the president.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  But you know, if you run articles like that from zero hedge, every major news channel says you're a Russian agent because you actually run what the Ukrainians are saying and link to it.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Because you're not supposed to hear that.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  See, I'm an agent of not wanting to die. I'm an agent of wanting a future.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  I'm an agent of wanting our children to live together and have a great chance.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  But that's being a Russian agent.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  But Bill Maher is starting to get it. Bill Maher torches LeBron James, John Cena and others for kowtowing to China.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Let me do this. I've talked an hour or we heard an intro. I've talked about 50 minutes.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  And I'm going to be a good boy now. I'm going to set this stack of World War Three Russian news aside, and then I'm going to tell you the rest of the story as best I can.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  I'm very honored to be here. This infrastructure was not supposed to be built. People were not supposed to be awake. We were not supposed to be able to come together.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  But good people around the world are now awake and understand the stakes.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  And we've got a damn good chance of stopping these people if we just continue to be vocal and to point out what they're really doing.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Because then other people will see what's happening in their area and they will speak out and they will whistle blow and they will say no and they will offer alternatives.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  And by all of us good people who care about the future and aren't psychotic pedophiles doing the right thing and not just turn the world over to evil, we will be able to turn things around in a big, big way.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  But in closing, what's happening on the border of Russia? It's simple. You send in weapons. You send in dribs. You start a fight. You start pushing on ethnic Russians, hoping Putin responds so they can do God knows what.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  And then Biden saying over and over again, showing it's not just him and dementia. He's been told to say it. Well, I'll let Putin take part of Ukraine. I don't believe that.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  I think they're trying to get Putin to go into Ukraine so they can launch an even bigger war. And so I've never felt like all of us are in more danger than we are now.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  And I think you all feel that in your gut and your spirit, your subconscious as well right now.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  OK.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Let's do this.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Let's do this.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  Let's go to break for a couple of minutes, air promo, whatever.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And I am then going to come back and I'm going to judiciously because I only said I'm doing two hours today because the crew is great and you're great.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  And I'm sure if I can't say it all in two hours, I shouldn't say it. I think we've said a lot of good stuff. I've been a bit long winded in my view.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  But when we come back, I'm going to try to be focused like a laser beam.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  On.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  The thirty six clips I have and all of the incredible news and information that we're about to break down.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Jeffrey Epstein's right hand man, dead neck broken jail cell.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  Bill Gates, unbelievable COVID-19 news. The latest developments unfolding with the riot police, tear gas, batons, horses running people over.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  That was it's ongoing right now. Just an orgy of evil, all run by Klaus Schwab.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And then the incredible footage.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Or you're not even allowed to talk about it in parliament now.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Yeah, martial law on the street, martial law in the parliament now. This even stuns me.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  I mean, they are moving so damn quick. What do they know is about to happen?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Total financial collapse worldwide. They already engineered it. They already slit the fuse.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  So they lit the fuse, but now they're not in control.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  And so it's about to go boom.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  I can just tell you this. Oh, there's also some other incredible news.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  All these big trucker convoys and others that weren't going to go all over Canada are now pissed.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And they're now all over the country flooding towards Ottawa.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  And so the police running that woman over with the horse and then pepper spraying and like grabbing a guy that doesn't resist and then huge cops in military outfits.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  Like six foot eight dudes, like literally like some little guy that looks his half as tall as him.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  They're kneeing him in the chest and stomping and hitting him in the head.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  People in America don't like that. People in Canada don't like that.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  And so I'm telling you, Trudeau and Klaus Schwab are playing with fire.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Schwab intends to blow everything up. Schwab intends to cause big crises. Schwab intends to cause big problems.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  But he doesn't want to get the blame. If he knows, we know he's behind it, they've got to stop.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  But if he can just have a civil war and he doesn't get any blame for it, well, they're going to do it.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  And that's why when Parliament brings it up now, they cut the feeds and admit it.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  Unbelievable. And that's their Achilles heel.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  That's smog missing the scales on his belly where the black arrow's got to go of truth.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  But you've got to be able to climb up on top of a citadel and the dragon's attacking.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  You've got to be strong. It's coming in with a fire, shooting right at you.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  And you've got to fire the black arrow politically right into its heart.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  And that's where we are right now. The dragon is burning down, trying to start nuclear war.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  We've got to realize we don't stop it. It's going to burn everything down. There's nowhere to run.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  So they've got a bunch of promos and a bunch of stuff. I'm going to take a break. I'm going to reset.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  And I'm going to come in here with about 50 minutes of live, uncensored transmission straight ahead.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  Have you shared the live link? Have you shared the articles? Have you? Because you are the power. You are the resistance.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  It's like I'm paralyzed, the neck down. But when you take action, we have victory.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  You are everything in this resistance. We'll be right back.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  then the information you find could be life changing.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  He predicted 9-11.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  And if there was an outside threat like bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in the Sorwellian phony system.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalist prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group at all.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  And most of you are about to stink in paradise.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  They falsely edited him.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  This is America in 2018.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Will you do nothing?
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.440]  The
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silence. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  They're banning people. They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Spreading articles, spreading videos, spreading links. You're going to get demonized. You're going to get attacked.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected. That's really what all this is about.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  They said that they deem our content and our brand unthinkable.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  It's the right to be, do, and say whatever you want. It's about freedom of expression.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  I'm a journalist. I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  They can say whatever they think and I respect their constitutional right to do it. I hope they respect my constitutional right to do it.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Here we are, 3 10, 3 11 now, Central Standard Time, February 19th, 2022. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  Let's talk about what's happening in Canada.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  When Black Lives Matter, funded by George Soros and the globalists, almost all white people,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  went around murdering, killing, and burning down 2 plus billion dollars worth of people's homes, including homeless shelters,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  it was wonderful, it was mostly peaceful, it was the best thing.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  And Trudeau endorsed it and said it was wonderful.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  And when leftists took over areas and set up their own autonomous zones in Canada and the US, he endorsed it.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  But when peaceful truckers came for 3 weeks and took over the downtown area, the capital of Canada, Ottawa,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  he called them terrorists, he called them racists, you know what he did.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And now, starting 2 days ago, he sent in thousands of paramilitary police to target members of the press
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  and to target other peaceful individuals and take them to jail.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  I think Tucker Carlson, last night, had the best monologue on the whole thing.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  We're going to play just a couple minutes of what he said last night here in just a moment,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  but this is staggering stuff.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  But then you go to New Zealand, and Australia, and Austria, and Germany,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  and they are billy clubbing women and men in the heads.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  They are using microwave cannons and sound cannons to physically attack people.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  And it's just so criminal.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  And it's all the DABOS group, alumni, admitting, build back better, great reset, we're doing this for Klaus Schwab.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  And then when the parliament that's been suspended demands, well, we should still be able to teleconference in and give speeches.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  But now it's only the speaker of the commons there, the speaker of the parliament.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And, oh, you talked about Klaus Schwab, oh, I can't hear your feed.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Oh, someone wants to comment? Oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  I mean, a dude on a throne literally not letting you say it's Klaus Schwab.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Why is that? What have I been saying for 2 years?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  You expose who runs this, the corporate globalist attack, and that it's above nation states and that it's their program to collapse society
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  and then bring in a global social credit score and a universal basic income tied to the vaccine passport, which they announced again last week.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  And then they conquer the world. It's a corporate takeover.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  So what can they not handle, that being exposed?
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  And then he suspends the parliament.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  But like the left always does, they give you a little out.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Oh, you can call in on their Canadian C-SPAN.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  We'll still have the manager. He'll still be there.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Oh, you called in?
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  You're a member of parliament? Oh, no, no, no.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Klaus Schwab's not involved in anything.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  You're not allowed. So see, oh, it's just like COVID, but now it's a martial law.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  No one's allowed in the parliament but the Zoom operators.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  And a few leftists that can jump on the mic when they don't like what you said.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  See how not being physically there is so powerful?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  See how now most of the courts, even murder trials, are being done over the internet?
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Who knows if you're even actually talking to the person?
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  It could be some internet creation.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Like Mad Dog Ben Richards in 1986 and the Running Man,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  committing all those heinous crimes, but it was all CG.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  What's the term they use for all the fake CG stuff?
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Deep fake.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  Well, we don't need to know about deep fakes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  We've got them in front of us.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  Hey, Klaus Schwab brags he runs Trudeau and has captured our parliament.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I'd like to know who he's captured. Well, you can look the names up.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  He's got people on his board of directors of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Its job, they say, is to capture countries for the greater good
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  and to remove the general public from the decision making process.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  That's a quote.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  And what happens once the parliament knows about that?
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  What happens once they go to his Wikipedia and see links to videos of him saying
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  it's game over?
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  You piece of filth.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  It's a family show, but I'm just going to say it.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  It's game over, motherfucker.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  You goddamn piece of shit.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  You New World Order piece of trash.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  You eugenicist garbage.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Excuse me.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  Excuse me for taking the Lord's name in vain.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  I apologize, but God forgives me.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  These people are damned to hell though.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  I'm not damning him to hell.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  I'm saying they're enemies of humanity
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  and they just think they're so arrogant that he hikes his leg
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  and pisses on us and brags how we're stupid
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  and how he's taking our bodies over
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  and how it's a post-industrial world
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  and you'll have nothing and you'll own nothing
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  and you'll like it and we run your government
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  and you don't have a say anymore.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  You know what?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  If I'm that pathetic that you can beat me,
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  then I deserve Schwab for you to beat me,
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  but you're not going to beat me or my family or humanity.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  You ran the lockdowns.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  You ran the virus release.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  You and Bill Gates.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  You killed all those people by cutting off the food around the world.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  You are a mass murderer and you will be held accountable
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  one way or another.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  He thinks all the corporate media in Hollywood can prop him up.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  He still thought I had enough power to make his run at us
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  and he'd get away with it, but he isn't.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  Problem is the crew's great.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  I got so many clips here.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  This is all unscripted that I just send them clips
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  and then I don't remember.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  What was I saying I was about to play, guys?
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  Tucker Carlson, while I look at these clips
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  and figure out what I want to play next.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  Yeah, we'll, after we play the Tucker Carlson,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  we'll show you the parliament saying,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  and then we'll go to Parliament Schwab
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  and then we'll go to parliament Schwab
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  and then we'll go to parliament Schwab
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  and then we'll go to parliament Schwab
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  and then we'll go to parliament Schwab.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  Saying, hello, wait, wait.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  First, just go to the Carlson clip.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  Here it is.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  If it looks like something out of Belarus, it is,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  but it's happening right here in North America.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  When they arrived downtown,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  the police shattered truckers' windows
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  and dragged the drivers away.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  They need several demonstrators in the head.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  At one point this afternoon,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  horses began trampling Canadians as they protested.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  You're seeing that footage on your screen right now.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  The horses ran over several demonstrators
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  including a woman on a mobility scooter.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  Reportedly, one man had a heart attack
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  in the face of all of this, at least one.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  Instead of helping, the police stood around him.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  This kind of violence sponsored by Justin Trudeau
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  continued all day.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  Police repeatedly tackled Canadians,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  arrested them for the act of protesting,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  journalists for the act of filming it on camera.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  Here's just one example.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  This is disgusting!
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  Disgusting!
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  This is disgusting!
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Disgusting!
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  Oh my God!
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  You're not attacking the older people?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  Get them down!
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Hold the line!
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Disgusting!
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  So here's the definition of tyranny.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  It's oppressing your own citizenry,
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  ignoring the most basic standards of human rights,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  and then preventing the rest of the world
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  from seeing what you're doing.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  And that is exactly what Justin Trudeau did.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  He's ordered police to target independent media.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  There aren't many in Canada.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  They're the only reason we know what's happening there tonight,
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  but that's exactly what Trudeau's forces have been doing.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Today, they threaten to throw a Fox News camera crew in jail.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  A Rebel News reporter was thrown to the ground.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  Police also arrested the live streamer, Zot,
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  someone whose footage we've been using for two weeks now.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  They arrested him while he was recording.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  So where's our State Department on this?
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  This is ridiculous!
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  This is ridiculous!
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  So where's our State Department on this?
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  This is our closest ally in the world.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  Canada is one of our biggest trading partners.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  We share a border of 5,500 miles with Canada.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  So what happens in Canada is of deep concern to the U.S. government.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Our State Department exists to wag its finger
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  in the faces of foreign governments
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  and lecture them about human rights.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  But Joe Biden's State Department has said not a word.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  We called them today to see if they had any reaction at all
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  to the suspension of civil liberties in Canada,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  and they didn't.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  They refused to condemn any of it or even comment.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  Well, so now let's go ahead and go to the next clip here.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  This is yesterday.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  Trudeau has suspended Parliament.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  I've got some articles on that.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  I'm going to show you in a moment what that means
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  and read you some of the code.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  But again, you've got the Speaker of Parliament.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  They've ordered everybody out,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  but Parliament is allowed to call in
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  and go out over C-SPAN and give their views.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  And, oh, you're a member of Parliament
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  saying Klaus Schwab brags he controls Justin Trudeau
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  or that he controls half the Parliament
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  or half the cabinet?
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  And they just go, oh, sorry, can't hear you.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Can't see you.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Of course, it's totally clear.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  Cuts it and then the other voice pops on and says,
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  that's not true.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  But why is this important?
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  Because it's on record that it's true.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  And we have the clip.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  We don't just have one clip of Klaus Schwab saying this.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  He runs around like a demonic parrot
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  saying it constantly.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  And that's what pisses me off.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  It's like they have this weirdly this thing
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  where we're going to say it and we're going to do it
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  and then you're not going to criticize it
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  and say it doesn't exist or we're going to shut you down.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  I mean, the whole Parliament ought to be awake.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  Trudeau should be instantly saying,
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  I mean, the whole Parliament ought to be awake.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Trudeau should be instantly removed.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  But you know what the Canadian Constitution says?
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Queen Elizabeth, it's not really a free country.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  Canadians are great.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  I've told this for decades.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  They can't believe it.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  Look it up.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  Anytime the Queen wants, she can dissolve Parliament
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  and have her Governor General put in charge.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Well, I say that force her hand just like we did in 1776.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  I mean, that witch is fighting for her life right now.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  I don't wish any harm upon her.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  I've never seen evidence she's a pedophile
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  or a Nazi or a mass murderer
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  like her sons and her husband.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  But I mean, she's a bad person
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  and she's the longest serving monarch in history.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Oh, great.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  It's disgusting.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  And you produce sons that are pedophiles
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  and have 17,000 children.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  And that's disgusting.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  That's disgusting.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  And you produce sons that are pedophiles
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  and have 70 teddy bears they sleep with at night.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  I mean, give me a fricking break, lady.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  The sooner she climbs in her grave, the better.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  Oh my God, you talk about the Queen.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  The American sacrament now is worshiping the Queen.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  The Brits hate her.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  The Irish hate her.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  The Scots hate her.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  We're not ruled by hereditary groups, folks.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  That's the most racist thing there is
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  is to be ruled by a genetic group.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  America is about what you can do, what you can produce.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  It ain't about what color you are.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  It's about what you can get done.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  How good's the work you can do?
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  How hard do you work?
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  How smart are you?
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  How trustworthy?
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  How good's your music?
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  How good can you cook?
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  How good can you, yeah.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  How good can you fight?
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Not about who your great granddaddy was.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  You want nepotism?
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  You want nepotism on steroids?
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  It's Prince Andrew
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  and all the people who had to kill
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  to cover up his criminal actions.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  I mean, really.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  You got some 70-year-old spoiled,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  rotten, buck-toothed, inbred witch
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  that we're all supposed to bow down to.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  They go, oh, well, that's England.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  B for sovereignty.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  No, sovereignty is sovereign countries,
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  not those people.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  And the worst is Prince Harry.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  He's the worst of them all,
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  the little leftist arm of the whole thing.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  That's all the psyop as well.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Prince Philip said he wants to come back
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  as a virus to kill 80% of us
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  and add some worth to the world
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  because, see, he's a beautiful person.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  You're not.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  You need to die and get out of the way for him
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  so his son, so he can raise a son
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  that sleeps with 70 teddy bears.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  Really, dude?
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  Really?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  And you wear admiral and Disneyland outfits?
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  You're disgusting.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  You're anachronism.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  Sorry.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Let's go to the incredible footage
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  of parliament that's suspended,
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  but they're able to have members of parliament
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  call in and make statements,
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  and then now that they're not there,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  they're able to get out of the way
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  because remember, Trudeau was getting shouted down
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  in the last few weeks at all the events
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  by liberals and conservatives
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  and calling Jews Nazis.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  They were shouting him down,
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  members of parliament,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  and so what was he going to do?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  Oh, I suspend parliament,
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  and I suspend you being able to be here,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  but an archaic part of the law says
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  they can still call in,
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  so now they've got to be censored in live time.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  I mean, see how it works?
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  They're not just going to censor the truckers
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  out there in the snow.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  With their own money and their own gas going bankrupt,
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  no, now we're going to censor members of parliament
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  and act like it's because their audio
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  and video doesn't work,
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  but then they can't help it once they're silenced
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  to jump on and say, it's not true.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Closwob's not involved in anything.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  But that's exactly what we want, isn't it?
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Because once people go,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  there's a global corporate group
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  that bought off our leaders
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  and that wants to wreck everything
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  and release the virus.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Oh, oh, you ain't so smart-mouthed now,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  are you, Closwob?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  Now you got orders in there
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  to that parliament you control
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  to not talk about you,
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  because you don't care a Trudeau
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  gets destroyed in the process.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  It just can't be you and Prince Charles you report to.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  Oh, yeah, it's on record.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Prince Charles calls this his war
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  to save the earth against humanity.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  That's a quote.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  So Prince Charles, the pedophile,
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  the degenerate, the heir of Count Dracula,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  on record, look it up, I'm not joking.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  He literally has this ghoul,
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  Closwob, up there that bought off our leaders
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  and has done all this
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  and they think we're gonna submit to them
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  and the answer is we have only begun to fight
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  in the words of John Paul Jones.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  So let's back to back play both clips.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Here's what happened yesterday
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  in a suspended parliament,
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  now not letting people even have free speech,
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  cutting the feed, and not like,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  because, you know, the speaker's smart enough
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  to like cover it up and say,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  oh, sorry, your feed's cut,
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  we couldn't hear you when it's crystal.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  But the other guys is gonna be,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  no, it's not true, on top of it.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  They just always gotta go too far, don't they?
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  And then the next clip is last year
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  at the Kennedy Center with David Gergen,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  Closwob bragging that they've taken over parliaments
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  all over the world, but he's most proud of Trudeau.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  Here it is.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  and I listened to my colleague's speech.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  I had a constituent that wanted me
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  to ask a question about outside interference
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  to our democracy.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  Closwob is the head of the World Economic Forum
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  and he bragged how his subversive
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  World Economic Forum has quoted
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  infiltrated governments around the world.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  He said that his organization had penetrated
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  more than half of Canada's cabinet
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  and I was wondering,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  in the interest of transparency,
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  could the member please name
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  which cabinet ministers are on board
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  with the WEF's agenda?
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  My concern is the deputy...
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Order, order, order.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  I know the member was in a really good question there,
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  but the audio is really, really bad
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  and the video is really, really bad as well.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  And I apologize.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  I don't know if the member...
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Okay.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  Let's try again.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  The honourable member for Timmins James Bay.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  The honourable member for Timmins James Bay.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  The honourable member for Timmins James Bay.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  The honourable member for Timmins James Bay.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Mr. Speaker, that member is promoting
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  open disinformation.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  That's not debate.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  We have to call it disinformation.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  We'll get into debate again.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  When I mention our names,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  like Mrs. Merkel,
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  even Vladimir Putin and so on,
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  they all have been young global leaders
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  of the World Economic Forum.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  But what we are very proud of now,
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  the young generation,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  like Prime Minister Trudeau,
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  President of Argentina and so on,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  that we penetrate the cabinets.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  So yesterday I was at a reception
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  for Prime Minister Trudeau
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  and I would know that
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  half of this cabinet,
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  or even more half of this cabinet,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  would not be able to penetrate the cabinets.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  And I would know that
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  half of this cabinet,
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  or even more half of this cabinet,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  would not be able to penetrate.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And half of this cabinet
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  are for our,
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  actually, young global leaders
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  of the World Economic Forum.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  And that's true in Argentina too.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Wow. Sorry.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  It's true in Argentina
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  and it's true in France now,
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  with the President,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  with the young global leader.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  But what is important?
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  These guys, you watch their hands,
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  they're rubbing everything,
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  they're all fetishising everything.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  They're like,
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  and they just think they're invincible.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  No.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  Your body's going to give out,
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  you're going to die like everybody else.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  God is going to bring you down
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  and your whole system will fail.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  And I tell you, Klaus Schwab will live
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  to see his new world order die.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  He's such a mass murderer though.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  So again,
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  it doesn't exist.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  He doesn't brag on his own website
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  that he controls half the countries of the world.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  And you can't say that in parliament
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  or they shut you down.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Well, of course, they declared martial law.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  You're like,
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  I elected a member of parliament
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  who's been kicked out of the building
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  but is allowed to call in
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  and then they censor him?
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  By the way, I'm going to get that member wrong, guys.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  That's a big person I want on.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  That's the essence of this.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  Of course they did that
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  because now they're identified,
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  now they're spotlighted
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  like those cockroaches that Ted Nugent
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  talks so much about.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  This is why my show is impossible
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  because this is an awesome broadcast.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  The crew's badass.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  But I mean, this one thing we've talked about 15 minutes
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  because it's a big deal, isn't it?
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  I've got stuff even worse.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  Seriously.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  I mean, it just, it's so incredible.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  Let me settle down.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  Get Bill Gates ready saying he's mad
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  that Omnicron saved so many people
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  and gave people immunity.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  And then him saying,
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  you've got to wear a mask like wearing pants.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  Get those clips ready.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  I'm going to go to those.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  But thank you.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  We'll go to it in a minute.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  Let me show you why I'm so pissed.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  I've got over 100 articles just on what happened
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  and I've been spending hours last night
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  and hours a day watching all this like you have
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  and it's just so fricking evil.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  I mean, it's like you walk out in your garage,
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  there's an eight-foot Count Dracula eating a baby.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  I mean, you know, it's not good.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  The articles on Infowars.com video,
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  Canadian member of parliament accused
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  of spreading misinformation,
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  disinformation for pointing out WEF's
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  corrupt influence over Trudeau's government.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  You know about this,
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  but do your friends and family know?
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  Because this is just next level.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  I mean, it's not just, see the headline,
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  Jamie's a great guy.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  He can't even get it as bad as it is and I get it.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  Member of Canadian parliament censored, censored,
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  for pointing out Klaus Schwab's
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  admitted control of Trudeau.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  They use that magic word.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  Oh, disinformation.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  If you go to the Wikipedia
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  and it links to Klaus Schwab's own website,
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000]  he says, we have penetrated the governments.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  We control half world government now
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  and half the, when he says we control
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  half of the, see the member of parliament got it wrong.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  When he says we control half of the cabinets,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  he means he's got half the cabinets,
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  not he's got half the cabinets someplace.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  No.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  There it is, capture of democratic
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  structures and institutions.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  Democratic structure.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  Democratic elite capture is what it's called.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  I mean, it's a declaration of war.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  They're annihilating us.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  They're bankrupting us.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  They're trying to put deadly poison in our bodies.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  They're laughing at us and we're supposed
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  to just sit here and take it while he says it all over TV
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  and then a member of parliament tries to bring it up
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  and they're shut down.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  While police beat up and run over women
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  on mobility scooters with Clydesdales.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  I've got the video of like the,
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  in slow motion of the horse stomping on her chest.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  It's like, her ribs are being broken
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  and then the cops are like,
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  the cops rush in and start billy clubbing.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  Because like, I mean,
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000]  you couldn't be more disingenuous.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  You couldn't be more satanic.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  And it's, yeah, there's the woman
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  that the horse runs over in a minute.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Imagine growing up your whole life being a cop
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  and then you're going to run over old women.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  I mean, I just, I can't even look at it anymore.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  But this is what evil is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  This is who these people are.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  Notice the left didn't say get rid of the Canadians.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  Because they're lock, stock and barrel in line.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  The good ones have already resigned.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  No, it's the better police departments
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  they want to control.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  Because they don't have control yet.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  Look at this, Canadian police use pepper spray
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  stun grenades to push clear the Capitol.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  And I love this AP headline.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  Because this morning the headline was,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  Canadian police use pepper spray
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  stun grenades to clear the Capitol
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  and restore normality.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  But I guess that was a little too obvious
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  because it's not normality.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  Oh, back to checkpoints.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Back to vaccine checkpoints.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Back to forced inoculations.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Back to total surveillance.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Back to the normality.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  No, we want the normality back, dumbasses.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  That's why they're there protesting.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  But they changed the headline to,
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  this is Reuters, sorry I said AP.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Canadian police use pepper spray stun grenades
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  to push to clear the Capitol
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  as if people are in the Capitol.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Canadian officers.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  Canadian police officers move protesters
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  towards Parliament Hill
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  as they work to restore normality.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  Oh, to the Capitol,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  while trucks and demonstrators
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  continue to occupy downtown.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  They're the ones blockading.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  They're the ones shutting down the bad people,
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  not Klaus Schwab and his men.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  They're the ones blockading.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  They're the ones shutting down the bad people,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  not Klaus Schwab and his men.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  Not Klaus Schwab and his men,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  he brags, he controls.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  So let's go ahead and look at some
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  of the controlling sections of this.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  And this is,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  Hitler was elected like Trudeau
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  with 30 percent of the vote,
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  strangely enough.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  You're like, well, how are you elected with 30 percent?
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  Well, it's a parliament.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  He was elected president of the lower house
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  of the German Reichstag Bundestag.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  It's a parliamentary system
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  different than America's congressional system.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  And then they firebomb the building
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  and claim it on people.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  It was later declassified
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  that they staged it in Nuremberg.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  But back then, our media didn't want
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  people knowing government staged stuff.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  They said, no, it's not true.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  Hitler did not firebomb his own Reichstag
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  with Hermann Göring,
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  which was admitted it had happened
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  previous to that.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  But why is this important?
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Because the emergency powers declared
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  by Hitler, then von Hindenburg,
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  stepped down as chancellor
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  and Hitler merged the presidency
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  with Hitler or the leader.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  And the Weimar Republic ceased to exist.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Don't you know, Q and the leftist CIA operatives
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  wish they could have got folks
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  to burn down the capital January 6th,
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  but they didn't.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  So they didn't get their full Reichstag.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  And boy, are they pissed.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  So here's a breakdown of this.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Allowing Trudeau tyranny
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  under the guise of protecting us
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  can only end badly if left unchecked.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Trudeau even suspended parliament,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  which is needed to officially pass
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  the Emergency Act,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  and is making some powers permanent.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  So he suspended parliament
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  so they can't challenge him again.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  Silenced them and is in now complete control.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  Last time that happened
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  to a major Western government
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  was February 27th, 1933.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  So let's move on to the next little piece here.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  He's figuring out what's going on.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  This is all a beta test.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  They admit Obama and the globalist
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  are in DC running this right now.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  Hitler's Enabling Act was passed
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  in March of 1932, 1933.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  Again, you have the Reichstag fire in February
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  and the Enabling Act the next month.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  Hitler's Enabling Act was passed
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  in March of 1933.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  It gave him extraordinary powers
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  to bypass laws and fundamental human rights
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  and punish anyone without courts
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  for no stated reason,
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  confiscate bank funds and other assets
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  and essentially do whatever he pleased.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  Trudeau's done the exact same thing.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  But don't criticize it
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  or you get your feet cut
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  even though you're elected
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  because you've been suspended.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  Oh, but Trudeau let you still call in,
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  but now you're controlled.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  But people in Dresden,
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  by the hundreds of thousands protesting,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  they're not controlled.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  The report of this woman
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  is in critical condition,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  stomped by the Clydesdales
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  along with others.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  The cops rode her over on purpose.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  That's the new Tiananmen Square.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  Then I've got this clip.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Trudeau's deputy,
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  Chrystia Freeland,
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  whose grandfather literally
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  was directly under Joseph Goebbels'
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  second command in his region
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  and ran the propaganda
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  of the Nazi occupation of Poland
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  and Austria.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  He was Ukrainian.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Quite a pedigree.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  He ran the newspapers
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  in occupied Austria and Poland.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Wow.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  And she's on the board of directors
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  of Klaus Schwab's,
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Deibos.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  But you don't talk about her.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  Folks on Twitter say,
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  absolutely surreal script
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  written by Alex Jones.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Ottawa police say,
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  protesters, we told you to leave.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  We gave you time to leave.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  We were slow.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  And the police say,
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  we were slow and methodical.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  Yet you were assaultive
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  and aggressive with officers
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  and the horses.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  Based on your behavior,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  we are responding by introducing
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  helmets and batons for our safety.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  Think about that Orwellian statement.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  We want you to let Pfizer,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  and he's already bought it out
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  many years in the future,
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Trudeau has injections and track
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  you and let us run your body.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  And if you don't like that,
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  if you peacefully protest,
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  we're going to ride over you
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  with Clydesdale horses
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  and then run our mouths
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  about how great we are.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  But the good news is Canada
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  is not giving up from all over
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  the country, from the east,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  from the north, from the west
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  and from the south.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  The people are flooding in
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  now that they've seen this attack.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  The police are just following orders
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  and I'm not defending them.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  I'm not saying that they're not bad
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  and shouldn't be held accountable.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  Most police refused to be part
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  of this, they had to bring in
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  these special units, but Canadians
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  had to stand up now peacefully.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  They can't say no.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  They've got to go.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  And I salute these men and women,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  but we need to be praying for them
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  right now because now they're
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  going to set off the truck bomb,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  the false flag or something along
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  the lines of protesting endless
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  lockdowns worldwide as the enemy
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  and Biden's thinking about doing
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  this in the next 262 days.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  I hope you're listening to me, folks.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  I don't just say this stuff up here.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  You think I'm up here doing all this
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  because I like to hear myself talk?
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  I don't.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  My wife complains that I barely
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  talk to her or anybody all day long.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  I don't hardly talk when I'm not here.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  I'm not telling you all this
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  so I can hear my mouth run.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  This is the take down of the entire
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  country and they're going to stage
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  a false flag like bananas are yellow
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  and the sky is blue and roses are red.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  Parliament isn't allowed to criticize
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  Klaus Schwab on TV.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  They're shut down.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  You think we're in a good spot, folks?
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  You think they're pulling crap like
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  this because they don't have the keys
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  to turn the power plants off right
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  now.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  They're thinking about, you know
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  my main fear?
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  They're going to turn the power off.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  Oh, here's the deal.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Trudeau is weak.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  Schwab's weak.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Biden's weak.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  They're all bad.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  They're evil but they've got the
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  technocracy and because our engineers
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  have let everything be hooked into AI
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  and centralized systems, it's like
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  the 1970s show and it got remade.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  I'm not a big TV guy but I did watch
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  a lot of TV shows that are hooked
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  into the AI.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  And that's how they can take all
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  the power systems down right now.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  You might as well have aliens that
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  are running this right now because
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  that's what they're doing.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  They hate us.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  They want to get rid of us and now
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  in all their telegraph reports and
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  all my intel from high level people
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  at the highest levels is they have
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  their finger on the button to turn
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  the power off for six months.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  Within two weeks, all the cities
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  will burn.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  That's why I'm telling you, folks,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  if you don't realize that the most
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  psychotic, evil people in the world
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  who are getting off on this, you're
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  like, why would they be ruthless?
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  Why would they be reckless?
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  They like that.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  They fly around on jumbo jets.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  They screw kids.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  They're off on doing bad things.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  And they're in control now.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  And if they can demonize the truckers
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  and set that precedent, they're
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  going to duplicate it here.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  And so now's the time for all the
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  bureaucrats.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  I don't care if you're a truck driver
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  or work at a power plant or work at
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  a school or work at the police
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  department or the FBI or in a
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  university or at a factory or you're
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  a farmer, you better hear me and know
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  this is the enemy war.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  I've known this stuff my whole life.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  I've just always understood it.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  I've always been drawn to it.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  And I know the enemy's plan.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  And I can tell you now this is what
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  I was born for and what you were
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  born for and this is the main assault.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  And any day now, it can be the last
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  show you ever see me again.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  And then you're on your own.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  I'm on my own.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  You think they're releasing the
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  restrictions all over the world?
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  No, they're getting ready to clamp
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  them down 10 times tighter.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  They want you to relax so they can
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  sucker punch you right in the gut
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  and I don't want you to relax
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  because they're scared of you
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  videotaping everything.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  They're scared of you talking
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  to everybody you know.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  They're scared of you watching.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  They're scared of you right now
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  saying the power's going off.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  Klaus Schwab did it.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  You know, maybe 16, 17, 18 years
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  ago where the trucks are driving
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  around listening to everybody.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  They're like, these got an 80%
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  positive and the dictator's so mad.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  They know if you know they did it
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  and if you know the UN and David
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  Rockefeller and his system and Bill
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  Gates is behind this and that when
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  the lights go out, you know what
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  they're planning to do, they won't
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  do it.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  But if they think you don't know
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  and if they think you don't know
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  it's Klaus Schwab, they're going
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  to do it.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Because Klaus Schwab wants to be
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  the savior when they turn the power
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  back on.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  Klaus Schwab's going to have the
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  social credit score and the
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  universal basic income when the
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  power goes back on.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  But if everybody knows his plan,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  then he can't do it.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  Comprende.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  If I thought it got your
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  attention, I'd take the scissors
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  off on TV and let blood spray
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  everywhere because maybe that would
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  get your attention, but I don't
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  think it would get your attention.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  I'm serious, folks.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  This is like if I thought it would
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  get you to wake up, I'd cut a couple
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  fingers off right now on TV.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  Seriously, I'd do it right now.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  Because here's the deal.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  I know they're starting a nuclear
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  war.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  I know they're getting ready to
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  turn the power off.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  I know they're getting ready to
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  turn the power off.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  You know, that's my frustration is
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  there's no way to cover all this
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  properly.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  You think I should keep going over
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  all this?
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  I mean, I think the main message
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  here is anybody that thinks you're
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  going along with evil and thinks
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  you're going to get ahead is a
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  moron.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  Maybe I'll go back to Canada in a
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  minute.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  God, is it bad.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  And then, oh, by the way, I should
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  probably add this.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  be in studio tomorrow.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  She's in Houston tonight.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  She called me Friday and she wants
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  to come on. We're really happy to
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  have her. We're going to go get
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  dinner tomorrow night. And I love
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  her. She's a great lady, got a
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  great spirit. She's the future of
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  people like her. She'll be on with
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  us if we're even here tomorrow.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  And I'm serious, folks. If you
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  don't think when you go to bed at
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  night, whatever comes back on,
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  unless you've got a bunch of diesel
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  or solar panels.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  I mean, I'm going to play this again
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  to you, but I'm going to be real
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  clear here. I don't tell you stuff
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  to BS you, okay? If I tell you
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  something, I know it's happening,
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  okay? I mean, I would be surprised
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  if the power is on in a week. I
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  mean, by doing this, we may stop
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  them. But that's how much trouble
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  we're in.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  And you know why? You know why?
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  Because we're winning. Humanity's
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  coming back from the dead again.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  Humanity's waking up from the dead
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  again. Humanity's coming together
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  again. Humanity is seeing through
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  the lies, and the system cannot
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  stand it and is going to try to
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  overturn the tables. And that's
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  why I'm not worried about waking
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  people up anymore. I'm not
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  worried about what's going to happen
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  to them. I'm not worried about
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  waking people up anymore. I'm
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  worried about letting the Bill
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  Gates's and the Austin's and the
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  Millie's of the world know that I
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  know you're sacks of garbage, that
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  we're putting power because you'd
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  carry out whatever order you said.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  But you ought to be smart enough
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  to look into the face of what
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  you're doing and know your
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  underground bunkers, a large
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  percentage of your personnel are
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  listening to me right now. That
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  ain't nothing. That ain't
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  a freakin' bluff. They know it. I
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  don't bluff. It's not about how
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  powerful I am. It's about how
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  powerful you are. I'm just a
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  messenger. We know who you are. We
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  know what you're doing. And don't
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  you think that once you vaporize
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  and once you people see their
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  families dying, you didn't get
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  your robots in place in time. You
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  still got humans you've got to
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  deal with, and you still got
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  humans you got to deal with, and
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  you still got humans you got to
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  deal with, and you still got
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  humans you got to deal with, and
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  you won't get away with this. You
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  think you purged the military? You
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  think you brought in a bunch of
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  woke retards who are going to sit
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  there and carry all this out with
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  you? You better think again. You
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  better slap yourself upside your
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  head, and you better get the
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  religion right now of what you're
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  facing, or you don't have any
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  future. And I'm not the one
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  threatening you. You're
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  threatening us, signed on to this
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  a long time ago. Get the hell off
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  the course you're on now before
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  it's too late. Because as for me,
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  I'm not scared. I'm ready for
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  whatever has to happen. I signed
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  on to this a long time ago. But
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  I'm telling you something right
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  now. You candy ass globalists are
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  all about your own personal power
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  and your own personal largess and
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  your own personal sensuousness.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  You're in love with yourselves.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  Well, you can be in love with the
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  skeletons that you're going to be
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  real soon. By your own frickin'
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  hand, you idiots. But I know
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  talking sense to one of you people
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  doesn't matter. So I'm talking to
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  your minions. If your minions are
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  listening right now, and they've
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  got any inkling of humanity left
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  to them, and they've got any soul
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  left, and they've got any
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  connection to God, then they know
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  that they can cry out to God and
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  say, I repent. I don't know what to
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  do. And don't follow what Alex
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  Jones tells you, because I'm not
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  about to tell you what to do,
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  where you're at, and what you do.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  I'm not omnipresent. I'm far from
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  it. I'm a dumbass. God will tell
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  you what to do right now, and you
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  can jack in. As sure as you can
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  plug your iPhone into a computer,
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  you can jack into the Holy Spirit
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  in eternity right now, and God will
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  tell you what to do if you're a
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  police officer, if you're a school
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  teacher, if you are in Cheyenne
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  Falls, if you're at Fort Bragg
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  right now, if you are in Moscow
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  right now, if you are in Durban,
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  South Africa right now, if you are
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  in Buenos Aires, it doesn't matter
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  where you are, you can say no to
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  these people right now. You can say
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  no to nuclear war. You can say no
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  to Satanism. You can say no to
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  pedophilia. You can say no to
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  following legal orders. You can say
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  no, and you can help all of us
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  together transcend this evil.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  Let's do this. Look at this stack
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  right here. Let's look at these
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  little jewels. Let's start with
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  this. See, unlike MSM, when I tell
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  you something, I show it to you.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  This is Bill Gates on international
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  television yesterday saying that
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Omicron, quote, sadly spreads
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  immunity faster than vaccines.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  Imagine what he's saying. The
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  natural world, your body, your
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  immune system, this is terrible.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  We're not going to be able to
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  inject 70% now because Omicron,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  because the natural immunity came
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  to this. Think about how
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  disconnected from God he is to
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  make a statement where, see, he's
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  got to be God. We've got another
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  clip, let's just play them back to
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  back, where he demonizes people not
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  wearing masks despite the trauma
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  and the oxygen reduction and the
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  brain damage. He says it's just
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  like wearing pants. And he's a
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  damn little demon gremlin up there
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  with a bunch of female tarts trying
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  to pick him up for the night. We're
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  not supposed to have kids, but he
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  can. And then you've got a whole
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  room full of masked people watching
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  him not realizing it's the mark of
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  their veil of death and that
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  they're in the cult and they're
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  silenced and they're gagged and
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  he's fetishizing the whole thing.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  Here are the clips.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  To kick off, actually, and get a
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  bit of a scene center from Mr.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Gates, because this is, I know, a
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  topic that you've spoken on again
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  and again. You were ahead of the
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  curve prior to the beginning of
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  this pandemic. Where would you
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  assess where we are today?
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  You know, hit pause, back it up.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Look at that gremlin physiology of
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  him, like crouching like a demon.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  Back up at the start, please. Oh,
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  you were ahead of the curve. You
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  made up all the major government
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  agencies, including the NIH and the
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  CDC on record, that were literally
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  owned by his consortium. You didn't
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  know that? They owned part of the
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  patents. And you're ahead of the
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  curve. Yeah, you made the weapon.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  You attacked us with it. And now
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  you're attacking us with the poison
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  gene therapy on record, causing all
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  the heart attacks. And here's this
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  woman worshipping you. It's
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  disgusting. Here it is. To kick
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  off, actually, and get a bit of a
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  scene center from Mr. Gates,
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  because this is, I know, a topic
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  that you've spoken on again and
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  again. You were ahead of the curve
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  prior to the beginning of this
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  pandemic. Hit pause again. You were
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  ahead of the curve. He's on record
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  spending billions a year paying for
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  these conferences, paying for the
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  media, so he can sit up there and
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  these idiots paid to say this can
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  say how wonderful he is. Just
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  realize behind the curtain what a
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  frickin' enemy he is of you and your
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  family. Put him back on screen. We
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  have to get him back on screen.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  What do you expect in beating COVID-19?
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  Well, the, you know, sadly, the
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  virus itself, particularly the
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  variant called Omicron, is a type of
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  vaccine. That is, it creates both
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  B-cell and T-cell immunity. And it's
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  done a better job of getting out to
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  the world population than we have
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  with vaccines. If you do seros
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  surveys in African countries, you
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  get what you need. And it's done a
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  better job of getting out to the
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  world population than we have with
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  vaccines. If you do seros surveys
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  in African countries, you get well
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  over 80 percent of people have been
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  exposed either to the vaccine or to
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  various variants. And so, you know,
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  what that does is it means the
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  chance of severe disease, which is
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  mainly associated with being elderly
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  and having obesity or diabetes.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  We love those Africans so much.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  Those risks are now dramatically
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  reduced because of that infection
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  exposure. And it's done a better job
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  of getting out to the world population
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  than we have with vaccines. And so,
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  you know, what that does is it means
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  the chance of severe disease, which
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  is mainly associated with being
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  elderly and having obesity or diabetes
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  or diabetes, which is mainly reduced
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  because of that infection exposure.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  And, you know, it's sad. We didn't do
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  a great job on therapeutics.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  It's sad that they have a much lower
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  level of getting sick or dying
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  because of Omicron. He just said that
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  because the vaccine erases your
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  immune system and basically kills
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  your immune system.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  And this is the kind of thing that
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  is so critical.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  And so what he's saying is that
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  Africa has the lowest COVID death
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  rate in the world, like ridiculously
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  low. So imagine what he's saying.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  He's telling you that it's terrible
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  that Africans got immune naturally
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  and didn't die.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  Here it is.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  To various variants.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  And so, you know, what that does
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  is it means the chance of severe
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  disease, which is mainly associated
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  with being elderly and having
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  obesity or diabetes.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Those risks are now dramatically
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  reduced because of that infection
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  exposure.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  And, you know, it's sad.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  We didn't do a great job on
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  therapeutics, you know, only here
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  two years in. Do we have a good
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  therapeutic vaccines?
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  It took us two years to be in
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  oversupplied today.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  There are more vaccines than there
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  is demand for vaccines.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  Let's stop there again.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  They block vitamin C, they block
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  zinc, they block hydroxychloroquine,
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  they block ivermectin, they block
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  everything.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  And then now they've got a Pfizer
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  pill that eats your kidneys like
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  remdesivir does as well.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  And now we've got a therapeutic.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  I mean, when you know what's going
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  on, it's like this guy is literally
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  a super villain pissing in your
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  face. Continue.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  There's demand for vaccines, and,
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  you know, that wasn't true.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  And next time we should try and
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  make it instead of two years, we
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  should make it more like six
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  months, which certainly, you know,
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  some of the standardized platform
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  approaches, including MRNA, would
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  allow us to do that.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  So, you know, it took us a lot
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  longer this time than than it
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  should have.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  That's right.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  We're going to continue.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  That's right, because we can't
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  have natural immunity. They'll
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  learn they have an immune system.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  We had the attorney general or the
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  surgeon general he owns say it
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  naturally doesn't exist.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  The sky doesn't exist.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  So now he's moved on.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  Here he is saying it's ridiculous.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  You should always wear your mask
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  like your pants.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  But he's not wearing his mask up
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  on the stage because the elites
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  don't wear the mask. Here it is.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  There are a lot of people in
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  America who are confused about
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  whether they should be wearing a
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  mask. And in the United Kingdom,
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  for example, they've scrapped that
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  altogether. Well, that's
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  interesting. You know, what is the
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  downside of wearing a mask? I
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  mean, it's got to be tough. You
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  know, you have to wear pants. I
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  mean, this is tough stuff. These
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  societies are so cruel. Why do
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  they make you wear pants? I'm
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  trying to figure it out. We're
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  very glad you have yours on.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  We're wearing masks. The whole
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  damn audience is just so sick.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  How they're inducting everybody
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  into slavery. You know, I've been
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  live here for about an hour and 50
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  minutes. We've been on air for two
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  hours. And I've covered two stacks
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  and I've begun the latest stack. So
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  let me just do this. Let me in the
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  interest of time here, because
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  everybody, you know, is tuned in and
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  we appreciate you. Let me just run
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  through the headlines with quick
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  questions for you. So Bill Gates
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  says Omicron sadly spreads immunity
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  faster than vaccines. Think that's
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  Orwellian? Well, he's a good person.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  You're not. Bill Gates says it's
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  too late to vaccinate the
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  world's population because, again,
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  they've already gotten better from
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  Omicron. But Bill Gates says there's
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  no doubt that misinformation
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  enhanced vaccine hesitancy and must
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  be shut down. Yes, silence people.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  And he says the new pandemic's
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  coming. The answer is an omni-vaccine
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  that basically erases your immune
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  system. Believe in COVID vaccines
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  even if it means you die. Spike just
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  boosted. There's a lot of other great
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  memes that are out there right now.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  How effective is the vaccine? 100
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  percent. He runs out of the room,
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  96 percent. Jumps out the window,
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  84 percent. Down the road, 42
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000]  percent. And now we learn it's AIDS.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  And, you know, we could joke about
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  that, but, man, boy, folks that took
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  the shot aren't going to want to admit
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  they got killed. They're going to get
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  mad at us when we tell them what he
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  did to them. That's how it works.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  Why are you pimps so good, Fauci?
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  General Flynn exposes it all. No
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  correlation here at all with the
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  current events in Canada that he's a
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  World Economic Forum menu. You're not
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  supposed to talk about it. He's got
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  his little matching socks. He's so
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  cool. He's got it all together. And
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  it just goes on and on and on from
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  there. Look at this article. Patrick
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  Howley put this out. The world should
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  not be governed by these types of
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  women. Ottawa City Council describes
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  weekend protests as if it's her
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  Vietnam. She says she's afraid to wear
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  her COVID mask. Masks have become a
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  psychological symbol of leftist
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  protectionism for her. I'm not going
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  to go back to the video, but we're
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  all being put into our own little
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  camps here. Let me show you these
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  headlines I don't want you to see.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Federal appeals court, United Airlines
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  vaccine mandate coerced employees to
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  violate religious convictions and
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  violated federal, state and the
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  Nuremberg code. Kind of important. New
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  York State will not require health
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  care workers to get boosted due to
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  potential staffing shortages. It was
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  collapsing things a little worse than
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  people thought it would. Everyone is
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  at risk of blood clots. CDC and Pfizer
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  issue urgent warnings on blood clots,
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  even in the healthiest of athletes, and
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  say it's normal to have thousands of
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  percentage points of people increasing
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  blood clots, heart attacks and
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  microcarditis. They just say it's
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  normal, but has nothing to do with the
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  shots. Just an absolutely amazing and
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  great conversation here, and MSNBC
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  reporter notes that the biggest
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  challenge for Democrat governors
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  ending their mask mandate is that
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  liberals have made mask wearing such
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  an important part of their identity.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  We have videos all over the U.S. and
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  Europe and Canada, people protesting,
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  demanding everyone wear masks,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  including children. Here, let's go
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  ahead and hear this clip right now.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  Trend lines have been clear that a
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  growing number of Americans, including
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  a lot of Democrats, are heading
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  towards, if not already at the point
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  of saying, you know what, we just got
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  to get back to normal. And you see
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  this kind of emerging message from
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  some Democrats basically saying
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  mission accomplished, that the
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  policies of the Biden White House,
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  the Democratic Congress, Democratic
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  governors, they worked, our
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  sacrifices were worth it, we got
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  vaccinated, it's now time to enjoy
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  those benefits. But that message
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  hasn't really been that loud because
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  as you point out, the base is
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  not yet. So I think there's going
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  to be a challenge for a lot of
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  Democratic leaders to get their
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  base comfortable with the idea of
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  going back to normal. I mean, for
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  the past two years, so much of the
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  identity of what it meant to be a
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  Democrat, to follow the science, was
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  tied up in masking and following
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  these rules and regulations. And if
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  you didn't do that, you were, you
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  know, a bad person. You were Ron
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  DeSantis. You were a denier.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  That's enough. Yeah, these folks
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  had to be rehabilitated. They were
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  part of the show with today. Greg
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  Rees's new report on Trainers to
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  Die, Trainers to Be Slaves, MK
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  Ultra, so powerful. Look at these
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  headlines. Crisis in America.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  Deaths up 40 percent amongst those
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  18 to 64 major life insurance
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  companies confirm what previous
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  companies have said. Moderna stock
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  loses 140 billion as insiders sell
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  millions of dollars of shares. We
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  told you that a week before it even
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  started, they called it a
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  conspiracy theory. And so is the
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  Pfizer stock plunging. So these
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  guys are in a lot of trouble. Let's
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  look at some of the numbers from the
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  VAERS reporting system. A 279
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  percent spike in miscarriages.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  Actually, that's in VAERS, but this
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  is even worse. This is from the
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  insurance company numbers and the
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  Pentagon numbers that are coming out.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  487 percent spike in breast cancer.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  1,048 percent spike in nervous
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  system. 155 percent spike in birth
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  defects. 350 percent spike in male
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  infertility. 369 percent spike in
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  testicular cancer. Don't tell that
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  famous biker about that. 2,181
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  percent spike in hypertension. 664
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  percent spike in malignant
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  neoplasms. 680 percent spike in
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  multiple sclerosis. 551 spike in
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  Guillain-Barre syndrome. 468 percent
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  spike in pulmonary embolism. 302
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  percent spike in tachyardia. 452
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  percent spike in migraines. 471
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  percent spike in female infertility.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  427, 37 percent spike in ovarian
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  dysfunction. 269 percent spike in
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  mitocardial infraction. 291 percent
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  spike in Bell's palsy. 479 percent
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  spike in pulmonary embolism.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  Here's another one by Steve Watson
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  on Infowars.com with the link to the
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  senator. Rand Paul vows to force or
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  repeal the federal regulation
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  mandating masks. Good. Video.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  University students protesting its
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  mask mandate being dropped. You've
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  got to see it, folks. And yes, they
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  waved on his flags as well, of
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  course. Video, mall cop kicks out
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  young man for wearing Trump face
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  masks. And it goes on and on and on.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000]  The FBI is announced again. Anyone
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  questioning lockdowns are the enemy.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  Wow. Must feel good to work for that
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  agency. I mean, this is just so
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  ridiculous. But California passed
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  the law where you can give somebody
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  hepatitis or HIV and you don't get in
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  trouble. You got to wear that mask,
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  though. What a very, very sick group
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  of people. Well, I really appreciate
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  the crew coming in today and I really
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  appreciate everybody that's here. And
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  like I said, we have Marjorie Taylor
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  Green in studio tomorrow with us. I
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  think she's going to host both hours
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  with us tomorrow. So definitely look
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  forward to it. I hit five or six of
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  the stacks today. I hit five or six of
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  the stacks today. But I tell you what
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  I'm going to do. I'm going to hit all
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000]  these other stacks. That one over there
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  and this one here and these was at one,
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 12 stacks I
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  didn't hit and whatever's new, as long
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  as we're still on air tomorrow. But
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  whatever I do, I'm not going to be a
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  victim. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  think it's totally normal that the
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  admitted pimp that reportedly got
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  thousands of underage girls and kids
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  or Jeffrey Epstein and other people
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  that visited, you know who they are, the
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  Bill Gateses and others of the world.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  Well, we're not supposed to think he
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  might have actually been suicided. We're
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  not supposed to think he might have been
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  suicided or actually murdered. Epstein
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  accomplished Jean Luc Brunel reportedly
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  hangs himself in a French prison. Let's
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  show a few images of this guy before we
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  get the transmission. Oh, my goodness. If
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  you go to the site Infowars.com, you can
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  see him on the Lolita Express and with
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  the Epstein's and with Ghazeline Maxwell
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  and with Bill Clinton. Just like all
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  these other guys, it's so much fun to
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  feed on people. Jeffrey Epstein's close
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  extended pimp Jean Luc Brunel found dead
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  and apparent prison suicide. He allegedly
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  hanged himself. Prison cameras were not
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  working at the time. Well, are they ever
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  working? That's all up on Infowars.com.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  And then we've got the sound cannon
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  attacks on the Australian population
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  protesting in Canberra, endless
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  lockdowns. And then I haven't gotten
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  to this CNN letter that I got last week
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  that I've mentioned, but I haven't covered
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  it yet because it's important. It's a lot
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  bigger than Alex Jones. It's how
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  identities are stolen and how Hollywood
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  operates. And they think I'm so stupid.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  They don't know this because they believe
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  they own my story. They believe they own
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  me and they don't. Jon Ronson doesn't own
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  me. Leader DiCaprio doesn't own me. None
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  of you garbage. I mean, you talk about
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  the garbage of the planet you're in. You
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  don't own me. And this whole thing, I'll
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  either read tomorrow or the next day on
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  air because I want to get this on record.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  The incredible fake origin story they've
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  created, which they're putting in the news,
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  which then they think will allow Hollywood
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  to put out. Well, well, NPR and CNN
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  reported this, so we're allowed to put
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  this garbage out.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  They're going to fail.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  Hollywood's already a rotting husk. In
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  fact, if Hollywood came out and endorsed
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  me, it would destroy me. But because we
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  expose them, it's the other way around.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  They don't get it, though. They don't know
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  it's all over for them. And so that's
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  another amazing sector of this. I'm not
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  funded by stolen taxpayer money. I'm not
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  funded by George Soros or the degenerate
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  senator. The queen of England makes you
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  burn in hell. I'm funded by you, and I
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  appreciate your support and everything you
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  do. We have amazing products that have
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  been sold out for so long back in stock.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  We have Brain Force Ultra, a very fast
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  acting, clean, pure, next level healthy
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  stimulant that is just so clean and so
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  good, very fast acting. What I like about
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  it is it dissipates. I can take this at
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  6, 7 at night and still go to bed at 11.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  Turbo Force, you're going to be awake for
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  10 hours, and it's amazing. Brain Force
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  Plus, five, six hours. They're all
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  different formulas, so it's like cats
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  versus dogs, potatoes, tomatoes. It's all
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  different things. But it's back in stock,
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  40% off, infowarsstore.com or triple-A

[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  for months, and that funds our whole

[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  get a t-shirt. You probably noticed for
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  10 years we had power reviews, a big
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  third-party site we got, and we on average
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  had 4.9 stars, hundreds of thousands of
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  reviews. They said, sorry, we can't work
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  with you, because we can't have you
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  connect to other humans. We can't have
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  other people come to you and say the
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  great response they had. So we think that
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  the power of you is a way, they told us
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  Thursday, that'll make people stop buying
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  your products. Well, this is just what we
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  deal with, folks. We're the tip of the
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  spear, and we understand that, but don't
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  let them shut us up. Don't let them
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  silence you. Don't let them stop you for
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  the revolutionary act of supporting
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  freedom and getting great products at the
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  same time. Get an Infowars shirt, get a
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  book, get a film, get historical food,
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  get a shortwave radio, get non-GMO heirloom
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  seeds, get our X3 that's also 50% off.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  That sale ends in a week. But whatever
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  you do, spread the word about the
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  articles and the videos and realize the
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  enemies of humanity, your enemies that
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  are attacking you and literally want to
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  kill you, that are degenerate, satanic,
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  pedophile globalists. On record, this is
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  monstrous goblins. They think they can
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  shut you up, and they can't. So pray for
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  the broadcast, pray for Global Awakening,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  buy the products, and whatever you do,
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  just say no to the new world order. I'm
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  not your slave, and I defy you, and I say
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  no to your tyranny. Incredible job to the
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  crew. This is the end of the live show
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  at 4 12 central. We're going to loop this
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  with this great infrastructure and great
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  crew until 4 p.m. tomorrow, where I'm
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  going to be back live for four hours
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  Sunday, because we're working seven days
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  a week. We're doing two shows a day soon.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  We're not backing down in the face of
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  tyranny, because this is a major test, and
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  we want to win the fight, but only you
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  keep us in the game. So I want to salute
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  and thank you all. You've been coming
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  through. We're doing amazing things. We're
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  breaking the will of the globalists. There's
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  that great crew. So God bless and good
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  luck. Now go share that Gregory's report
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  on illegal secret testing on the people
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  of the planet.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  and say, I don't know what's going to
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  happen at the end of this, but you want
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  to fight? You better believe you've got
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  one!
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  From the front lines of the Information
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years, and
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  long before I started selling high-quality
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  promoting people taking vitamin D3,
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  because it is essential. And if you're
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  not getting sunshine every single day,
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  it doesn't matter. Your body will be
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  susceptible and wide open to so many of
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  the threats that are out there. It's just
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  like you need oxygen. You die in four
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  minutes without oxygen. You die in five
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  or six days without oxygen. You die in
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  four minutes without oxygen. You die in
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  five or six days without water. You die
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  in a month without food. Well, that's
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  because these key minerals and elements
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  and vitamins are in the food that you
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  need. And one of the most important for
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  your immune system and your overall
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  health is vitamin D3. We have the highest
