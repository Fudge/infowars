[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.600]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:20.600 --> 00:42.120]  jones ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 31st day of August 2012 and I am
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.200]  going to attempt to focus like a laser beam and stay as calm as possible it's
[00:47.200 --> 00:50.440]  just when I start covering a story hundreds of other data points come in
[00:50.440 --> 00:54.880]  and I want to try to break down why I know something why I think something why
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.560]  I believe something why I predict something and it's just impossible to
[00:59.560 --> 01:03.800]  do but we try our best here and I want to thank you all for joining us
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.160]  colonel lieutenant colonel Anthony Schaefer will be joining us to talk
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.520]  about the Middle East the word of an Iran attack as an October surprise the
[01:13.520 --> 01:16.920]  end of Posse common taught us and so much more he's one of the whistleblowers
[01:16.920 --> 01:21.480]  of the fact that they were able to kill bin Laden not once but twice with him in
[01:21.480 --> 01:28.080]  their sights in 2001 and were ordered not to pull the trigger with the drones
[01:28.080 --> 01:40.680]  why is that because Al Qaeda ladies and gentlemen Al Qaeda is a globalist
[01:40.680 --> 01:48.360]  creation it is protected by the globalist on every front so lieutenant
[01:48.360 --> 01:55.080]  colonel Schaefer will be joining us coming up in the second hour and then
[01:55.080 --> 02:01.200]  congressman Walter Jones who has been valiantly trying to move forward with
[02:01.200 --> 02:05.320]  legislation that will commence impeachment of Obama or any other
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.760]  president if they try to put our military under foreign command duh that's a no
[02:10.760 --> 02:17.800]  brainer but that's the point we've gotten to yesterday and I want to get
[02:17.800 --> 02:26.400]  into an amazing report out of the Indianapolis newspaper where they admit
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.240]  that the black helicopter drills with the police in the city or the police are
[02:31.240 --> 02:35.760]  involved are practicing going up against the American people so more
[02:35.760 --> 02:41.160]  seditious anti-constitutional treason because the bankers are planning
[02:41.160 --> 02:46.080]  something big they didn't get a hundred
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.160]  I see my mind can't even wrap itself around the numbers the 1.4 billion
[02:53.160 --> 03:01.200]  rounds of ammo because they want to take us for long walks in the park and hold
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.640]  our hand we have been captured by foreign banks they have bragged about this
[03:05.640 --> 03:11.520]  fact all over the news in fact guys will you reprint me the article banks bragged
[03:11.520 --> 03:14.240]  they've conquered the US and Europe because I want to be able to actually
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.880]  list some of the news articles to people instead of just playing that same video
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.800]  clip over and over again where they say they've conquered us and now they're
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.920]  getting ready for a further implosion to poses the saviors and bring in more
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.800]  control that's the name of the game with tyrants and whatever they're
[03:31.800 --> 03:38.240]  planning is so horrible they expect the state legislatures to rebel and that's
[03:38.240 --> 03:43.120]  in the governor's counsel documents that's in the John Warner Defense
[03:43.120 --> 03:50.040]  Authorization Act documents that that this battle plan is shut up to go after
[03:50.040 --> 03:54.280]  the American people so we're gonna be breaking that down now look I don't know
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.680]  of guests like Steve quail who I believe his heart is good and he's you know
[03:59.680 --> 04:03.280]  covered some things that sounded wild in the past that came true but he's also
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.360]  you know before said that the flu you know this is it the flu is gonna you
[04:07.360 --> 04:11.160]  know absolutely spreading me a pandemic and that didn't materialize by the grace
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.640]  of God but the media was hyping it too is this big pandemic and you know
[04:15.640 --> 04:19.360]  Governor Ridge can issue fake terror alerts Bush could do it Obama's been
[04:19.360 --> 04:26.720]  caught doing it it's it's no big deal but I really had an epiphany this
[04:26.720 --> 04:34.120]  morning realizing that the gun is to our head and so we should be upset about
[04:34.120 --> 04:38.520]  that we can debate all day when the system will pull the trigger politically
[04:38.520 --> 04:44.800]  into a new hot war against liberty but we're already in it we're already being
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.080]  told we've been conquered by foreign banks that's my point they're not going
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.800]  to need to conquer us they've already conquered us and now they want to
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.200]  really clamp down well they're right back
[04:59.280 --> 05:04.160]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.480]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[05:08.480 --> 05:12.760]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[05:12.760 --> 05:17.040]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.560]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.640]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[05:24.640 --> 05:29.200]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.880]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I

[09:10.800 --> 09:16.360]  Laden two separate times when he was running Stratus Ivy and able danger
[09:16.360 --> 09:21.120]  operations and why he thinks that's the case we're going to talk to Lieutenant
[09:21.120 --> 09:26.320]  Colonel Anthony Schaefer about all of those issues coming up in the second
[09:26.320 --> 09:31.560]  hour today and then Congressman Walter Jones on his legislation to begin
[09:31.560 --> 09:37.720]  impeachment of any presidents not just Obama who try to put our military under
[09:37.720 --> 09:43.840]  UN or NATO command saying that we get our orders that our country is run by that
[09:43.840 --> 09:50.040]  our military industrial complex is run by the UN and NATO so that is all coming
[09:50.040 --> 09:56.400]  up today I am going to attempt here to calmly go over the most important news
[09:56.400 --> 10:06.760]  and know the most important news is not the bizarre speech that one of my
[10:06.760 --> 10:13.440]  favorite actors Clint Eastwood gave and the and I could tell you why the speech
[10:13.440 --> 10:18.760]  came off a little strange the kind of being inside media and having a bird's
[10:18.760 --> 10:21.840]  eye view of it but I would imagine a lot of you picked up on it but I will not be
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.600]  delusional here just because I like Clint Eastwood and say that I think the
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.160]  speech went well it did not go well but see that's a fun radio topic that's the
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.920]  kind of thing that would get a bunch of ratings for the show and I've got MSNBC
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.680]  saying it's racist to say that Obama plays enough golf to try to become a
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.960]  professional golfer they claim that's racist just like they said if you don't
[10:45.960 --> 10:49.440]  like government-run health care you don't like black people it's like hey I
[10:49.440 --> 10:57.280]  don't want a cup of tea I want a cup of coffee and they go that's racist you go
[10:57.280 --> 11:01.480]  how they go just is hey I don't want the TSA to stick their hands down my pants
[11:01.480 --> 11:08.200]  oh that's racist hey I don't like you know traffic well that's that's racist I
[11:08.200 --> 11:13.960]  mean this is I mean political correctness has now reached a new level so
[11:13.960 --> 11:19.800]  we're gonna get into that article is up at infowars.com prisonpunna.com
[11:19.800 --> 11:28.600]  Limbaugh it's now racist according to MSNBC to say that Obama plays so much
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.960]  golf and takes so many vacations that he ought to try out for professional golf
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.440]  and that that's been said about basketball and then professional players
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.360]  said look he's not that good and then they got criticized of course
[11:43.360 --> 11:49.000]  fellow was black to criticized Obama in the first case so you know they had
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.480]  trouble saying he was racist but this new system of just no criticism of
[11:53.480 --> 11:57.360]  government or you're an extremist you're a racist it's amazing we're gonna get
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.400]  into that out in California multiple cases of cops beating women in front of
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.640]  everyone for no reason to death stomping out their throats stomping out their
[12:08.640 --> 12:12.400]  heads just like that poor homeless guy begging for daddy as they kill him over
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.920]  20 minutes and again the police need to get in trouble for this if you want to
[12:17.920 --> 12:23.040]  go be a tough guy go join a jujitsu club or a boxing club and go get in the ring
[12:23.040 --> 12:26.240]  with guys that want to pound people's brains out as well first they want to
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.840]  fight men not not women or or or or homeless people that weigh 120 pounds
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.240]  that aren't resisting you and again I'm not saying all police are bad but you've
[12:36.240 --> 12:42.880]  got to criticize this type of garbage when it's going on it's something that
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.840]  absolutely has to be done Chris I know you gave me that Eisenhower quote I
[12:46.840 --> 12:51.960]  sent you but I lost it here in my stacks will you just reprint me that off the
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.520]  off the email or I am I sent you thank you thank you very much I'll never find
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.920]  it in the hundred plus articles that are here in front of me I put it somewhere
[12:58.920 --> 13:04.400]  so I want to read that the reason I bring up police before I get into the
[13:04.400 --> 13:07.880]  really big stories here today and that is the military and another article
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.400]  training to take on the American people and this buildup of weapons and
[13:12.400 --> 13:19.880]  checkpoints and billion 400 million rounds of ammo before I get into that and
[13:19.880 --> 13:26.040]  talk about what is the big event that's clearly being being prepared I want to
[13:26.040 --> 13:32.320]  talk about the police first we talk about the police a lot here because if
[13:32.320 --> 13:40.720]  tyranny comes to our door it will come in a uniform and if a tyranny manifests
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.440]  itself a hot aggressive tyranny we're already in a soft tyranny it will be the
[13:45.440 --> 13:54.400]  police that will face the brunt of the societal hate and the physical danger
[13:54.400 --> 14:01.640]  you see every time I listen to radio or watch TV or or at a family's house or
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.600]  something and see a sporting event all they do is say let's take time out with
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.480]  this Labor Day coming up or this Memorial Day or 4th of July whatever the
[14:10.480 --> 14:14.680]  holiday is and thank our troops because we wouldn't be free if it wasn't for them
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.360]  and by extension they say let's thank our police we wouldn't be free if it
[14:19.360 --> 14:28.000]  wasn't for them and to analyze it number one it's a propaganda empty thing if I
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.600]  heard the radio host like I heard on XM this morning on two different channels
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.360]  I was listening to rock and roll and then I was listening to heavy metal
[14:37.360 --> 14:43.560]  driving in and on two different channels they had people reading talking
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.440]  points thanking the military and it's just meant to make you when you hear the
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.400]  military think just fall down and start robbing thank the military they want to
[14:52.400 --> 14:55.560]  launch wars thank the military they want to run checkpoints on your highway
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.160]  thank the military there's no discussion of how they're taking their death
[14:59.160 --> 15:04.440]  benefits for 13 years now when you put money out of your check to get life
[15:04.440 --> 15:11.480]  insurance they signed deals in 99 to take your death benefits almost all
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.880]  veterans when the man or woman dies the widow or widower gets no money see if you
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.880]  really cared about the troops you'd say we need to indict these big insurance
[15:21.880 --> 15:26.520]  company heads that met with the Pentagon and and got them to give them a letter
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.320]  letting them steal it like that makes it okay okay I have a letter to rob banks
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.960]  oh sure here you go since you're the big mega banks that own the insurance
[15:35.960 --> 15:41.880]  companies will let you take over a trillion dollars of people's money or
[15:41.880 --> 15:47.240]  you know if I heard talk show hosts say hey they shouldn't be using DU remember
[15:47.240 --> 15:53.920]  the troops it's gonna kill them 20 years down the road no it is a centralized
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.560]  propaganda arm when you turn on television and you're in a hotel room and
[15:59.560 --> 16:02.760]  this is happening to me and it's only pretty much watch television when I'm
[16:02.760 --> 16:06.360]  in a hotel room for five hours waiting for some TV shoot you know waiting on
[16:06.360 --> 16:09.640]  call to go down and do some do some interview in the field or something with
[16:09.640 --> 16:12.600]  Ventura or whatever I'll be sitting there for five six hours watching
[16:12.600 --> 16:15.880]  television and it's just every channel propaganda different anti-family
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.640]  messages anti-liberty messages that's not a good society that's not a good sign
[16:20.640 --> 16:27.160]  every cartoon I watch that's got military in it the UN runs America the UN
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.400]  fights the aliens that invade I mean you see it we're all being bathed in
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.360]  propaganda so that's the sign we're not in a society going in the right
[16:36.360 --> 16:44.960]  direction so when I hear all this pro cop propaganda it means pro police state
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.800]  pro federalized pro cop at school talking to your nine-year-old about what's in
[16:50.800 --> 16:55.640]  your medicine cabinet not local controlled police helping people and
[16:55.640 --> 17:00.280]  really going after bad guys aggressively that's not what happens crime is
[17:00.280 --> 17:06.240]  managed into crack districts and prostitution districts okay the system
[17:06.240 --> 17:11.560]  launders the money it runs it that's the way the world works so I refuse to live
[17:11.560 --> 17:23.400]  in the naive system now why am I talking about the police here I was in a huge
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.840]  and I'm not even gonna say the name of the place huge gunshot probably the
[17:27.840 --> 17:33.760]  biggest in Austin Texas where I live bigger than McBrides but it's mainly a
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.480]  place that sells to the police state police you name it about 80% of their
[17:39.480 --> 17:45.920]  businesses police so I'm in there yesterday and I'm buying a bunch of ammo
[17:45.920 --> 17:53.040]  I'm buying a Russian made semi-auto AK because it's such a great gun and I was
[17:53.040 --> 17:58.160]  buying a 50 caliber rifle so I'm in there buying a 50 caliber rifle semi-auto
[17:58.160 --> 18:04.040]  Barrett tactical short barrel because it's something I just need to have it's
[18:04.040 --> 18:12.200]  and it's important to have that and I'm in there and even before I started buying
[18:12.200 --> 18:17.160]  guns there were police in there and everybody that worked there was shaking
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.200]  my hand were listeners and then there was a chef in there from one of the
[18:21.200 --> 18:27.040]  local restaurants and I mean everyone was a listener and the cops were looking
[18:27.040 --> 18:31.640]  at me and and and it really freaked me out the police were acting like they
[18:31.640 --> 18:37.680]  were scared of me and I don't like that I'm not some some weird insecure person
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.640]  that once people look at me and what you like they're scared I found it very
[18:41.640 --> 18:48.040]  disconcerting but the police were looking at me wide-eyed and there were
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.760]  Austin SWAT team guys in there they were the only ones we were leaving with this
[18:51.760 --> 18:57.440]  huge shopping cart of ammo and I was busy opening the doors for the guy they
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.800]  were looking at us and and I guess halfway in awe but also trying to
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.320]  stare us down or whatever and it really and these were obviously desk jockeys
[19:06.320 --> 19:09.800]  they weren't the regular SWAT team guys I'm not knocking them but you know I mean
[19:09.800 --> 19:12.840]  one of these guys look like he had two spare tires around him they had the red
[19:12.840 --> 19:16.120]  SWAT patches and all that and they were obviously the bureaucrats because they're
[19:16.120 --> 19:22.480]  they're buying ammo and guns and and I walked out and Matt Williams was there
[19:22.480 --> 19:26.360]  Shane Stoner was there with me and we're getting some stuff for them you know a
[19:26.360 --> 19:31.960]  new episode of the gun show brothers and arms and I'm sitting there and Matt's
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.480]  like yeah you you saw right they were trying to stare us down and it just it
[19:37.480 --> 19:43.840]  was so bizarre it was so it was like a gang or something but the police he was
[19:43.840 --> 19:48.600]  like an old Western you know where the gangs taken over the town and
[19:48.600 --> 19:52.800]  Clint Eastwood walks in and high planes drifter or something and goes over to
[19:52.800 --> 19:58.320]  the bar I mean it was unbelievable I'm gonna talk about the psychology when we
[19:58.320 --> 20:03.720]  get back the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[20:03.720 --> 20:08.440]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is

[24:14.480 --> 24:22.080]  look it's very simple in every culture when corrupt interests take over they
[24:22.080 --> 24:25.200]  turn the police and military against the people you know that about North
[24:25.200 --> 24:31.640]  Korea about Mexico about almost every country in the world that run from free
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.760]  to totally enslaved the more military the more police on the streets the more
[24:36.760 --> 24:41.440]  bowing down to military and police the more of a fascist or communist or
[24:41.440 --> 24:45.840]  authoritarian country you're in and I was just talking to because I was busy
[24:45.840 --> 24:48.600]  looking at guns I was just talking to Matt Williams he said no most the cops in
[24:48.600 --> 24:51.480]  there were you know coming over and talking to him and saying they like to
[24:51.480 --> 24:55.400]  show and I know all the people you know selling us guns in there were listeners
[24:55.400 --> 24:57.920]  they were telling me about the show and what they heard what they liked and
[24:57.920 --> 25:02.560]  things like that but I was in this place you know getting a 50 caliber rifle and
[25:02.560 --> 25:09.400]  some ammo and stuff there's one of the armor piercing incineraries you can't
[25:09.400 --> 25:12.920]  get these anymore they don't manufacture these anymore but I thought I'd get them
[25:12.920 --> 25:15.840]  because they were cheaper than regular ball ammo it's gonna be great on the
[25:15.840 --> 25:19.840]  show and we shoot these through metal plates these came from a B-52 it says
[25:19.840 --> 25:24.560]  only use in B-52s on the on the casing of it back when B-52s had four of those
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.280]  in the back this is from the early 60s that's when they phased out 450 cows and
[25:29.280 --> 25:35.080]  went to what 20 millimeter cannons in the tail gun of a B-52 anti-aircraft but
[25:35.080 --> 25:38.920]  I mean you gotta love America that's what the Second Amendment is all about is
[25:38.920 --> 25:46.360]  the government doesn't have the monopoly of force we the people do and it's a
[25:46.360 --> 25:51.880]  beautiful thing but Matt was correcting me they it looked like an Austin
[25:51.880 --> 25:59.480]  uniform and it said swat and red but what County was it what County was it you
[25:59.480 --> 26:03.840]  weren't sure but it wasn't Austin said burlock or something the point is we're
[26:03.840 --> 26:06.880]  walking out and I guess they've been talking about the guns we were getting
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.960]  and they were just staring at us with this shopping cart and looking at us you
[26:11.960 --> 26:19.120]  know staring us down and even if you are the toughest guy in the room even if
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.200]  you've got you know everything behind you you know you're the toughest MAA MMA
[26:24.200 --> 26:28.880]  fighter in the world your your Chuck Norris whatever the case is staring at
[26:28.880 --> 26:33.800]  people bugging your eyes out at them trying to intimidate them is the essence
[26:33.800 --> 26:40.760]  of tyranny and my only point is I am not the enemy of the police I never have
[26:40.760 --> 26:46.960]  been I never will be and I've got to tell you on average the problems I have
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.960]  with police are young ones and that's what I've been told about police the
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.440]  problem is young ones they're new to it they're on a power trip they haven't
[26:56.440 --> 27:02.000]  experienced things yet these guys look real young and they're enjoying the fact
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.480]  that they can throw their weight around well it's that type of mindset that can
[27:06.480 --> 27:14.680]  be used by social engineers and tyrants to bring in corruption and there's
[27:14.680 --> 27:22.720]  nothing cool about corruption bondage in slavery is a very very sad thing and we
[27:22.720 --> 27:26.120]  do have a charity in this country and I'm going to cover it when we come back
[27:26.120 --> 27:31.120]  from break the latest developments but I want to challenge everyone to go read
[27:31.120 --> 27:37.040]  the cover issue article that was in our free newspaper free on the streets of
[27:37.040 --> 27:44.080]  Austin for sale at cost in bulk until we sold out in 36 hours at info wars.com
[27:44.080 --> 27:49.080]  but it was the cover story but it's also online so all of you can read it
[27:49.080 --> 27:54.920]  bankers declare US and Europe conquered and it has news clips financial times of
[27:54.920 --> 28:01.160]  London newsweek time magazine economist magazine council on foreign relations
[28:01.160 --> 28:07.040]  video clips of world leaders like Herman von Roope out of the EU CFR
[28:07.040 --> 28:15.520]  documents Al Gore speeches UN blueprints on their own website it's got 14 no no
[28:15.520 --> 28:23.320]  I'm sorry 15 16 links in the bibliography mainstream news does not
[28:23.320 --> 28:30.760]  have articles folks with bibliographies we do bragging that they've conquered us
[28:30.760 --> 28:34.320]  and that they're going to shut off our power incrementally and shut off our
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.280]  jobs to make us dependent on them so I want to be friends with the police and
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.520]  military you're Americans too it's the same thing people in other countries I
[28:42.520 --> 28:47.560]  want you to be free I want you to live well and prosper I want you to have great

[29:07.120 --> 29:14.000]  neck you know justice is served but I do not want to sit here and watch you beat
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.480]  homeless people and women to death because you think that's tough and I
[29:18.480 --> 29:22.680]  don't want to watch police departments protect those type of people and I don't
[29:22.680 --> 29:26.600]  want to watch police going around bugging their eyes out at people because
[29:26.600 --> 29:31.800]  as a man I find that type of North Korean police activity threatening and it
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.600]  gets my hackles up I'm just like a dog somebody's aggressive towards me I get

[35:34.480 --> 35:40.240]  that said we put the I've got all the technicals now we put the magazine out
[35:40.240 --> 35:50.040]  at almost 1,100 locations in Austin as a beta test we plan to have it be a
[35:50.040 --> 35:54.080]  system where people become franchisees in the next six months or so we're
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.760]  setting all that up got a lot of requests incredible feedback of people
[35:58.760 --> 36:02.160]  calling us emailing us established publishers you name it so it's
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.560]  definitely a big success by the grace of God your support out there to have a
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.560]  print version that's internet kill switch proof or resistant it's not like
[36:12.560 --> 36:16.400]  you know watches aren't really waterproof they're water resistant because
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.360]  if they go down too deep past 3,000 feet most of them will break it's like submarines
[36:20.360 --> 36:23.720]  aren't waterproof they're water resistant it's it's it's it's internet
[36:23.720 --> 36:29.320]  kill switch resistant is why we're going to this as a backup system but the
[36:29.320 --> 36:35.360]  point is we printed 50,000 for the streets of Austin but they got a copy
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.600]  over here and then we printed another 20,000 to mail out to listeners that we
[36:40.600 --> 36:49.120]  would sell in bulk at cost well it turns out that we sold out in in just I don't
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.200]  know 10 or 15 hours or so the first 20,000 so we printed another 20,000
[36:54.200 --> 37:02.240]  that's 90,000 and those sold out in less than a day as well so 36 hours 36,000
[37:02.240 --> 37:10.080]  got sold because we held back roughly 4,000 so that we could you know when we
[37:10.080 --> 37:13.640]  come out with subscriptions next month you could get the first issue for free
[37:13.640 --> 37:16.800]  and the next 12 and we're going to launch that next month the next few weeks
[37:16.800 --> 37:19.520]  to be able to sign up for a subscription not just buy them in bulk
[37:19.520 --> 37:23.600]  you don't have to keep reordering each time but we're all going to offer them
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.000]  in bulk at cost well we then and I learned that folks were told this on
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.480]  Monday I was never told till last night that about 60 not well not about 66
[37:34.480 --> 37:39.560]  locations in Austin refused them because it's politically incorrect I mean
[37:39.560 --> 37:46.200]  it's evil to want Liberty which is fine I expected more 66 locations so it
[37:46.200 --> 37:52.800]  comes out to about 3,500 magazines that we have so those are up for sale right
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.960]  now in groups of 10 so everybody can get a chance to get them and I did lose
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.160]  money also and then I'm done talking about this I just guesstimated how much
[38:02.160 --> 38:05.160]  it would cost to ship these and then up the price a little because I was still
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.360]  losing money I thought well we thought we could ship these out media mail it
[38:09.360 --> 38:15.400]  doesn't let you ship out magazines with advertisements post office rules with at
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.480]  media mail cost so every magazine cost me three dollars to ship out we lost
[38:19.480 --> 38:25.280]  about $20,000 but I honored it of course doing that and of course so maybe up in
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.720]  the price of these 3,500 will come some way towards recouping that but it's not
[38:28.720 --> 38:33.440]  that big a deal our goal is to get the word out period so info warshop.com

[39:49.320 --> 39:59.640]  enough let me now get into the big issue here I was exercising this morning
[39:59.640 --> 40:06.680]  before I got to work and I'm driving in the car early this morning earlier this
[40:06.680 --> 40:11.880]  morning and I hear a Genesis talk show host Joyce Riley you know talking about
[40:11.880 --> 40:15.960]  oh my gosh my listeners are so scared you know Steve Quayle on the Alex Jones
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.400]  show you know he was talking about in the next three months at Marshall laws
[40:20.400 --> 40:24.960]  coming it's gonna happen and people are so scared and she was like you know
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.040]  there are the preparations of the 1.4 billion bullets and the checkpoints and
[40:29.040 --> 40:32.960]  the urban warfare drills but she said that's been going on a long time it is
[40:32.960 --> 40:36.720]  building up to a head but you know she's called Steve I didn't know this
[40:36.720 --> 40:40.120]  heard her saying this and once he'm on so I forgot to tell you guys I just thought
[40:40.120 --> 40:43.640]  of this just now in relation this bigger story I'm gonna cover you call Steve
[40:43.640 --> 40:47.240]  try to get him back on sometime next week but also ask him if he's gotten
[40:47.240 --> 40:50.520]  messages from Joyce to go on her morning show here on Genesis I'm gonna do that
[40:50.520 --> 40:54.200]  before I forget I'd do so much planning just right here on the air it's total
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.560]  transparency but my necessities we just don't have enough time in the day there's
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.600]  so much to do it's coming little details and and I too have seen the comments
[41:03.600 --> 41:06.880]  pouring in the guys that give me the emails I mean that that interview really
[41:06.880 --> 41:11.960]  freaked people out and that's why I said yesterday I think Steve believes what
[41:11.960 --> 41:20.640]  he's saying but you know I don't think that they're gonna go to full martial law
[41:20.640 --> 41:24.800]  or use foreign troops in the next three months and that's not criticizing him you
[41:24.800 --> 41:27.640]  know I'm allowed to say when he was on air a couple days ago I was like are you
[41:27.640 --> 41:33.440]  sure Steve now I know you know he talked about drones two years ago getting GPS
[41:33.440 --> 41:37.040]  coordinates of your front door people didn't even believe at first that they
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.680]  were getting GPS coordinates the front doors turn out they were then it they're
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.080]  admitted now they fed that into drones that's been in the news and they're
[41:44.080 --> 41:52.680]  using even reapers and predators against rural communities so reality's gotten so
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.120]  crazy you can't criticize Steve quail for believing they're gonna pull the
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.600]  trigger on the next three months because and here's the epiphany I had the gun
[42:01.600 --> 42:08.280]  is at our head we already have TSA checkpoints in every state told you that
[42:08.280 --> 42:11.680]  was coming years ago because I saw him say it on c-span they're already in
[42:11.680 --> 42:15.120]  thousands of different job types demanding TSA approval before you can
[42:15.120 --> 42:21.000]  have a job in loading docks at shopping malls now I mean this is you know when
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.680]  you buy nor sell or work they're coming out with face-scanning cameras to buy and
[42:25.680 --> 42:29.880]  sell everywhere they've got face-scanning cameras everywhere Austin has them
[42:29.880 --> 42:37.000]  license plate readers they are Homeland Security two years ago approached my dad
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.800]  a patient he had for a decade got treated to him and his mother and said we
[42:42.800 --> 42:46.360]  like to recruit you you'll get paid for Homeland Security well what do I do well
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.680]  you spy on your patients well I mean that's totally illegal folks no patient
[42:50.680 --> 42:57.200]  doctor privilege all that my dad thought it was a setup and I said don't go to the
[42:57.200 --> 43:00.320]  meetings just find out more and then he talked to the other doctors that work
[43:00.320 --> 43:03.760]  for him the other dentist they got visits at home they talked to dentist
[43:03.760 --> 43:06.720]  almost every dentist got a Homeland Security visit in the town where I live
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.120]  folks this is a giant infrastructure takeover finding out who will be spies
[43:11.120 --> 43:14.840]  who'll be collaborators just because Americans want to be friendly and want
[43:14.840 --> 43:18.320]  to work with the system and oh Homeland Security must be good no it
[43:18.320 --> 43:22.920]  didn't good it's been taken over it ships guns into Mexico to blame the
[43:22.920 --> 43:26.920]  Second Amendment it allows the mega banks to steal trillions of dollars and
[43:26.920 --> 43:31.880]  the veterans death benefits I mean yeah this is a lawless group I don't like
[43:31.880 --> 43:37.480]  risking my life to fight them but it's got to be done so I was thinking about
[43:37.480 --> 43:43.520]  all that and all the different angles of it and just had the realization that we
[43:43.520 --> 43:51.240]  are already so deep into this and that the system doesn't
[43:51.240 --> 44:06.600]  want to have big giant jumps and big giant events and big giant you know
[44:06.600 --> 44:12.240]  foreign troops nukes going off things like that unless they have to and yes
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.080]  if we were ever marching on Washington and a bunch of states woke up and the
[44:16.080 --> 44:18.760]  counties and cities woke up to the criminality and there was a mass
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.840]  awakening like against Chilchescu and Romania the globalist would set off nukes
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.960]  that's in their battle plan from our research and blame it on patriot groups
[44:27.960 --> 44:32.960]  and try to organize the military against the states and their entire battle plan
[44:32.960 --> 44:38.800]  is organized in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and everywhere else it
[44:38.800 --> 44:49.360]  is all set up and established pointed at the states pointed at the people pointed
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.000]  at the legislatures and that's why they threatened when the state of Texas said
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.720]  we're gonna enforce the law and not let DSA grab people's genitals they said
[44:57.720 --> 45:01.400]  we're gonna have an F-16 blockade I mean you know don't forget they said an air
[45:01.400 --> 45:07.920]  embargo enforced by the US Air Force when Rick Perry said we might secede as a
[45:07.920 --> 45:13.520]  joke the surrounding states all went on alert that was not in the news but I
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.360]  confirmed that from five different sources I mean ask people in the
[45:18.360 --> 45:24.240]  military that are in the National Guard in Oklahoma in Louisiana in Arkansas in
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.320]  New Mexico they even had Colorado ready to come in even though they don't really
[45:28.320 --> 45:38.040]  border us I mean that happened so the entire architecture of North com you name it
[45:38.040 --> 45:47.880]  is set up and is rigged and is pointed at the legitimate nullification states
[45:47.880 --> 45:50.880]  rights 10th Amendment that the states come in as a check on the federal
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.320]  government if it gets out of control or gets infiltrated or gets taken over by
[45:54.320 --> 45:57.320]  foreign powers and the founders all talked about this this was the big
[45:57.320 --> 46:01.520]  threat you don't have foreign born as president you don't have foreign born
[46:01.520 --> 46:06.760]  back at that time you know in in in in higher positions because governments
[46:06.760 --> 46:12.240]  were infiltrating back then that happened a lot in Europe and so all of this is
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.120]  going on I mean the preparations the military drills I've got new articles
[46:16.120 --> 46:20.720]  here today the admissions that Homeland Security is now not for Al Qaeda who
[46:20.720 --> 46:24.800]  they say the Pentagon now runs with NATO and they're saying Al Qaeda is good and
[46:24.800 --> 46:28.600]  the council on foreign relations last month or earlier this month actually
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.320]  was in was it was their new issue the first of 1st of August it's August 31st
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.640]  but still August not thinking of as if we're in September I'm already thinking
[46:37.640 --> 46:42.760]  out in October November but the point is is that all of this is going on I mean I
[46:42.760 --> 46:49.160]  had Larry Grathwald you know the psychologist Army Ranger veteran FBI
[46:49.160 --> 46:56.560]  infiltrator of the weatherman and he's he hasn't heard all that stuff I talked to
[46:56.560 --> 46:59.480]  him off air he didn't hear what we were saying and he's saying I think they may
[46:59.480 --> 47:02.840]  stage something to take over they've got it all lined up I don't see them
[47:02.840 --> 47:08.480]  turning loose of power everyone who's got their ear to the ground or their
[47:08.480 --> 47:12.800]  finger to the wind who or who has the pulse of things knows that there's
[47:12.800 --> 47:19.560]  problems and I want to quote what Eisenhower said shortly before he left
[47:19.560 --> 47:23.480]  office and he said similar things in his farewell address if an American wants
[47:23.480 --> 47:28.040]  to preserve his dignity and his equality as a human being he must not bow his
[47:28.040 --> 47:33.080]  neck to any dictatorial government like the Eisenhower I mean that's what
[47:33.080 --> 47:38.720]  America is show when bureaucrats get mad at me or cops feel threatened by me
[47:38.720 --> 47:43.560]  listen to you don't like America because this is what it looks like and I'm not
[47:43.560 --> 47:48.760]  trying to brag about my lineage but may flower both sides Texas independence I
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.240]  won't even get into it all it's illustrious don't shake your finger at me
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.560]  and tell me I'm anti-American and I need to get out of the country when I talk
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.480]  like George Washington I talked like Thomas Jefferson that's who I want to
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.320]  be like that's who I admire that's what I'm for that's what the flag symbolizes
[48:06.320 --> 48:12.160]  not all this torture and tyranny and lies and I want you to join the Republic I
[48:12.160 --> 48:17.360]  want your your your ancestors to be proud of you I want you to to maintain
[48:17.360 --> 48:21.680]  your family name this is a big deal this is real this is happening the
[48:21.680 --> 48:25.920]  globalist Prague they've conquered us and they're planning something big is it
[48:25.920 --> 48:29.440]  financial collapse is it war probably both will it be in three months like
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.920]  everybody's saying I'm not saying that the police you here calling in crying the
[48:33.920 --> 48:38.000]  government documents the admissions the Fox News talking about financial
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.200]  collapse I mean this is what Larry Summers in the Washington Post is talking
[48:43.200 --> 48:50.080]  about there's another great Eisenhower quote him let me read that if if all that
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.200]  Americans want his security then go to prison they'll have enough to eat a bed
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.280]  and a roof over their heads but if an American wants to preserve his dignity
[48:57.280 --> 49:00.840]  and equality as a human being he must not bow his neck to any deferral
[49:00.840 --> 49:06.560]  government yeah there's the full quote president of Columbia University speech
[49:06.560 --> 49:13.520]  to luncheon club the Alveston Texas 1949
[49:14.600 --> 49:23.400]  amazing very very very very very very very interesting there you have page
[49:23.400 --> 49:28.920]  23 subject security yeah that's America it's not just Benjamin Franklin that
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.640]  said you give up your liberty you're gonna get slavery okay I know tyranny
[49:33.640 --> 49:39.240]  when I see it TSA checkpoints and the border is wide open basically I know
[49:39.240 --> 49:43.960]  what's going on and now there's articles in the Minneapolis Star Tribune and
[49:43.960 --> 49:51.680]  others admitting that the special operations group Fort Campbell Kentucky
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.600]  and also out of Florida and Fort Bragg are doing urban warfare confrontation
[49:56.600 --> 50:02.360]  scenarios close quarters battle with the police in simulations against people
[50:02.360 --> 50:07.000]  resisting and that's what's going to happen in the state houses try to resist
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.120]  this takeover they're going to send in the big red one and you've already got
[50:13.120 --> 50:20.720]  judges and people in Texas you know the heads of different organizations like in
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.160]  Lubbock saying we're going to resist this I mean this is horrible ladies and
[50:24.160 --> 50:29.960]  gentlemen and you've got city people in city government speaking out saying we're
[50:29.960 --> 50:33.800]  being conditioned I'm gonna read this when we come back for four martial law
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.160]  yeah that's what this is and guess who they're practicing guarding in
[50:39.160 --> 50:44.680]  Minneapolis the Federal Reserve building that's in the news and it
[50:44.680 --> 50:49.960]  remember 2009 Army dispatched in response to in the Fed protest this was
[50:49.960 --> 50:54.120]  leaked to the media that Ron Paul and myself I was in Dallas he was in Houston
[50:54.120 --> 50:58.960]  and in the Fed protest they had plainclothes army there watching us
[50:58.960 --> 51:04.920]  they're right back Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts get
[51:04.920 --> 51:08.920]  off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power folks with what's
[51:08.920 --> 51:11.960]  been going on in this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and

[53:14.560 --> 53:18.360]  what they really are incompetent line crooks that are counting on your
[53:18.360 --> 53:23.120]  ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high some have called

[53:46.400 --> 53:51.040]  one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home go watch my
[53:51.040 --> 53:56.560]  video now at 123 cover up dot com before they force me to shut it down again
[53:56.560 --> 54:09.880]  that's 123 cover up dot com we are back live ladies and gentlemen let me just
[54:09.880 --> 54:13.880]  recap this as cogently as I can because again I got thousands of data points
[54:13.880 --> 54:18.760]  come in I'm trying to paint the image I'm seeing here crystal clear it's called
[54:18.760 --> 54:23.440]  history it's repeating itself from Caesar bringing in the troops crossing the
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.200]  Rubicon taken over to third-world dictators I mean this is what's
[54:28.200 --> 54:34.040]  happening but this time there's not one dictator there's puppets so puppets
[54:34.040 --> 54:37.480]  come and go and every new puppet the agenda gets worse but something's
[54:37.480 --> 54:41.800]  happening people are waking up to puppets like Obama quicker and quicker
[54:41.800 --> 54:44.480]  they're gonna wake up to Romney who it looks like they're gonna put in there
[54:44.480 --> 54:48.640]  everything's shifting towards him right now and the system knows it's not
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.240]  working anymore and they know things are gonna get really bad because of the
[54:52.240 --> 54:56.360]  derivatives that they created and signed us on to and so they're committed
[54:56.360 --> 55:01.400]  they believe they're going to get away with this they believe they're going to
[55:01.400 --> 55:05.560]  get away with this collapse and the question is when does the deepening
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.240]  collapse get here well it's getting here every day hyperinflation QE3 they've
[55:11.240 --> 55:15.040]  been holding off on that we are in trouble if they do that we're in trouble if
[55:15.040 --> 55:20.080]  they don't do that there's no way out of this except back to the Constitution and
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.920]  Bill of Rights but things aren't gonna get better because the people that stand
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.600]  again from the crisis and who want to convert us from a free society and a
[55:28.600 --> 55:34.400]  wealthy society to a beggar society under a tiny elite they're in control and
[55:34.400 --> 55:40.000]  they are now shifting from that the training toy that they train the police
[55:40.000 --> 55:46.480]  to be authoritarian to fight al-Qaeda to the real enemy us the American people
[55:46.480 --> 55:54.760]  and my point is if they can take over with incremental slide into oppression
[55:54.760 --> 55:58.240]  that's what they want to do they're putting fluoride in our water they're
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.160]  giving us GMO they've got kids wearing RFID bracelets and face scanning to buy
[56:03.160 --> 56:07.280]  and sell in the schools they've got face scanning going in they've got TSA on the
[56:07.280 --> 56:11.400]  streets they've got their gun registration rollouts all of it's happening
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.400]  and resistance is forming and now they're saying let's restrict their speech
[56:16.400 --> 56:21.280]  on the internet let's pass cyber security that even seen at news it says
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.480]  mirrors Putin censorship let's yeah the NSA is spying on you yeah we are
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.760]  torturing people yeah we will secretly arrest you yeah we are weaponizing
[56:30.760 --> 56:36.960]  drones they'd rather just come in take over and war game a slow collapse
[56:36.960 --> 56:43.760]  dealing with us but if they see signs that there's a total mass accelerated
[56:43.760 --> 56:50.960]  viral awakening happening which we're on the verge of they will set off a nuke in
[56:50.960 --> 56:55.480]  a city in a New York minute and blame it on domestic ribs and try to bring in
[56:55.480 --> 57:00.000]  martial law and the mainstream media will go along with them because they
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.560]  want to maintain control they want to make you watch them they want to shut
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.080]  down free speech so they're the monopoly that everybody's forced to watch
[57:09.080 --> 57:13.880]  there's a perfect storm a confluence of things and everyone's got to ask
[57:13.880 --> 57:20.600]  themselves do you really want to let this happen because once liberty is gone
[57:20.600 --> 57:25.280]  once freedom and prosperity is gone it's very hard to get back I mean do we
[57:25.280 --> 57:31.360]  really want to deliver our children into this and you know you can't criticize
[57:31.360 --> 57:34.360]  somebody who thinks that they're gonna have a foreign troop takeover in three
[57:34.360 --> 57:37.600]  months because foreign troops are here because we are being prepared for that I
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.200]  don't think that's gonna happen but you can't criticize people that think it is
[57:41.200 --> 57:45.160]  because the guns to our head somebody with a gun to their head they think the
[57:45.160 --> 57:48.920]  trigger could be pulled any minute and we've all got a gun to our heads but
[57:48.920 --> 57:52.600]  instead of getting upset about that future event coming we should be upset
[57:52.600 --> 57:57.400]  right now about how far we've gone because it will go to that point someday
[57:57.400 --> 58:03.000]  if we don't turn it around now and the system is running around wild digging in
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.680]  against us right now here's the article Minneapolis military drills based
[58:06.680 --> 58:10.520]  around confrontation scenarios we'll talk about this summer colonel Schaefer
[58:10.520 --> 58:13.880]  after we get the geopolitical issues and here's the article from 09 Kurt Nemo
[58:13.880 --> 58:19.080]  army dispatched in response to in the Fed protest and they watched us in Dallas I
[58:19.080 --> 58:22.400]  let those demonstrations it's in the Obama deception and they watched Ron Paul
[58:22.400 --> 58:27.080]  and it said this out of Camp Maverick Austin Texas and other bases we have
[58:27.080 --> 58:31.320]  copies of the documents sent to us by patriots and the army responded and said
[58:31.320 --> 58:34.080]  yeah these are our documents you shouldn't have them that they said don't
[58:34.080 --> 58:37.840]  let them know your military they may kill you that's what they tell the
[58:37.840 --> 58:40.400]  military about
[58:42.240 --> 58:51.520]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network the worst drought in 50
[58:51.520 --> 58:55.560]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on

[59:00.480 --> 59:05.040]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the

[59:08.280 --> 59:12.280]  blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze
[59:12.280 --> 59:16.200]  your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from

[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.680]  not be the end of the world December 21st unless they start a nuclear war with
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.200]  Russia maybe that is their plan I've always said it would be the end of the
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.560]  world but governments digging in like it's me at the end of the world who knows
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.280]  the fruit loops running the New World Order might think little green men are
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.320]  gonna land December 31st I don't know anymore I just don't like the fact it's
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.400]  it's on I mean it's in the culture so much that my eight-year-old daughter she's
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.160]  not a yet they're gonna be eight soon is like so is it the end of the world on
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.880]  December 31st no I don't believe it is maybe the end of the world as we know
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:21.360]  it as the song goes it's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.160]  fine I started getting into this we're gonna get the Colonel Shaffer coming up
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.640]  in the next segment on a host of issues but Minneapolis military drills based
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:36.520]  around confrontation scenarios Minneapolis records clerk she's the
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.760]  clerk of records Melissa Hill tells the Star Tribune she fears people are
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.360]  being conditioned to accept a police state that's a quote as military
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.080]  exercise of the city invoke involve black Hawk helicopters based around
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.640]  confrontation scenarios continue to stir intrigue and concern and you got to
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.360]  train the special forces to go up against the American people and there
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.560]  already helping guard the opium they ship in why not ask about the exercises
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.360]  which have been ongoing all week and down down Minneapolis he'll respond to me
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.080]  it's really frightening military copters flying around our airspace in
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.120]  urban setting it's kind of conditions people to accept the police day yeah
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  before they invaded Panama for a year they did drills so the military stood
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.640]  down when they attacked as reported on Tuesday footage of the drill showed
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.080]  black Hawk black Hawk choppers hovering between skyscrapers and circling over the
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.200]  Avenue Bridge the exercises are being run by an elite military unit based in
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.960]  Florida all the US special operations command and coordination with
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.080]  Minneapolis police yeah train of police to work with the military and if I see
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.480]  one more police chief every time you see your police chief for cops on the news
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:55.520]  going civilians have been helping us you know that voice you need to call call

[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.640]  general you're not a colonel you're not any of those things and the police we're
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.120]  a pair of military organization to enforce federal edicts and you are a
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:32.840]  slime back civilian I mean that is the attitude that is not freedom that is not
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:40.640]  liberty that is not America okay end of story and they just henpeck us with
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.040]  civilian civilian civilian and now they've got the military merging with the
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.920]  police you got the police dressing like the military I mean it is a joke it is a
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:57.640]  joke and the big question is what is the giant gear up for the civil unrest all
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.560]  of it I didn't even get into earlier when I was talking about all the signs of the
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:07.840]  police state army FM 3-39 dot 40 interment resettlement operations and the

[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:20.960]  all right welcome back to another hour of info wars I'm Alex Jones we've got
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.080]  congressman Walter Jones joining us in the second half of the next hour to get
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.600]  into legislation to begin impeachment against any president that openly
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.920]  announces that the military chain of command is NATO UN president under that
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.920]  and then Congress doesn't even exist he's been officially saying that now for
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.720]  two years and letters statements and actions like we'll get Colonel Shaffer's
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.080]  take on that as well Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer is joining us here in
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:54.640]  just a moment fact he's online right now I want to get into Iran I mean is the
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.280]  attack because he's got all the sources and inside all the different scent comms
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.640]  you name it I mean I know he probably knows the latest but won't is unable to
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.960]  tell us but he can hint at that I don't think they're fully decided yet if
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.920]  there'll be a strike on Iran or it'll be covert operations you've got Al Qaeda and
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.840]  other groups openly being funded in Syria the carnage of Libya that Colonel
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.640]  Shaffer predicted the way it would go it certainly went that way handing it over
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.840]  to a bunch of jihadis thousands of missiles missing we're gonna get into
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.720]  that what does he make of this Navy seal book that I think the White House
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.360]  probably wrote and claims that it's some you know gnome to plume so they can put
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.400]  out their election propaganda what is Colonel Shaffer think about that what
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.680]  is his take on just all the different things that are happening Lieutenant
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.080]  Colonel Tony Shaffer is a highly experienced intelligence officer well
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.120]  I could have killed bin Laden repeatedly but was ordered to stand down ran
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.560]  stratus ivy able danger whistle blew to Congress successfully defeated their
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.720]  demonization campaign he's a recipient of the bronze star with 25 years of
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.840]  field experience Tony has commanded directing several key operational
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.800]  intelligence organizations in the 80s he was a counterintelligence officer and
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.440]  worked to monitor Soviet military forces visiting the United States during the
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.200]  INF Treaty well now they're just led them into NORAD and trained to fight
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.480]  American terrorists with them who needs to monitor them now when we become the
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.560]  Soviet Union now Lieutenant Colonel Shaffer transition to foreign
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.480]  intelligence I'm not even gonna go over all this humid stuff probably more
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.440]  human human experience of most people in special operations a period operation
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.040]  dark heart commas his book they tried to censor and did excise parts out of and
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.240]  that's still a best-seller out there operation dark heart bookstores
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.560]  everywhere but I gotta ask you this first okay and I want you to really because
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.600]  we're getting down to the line things are getting so crazy who knows it's a
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.120]  possibility we won't be on the radio in three months with the bunkers all my
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.040]  military and police sources that I've talked to personally not just calling
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.160]  in they're being told huge life-changing events in late October early November
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.520]  they're being told financial collapse Iran war we all know that doesn't mean
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.400]  that's going to happen but that's what they're being told the system likes to
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.000]  tell people hey we're going to war this is happening to get everybody in gear
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.680]  but all these preparations going on you know city clerks in Minneapolis shang
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.720]  it's a police state takeover they admit special operations group out of
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:26.800]  Florida is training for confrontation scenarios I've got Army manual FM 3-3
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.840]  940 that we got the army responded three months ago and said yeah it's real you
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.840]  shouldn't have it it's it's for foreign resettlement and camps but it's also for
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:41.160]  domestic the 10 regions have a process is with our social security numbers how
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.080]  to take the political people and put them in in a camp within a camp just like
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:51.920]  x-ray the 1.4 billion bullets bought in the last year the armored giant wheeled
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.960]  tanks being delivered just just government is digging in against the
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.840]  people they've announced al-qaeda is no longer the threat officially we've been
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.440]  told it's white conservative libertarian gun owners returning veterans we first
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.520]  got those documents four years ago or three and a half years ago from homelands
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.000]  from a federal marshal and from a state police officer people didn't believe it
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.920]  at the time they later admitted it was accurate I mean I'm seeing a build-up
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.160]  I've never seen this is probably let's be conservative 20 times any build-up
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:27.480]  I've ever seen in the past and so Colonel Schaefer I'm asking you we have you for
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:34.640]  the next hour or the next 50 minutes be honest with us what is going on what is
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.920]  the military telling you I mean you know yeah I understand you can't talk about
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.640]  classified stuff but I mean just be honest as a citizen what is going on and
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.960]  what should we do as citizens well one of the first things Alex I'd like to point
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:53.680]  out that this trend of essentially using the military or planning to use the
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.320]  military is not new and I know this may shock your audience but I had friends
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.960]  coming to me as early as the 90s when the Clinton White House to existed
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.880]  complaining about the fact that they had to do operational plans which were not
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.040]  against foreign adversaries which that they were actually for contingencies
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.400]  within the United States now you and I both know and I worked to testify and
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.840]  this was prohibited by the way back in 2005 regarding the issues regarding
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:25.240]  Placicumetatus I was actually prohibited by duty from testifying in front of the
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.400]  Senate Judiciary Committee on this issue this issue in September 2005 and one of
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.600]  the aspects of this obviously I think you and your audience clearly
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.480]  understand this there needs to be a separation between police actions and
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.640]  military actions the United States military was designed to be essentially
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.960]  an expeditionary unit a capability which would fight our foreign wars and I
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.440]  think what we've seen is this internal look which is again not not new I think
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:14:00.280]  what you're seeing now is a more visible I think roll out yeah roll out of
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.920]  you will but again this has been going on since the 90s and I think one of the
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:09.920]  things that every president Democrat Republican is not recognized as trend for
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.520]  what it is which essentially is the potential for the US government to
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.400]  abuse the power this is one of the things I will always say and and for your
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.160]  audience no look Walter Jones is a dear friend of mine so I want everybody you
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.720]  know truth truth and advertising here he's been one of the voices looking at
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.080]  this I mean he's a conservative and yet at the same time he's very concerned
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:33.200]  about the fact that anytime you have power you have the potential to abuse
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.520]  that power and I think that's what a lot of us are saying we all understand we
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.280]  need to have a strong military we'd have a strong ability to use that military
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.280]  to defend the United States however one of the things that I've noticed and I
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:51.080]  actually was on Fox News in July talking about the fact that DHS departmental
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.600]  Homeland Security is now incorporated and it's training now this is what the DHS
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.040]  does to train local law enforcement they have incorporated in their training the
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.400]  concept that quote-unquote freedom lovers should be looked at as potential
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.120]  terrorist organization that's a quote that's a quote and so I'm I I actually
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:18.720]  said on national TV this is insane you cannot try to disabuse yourself of the
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.560]  clear and factual evidence that the majority the vast majority of real
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.160]  terrorism attacks over the past 12 years have been perpetrated planned and
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.720]  perpetrated by radical Islamists I'm sorry that's the fact and look I have
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.440]  very dear Muslim friends who I'm still friends with on Facebook I'm involved
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.760]  with a lot of things to try to look at how we can better understand each other
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.920]  and mitigate sure well let me ask you this why are they trying because this is
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.400]  not denied they say the number one threat is domestic veterans conservatives
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.280]  libertarians who statistically had the lowest crime rate of anybody that's just
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.040]  departments own numbers it is a lie why are they rebranding off of Muslim
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:08.240]  extremists on to Americans I don't know I think the only reason I can see is that
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.160]  this gives them a boogeyman to go after within the United States and let me be
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.880]  very clear on this and I said this another radio interview Sharia law cannot
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.040]  coexist within the context of our Constitution my good friend Bruce Fine
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.040]  will tell you the same thing he studied the Constitution there's no room for an
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.640]  alternate law system to sustain itself within our bill of rights just it just
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:34.760]  can't exist with that said that the bill of rights is heavily defended by as you
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:41.720]  you and others take up arms and I mean take up a very vocal perspective on
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.680]  this and obviously the first through 10th Amendment are our ability to know
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.800]  that you had a good Friday and slip from your subconscious words are the more
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.520]  powerful weapon that you want to resort to first before you ever talk about
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.800]  physical and you're right I do assault tyrants with my words it is a weapon and
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.880]  that's the point here I think the the the Department of Security and their
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.440]  current training system is set up to actually go after anyone who exercises
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.560]  their their rights within the Constitution which to me is is insane
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:17.080]  recently and right here in Virginia down in Richmond there was a former US
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.880]  Marine Marine individual picked up because he had posted on his Facebook
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.800]  very definite I think he used the word of wanting to cut people's heads off
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.160]  because of what he perceived as their violation of the Constitution well you
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.320]  and I both know that he's not going to take a freaking axe and go shut go cut
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.760]  off somebody's head it was a figure of speech yet that got him incarcerated for
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.360]  about five days well he quoted a song saying I'm sharpening the axe yeah how
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.480]  many rappers do you know who have actually said they're going to go on kill
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.080]  cops and in many cases have actually done so so there's there's a clear
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.560]  assault on the First Amendment at this point in time and this this is one of
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.080]  those things which only those on the inside would really know their
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.080]  motivations but when you combine that when you combine this training trend by
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.200]  DHS to instruct local law enforcement to look at freedom lovers as a potential
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.240]  terrorist threat you take time and resources away from real threats that's
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.240]  my concern that's what I said several times let me ask you this question then
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.080]  what is why I mean because I looked at the numbers this is ten times the ammo
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:29.800]  DHS has bought in the previous nine years that no one has ever bought 1.4
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.560]  billion rounds of different handgun and rifle ammo for domestic operations
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:40.920]  they're buying mobile armored pillboxes for the highways I mean they're they're
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.280]  rolling everything out what what is the word what's coming well let me tell you
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.880]  something else is going and I think you guys have talked about for the drones
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.640]  we're talking about 30,000 drones being up and running by 2020 or before that
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:57.560]  really you're talking about the FAA now writing rules and I think it's something
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.560]  maybe you want to talk to Walter about when you have a model of it later you
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.000]  know that no one has looked at the constitutional issues of the use of
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.840]  drugs you have FAA which is a large bureaucracy writing rules for use
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.320]  without even any regard of why and how they're going to be used regarding the
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.200]  1st and 4th Amendment so you've got to consider that in addition to that when
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.280]  you look at the layering of capability like you point out this is a huge buy
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:28.600]  of bullets this basic militarization of the police forces one has to wonder and
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.720]  and this is for your audience and everybody should be asked a question
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:37.680]  why what threat has presented itself that requires this level of purchase have
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:43.800]  we had race riots or other riots in any major city United States we haven't we
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.840]  just went through the RNC convention one of the things that DHS said they
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.760]  justified the purchase of all these weapons is because well we think that
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.000]  there may be riots at the convention for one conventions down the next one's
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.840]  coming up next week and nobody I've talked to indicates to me that they see
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.080]  any level of 1960s radical riots as we saw in the Democrat but you couldn't use
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:11.440]  1.4 billion rounds of ammo domestically I mean that would take years to use in a
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:16.920]  full-on war literally so I don't believe any answer given by the government so
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.680]  far is sufficient to explain what they're doing and I think everybody
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.680]  should be demanding through their Congress people through their state and
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.120]  Senate representatives what the heck's going on because I can't answer that
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.800]  question Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer is our guest be sure and visit
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:38.320]  his website we'll give you that address here in just a moment let me ask you
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.360]  this I don't know if you've seen it but it's FM 3-39 dot 40 internment
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:47.840]  resettlement operations PDF we've got all these others here in front of me we've
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:54.040]  got a public document they put out on the National Guard website in multiple
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:58.240]  states saying that they are training for coordinating of cities gun
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.840]  confiscations so all this is now admitted them this is newer training I
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:07.280]  know this has gone on before and at a smaller you know cadre level now it's
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.000]  it's going on across the board everybody I know that's in the army family I have
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.360]  it's in the army they tell me that in the last three years that even mechanics
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.600]  have been trained in riot control that they're training everybody in riot
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.760]  control again I know you don't like to speculate but what are they gearing up
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.280]  for I mean to be one thing if they were getting ready with it for an Iran attack
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.280]  and they thought Iran might have some sleeper cells that's special tactical
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.400]  units you know more about that than I do but I mean I mean I'm correct you
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.840]  don't fight a few terrorist groups with 1.4 billion bullets you don't fight them
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.920]  with internment camps you don't fight them with I mean the architecture of
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:47.840]  this military buildup is for mass takeover targeting of states I've talked
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:54.640]  to army officers off record who said no whenever Rick Perry joked and said we'll
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:59.000]  we'll secede that they got the National Guard in five surrounding states on
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.840]  alert we know when they said we're not gonna the Texas legislature unanimously
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.800]  in the house said no more groping we're gonna kick the TSA out Obama said we're
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.200]  gonna have a air embargo and if you try to run it F-16s will go after you I
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.000]  mean this is the stuff that started the Civil War and I mean I know I'm ranting
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.440]  throwing these data points out at you but but this architecture for my layman
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.680]  research is it not built to suppress the states as we saw the county judge say
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:29.440]  out in Lubbock why I quote that you're very point on my Facebook a wall back
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.600]  the 10th amendment requires the states have a certain amount of
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.000]  responsibility and frankly everything you just talked about regarding riot
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.560]  control regarding riot training is all a National Guard function I went through in
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.360]  1981 basic training as a guard soldier my basic training differentiated from
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.200]  those at the federal level because I had to actually go through riot gear
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.360]  training because part of the state's duty Alex is to actually to actually do
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.480]  things which are necessary to protect the civil population so I like I do
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:05.480]  believe that they have to have a better understanding we all have to have a
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.400]  better understanding that you've got to allow the states to have that function
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.440]  every state has that responsibility it is not a federal function and so any time
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:20.360]  I see these these articles about the feds getting into riot control buying gear
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.720]  buying capability to me it's unconstitutional that is clearly a
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.720]  state level responsibility the state guardians are trying to do that and
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.880]  every governor God bless him has that responsibility it's a title 32 issue
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.160]  regarding our laws the guard is funded by through our through title 32 I came up
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.120]  to the guard the guard has a very distinctly distinctly different mission
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:46.480]  than the federal government and so when you look at this it has to be the
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.560]  states and the governors who actually call out this capability not the feds
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.320]  because the moment the feds do it they're trampling on state's rights which
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.120]  as you point out resulted in the civil war and in this case to me it's a clear
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.640]  differentiation which always falls to the state so again I have not seen
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.600]  anybody make an argument to me why the federal government should have this
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.400]  authority to come in and do quote-unquote riot control or coordinating
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.400]  cities when really already the capability exists what the state level and
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.040]  frankly it is the state's responsibility Colonel Schaefer I want to shift gears
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.320]  to international events and all the perspectives that you can give us from
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.360]  the inside on this new Navy Seal book Obama in this new movie the story
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.200]  changed a hundred times you know when you're the real guy that could have
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.000]  with your men killed bin Laden repeatedly it's been admitted and we're
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.200]  ordered to stand down so you're I mean perfect to be able to comment on this
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.320]  probably the best person out there so I want to get into those areas and the
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.400]  Iran situation but what are your colleagues saying because you know I do
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.480]  have federal sources some of them dried up because people are so scared the
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:55.200]  whistleblower persecution that's going on they are using in SA as you know to
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:01.520]  surveil the police the military FBI all of them they've been threatening ATF
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.520]  people of the exposed fast and furious I mean we're seeing authoritarianism it
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.920]  strongest in the federal government trying to not have good people follow
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.880]  their oath but what what are your colleagues that are currently in the
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.920]  military I know you still teach in the military and have those contacts are
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.360]  they concerned because from my sources they've never been more concerned and
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.400]  they say that elements of the federal government are looking at trying to take
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:33.280]  over the state start a civil war try to script you know saying domestic groups
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.240]  for the enemy really trying to bring in an authoritarian takeover all openly are
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.680]  you hearing any scuttle bottle in that area what I'm hearing is this something
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.080]  I think I encourage your audience to Google or check for themselves Senator
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.000]  Ron Wyden said some very provocative things about the classified
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.760]  implementation of the Patriot Act and so what I can tell you from what I'm
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.440]  hearing I can't tell you why but yeah everything that's communicated anything
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.720]  it's a zero one a travel to the Internet or on the phone system is being
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.040]  recorded by NSA and I don't care what General Keith Alexander says I know that
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.320]  he's been confronted on this by several reporters and he always tends to change
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.400]  the subject everything that's being communicated is being it is being
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.040]  recorded in some form that's why they opened this big Utah facility with that
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:20.440]  said there needs to be a clearer understanding of oversight of that
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.400]  system which brings me to my next point which is what you want me to talk
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.720]  about here is what's actually going on look I do believe that that power
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.200]  crops absolute power crops absolutely so you've got to have someone watching
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.400]  their watch this is where Congress comes in and has to take a much stronger role
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.520]  in exercising its oversight responsibilities we have elected officials
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.360]  elected officials by the people United States who do not have access to the
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:50.400]  very things they're funded that is a and I think Walter will be willing to tell
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.280]  you this he pays for things he votes on things and yet cannot oversee the very
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.240]  things he approves that's Congressman Walter Smith coming on later well
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.200]  just coming out a few minutes yeah excuse me yeah and I think that's one of
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:07.080]  the insanity's of the current system we have a lot of things going on in the
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.160]  federal government which people don't have clear understanding of this goes
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.080]  back what I blew the whistle on where I believe certain things happened and
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.480]  were suppressed they could have resulted in other things and regarding that a
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:23.440]  lot of folks are working very hard your digital watches and organization this
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.760]  is constantly trying to get behind the scenes and this goes to the issue of the
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:33.000]  big alone movie a zero dark 30 a judicial watch just recently uncovered four
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.160]  linear inches of documents which were quote-unquote overlooked during the
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.360]  initial review which indicates not only was the White House behind opening
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.840]  doors they were trying to shape the story to show that the current president
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.440]  was very much involved in the quote-unquote assassination of Ben Lottin
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.400]  whether you believe that to be true or not I'm not going to go into that debate
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.240]  at this point but what is not within debate what has been proven by these
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.240]  documents is that the White House opened the doors to both CIA and DOD and gave
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.360]  Miss Bigelow her Hollywood types full access which includes classified
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.280]  information to help them film this movie so totally illegal the president is
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.160]  even allowed to do that and this is on top of the other leaks which have been
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:23.880]  clearly demonstrated the doctor the Pakistani doctor Alfredi being outed
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.720]  the thing with the Yemen net being outed there's a whole series of things
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.960]  these things which have been very clearly detrimental to our defense and
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.960]  our national security and yet they continue they've happened to continue
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:41.880]  to happen and so we come to the book no easy day I'm going to tell you as best
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.720]  as I know this kid for better or for worse is very naive to what's going on
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.960]  around him I don't know him I know people who do know him and and frankly this
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.400]  seems to be all about the money apparently Alex this kid was offered
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:01.240]  one point something million dollars in advance that's a lot of money and I
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:06.440]  don't mean to sound I don't mean to sound demeaning to him but everything I'm
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.120]  hearing is that the kid walked into essentially a trap if you will my
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:16.960]  lawyer Mark Zaid is commented on us both publicly a number of times and within
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.280]  the context of what's going on he thinks his kid is probably going to get a lot
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:24.720]  of problems is the content wheel could be I don't know about the content I
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.160]  haven't seen the content of the book tell you what stay there let's break down the
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.800]  national security rules and what this book no easy day means and again they
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.040]  they wouldn't let you publish your book for a long time they grabbed it they
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.880]  destroyed a bunch of memory serves and then they let it come out later so how
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:48.440]  did this even get published through a major publisher or we'll be right back
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:56.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:04.360]  network the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:09.120]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.400]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.880]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.560]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.640]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:29.640]  supply of foods from eat foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.160]  increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your

[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.000]  count YouTube and all the rest of it that we're reaching outside of info
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.800]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com so you add it all together we're approaching eight
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.160]  nine million people a day one way or the other the system well four-year
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.120]  requests have been done by Bob Barr's group and others and it's come out we
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.640]  are being spied on by Homeland Security we are being watched they see us as a
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.560]  terrorist threat we're listed as extremist and it's it's who knows what
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.560]  they'll do to us this is a lawless foreign banking cartel that is declared
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.160]  they've captured our country and they've declared those of us that are true
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.320]  Americans and know the Bill of Rights and Constitution and don't want to be
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.600]  slaves that we're the enemy it's kind of like we're in France and the Vichy
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.160]  French have taken over and collaborated and they're saying if we don't like
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:34.600]  Hitler we're bad I have to use that analogy because if it gets much worse
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.640]  with this military occupation and the rest of it and this slow implementation of
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.960]  tyranny we're going to be in that position and they will start grabbing
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.160]  people you know they're openly trying to start censor the web CNET News has
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:52.000]  admitted we're going back to our guests that that the cyber security type
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.240]  legislation isn't pointed at protecting the internet or commerce I mean the IRS
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.520]  gives out fake tax ID numbers whoever wants them for heaven's sakes is one of
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.580]  the biggest problems it's pointed at shutting down free speech and we're
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:08.240]  seeing more and more of that so please stand up for the First Amendment and
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.600]  support our guests who've had a lot of courage you know they tried to he didn't
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.440]  talk about it but they tried to persecute him and go after him when he
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.560]  spoke out to Congress about them not letting him kill bin Laden his unit his
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.880]  group is operation operation darkheart.com is a real book that had real
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.160]  events that were proven by other separate books and insiders not a work of
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.640]  fiction that they censored in fact why don't you recap the censorship of that
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:40.080]  and then comparing that Colonel Anthony Schaefer to this new book I mean I'm no
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.520]  expert but I've never heard of a major publisher publishing something like
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.360]  this without authorization I mean they could be arrested for this I mean I
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.040]  get sent secret stuff and it goes in a shredder if it's more secret I mean I
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.280]  won't even investigate it because I know they could arrest me so anybody in
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:02.720]  media knows this anybody in media understands this and I don't believe it
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.720]  could have gotten to bookstores if somebody didn't want this out and I
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.520]  agree with what you said the White House or you were implying may have wanted
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.840]  this out and kind of set up this guy through the publisher and then he ends
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:20.240]  up getting burned. I think it's very possible I think that's one of the
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:24.120]  scenarios we've talked about actually happening because you know between you
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.920]  and me I don't think anybody would want to do something like this without some
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.480]  level of top cover and just so your audience knows I mean there's been a
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.120]  real battle inside of DoD over my book some people supported because they
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.160]  know the truth others have tried to make it go away and and on that point just to
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.000]  recap very quickly Darkheart tells the story of our one of our first shots
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.120]  going and getting Dr. Zalman Zawahiri who was hanging out a place called
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.000]  Walnut Pakistan in 2003 and for any number of bizarre reasons I won't give
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.240]  away the entire content of the book things went against this and he decided
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.160]  not to do it which obviously let a loud Zawahiri and Ben Lawd and everybody else
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.440]  to hang out in Pakistan for a long time Zawahiri is still hanging out over it. We
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.280]  did disclose within that book elements of operation able danger which was our
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:14.640]  pre-911 operation looking at going after Al-Qaeda offensively that was shut
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.320]  down right before 9-11 is that as well so that all those things are in the book
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.960]  and frankly I think there's more issues still in that book that people don't
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.880]  want to be talked about it who are still in DoD and I think that's one of the
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.120]  reasons that we'll go over the history they blocked its publishing for a while
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.560]  right then grabbed it and and I'm in a bunch of stuff we went through two
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.680]  separate reviews had to have it cleared twice and so unlike this Navy Seal we
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.000]  actually tried to cooperate from day one went through the process they gave us
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.040]  and then right at the 11th hour when one certain folks figured out oh my
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.440]  goodness this thing this book sells those things we don't like they did it
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.360]  they pulled it back they destroyed 10,000 copies as you pointed out and it was all
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:59.600]  done under the quote-unquote issue of security let me be clear with your
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.080]  audience we have a First Amendment lawsuit against DoD for the abuse of the
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.920]  First Amendment because we believe we can prove in court that everything in my
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:13.200]  book and the unredacted copy is unclassified we believe we can prove
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.200]  that and yet over a year now we have been fighting DoD for our day in court
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.880]  that's how much they're fighting because it's an embarrassing story it's not one
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.080]  they want told but this propping up the fairy tale with how Obama told it of the
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.400]  barrel at sea and they're watching it live on feeds which they admit it wasn't
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.360]  true on and on and on they want this published backing up their story they
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:39.120]  don't want your book out. Exactly so it's one of those things it's been a
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.640]  clear pattern by this White House that if they want something out they'll be the
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.440]  first to leak it it's almost as if for the New York Times as they're out
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.120]  with for classified information at the same time if you have people trying to
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.680]  come forward and tell the truth they're immediately pounced upon as you pointed
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:00.520]  out this there's been a war against whistleblowers that has been unlike any
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.720]  other in any of their administration so I think what we're seeing here is this
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.840]  this as long as that narrative that they like supports what they want to have
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.360]  people think they'll let it be leaked if there's any criticism or contrary
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.400]  information which tells the truth they don't care they will pounce on people so
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.040]  I think that's the one issue that I think everybody needs to be concerned
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:27.360]  about the truth is the truth is the truth and I think that should be what
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.040]  everybody seeks in this case and frankly this book I don't know how much of it I
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:38.880]  have not seen it yet I've only seen some reviews of it and I think this this
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.000]  narrative is going to be something I think sets the record straight but again
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.400]  it could be the record that the White House wants that straight not one which
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.720]  may reflect the total truth of the situation let me say one thing real
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:56.600]  quick a reporter named Kim Dvorak from the she writes for the for the for one
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.840]  of the the online report I'm sorry newspapers for I think I think it's
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:07.680]  the the examiner did a story back when Ben Laden was chill talking about the
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.280]  quote-unquote airy parallels between Operation Darkheart and Operation
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:17.200]  Geronimo because according to her and I can't confirm this that what we came up
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.440]  with for Operation Darkheart was actually the format used for the raid on
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.240]  Ben Laden so I can't confirm or deny that but I'm just saying go check out her
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.640]  article and read for yourself interesting now now it was shifting gears
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.480]  into the larger geopolitical situation recap because I remember you being on
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.520]  the show with with your predictions and other predictions what would happen in
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.720]  Libya what the geopolitical strategy is of wrecking that country with somebody
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:47.000]  working with the West putting in the jihadis Al Qaeda flags over major cities
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.360]  lining up black Africa and shooting them and then now what's happening in Syria
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.960]  where they had in the CFR three weeks ago came out and said quote we need Al
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:00.360]  Qaeda and news is like wow Al Qaeda is getting the job done I mean this is just
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:06.240]  amazing they're saying the TSA needs to you know take my four-year-old in the
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.640]  back room and abuse them or needs to grab my wife's breast or needs to grab
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.120]  my genitals or Ron Paul's as they tried to do in Florida a few days ago on a
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.600]  private jet they wanted to search him and his wife and check for bombs that he
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.760]  you know because he might be a threat to Mitt Romney this I mean Ron Paul's
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.960]  public video was shot of this so Ron Paul can't be trusted but Al Qaeda can be
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.200]  given 10,000 missiles 2,000 of them he's seeking a radar guided out of Libya
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.840]  that's not an issue NATO can fly Al Qaeda in to Turkey and other areas to
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:40.840]  insert them to infiltrate Assad's regime I mean this is so they can kill the
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.120]  Christians I mean how have we gotten to this point and is the military concerned
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.320]  about putting Al Qaeda into Syria and what do you think the grand plan is of
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:55.840]  this I don't think there is again grand class part of our problem as a DOD we
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.280]  don't have a global strategy one of the things that was notable at least during
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.520]  the Cold Wars we had kind of an enemy we all looked at and we understood we
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.240]  don't have that now and I think what you're seeing is chaos our military
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.560]  today is reticent and I've talked a lot of folks as you have we don't a lot of
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.560]  folks don't believe that we need to be looking at going to war we need to be
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:18.240]  looking at only using military force when necessary I think we have an
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:24.640]  overabundance of evidence that we need to be more to be step out of getting
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:29.600]  involved in local conflicts the conflict in Libya resulted in as you pointed out
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.480]  I predicted that we would see the chaos we now see that tribalism would be
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:38.280]  the the real result which is what we have we still have literally thousands of
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.280]  surface-to-air missiles missing I don't know how that's our best interest I
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.000]  don't think we've seen the end of bad consequences coming out of Libya we go
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.160]  to Syria Syria was one of those situations where I think people like
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.200]  John McCain are insane and the MBB very player are insane to be calling for
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.440]  military intervention by us as if we didn't learn our lesson from Lebanon and
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.800]  the Marine Corps bomb emissary barracks bombing in the emissary bombing back in the 80s we've
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.880]  got to be much more careful about how we involve ourselves and frankly us you
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.680]  know going allowing for Al Qaeda or the Muslim Brotherhood to take a stronger
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.880]  role against Assad is not in our best interest I think we should be looking at
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:22.320]  how we can get Assad to move along but I think he you know that the social
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:28.000]  construct the whole country of Syria is for better or worse a modern
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.320]  republic of some of some form it should I'm sorry let me strike it should be a
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:36.760]  transition into a republic right now you have a dictator in the form of Assad I
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.680]  believe if you replace Assad with a group they can transition that country
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:44.840]  you're much better off than allowing total chaos to come in the moment that
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.720]  government falls you will see another Libya and I take the consequences of
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:52.440]  this be far worse because this government has weapons of mass destruction
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:58.800]  chemical weapons and and frankly you could see an entire expansion of
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:04.520]  conflict throughout the region so I'm not for the blind use of force of us
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.320]  coming in and taking sides there we all I think would agree something needs to be
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:13.000]  done to stop the killing but dismantling of the the central government and seeing
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.720]  that military devolved into what we saw the Iraqis devolve into after we got
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.400]  rid of the Iraq government and military is not our best interest so I don't think
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.640]  we have a course we're going forward on sure Colonel Shafer you're a smart guy
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:32.320]  I mean I mean there's no doubting that and you're a gentleman and you like to
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.880]  just stick to the facts but when you say it's chaos that's from perspective of
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:43.120]  someone like you that really wants to spread 1776 worldwide you want freedom
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:48.080]  you want a fair shake for everybody you support the Bella Rides Constitution and
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.400]  so you look through that lens but I know you're not naive I mean the global is to
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.520]  brag you know the the you know the foreign corporate interests that
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:00.960]  manipulate our government that they want chaos they want a Shiite Sunni
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:07.240]  civil war they want tribalism they don't want to build up Syria they don't want
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:11.400]  to make that place a nice place just like they threw out Mosaddek and 53 and
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:17.240]  Iran and replaced him with you know tyrants they want the strategy of divide
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.320]  and conquer destabilization deindustrialization our country did have
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:27.080]  the policy in the 40s and 50s and 60s to build up the world and then it started
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:32.120]  shifting by the 70s 80s 90s and now it's wreck everything which is really kind
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.640]  of a British model I'm not saying the British run it but it's that British
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.080]  model of divide and conquer and I find it an extremely immoral and evil system
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.360]  and I see them using the Al Qaeda threat to take my liberties and that makes me
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.840]  very mad that makes me really take it personal that I can't take my children
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.120]  on trips because you know these scum want to put their hands all over them and
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.680]  I want it to stop and only this Al Qaeda myth is holding it up and I just don't
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.680]  see how we can logically say Al Qaeda are good guys I know you're not saying that
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:07.600]  and are helping bring down Assad and you know they got missiles that's okay but
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.800]  I've got to have my rights taken away and they got to have TSA at the shopping
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.320]  malls I mean I'm ranting here but I mean come on I think there is a method to
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.720]  this madness is destabilization well the whole TSA thing is out of control let
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.320]  me be very clear I go to New York very often one of my favorite ways to travel
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:29.840]  is an anthrax excel and let me tell you the anthrax security folks have done a
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.520]  credible job for years and they do random searches they profile oh my god
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:38.560]  what a word to say and they look for people to be you know some anomaly that
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.640]  to actually pull somewhere aside and talk to them imagine that and they have
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:46.840]  dogs bomb sniffing dogs they run them around I have no problem with that and
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:51.520]  yet for some bizarre reason TSA wants a piece of that action they want to get
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.480]  involved why there's no reason it's a secure prospect anthrax knows what it's
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.720]  doing you travel without having to go through owner of searches and yet
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.800]  somehow TSA wants to get in this is the problem with what we're faced with right
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.360]  now we have an out of control bureaucracy frankly again Congress is not
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:11.440]  doing its job the way Congress should deal with this is cutting back the
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:15.480]  African TSA budget and frankly asking them to account for everything they're
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.400]  doing they are they are truly you know not profiling people I don't believe
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.720]  TSA is making anybody safer by doing this charade of looking at the diapers
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.080]  of four-year-olds and I think this is one of the things we as Americans have
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.760]  to take a very hard look at and yeah the the whole idea of al-Qaeda being good
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:38.040]  one day and bad the other isn't saying if you have radicals who are out to be
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:43.520]  stabilized or see a Muslim caliphate come to you know come to for which they're
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:47.040]  not our friends so you have to understand the larger picture here I think
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:54.720]  everybody does and we cannot accept onerous security in our own borders for
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.800]  an enemy who frankly is there but not as monolithic as we might make him out
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:04.840]  well Eisenhower said if you want security go live in a prison right and
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:09.560]  that's the thing so I and again let's look at the threat how many attacks have
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.720]  come over the past ten years where have they come from and look at how those
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:17.640]  were perpetrated we had the underwear bomber part two almost were perpetrated
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:23.680]  of course the administration leaked that to the detriment of now now the al-Qaeda
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.160]  guys know how we figured it out so that came from an external source there's
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:32.360]  been other radicals like Major Hassan and Nidal Hassan who have been radicalized
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.720]  that is an active threat that we need to look at and it turns out though they
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.480]  knew that he was talking to these people and let him continue for two years
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:46.160]  right exactly so that's my point we need to look at where we know the threats to
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.440]  be not to look at four-year you know four months old four-year-olds diapers
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:56.040]  it's insane we've got to get past this perception again I think the government
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.440]  there's a lot of things to create the perception of security what in an
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:04.680]  effect obviously they have not protected us by against the real sure but it's more
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:09.320]  than security theater it's a power grab I think in many ways especially what TSA
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:13.880]  it is and again this goes back to Congress reeling them in I'd like to
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:17.440]  believe that people are waking up to the fact certain airports have already said
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:20.520]  we want to get rid of TSA we should make it easier for them to get rid of TSA
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.440]  because TSA is another government bureaucracy which now because of its
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.520]  size is more focused on its own self continuation than actually protecting
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.640]  the American people final segment with Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer who

[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.920]  domestic terror threat if you say hey I want the Bill of Rights I want the
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.800]  Constitution I want the Second Amendment I want states rights oh you're the
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:48.280]  number one terror threat you're who we're watching well that means then that
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:53.840]  you hate the spirit of this country you hate George Washington it really comes
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:56.960]  down to that we've got about five minutes left with Lieutenant Colonel
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.120]  Tony Schaefer best-selling author researcher amazing story you got to
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.600]  check out a site in this book you can't put it down it's so informative and he
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.520]  obviously knows a lot more he can't tell us someday he'll be able to though in
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:13.520]  closing the Iran situation I'm sure you've seen Debsy who's usually been
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.560]  pretty hawkish that's why they kept getting rid of the different chairman
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.320]  he's in the Jerusalem Post and everywhere else saying that Israel's
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:26.800]  moving towards a strike and he's now distancing himself that that's kind of
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:33.260]  creepy does that does that lean towards an attack or or against it what what
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:38.520]  intel are you getting well there's two things remember the whole regimen of
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:43.840]  sanctions daily dollar short not gonna work irrelevant hard currency still
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.440]  going into the Iranian so I think we might as well give that up if they really
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.520]  wanted to do something like that they should have been that back during the
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.120]  Bush years but they did what that said now we are looking at the almost certainty
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.840]  that the Iranians will develop a nuclear weapon my sources tell me they've
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.360]  already got to I just that they do question becomes what do they do with
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.040]  them I don't think they know what to do with this it's something that what they
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.440]  understand at this point and we understand that we if they ever use a
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.960]  nuclear weapon they would suffer huge consequences I don't think there's any
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.700]  question of that the problem is this to actually do an attack a conventional
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:22.200]  attack using aircraft they're talking right now there's over 300 known sites
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.200]  that's known sites they're involved in the Iranian nuclear program keep in mind
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.360]  there's sites we don't know about obviously this is the known ones and to
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:34.520]  actually attack those using aircraft would be hugely difficult so this is
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.520]  where I think the general is coming from it's like you know the idea of using an
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:43.280]  attack may not actually net us what we want which is to shut down the Iranian
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.600]  nuclear program I think that cow is long out the barn door so what we I think need
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.600]  to focus on is the fact the Iranian people are Persians and they have their
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.240]  own green movement which is a democracy and I think we need to encourage their
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.200]  own people to think about you really want a government which is actually out
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.560]  to poke other people in the eye to create the conditions for war because
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:09.560]  frankly the Iranian government the mullahs and the guy in charge is all
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.840]  about making some very pretty big rhetoric about trying to use their
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.720]  weapons to kill others with that said there needs to be distinguishing and
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.920]  distinct distinction between the Iranian government and the Iranian
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.680]  people we don't want to do anything to make the Iranian people are enemies so
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.760]  this is where I think we had to have to have a deeper strategy and understand
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:32.440]  the situation or and to understand who the good guys are who the bad let me
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.920]  ask you this because you've got to go sooner maybe you could stay five more
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.760]  minutes we're going to break here in just one minute
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:41.560]  oh look I don't want a war and and I want to see Iran me and become a
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:46.200]  freer country but why are there mullahs and people saying we're going to blow
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.080]  Israel up and they really are saying that now it's like they want this war to
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.800]  happen on that's crazy it is crazy that's one of the things I've said before
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.160]  we need to look at the Reagan approach to things where if I were President Obama
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:01.920]  I would have three US carrier groups there all the time one and the
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:05.920]  Mediterranean one in the Red Sea one in the Persian Gulf ready to go and say
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:09.240]  well we don't want war the moment we think you're going to do anything
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.800]  aggressive we will kick your ass and I think that's their approach we need to
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:15.360]  look at taking because obviously I don't think we're going to what we're doing
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:18.640]  right now is not going to stop I know you got to go but we got a 60 second
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:23.560]  break just give me five more ahead of Congressman Walter Jones joining us because
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.880]  he's joining us after that just to break down a little more on Iran can you do
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:32.440]  that okay great back in 60 seconds ladies and gentlemen we've got globalist

[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.040]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:25.880]  alex jones all right we got a short segment left here with lieutenant
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:30.560]  colonel Anthony Schaefer author of operation dark art then I got a couple
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:36.520]  segments to cover news and then congressman Walter Jones on a host of
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:41.360]  issues is going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour a colonel
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.080]  for folks that just joined us recapping we're talking about Iran which has got
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:51.480]  really you know good smart people that want freedom and I know that the west
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.000]  has done a lot of bad things to Iran so it's not just a one-way street but Iran
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.360]  is doing a lot of provocative stuff I mean you know some of these statements
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:04.200]  are almost asking for it and isn't that I mean correct me if I'm wrong because I
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.600]  want to hear everything I'm wrong isn't it that their government I've seen some
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.800]  of the statistics thinks they'll be more popular because they're pretty unpopular
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.840]  if Iran is struck that will unify that government for another 20 30 years I
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:20.720]  mean they kind of want that chaos so they can look like and then you know that
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.640]  they're the victims and stay in power yeah actually look what did happen with
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.200]  the paulcon islands in Argentina that was exactly what the Argentines thought
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:33.560]  they could do is actually pop their population to be more supportive and two
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:37.200]  two points very quickly and I know we're short on time but the the Iranians
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:42.400]  watched how the North Koreans played brinkmanship masterfully I you know I
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.320]  worked the operations back in the 90s and I watched in slow motion how the North
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:51.680]  Koreans were masters at pushing us right up to that line and backing us off and
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:55.640]  there before our eyes the nuclear program within Korea produced nuclear
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:59.360]  weapons imagine that so they've watched that they understand this game of
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.760]  brinkmanship and I think they're trying to walk a very fine line let me be very
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:08.040]  clear here the the moment that and and and they would lose they the Iranians
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:13.320]  would lose as much as anybody else in a war they sustain themselves off of oil
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:17.200]  sales they cannot even refine their own oil so I think this is one of the things
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.000]  that do you continue to see this brinkmanship but what that said there
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.580]  are crazies within their own government who would sooner see the return of the
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:29.520]  12th imam which is their religious belief that somehow if they create chaos
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:33.200]  that their their religion would see the return of their one of their their
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.760]  religious leaders and so there is that element of crazy to produce nuclear
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.040]  weapons you have to have rational people who understand science break break
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:47.520]  you've got equally committed crazies who are putting out this propaganda and who
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.760]  may well pass that line but our interests I think as most Western interests
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:58.720]  are is to maintain basically the status quo at least as long as we can and then
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:02.840]  if there is any that hint of use of force that that that the Iranian
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:06.120]  government understands that we will be forced to take military action against
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:10.400]  them but the moment we are seen as the aggressors that the Iranian government
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:14.400]  can pay us the aggressors surely they will use that it with their own people
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:18.480]  to say see they really do hate us this is why you have to support us that's one
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.520]  of the reasons we have to walk this very fine line between focusing on the
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:27.160]  Iranian crazies and the Iranian people who really do as much as other people
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:32.800]  again their Persians not Arabs want to be free well expanding on that just in
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.040]  the minute we have left the the downfall of the West is the fact that we don't
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.600]  have the moral high ground anymore with all the corruption and there are
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:44.880]  interests that want to destabilize these countries they don't want those
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:47.840]  countries to be free they don't want them to have freedom they're trying to
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.480]  put al-Qaeda in it's gonna kill the Muslim Christian and Jewish minorities or
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:56.040]  drive them out I mean they're blowing up churches for heaven's sakes and the so
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.920]  called liberal media isn't covering it it's a war crime what's happening in
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.400]  Syria it's shameful all right I agree and that's where I think that there needs
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:07.840]  to be reckoning of the American press the world press I think a lot of things
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:12.000]  going on people don't really understand and I'd like to believe somehow some way
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.960]  we'll continue to have voices in the world just trying to call out the wrong
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.520]  doing and trying to do the right thing well I mean I don't know how they're
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:22.880]  gonna spend this in history when al-Qaeda ends up taking over Syria if it goes
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:26.280]  that direction now you got the Russians lining up we ran out of time I hope you'll

[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:38.200]  world this life is a task my friends the magic of consciousness the gift given
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:47.400]  to us by our creator be able to stare out into the universe and experience
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:58.200]  life is an unspeakably amazing event I just can't believe that people don't
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:05.160]  feel more fulfilled in ecstasy or agony are all the points in between life is an
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:11.240]  incredible adventure and the globalists seek to attack our genetics our family
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:17.760]  lines our DNA is being destroyed our species is under unmitigated assault
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:26.200]  because when you give in to evil it sinks to its absolute absolute zero the
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:34.320]  very worst are empowered and I seek to set bushfires brushfires in the minds of
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:42.000]  men and women of humankind to reach for the stars there are so many mindless and
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.080]  I get into the news here so many ahead of congressman Walter Jones joining us
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:56.440]  big breaking news on a host of issues I see the ongoing idiotic debates based on
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.800]  ignorance that go on on so many thousands of subjects and it just
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:05.360]  frustrates me because I know my intellect is finite my intellect is
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.640]  limited but in the true research of knowledge you don't plug into disinformation
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:14.760]  if you plug into real information it just exponentially connects itself and the
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:21.000]  and Matt Williams was likening it the other day here in the office to that
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.960]  scene in V for Vendetta where the where the detectives are sitting there with
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:33.080]  all the evidence and it all starts to come together right there and that's
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:38.040]  what it's like on every issue is I get a deeper and deeper understanding it's
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:47.840]  it's mind-blowing it's mind-blowing to stare into the fulcrum the the the flow
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:57.240]  the blast of reality and to gain exponentially more and more understanding
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:04.640]  and then you realize that people run in the planet they gained a lot of this
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.920]  knowledge but decided to take another road and use it against people and just
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:15.480]  the idea of the thought of using knowledge to pull people down the thought
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:19.920]  of using knowledge to shutter minds the thought of using deep knowledge to hurt
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:30.160]  people who don't deserve it my very spirit recoils and now only now in the
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.360]  last few years I always felt it but now I really understand what God fearing
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:39.920]  means it isn't like God even wants us to be afraid it's that when you see
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:45.120]  things that are wrong and you even behold them even beholding the sin
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:52.520]  makes you recoil and and and feel fear for those that are doing it and it's
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.800]  not like fear of being hurt or fear of being humiliated or fear of being
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:01.600]  destroyed fear at being cut off from the life force of the universe who gives
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:10.880]  me just get chills of just love oh man you people that are into evil huh stay
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.440]  away from me just get back get back get back you don't know you don't know you've
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.280]  got something wrong with you if you knew the roads you were going down I'm
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:28.720]  getting chills right now bad ones just imagine what you've become what you've
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.400]  been part of it's so horrible I can see I can see what you think I can see who
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:39.160]  you are I I see into your mind I I see what you like it's it stinks stinks it
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.320]  smells really bad it's like walking into a room with a dead animal it's been
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:46.360]  there for a month and it's just you want out of that room I'm just like oh I
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:53.680]  recoil from you I like life I like creativity I like everything that flows
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:14:00.160]  from God the living waters it just flows out in the spacetime continuum
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:09.200]  blasting us all as our souls just travel in it in a stream of eternity and to
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:13.960]  imagine people because again really evil the top globalists who are very evil
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:20.600]  are very intelligent they are aware of all this but have a dark twist and I
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:25.680]  understand the dark majesty of evil but it's only at a certain level it's a
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:35.480]  it's a it's a reflection of good in the in the face of the evil because only by
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.320]  looking at the evil do you recognize just how good the goodness is and that's
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:44.160]  why God allows evil to operate was so that you have free will and can see it
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:51.240]  and I'm not trying to preach I have all this news to cover you know let me talk
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:55.080]  about this even though it's kind of a petty story it has a gateway into deeper
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.840]  understandings and it's this
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:07.000]  Clint Eastwood I didn't watch the RNC last night I went and visited my
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.800]  grandmother for her birthday my uncle was over there visiting her she didn't
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:15.440]  want to party but my uncle came in from East Texas and on up here to Austin on
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:21.120]  over and sorry I had dinner with her and so I didn't watch it but I watched it
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:25.240]  this morning and I mean Clint Eastwood is really a great actor but more than
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:31.240]  that he is an amazing amazing director and I've talked to people that have
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:35.760]  worked with him he I mean he knows how to do it where they do one take and it
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.760]  comes off like nobody else can do he calls it shoe leather 82 years old very
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:46.480]  prolific very private I know quite a few people that have been in movies with
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.640]  him talked to folks out in California that lived close to him that have talked
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:56.960]  to him and you know the Santa Cruz area that said watching the speech was
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:05.200]  painful because he wanted it to come off as you know kind of friendly and witty
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:15.040]  and it did but it doesn't translate in a teleprompter world because you can tell
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:21.000]  he's got some notes there there's no teleprompter and the stupid Republicans
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.880]  that were just into like a tree full of parrots and you know that you know and
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:28.520]  parrots get happier as they sit higher you know they love to sit at the highest
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:33.400]  perch you know the biggest strongest male sits up at the top and looking at
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.640]  most those Republicans I mean you see it they're like children that are into
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:43.200]  being in the cool club which is just a very childlike level Democrats are the
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:46.040]  same I'm sure there were some good people there I know Ted Anderson was
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:50.000]  there but I mean a lot of them you know they just it's it's hokey-ness they
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.640]  should be horrified at the position of this country instead it's all raw raw
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:03.200]  you know 17th century style convention 18th century style convention and I'm
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.880]  watching it and I realized what went wrong he had a lot of courage to go out
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:13.000]  there they wouldn't shut up the entire time he was trying to speak and he and
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.400]  he's not a teleprompter reader so he was doing for an 82 year old man better job
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:23.360]  than I guarantee a Barack Obama or George Bush would have done probably better
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:27.960]  than Bill Clinton I mean it's really hard to sit there and have a conversation
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:32.000]  with a person that isn't there I can do it my problem is I get in front of a
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.760]  crowd I have no adrenaline anymore I do this so much I'm even worried about it
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:38.240]  it's the opposite it's Clint Eastwood who you don't even see on television and
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:42.800]  stuff coming out there trying to help America believing that you know Mitt
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:47.280]  Romney's better for the country and you know going through all the classic
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:54.360]  cliches you know thinking you know the Republicans are better and doing it out
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:59.360]  of love of this country thinking that he's going to go to the establishment's
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:04.160]  backup guy and that somehow that's going to fix things and I just thought how
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:08.280]  many times we have to go through this cycle that the problem is is that both
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:12.040]  candidates are selected by the power structure that's why they're so close on
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:16.840]  the issues the rhetoric's different because that's where the power structure
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:22.400]  wants to go we're going in that direction it's extremely elementary and so
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:26.240]  things are getting horrible under Bush whoa Obama must be good then it really
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:29.360]  gets bad under Obama and let me tell you Mitt Romney comes in it's just going to
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:34.440]  keep getting worse just be ready for that because all these discussions about
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:38.880]  what this one will do or that one will do it's like sports sports is so popper is
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:43.080]  for men learning all the factoids about this player and that player and where
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:47.280]  they went to college and what they did and what they make hey man if you were
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:51.960]  doing that type of work in business and were that obsessed with work you'd be
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:58.120]  millionaires all modern sports they admit Edward Bernays you name it was
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:03.080]  designed to distract you from being dominant it was to just me I'll tell
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:09.440]  you something the Super Bowl was on last year and I told the story maybe last

[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:40.880]  you something I'm not pleased with that I am really freaked out by how far this
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:44.920]  is gone and you know I talked about it we got the congressman coming up here in
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:51.400]  a moment I talked about it for the whole first hour today that they have
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:57.000]  reeducation camps in Army manual FM 3-39.40 and then we have Colonel
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.240]  Schaefer on he's like oh yeah this has been going on a while but now it's just
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:05.080]  rolling out it's rolling out to take over the states he sat there and told you
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:12.280]  the same thing we just sit here watching it slow motion happen and it'd be bad
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.840]  enough if it was the federal government doing this the federal government I
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:23.040]  mean the Army War College has bragged what what's his name the professor Barnett
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:29.360]  on C-SPAN that you know they work for the globalist and all this well that's
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:34.880]  called collaborating and I guess if they just ease it in slow enough and
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:39.080]  everything I guess I am the bad guy I mean I want private property freedom
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:43.920]  Second Amendment family rights we've just got to get used to the country was
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:47.400]  taken over and we're the bad guys and a lot of people are cowards they're like
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:51.520]  I don't care if you stand with America I'm gonna stick with the bankers they're
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:54.640]  the winners and you're like why are you like that they're like we like winning
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:28:00.560]  but you're not winning it's destroying the country but as long as they feel
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:04.640]  like they're winning you see oh well I associate myself like these idiots that
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:09.680]  vote for Barack Obama and associate their personal power with them or any of
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.080]  these politicians I mean it's one thing if you hold your nose and vote for an
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:17.280]  establishment politician over another but don't ever I mean I've been in
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:23.120]  people's houses all over the place looking at houses moving or at friends
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:29.560]  houses or at parties and they'll have framed letters from Rick Perry letters
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.680]  from George W. Bush and it's a form letter with a fake signature Robo sign
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:38.520]  and they'll really think they got letters from them people gonna be on
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:43.560]  the street go I got a letter from George W. Bush what do you think that means I
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.320]  mean I only gave them $500 once I'm like it's it's a fake letter it's a form
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:51.240]  letter they're like no that can't be true it's the same premise of the
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:57.240]  Nigerian letters that Prince Habubu or Magubu or whatever wants to give you a

[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:23.280]  operations instead of seeing NATO and the UNR boss I mean people say Congress

[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:46.440]  talk about but but I always love to ask people this question you know cold right
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:51.160]  up front what is front and center on your radar I just threw out the things I
[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:55.440]  know you're working on but what is most important what what keeps you up at
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.600]  night or when you wake up in the morning what are you thinking about
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:03.320]  congressman well thank you for the opportunity and always on the very
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:07.800]  forefront of my mind are all those young men and women over in Afghanistan
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:14.160]  given their life and limbs for a corrupt government led by Karzai and I
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:20.480]  continue to beat the drum of getting the American people to push Congress and
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:25.000]  say it's time to bring our troops home and Alex I think I've said you before
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.600]  I can't say the name but a former commandant has been my advisor on
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:33.040]  Afghanistan for three years send me email send me question statements that
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.360]  things like that and he has been staying for three years learn history
[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:43.840]  history is no nation has ever no nation will ever change Afghanistan it's
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:49.640]  living in the seventh century so I wish your listeners with this the next couple
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:53.120]  the next week most members of home and across the United States I wish they
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:56.640]  pick up the phone and say bring our troops home now don't continue to wait
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:01.920]  and very quickly Alex we had three Marines from County June which is in my
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:06.720]  district they're in the special ops known as Borsak three Marines from
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:11.760]  County June over there to train the Afghans one training one Afghan who was
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.800]  being trained turned the weapon and killed all three Marines this has happened
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:21.040]  to over 10 of American citizens who were in uniform over the last two and a
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:26.600]  half weeks it's a true tragedy and listen I know you're used to mainstream
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:29.720]  media that doesn't want to talk about the troops they just want to wrap you
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:34.320]  know their agenda in the troops of valor but take your time talking about this
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:39.200]  because you're one of the only people in Congress that has called on the phone
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.880]  or visited the family of every single member of the armed services that have
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:48.440]  been killed since all these wars started yeah Alex you're right what I have done
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:56.280]  I've signed over 10,847 letters to families and extended families who
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:01.960]  have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and Iraq primarily now in Afghanistan Iraq
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:07.280]  was a war we never had to fight the intelligence was manipulated by the
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:11.560]  Bush administration and it was war we never had never had to write and I
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:16.080]  regret that I voted to give President Bush the the authority to go in and
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:21.360]  therefore I started writing letters to these families right now in the last
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:25.960]  three weeks counting 40 that I've got to sign tomorrow that I'm not signed yet I
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:31.120]  would have signed over 121 letters to families and extended families in the
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:38.080]  last three weeks wow and that makes you focus on it I saw I saw a report last
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:43.160]  week that in polls the American people have just forgotten about Afghanistan and
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:48.520]  the media is not even covering any war I mean this is a forgotten war well Alex
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:52.400]  thank you for giving me this time and I'll tell you why last Wednesday I don't
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.720]  generally buy the Wall Street Journal but I had a reason to and I did not know
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:01.880]  it but their front page happened to be the beautiful picture of two parents
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:06.880]  crying holding the folded flag and their son had been one of the three Marines
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:13.440]  killed and I just made reference to what the Wall Street Journal did they had
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:21.040]  the inside pages they had 1,000 faces 1,000 faces of those who've given their
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:25.080]  life for this country that's why I appreciate you giving me this time I
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:30.040]  wish every newspaper in America was required to which we cannot do to put
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:35.680]  a flag drape coffin above the names every time they publish the names in a
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:43.520]  newspaper we need to somehow get people to think about what these wars for
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:50.120]  profiteering wars for no bid contracts wars for control of opium are doing and
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:54.360]  it's so refreshing to see you and Ron Paul and others pointing out that you
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:58.080]  know if we're going to have a war it should be declared by Congress up front
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.600]  and let's get into that you've introduced the legislation the media has
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:06.200]  tried to black it out that if this president or any other president tries
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:10.840]  to launch wars without congressional approval or tries to say their authority
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:15.640]  comes from the UN or NATO that impeachment begins and since then they're
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:21.040]  just barreling on now talking about the US getting involved overtly not just
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:27.320]  covertly in Syria yes Alex you're right thank you this you have me on the
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:33.920]  show when I first put 107 H con resolution 107 as it has legislation in
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.720]  the house I have been beaten the drums I cannot get a hearing on it and of
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:42.160]  course we only have like two and a half weeks left before everybody breaks for
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:46.960]  the election but I had gotten Jonathan Turley who you know is the well-known
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.080]  constitutional lawyer Bruce fine well-known constitutional lawyer all
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:55.440]  these people have joined me in saying that we should hold hearings because at
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.800]  the present time the Republican or Democrat it seems like that the
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:03.720]  Congress and I blame the Congress instead of the administration the
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:09.080]  Congress should demand that a president meets the responsibility of the
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.480]  Constitution and we have not done it for so many years that's the reason I put
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:19.200]  in H con resolution 107 and it says a president it did not see the president
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:25.080]  but a president who without the cost does not come to Congress and follow the
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:29.880]  Constitution that they can be impeached and I would say there might be one
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:34.800]  exception that is if we got bombed by foreign entity and the president needed
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.600]  to take some retaliatory action within a day or two but still I think they should
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.000]  come to Congress but I would say they would be an exception of that kind of
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:49.040]  situation but you're right I mean right I just wrote the president yesterday and
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:55.360]  asking please do not commit troops to Syria or to initiate war with Iran
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:01.480]  unless he comes to Congress to justify it we even have the chairman of the joint
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:05.120]  chiefs who's been pretty hawkish compared to the last few Dempsey in the
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:10.080]  Jerusalem Post saying I don't want to be complicit in Iran strike I mean most
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:14.280]  military experts say it is it's gonna dig the moolahs in even deeper and
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:20.000]  unify people over there but a lot of politicians they want a war to look
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:25.440]  good are you concerned about an October surprise congressman when it's 1.4
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:30.960]  billion rounds of ammo since last November in less than a year 750 million
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.240]  450 million 250 million and now tens of millions since that story broke three
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:41.440]  weeks ago rounds of ammunition for domestic operations we have the
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:46.560]  Obama supporters and minions at Homeland Security saying veterans gun
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:51.960]  owners liberty lovers are the number one terror threat so now the TSA isn't
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:55.440]  looking in my pants for bin Laden they're in there looking for George
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:00.800]  Washington well Alice I I could not agree more and I want to go back to your
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:06.920]  comment about General Dempsey I know I have great relationships with the
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:11.800]  Marines in my district and I can tell you they're still like any service
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:15.480]  person willing to give their life for this country but they want to give it
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:21.680]  for a sound policy and I know that the the Marine Corps is tired I know the
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:26.440]  equipment is worn out in many cases and we need to rebuild our military because
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:33.520]  I am more concerned about quite frankly a war with North Korea or country in the
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:38.920]  Southeast Asian part of America and right now our troops are so tired that if
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:44.640]  we got stuck in Iran or Syria I mean it would be a long long time before we would
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:49.720]  get them out well that's another thing as you know previously they never made
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:55.080]  you serve more than one tour in combat now it's five six seven eight and then
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:58.760]  they give them prozac and stuff that they know causes suicide and then
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:03.960]  wonder why there's record suicides and then try to demonize all veterans instead
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:08.240]  they should have their guns taken I mean this is incredible well Alex I wish
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:13.200]  that the American people there's a book and if you want to get off the one I
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:17.160]  would suggest you might would really get a great show that the book's name is
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:23.920]  funding the enemy it's written by Douglas Quisting Doug ISS ING I bought the
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:28.480]  book I read the book I have contacted Mr. Whiston he is going to come to
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:34.640]  Washington DC on September the 20th and my staff along with Jim McGovern from
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.280]  Massachusetts staff we're going to do a press conference and Mr. Whiston is
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:44.360]  going to talk about how the money is going from America to the to the
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:50.080]  Taliban so that means and the subtitle of the book funding the enemy the
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:56.200]  subtitle is how us taxpayers have funded Taliban to kill Americans yes I'm
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:58.920]  familiar with the book I've read excerpts I've meant to read it we have
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:03.080]  it I just get get over one with having that time but just separately they
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:07.720]  admit even in the council on farm relations last issue that came out four
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:13.240]  weeks ago of August 1st it's almost four weeks ago that well the quote is we
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:18.080]  need Al Qaeda I'm sorry it's just too insane and and they're actually now
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:22.760]  saying Al Qaeda is doing a great job against Assad I'm not saying Assad's a
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:26.880]  great guy but compared to Al Qaeda he is this is so immoral you're up there
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:30.400]  you're on the armed services committee I mean you're you know you've got access
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:35.800]  to stuff that hardly anybody else does in national security can you tell us what
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:41.280]  the plan is trying to put Al Qaeda in who are admittedly blowing up churches I
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.760]  mean there's video of this blowing up synagogues I mean since when I mean how
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:53.320]  is the media ignoring this well I will be honest with we've had briefings we've
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:56.560]  been home for four weeks we had a briefing five weeks ago but it was
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:02.200]  predominantly on on the Afghanistan it was not a briefing on Syria or any of
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:07.880]  the movements taking place in that area my concern is it go back to a point you
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:16.400]  made about an October surprise I would not be surprised that if the politics
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:23.920]  are such in this country that if Israel decided and then it should be up to
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:29.080]  Israel with not America being involved but if Israel decided to go into Iran
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:33.920]  that maybe this administration would say we agree and support they're going into
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:39.040]  Iran I don't I can't prove that I don't want that to be misunderstood I have
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:43.400]  nothing personal against the president but I am concerned that there might be
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:48.160]  a justification as we get into October late October especially that the
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:55.120]  Israelis take a opportunity to take out some of the sites in Iran and then the
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:58.880]  administration says we support it because you know the Jewish vote is big in
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:03.240]  America and I'm very much respected you so don't get me wrong on that but
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:07.960]  they're just too many things that can happen with just a I hate to say it so
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:13.920]  simply but snap of a finger stroke of the pen law the land kind of cool is one
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:18.200]  of Clinton's advisors what McGullis said well you're absolutely right and and
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:22.080]  you know there there are a lot of special interests that want to have this
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:26.080]  war there's a lot of interest in Israel that are also against having this war
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:30.400]  with Iran but it'll be good for politicians up for reelection to have a
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:36.620]  political diversion in Israel and here and Obama is sliding quickly Hillary
[02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:42.560]  won't even go to the DNC you've got all these Democrats saying Biden needs to
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:51.200]  step down they can't even give away tickets for Obama's speeches now Michael
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:57.120]  Moore says get used to saying president Romney show I mean look the polls say
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:01.240]  it's a dead heat we know those polls are cooked the numbers I've got are Obama
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:06.680]  is on his way out unless unless there's some type of crises and I'm sure you've
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:11.280]  seen all those quotes by Democratic advisors saying if there was a crisis
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:17.960]  they could blame the the people against them well no I've read some of the
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:23.960]  articles in it and that you made reference to and and again my concern
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.520]  is I told you about how many letters I've signed I go to Walter Reed Alex and
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:31.760]  I will be going in two weeks the young man that graduated from East Carolina
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:37.520]  University this right here in my town where my office is located he lost both
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:43.080]  legs about three months ago stepped on an IEDs a young lieutenant stepped on an
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:49.840]  IED and both legs well below the knees that were lost that part of the leg I've
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:55.400]  seen five kids at Walter Reed that have no body parts below the waist I was told
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:00.680]  that by the escort one being army one being marine that these kids have lost
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:05.440]  everything below their legs the next phenomena that's coming to take that
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:08.920]  America's not prepared for is to take care of the wounded from Afghanistan and
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.800]  right it will be anywhere from three to five trillion dollars that's not being
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  factored in any of our unbelievable you know I talked to so many veterans a lot
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:22.480]  of the regular folks are scared of veterans because of the media which I
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:26.560]  think overalls unfounded they make some of the best employees and they no one's
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:34.880]  giving them jobs yep it's a problem and it's that that's why you know I am if
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:39.400]  why are we spending ten billion dollars a month in Afghanistan it's borrowed money
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:44.600]  from the Chinese we cannot even send inspectors in there to see how the
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:49.480]  taxpayers money is being spent for the Chinese money I might say in Afghanistan
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:55.720]  and yet we're cutting programs some good programs like home health programs and
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:00.720]  talking about sequestration coming in I mean America needs to understand is
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.360]  Ron Paul would say let's start fixing America's problems unless they home and
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:09.440]  spend the American energy and the American money right here in America
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:15.360]  rebuild that country exactly sir now I want to get into the what do you think
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:18.560]  the billion 400 million bullets are for me you're up there at the national
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:22.400]  intelligence level well is Congress gonna ask Homeland Security what that is
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:27.080]  for and and also I know you're concerned about drones and are supporting some
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:32.840]  legislation tell us about that well I was first I think you'll find Darrell
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:38.040]  ice that the oversight committee to hold some hearings as soon as we go back
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:43.360]  regarding this bullet situation I really do that the bill that I am on was
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.240]  introduced by a Georgia Republican Representative Austin Scott and this is
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:53.840]  what the bill does it's HR 5925 would only permit the federal government to
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:59.000]  use drone technology without a specific warrant when patrolling the national
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:04.120]  borders and when credible intelligence exist to indicate that there's a risk of
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:09.240]  terror terrorism attack a few weeks ago I was on the floor to talk about getting
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:13.720]  our troops out of Afghanistan and before me was a very dear friend of mine
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:18.440]  named Ted Poe Ted was speaking before I did what they call five minute speeches
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:24.160]  and he got up and talked about in 2015 we will have 17,000 drones flying around
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:29.560]  America that's one reason I did not vote for the DOD bill the armed services
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:33.200]  bill back in May June can you repeat what you said to me off air about the
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:40.960]  drugs yeah yeah I can that that is that is what Ted Poe said on the floor of the
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:45.640]  house he's from Texas he's a good man you might get him on your show he
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:49.040]  actually spoke before I did that day the five minute speeches early in the
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:54.940]  morning and he was saying that at some point in 2015 there could be as many as
[02:50:54.940 --> 02:50:59.960]  17,000 drones flying around America stay there let's finish up on the drone

[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:12.800]  joins us from North Carolina we're very honored to have him what a great
[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:18.800]  patriot up there speaking out telling it like it is against a recap in your own
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:23.560]  words the drone situation the break interrupted us back to this bill very
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:27.440]  quickly the title of this bill by congressman Scott from Georgia that I
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:32.160]  co-sponsored the title tells you everything the title is the preserving
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:37.160]  freedom from unwanted surveillance act of 2012 so it would put certain
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:41.320]  restrictions on the American government using drones against the American
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:46.720]  people and I I mean I'm concerned I voted against the armed services bill two
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:50.720]  months ago because that there's a provision that was put in by the Senate
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:55.520]  that puts it really says that any administration that determines an
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:01.300]  American citizen is a terrorist they can take him out without coming to
[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:05.560]  Congress or anyone else it's very dangerous I will send that provision to
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.840]  you so that you will have it that was in the armed services bill that passed the
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:14.160]  House and the Senate and signed by the president of the United States on the
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:17.960]  drones you also made the point when I first got him for went live that that
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:21.600]  you need a provision so that these aren't used against the American people
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:28.440]  yeah that's what that's what HR 59-25 will do by congressman Scott it would
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:34.440]  only permit the federal government to use drone technology without a specific
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:38.800]  warrant when patrolling the national borders and when a credible
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:43.200]  intelligence exists to indicate there's a risk of terrorism because if you don't
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:47.520]  have that provision that I just read to your people then the government can do
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:51.320]  anything they want to with drugs I mean take the NSA they now basically admit
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:54.600]  they're recording everything we do illegally I mean why even have a bill
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:59.960]  of rights in Constitution well you know I tell you Alex I think the American
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:03.800]  people are ready to take the government back I would rather that it be done I
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:08.400]  would vote but I really do think the American government the American people
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.800]  are just fed up with Congress and fed up with the government it's just it's the
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:20.480]  time to bring America back to the people what is the feeling you get in DC now
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:23.520]  I mean is Washington aware of this awakenings happening because I see it
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:27.000]  to and what is the feel from your constituents you're saying they're
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:32.120]  really starting to wake up I think that Congress that's why I think this
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:36.080]  election November is gonna be very interesting I sincerely believe that
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:40.880]  people are more concerned today than ever before about the overreach and the
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:45.960]  intrusion of the federal government into our private lives that's why I love
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:51.040]  Ron Paul I'm a big Ron Paul supporter and believe today if he was the nominee
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:54.320]  of the Republican Party he'd be the next president of the United States there's no
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:58.720]  doubt he would absolutely politically destroy Obama and Romney just I don't
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:04.400]  see any Romney stickers still and I mean Paul Ryan's a little better than Romney
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:09.720]  but I mean Romney's in for a rude awakening if he gets elected and tries
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:13.960]  all that that Massachusetts liberal stuff yeah people aren't gonna put up with
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:19.240]  that no not at all not at all and Alex very quickly I got a copy the letter
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:23.360]  that I sent to mr. Obama yesterday and I read the first paragraph very quickly
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:27.640]  this letter is written to you out of grave concern that you were once again
