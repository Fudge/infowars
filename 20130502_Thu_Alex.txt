[00:42.800 --> 00:48.640]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Thursday May 2nd 2013
[00:48.640 --> 00:54.720]  worldwide edition I am your host Alex Jones we're gonna be live here for the
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.920]  next three hours and riding shotgun with me their admission control in Austin
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.600]  Texas will be jacarney Jackson now I have a ton of news that obviously I'm
[01:04.600 --> 01:13.540]  going to be getting to here today we're going to look at some of the dorm mates
[01:13.540 --> 01:23.120]  now are the new terror threat and the masterminds the FBA okay we seem to be
[01:23.120 --> 01:26.400]  having a little bit of technical difficulties we'll get reconnected with
[01:26.400 --> 01:30.080]  Alex and get you right back to him in one second but I'll go ahead and start
[01:30.080 --> 01:34.280]  off with a few things we have coming up on our show today this is out of bright
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.960]  part Pentagon may court marshal soldiers who share Christian faith now this is
[01:38.960 --> 01:43.760]  just days or weeks after we saw a Lieutenant Colonel Jack rich come out
[01:43.760 --> 01:47.680]  with a email to his subordinate saying the new terror threat are Christians as
[01:47.680 --> 01:51.880]  well as many other groups but he also mentioned people of Christian faith and
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.640]  this article goes on to say the Pentagon has released a statement confirming
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.480]  that soldiers could be prosecuted for promoting their faith and then the
[01:59.480 --> 02:05.840]  Pentagon issued a a comment to the Jack rich email and it said that the Pentagon
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.840]  does not discriminate to anybody discriminated against any group based on
[02:08.840 --> 02:11.800]  faith and then I had to ask the question well what have they been doing to
[02:11.800 --> 02:15.240]  Muslims since forever and that's just one of the articles we have coming up
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.880]  next we have police police say liberal student activists threatened herself
[02:20.880 --> 02:26.800]  with rape in Facebook host host hoax to frame conservatives and we also have
[02:26.800 --> 02:31.480]  this one lesbian who reported hate crime attack staged incident Nebraska police
[02:31.480 --> 02:34.800]  say and that's just some of the things we have coming up for you on the show
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.680]  today I'm pretty sure Alex has many things he wants to mention as well let's
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.160]  take a look at a few more here high school student faces 20 years for Obama
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.600]  Facebook threat now this is after you guys remember last the last election
[02:48.600 --> 02:52.040]  cycle we had all those threats to Mitt Romney regardless if you like Mitt Romney
[02:52.040 --> 02:56.880]  not I'm not a cheerleader from it but he had many threats from people on Twitter
[02:56.880 --> 03:00.520]  and Facebook and other places saying hey I want to kill Mitt Romney and Mitt
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.240]  Romney wins I'm gonna run him over shoot him up we saw that Michael Moore funded
[03:04.240 --> 03:07.680]  video where the old lady said she's gonna punch him in the gonads and all
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.200]  that was well and good but this guy guy with a little too much time on his hands
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.280]  and middle fingers on it I don't even know if we can show that but this guy
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.040]  says he wants to kill people and now he's facing 20 years so that's that's how
[03:21.040 --> 03:23.360]  the system works let's go to this next one
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.600]  Florida's encouraged to report neighbors who quote hate the government now
[03:28.600 --> 03:31.920]  there's a difference between hating your government and being critical of it we
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.880]  are very critical of it here at info wars but people seem to equate that with
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.280]  hating your government and some type of violent extremist activity let's go to
[03:41.280 --> 03:47.000]  this one IRS to spy on our shopping records travels travel and social
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.920]  interactions now mrs. Catherine Albraker should I say doctor she's been
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.880]  worrying about this for years the frequent shopper cards of many other
[03:55.880 --> 03:59.680]  kinds of perks and benefits that you can get from giving people your special
[03:59.680 --> 04:02.840]  information secret information and now they're saying that they're going to
[04:02.840 --> 04:06.720]  spy on you they just admit it throw it in your face yes this is what we are
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.600]  going to do but you know your conspiracy theories if you point out the
[04:10.600 --> 04:14.840]  data mining centers and all these other cookie things that they do to collect
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.880]  your information Google Bing Yahoo many other sources so that's what they're
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.560]  going to do and that's what they admit to doing now last night on the info
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.160]  wars nightly news I had David Knight on and this is something very important
[04:28.160 --> 04:31.160]  because we get a lot of comments about this referring to the Paul Revere
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.760]  contest I just want everybody to know that the Paul Revere contest is over we
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.480]  have not selected a winner we'll probably do that around July 4th so
[04:39.480 --> 04:42.320]  definitely be encouraged if you just submit just be aware it's going to take
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.600]  us a little bit to get through all those entries and we'll hopefully have Alex
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.680]  Jones back on the other side
[04:59.680 --> 05:04.640]  in the last two years alone the US has seen huge losses to our food supply in
[05:04.640 --> 05:09.840]  2011 storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion and lost crops
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.520]  alone in 2012 we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years you
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.200]  may think out of sight out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected
[05:18.200 --> 05:23.080]  the fact is you are we all are food shortages drive prices up for everyone

[08:41.200 --> 08:47.120]  riding shotgun there at the Info Wars Center in Austin Texas we've got a ton
[08:47.120 --> 08:52.000]  of important news and information that we're going to be going over and
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.400]  covering in detail today remember this story from back in 2002 since then it's
[08:58.400 --> 09:03.440]  it's morphed quite a bit towards the towards the Stasi state is your cable
[09:03.440 --> 09:11.000]  guy a spy was the question then it goes into the new tips program with the
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.200]  citizen core isn't that not being being part of the citizen core course I've
[09:15.200 --> 09:18.440]  seen all these mainstream news articles saying there is no citizen core there is
[09:18.440 --> 09:29.000]  no FEMA core I am reportedly I am reportedly you know making all of that
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.800]  up and then we have other other reports here coming out today that are up on
[09:36.800 --> 09:42.840]  info wars.com dealing with a sheriff in Florida saying if somebody says they
[09:42.840 --> 09:48.520]  hate the government well then just call us and we'll send some psychiatric
[09:48.520 --> 09:56.800]  forces over there to deal with them and of course this is the new Soviet style
[09:56.800 --> 10:04.240]  system in America where you see a repeat of what we saw in Nazi Germany Soviet
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.640]  Russia and so many other authoritarian systems were outside of law the
[10:08.640 --> 10:16.680]  psychiatric system basically comes in and takes over the society and again
[10:16.680 --> 10:22.360]  we've got Jakari Jackson there riding shotgun with us today breaking a lot of
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.720]  this down he's going to have some other news reports here for us and I have the
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.000]  master sergeant David Schmecker joining us coming up at the bottom of the next
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.960]  hour rested for walking around in rural areas outside Waco Texas with his rifle
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.680]  with his son and the cops said we don't care what the law is we're gonna arrest
[10:40.680 --> 10:43.800]  you so it was feel good when the government has guns everywhere and
[10:43.800 --> 10:47.880]  wearing black uniforms and telling neighbors to spy on us but you don't
[10:47.880 --> 10:51.880]  go outside with your gun even in rural areas in Texas or we'll we'll take your
[10:51.880 --> 10:54.800]  gun and then charge you with resisting arrest even though there's video your
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.000]  son shot showing that's not the case because why not again here's the
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.720]  headline up on info wars.com it says Floridians encourage to report neighbors
[11:05.720 --> 11:11.720]  who hate the government one million dollar hotline characterizes descent as
[11:11.720 --> 11:16.540]  extremist threat a new one million dollar program led by Palm Beach County
[11:16.540 --> 11:21.840]  Sheriff Rick Bradshaw aimed at violence prevention how about preventing the
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.760]  globalists that run our country from murdering millions of people worldwide
[11:24.760 --> 11:29.560]  is encouraging Floridians to report their neighbors for making hateful
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.840]  comments about the government a chilling reminder of how the scent has been
[11:33.840 --> 11:38.200]  characterized as extremist threat Bradshaw plans to use the extra million
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.720]  dollars to write some more tickets their pal pay the cops 100,000 apiece to
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.040]  launch prevention intervention units don't run we are your friends this is
[11:48.040 --> 11:55.120]  not an assault more Tokyo roast of prevention intervention units featuring
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.760]  specially trained deputies mental health professionals and caseworkers the
[12:00.760 --> 12:07.840]  teams will respond to citizen phone calls to a 24-hour hotline hey East
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.680]  Germany had it's got to be good here but when we do it it's good of course let's
[12:11.680 --> 12:15.520]  make some more excuses for it everything will be fine with a knock on the door
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.200]  and a referral to the services that's adult CPS basically to kidnap you
[12:20.200 --> 12:25.840]  indeed it goes on reports the Palm Beach Post Bradshaw makes it clear that the
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.600]  kind of behavior which could prompt a visit from the authorities not the
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.040]  servants for the authorities includes anti-government political statements that
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.960]  may be deemed a prelude to violent action so it's not just a threat now it's a
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.680]  prelude to it but we want people to call us if the guy down the street says he
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.760]  hates the government comma hates the mayor see now hating the government means
[12:48.760 --> 12:54.040]  this next statement hates the mayor and he's gonna shoot him well obviously if
[12:54.040 --> 12:57.040]  someone says we're gonna shoot the mayor you need to in fact if they're
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.760]  serious call the police but see no no no now it's if you hate the government I
[13:01.760 --> 13:04.200]  can't tell you how many people have been visited by the Secret Service if they
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.440]  just say they hate Obama or Obama's a piece of garbage Secret Service shows
[13:08.440 --> 13:12.240]  up and demands people be fired like somebody sitting there right now their
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.440]  dad runs a car dealership and the Secret Service came and said your head
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.200]  mechanic said a little something he didn't like Obama we want him fired and
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.400]  of course in America people then follow their orders because they're so scared of
[13:25.400 --> 13:30.440]  the government but we want to we want people to call us if the guy down the
[13:30.440 --> 13:34.880]  street says he hates the government hates the mayor and he's gonna shooting
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.120]  Bradshaw said what does it hurt to have somebody knock on a door and ask hey is
[13:40.120 --> 13:44.000]  everything all right no they're gonna SWAT team you and maybe get another
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.200]  notch on their belt because mostly SWAT team guys like to hunt humans that's
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.320]  what's gonna happen a SWAT team's gonna pull up with a robot and they're gonna
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.160]  hope that you know that they get to come in and kill you or maybe burn your
[13:56.160 --> 13:59.920]  house down maybe maybe they can have them dance around the house and say
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.240]  we're gonna burn it down on the radio we're gonna burn the mother effort down
[14:03.240 --> 14:07.440]  and then burn it down on video and the and the media will say well they didn't
[14:07.440 --> 14:11.320]  mean burn it down they just said burn it down burn that house down burn that
[14:11.320 --> 14:17.720]  mother effort down so that's the type of garbage that we're dealing with here and
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.680]  again this is the Soviet rollout with Homeland Security funding everywhere I
[14:21.680 --> 14:25.720]  mean you can type in your cable guy is spying on you the phone repair person
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.440]  is spying on you I mean now whenever you've got any of these repair people in
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.120]  your office unless you know them in their patriots you better believe they
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.880]  now are our uppity secret agents of the New World Order see all the CIA ads on
[14:39.880 --> 14:44.360]  TV you know just recruiting people and they're there just recruiting under
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.640]  AmeriCorps and Secure Corps and all these groups just armies of clergy
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.800]  response team and in regard and just everyone there this is the new economy
[14:53.800 --> 14:57.240]  the new economy is going to be disappearing us and the labyrinths of
[14:57.240 --> 15:00.560]  the most imprisoned population in the world you thought the drug war was a
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.200]  fraud now it's going to be the secret police war on liberty lovers and it
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.960]  will actually create the war it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to create that
[15:09.960 --> 15:15.240]  actual war that is the program that is the plan that is what they're coming up
[15:15.240 --> 15:20.800]  with and it goes on the program will also include public service announcements
[15:20.800 --> 15:25.000]  as a quote this is not us this from the news with a straight face the public
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.080]  service announcements to encourage local citizens to report their neighbors
[15:29.080 --> 15:34.320]  reports the newspaper the program has sparked concern that the hotline could
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.440]  violate civil liberties what that that that conspiracy theory the evening
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.720]  rights or even be exploited to pursue personal vendetta's all that never
[15:43.720 --> 15:48.880]  happens with Brad Shaw's acknowledgement that anyone in a messy divorce or in a
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.600]  dispute with a neighbor could abuse the hotline and that would prompt frivolous
[15:54.600 --> 15:59.240]  complaints when they already take your guns just even a divorce period just
[15:59.240 --> 16:02.400]  it's just done out of hand everybody knows men are bad but discriminating
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.960]  against men is no big deal I mean men are bad we're evil I'm just enough this
[16:05.960 --> 16:09.080]  this phenol a in them in the in the plastics to make sure that doesn't
[16:09.080 --> 16:14.020]  happen your sperm counts down by 80 plus percent you know just enjoy it the
[16:14.020 --> 16:18.000]  caveat is all more chilling given the research of Florida State University's
[16:18.000 --> 16:23.640]  Robert Galletti into how Germans under Hitler well it's a conspiracy theory
[16:23.640 --> 16:27.280]  there was any authoritarianism because the terrorism doesn't exist denounce
[16:27.280 --> 16:31.800]  their neighbors and friends in Nazi Germany not because they genuinely
[16:31.800 --> 16:37.160]  believed them to be a security threat but because they expected to selfishly
[16:37.160 --> 16:43.880]  benefit from doing so both financially socially and psychologically via a
[16:43.880 --> 16:49.200]  Pavlovian need to be rewarded by their masters for their obedience and yes that
[16:49.200 --> 16:54.240]  is the essence of tyrannies throughout history is a groveling worship of
[16:54.240 --> 16:59.320]  government and the thrill that that that's why when somebody calls the cops on
[16:59.320 --> 17:02.760]  their neighbor for putting a rifle on the back of their car in Alabama even the
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.000]  SWAT team comes and then they go ahead and arrest him and take his guns and
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.600]  just say what we took him in for an evaluation because they've got to teach
[17:08.600 --> 17:13.240]  the public the only power you have is through the God state the only power you
[17:13.240 --> 17:16.480]  have is through worshiping the government the only power you have there is no
[17:16.480 --> 17:19.920]  individual there is only the worship of black uniforms the worship of black
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.480]  helicopters the worship of open borders the worship of checkpoints the worship
[17:24.480 --> 17:28.760]  of CPS taking your kids the worship of brain damage and autism off the charts
[17:28.760 --> 17:33.600]  the worship of GMO sterilizing rats fed to you and your family the worship of

[17:40.640 --> 17:44.320]  conspiracy theorist that is all there is is the total worship of the state and
[17:44.320 --> 17:48.800]  the Stanford Research Institute studies where they found over 90% of people are
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.760]  ready to kill they were ordered to but by their superiors well that is the
[17:52.760 --> 17:57.920]  priest of power that is the new God and you're a heretic evil demon who will be

[24:24.240 --> 24:35.520]  all right folks Alex Jones here back live ranting a little bit just because I'm
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.000]  so sick of the incremental expansion of authoritarianism and control freak
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.720]  systems where people build their lives through government and corporations
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.000]  that control the government instead of developing anything of use and then they
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.560]  lecture us all day how we've got to worship them it's a cult of government
[24:53.560 --> 25:00.520]  and insider corporate minions that I just refused to bow down and worship and
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.520]  then I look at this creepy sheriff you know just social worker commas are
[25:05.520 --> 25:18.960]  sheriff Rick Bradshaw and I I look at this guy and he's just sitting there you
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.440]  know telling us how great it is that we're just gonna drop by and you know
[25:22.440 --> 25:28.360]  talk to the person see how they're doing not off of a sworn affidavit not off
[25:28.360 --> 25:31.720]  of someone going in and filling out a criminal complaint where if they're
[25:31.720 --> 25:37.480]  lying they go to jail no just call the tip line and give us excuses to SWAT
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.200]  team whoever we want and of course they do that people constantly SWAT
[25:42.200 --> 25:47.280]  politicians and they SWAT bureaucrats and people with their own SWAT teams by
[25:47.280 --> 25:52.440]  calling in fake reports on them it's pretty ridiculous but you know this is a
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.000]  this is a hungry police state the biggest the world's ever seen but it's here
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.560]  for our own good of course and it goes on as the professor points out the
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.000]  program is also has disturbing throwbacks to help political dissidents
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.560]  were imprisoned in Soviet mental hospitals where criticism of the state
[26:11.560 --> 26:18.880]  was deemed philosophical intoxication hey but by the way sounds like an
[26:18.880 --> 26:21.880]  idiocracy where he gets a basically arrested because he knows how to talk
[26:21.880 --> 26:30.280]  that's like a crime there in the idiocracy world that reminds me of what
[26:30.280 --> 26:33.880]  we see happening in this country where again we have a government that's still
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.560]  torturing but but but again it's okay when our government tortures it's loving
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.520]  it's caring it's for a good cause and it's okay that we have spies spying on
[26:43.520 --> 26:49.760]  everybody and filling out false reports constantly it goes on under Stalin who
[26:49.760 --> 26:52.480]  nowadays I think should be known as a good guy and our government's adopting
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.000]  as policies dissidents were sent to infamous psychiatric prisons where
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.840]  they were isolated and brainwashed in order to have their political ideas
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.520]  discredited amongst the general public yeah and and now they just do that for
[27:06.520 --> 27:10.880]  trial when they stage a mass shooting they just electro shock you and drug you
[27:10.880 --> 27:14.440]  up and you know it doesn't matter if you're openly under Air Force psychiatric
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.960]  control in a DARPA mind control program just oh what's Alex oh or if I told you
[27:19.960 --> 27:22.840]  the unabomber like I told the reporter that's here from Esquire that the
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.520]  unabomber was in the MK ultra program he just looked at me like I was completely
[27:26.520 --> 27:31.480]  full of crap excuse my French because you know after all the the underwear
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.940]  bomber and the unabomber and all these other guys sure they were protected and
[27:36.940 --> 27:40.320]  shepherded by the government sure they had government connections but that's no
[27:40.320 --> 27:47.360]  big deal there he is over there I tried to get this Esquire reporter on the show
[27:47.360 --> 27:52.600]  and he said his editor wouldn't letting and by the way I didn't even know when
[27:52.600 --> 27:58.720]  I got this guy here to town to talk to us that he came to Austin I forgot I
[27:58.720 --> 28:02.560]  wasn't gonna be in Austin so he was nice to fly up here to Arkansas where I'm at
[28:02.560 --> 28:10.440]  and he he was like so you know I'm with the CIA or my dad was and I said no and
[28:10.440 --> 28:14.200]  he goes well I would expected you have to known that because I wrote a book about
[28:14.200 --> 28:19.000]  my dad it was involved overthrowing governments but he didn't like it so he's
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  been here trying to deprogram me you know to where I will accept that Obama loves
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.480]  me and cares about me and that the drone program is um is well a lesser a lesser
[28:30.480 --> 28:38.480]  of evils is that right John no comment oh boy so we're gonna come back with

[33:26.480 --> 33:29.680]  when we get our rights or liberties violated like a few months ago and the
[33:29.680 --> 33:35.840]  police tried to say we couldn't hand out in fours magazines in Austin Texas that
[33:35.840 --> 33:40.320]  then you know became part of the story we became part of the story because the
[33:40.320 --> 33:44.480]  establishment was trying to violate our rights but the fact that we've got I mean
[33:44.480 --> 33:50.360]  no exaggeration I don't know 1015 news articles a day the last few months most
[33:50.360 --> 33:58.600]  days demonizing us is really an example of how the power structure is getting
[33:58.600 --> 34:04.240]  more and more desperate and why are they doing that well you could argue that
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.640]  they think Alex Jones is a good way to smear at the Liberty Movement Richard
[34:07.640 --> 34:11.240]  do me a favor we turn my headphones up over there thank you because after you
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.760]  made that adjustment I can't even really hear audio thanks I want to be able to
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.160]  hear your car when we go to him in a moment thank you so what's going on here
[34:18.160 --> 34:23.160]  is Pierce Morgan's ratings have dropped to an all-time low again I'm gonna go
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.640]  over some of those numbers all of the mainstream cable is a shadow of what it
[34:27.640 --> 34:36.040]  just was five years ago and it is only intensifying it is only increasing and
[34:36.040 --> 34:39.240]  so they look out there across the landscape for something to attack
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.680]  something to go after and I guess my head here in the whack-a-mole game is
[34:44.680 --> 34:48.160]  sticking up higher than some other peoples and so they're going after us
[34:48.160 --> 34:52.120]  because they're scared to death that people will actually research what
[34:52.120 --> 34:57.400]  we're covering so they're not going after us predominantly because they think
[34:57.400 --> 35:02.760]  I'm a kook and an easy target they're they're going because if that was the
[35:02.760 --> 35:07.840]  case they would have me on more radio programs more of their TV programs no
[35:07.840 --> 35:15.080]  no they are going after us because we are becoming more and more effective and so
[35:15.080 --> 35:20.160]  it's important for listeners to realize that and to promote the broadcast and to
[35:20.160 --> 35:25.640]  tell their friends and family and to financially support us because Salon and
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.320]  others are going with the classic tactic I mean you've got mainstream media
[35:29.320 --> 35:33.840]  funded by big money sponsors I noticed they're funded by Wells Fargo here as I
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.560]  look at the Salon article that's the big bank caught laundering 378 billion
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.080]  dollars of drug money and running the narcotics aircraft a few years ago that
[35:42.080 --> 35:45.920]  was in Associated Press and even Bloomberg but here they are because see
[35:45.920 --> 35:49.760]  I'm bad because I'm not laundering drug money I'm bad because I sell high-quality
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.000]  vitamins and minerals and have firearms sponsors and have high-quality
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.440]  storeable food so people can be self-sufficient in this inflationary
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.040]  system the globalists have created they want us dependent they want us on food
[36:02.040 --> 36:05.880]  stamps no we're going to be dependent on ourselves so they write an article
[36:05.880 --> 36:11.400]  Alex Jones conspiracy ink and it goes on to say conspiracy theories can be big
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.880]  business that means questioning known dying media known liars known corrupt
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.200]  power structure that told us there were WMD's in Iraq knowingly the memos came
[36:21.200 --> 36:24.920]  out was on purpose conspiracy theories can be big business that's right if we
[36:24.920 --> 36:28.280]  build our own platform become successful that's bad here's how the
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.400]  multi-platform entrepreneur makes his millions his millions now it would be
[36:33.400 --> 36:39.000]  okay if I was making millions of dollars and keeping it but did Salon
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.840]  call us to try to find out how much money we actually make well here it is
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.320]  it's good to be Alex Jones Matt drugs the conservative web entrepreneur and
[36:48.320 --> 36:55.720]  news aggregator provided prolific or prophetic when he predicted in 2013
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.440]  would be the year of Alex Jones the longtime conspiracy broadcaster is
[37:00.440 --> 37:03.960]  finally breaking into the mainstream consciousness after a buzzy interview
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.560]  with Pierce Morgan and his Boston bombing conspiracy and traffic to his
[37:08.560 --> 37:14.000]  websites has never been higher the conspiracy business is booming so is
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.040]  the CNN's business booming when the bombing happened or a Salon's booming
[37:18.040 --> 37:21.280]  when they sit there and talk about me all day so they make money knowing I'm a
[37:21.280 --> 37:27.120]  hot topic oh no and make no mistake it's a business that's not to say Jones is
[37:27.120 --> 37:30.520]  the believer there are easier ways to make money but Jones has built a
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.760]  multi-platform new media empire in his Austin Texas free speech systems and
[37:34.760 --> 37:40.240]  reaches millions of believers and promises and advertisers that it will
[37:40.240 --> 37:46.280]  direct lucrative buyers to you from a daily audience of active enthusiasts
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.800]  yeah that's what the sales guys wrote they I ought to actually write my bio
[37:51.800 --> 37:58.080]  on the things on the website and all told Jones is very likely raking in
[37:58.080 --> 38:05.000]  millions yeah about seven million a year that's right and about six plus of
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.560]  that goes into the operation some of the other stuff we put into funds to then
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.000]  build larger projects and things I mean that's what I meant to Jones didn't
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.480]  invent the business model but he may have perfected it he comes from a long
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.280]  line of what historian Greg or Robert Goldberg calls conspiracy entrepreneurs
[38:24.280 --> 38:30.280]  and then it goes on from there to basically say that anybody that
[38:30.280 --> 38:35.760]  challenges the government is just basically a profiteer person so see
[38:35.760 --> 38:43.960]  it's not good from nowhere with literally no money for my family my
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.000]  dad did help me set up a computer program to take orders online and things
[38:49.000 --> 38:55.400]  like that in about 1996 and 1996 and he did help me set up a 1-800 number because
[38:55.400 --> 38:58.800]  I wasn't good at that so my dad did help me a little bit but other than that I
[38:58.800 --> 39:05.960]  100% on my own built info wars.com and in the new America that's not a good
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.640]  thing if you're a defense contractor getting hundreds of billions of dollars
[39:09.640 --> 39:14.080]  a year you know to build drones and weapons systems to bomb villages that's
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.760]  a good thing USA USA USA if you're a vaccine maker dumping deadly
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.320]  Gardasil shots known to kill people on the trials that doesn't even protect you
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.120]  from papillomavirus their own insert states on the public and having Rick
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.360]  Perry lie and say it's the law that you've got to take the shot so they
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.080]  could run the hoax and make millions of people take it that's a good thing if
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.000]  your MSNBC they get stimulus money to give Rachel Maddow raises that's a good
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.120]  thing if your general electric you know connected to the media and with all its
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.640]  defense contracting and stuff and so so you can pay your news division even
[39:49.640 --> 39:53.640]  when it loses money to propagandize that's a good thing but when you as an
[39:53.640 --> 39:58.400]  individual in the free market of ideas from nowhere builds your own media
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.920]  operation because you want to restore the Republic that is the nastiest dirtiest
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.760]  thing in the entire whole wide world ladies and gentlemen and again the
[40:09.760 --> 40:17.680]  reason that we are under such unmitigated attack is because we are
[40:17.680 --> 40:24.680]  effective we are effective and when I ran into Pierce Morgan's producer I was
[40:24.680 --> 40:29.440]  told where he was going to be at by the gun range in Houston so they said come
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.160]  down here as long as you're polite you can come in the back room and
[40:32.160 --> 40:35.840]  confronting as long as you're not rude people said well why were you nice because
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.080]  I told the guy to be nice and I went in and shook Pierce Morgan's hand and said
[40:40.080 --> 40:42.840]  why don't you have me on again and he said this is on video because we don't
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.240]  want to give you that much attention but I thought if you kicked my butt if it was
[40:46.240 --> 40:53.760]  this big victory why wouldn't you then want to have me back on if it was such a
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.920]  route the truth is it was an implosion in the hypnosis it was a implosion in the
[40:58.920 --> 41:03.320]  trance people are in so you see somebody go look knock it off you want to
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.680]  confiscate our guns and you know it so stop sitting there and acting like you
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.640]  don't when you've been on record saying people shouldn't have guns and when
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.760]  Bloomberg's been on record saying ban all the guns and when Obama as a state
[41:16.760 --> 41:19.440]  senator said he didn't believe in the individual right to own guns and the
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.080]  attorney general when he was deputy attorney general said the same thing and
[41:22.080 --> 41:26.760]  Sarah Brady has said the same thing stop sitting here talking to us like we're
[41:26.760 --> 41:31.320]  idiots con man stop sitting here telling me you just want reasonable
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.640]  restrictions because that's not what you want you want to register to then
[41:34.640 --> 41:41.160]  confiscate like mayors against gun violence propagandist Mike Martinez in
[41:41.160 --> 41:46.560]  Austin Texas mayor proteum said he said hey you see that sign out there saying
[41:46.560 --> 41:50.320]  don't ban our guns we're not gonna do that today but what we are gonna do now
[41:50.320 --> 41:54.360]  is the first step to making your sign a reality so keep that sign you're gonna
[41:54.360 --> 42:01.320]  need it and the whole crowd laughs we know the plan we know the best thing in
[42:01.320 --> 42:05.160]  society we're gonna get these guys incrementally while they armed to the
[42:05.160 --> 42:08.240]  teeth against us and I want to go to a David Knight piece and then come back
[42:08.240 --> 42:11.960]  with Jakari Jackson to get his take on this and so much more but you have heard
[42:11.960 --> 42:15.960]  me in recent times spend a lot more time about what's happening to info wars
[42:15.960 --> 42:23.120]  calm and prison planet calm because the system is gonna pick apart what we say
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.400]  they're gonna twist what we say they're gonna take it out of context and they
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.720]  are going to try to demonize us just like when they said Alex Jones says the
[42:31.720 --> 42:37.760]  government wants to make you gay with juice juice boxes for kids the whole
[42:37.760 --> 42:42.960]  ranch showed a bunch of news articles where the frogs are becoming sterile or
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.840]  having both sexual organs or hermaphrodites the fish are from the
[42:47.840 --> 42:51.760]  runoff of what's going on in our society and I've got government documents
[42:51.760 --> 42:55.000]  like the White House science our zone writings and eco science others about
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  doing that to us and countless other scientists so I know it's on purpose I
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.760]  talked to chemist they had hundreds of other plastics just as cheap they could
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.400]  have used that didn't have estrogen mimicers in it and that's part of their
[43:07.400 --> 43:10.000]  program they're now proposing putting lithium in the water they're now
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.120]  proposing putting men on estrogens to make us not aggressive this is
[43:14.120 --> 43:20.520]  engineering and this is mainline systems pushing this this is the
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.480]  conditioning this is the program that they brag they use soap operas and
[43:24.480 --> 43:28.280]  cartoons in the third world in here domestically to go after the family and
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.440]  to remove the man as the head of the household to make the state the head of
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.560]  the household and the parents is babysitters so so we know all of this we
[43:37.560 --> 43:44.400]  understand all of this and then they just said it was an anti-gay rant saying
[43:44.400 --> 43:48.000]  that everyone who's gay is because of chemicals doesn't he know about the
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.280]  Romans yes I know about the Romans it's not a judgment of gay people it's not a
[43:53.280 --> 43:56.960]  judgment of fish I'm not obsessed with fish being gay the point is we're
[43:56.960 --> 44:01.520]  chemically being manipulated and confused from what we're naturally born to
[44:01.520 --> 44:06.600]  be because in their own documents that we cover in in game 2.0 they break down
[44:06.600 --> 44:11.760]  how they plan to do this to break up the family just like brave new world talked
[44:11.760 --> 44:16.920]  about making people sexless and making them go into fertility early and this
[44:16.920 --> 44:21.760]  is what Bertrand Russell wrote about diet injections and junctions to turn us
[44:21.760 --> 44:26.720]  into adult sheep and that's what I'm frustrated by is that is that we are
[44:26.720 --> 44:31.120]  under con under massive scientific manipulation I don't like being under
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.640]  social engineering the social engineers admit they're doing it so much of the
[44:35.640 --> 44:39.600]  media is paid government propaganda and foreign government propaganda and it's
[44:39.600 --> 44:44.880]  the opposite of a free society whatever is the real popular driving force in
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.480]  culture should be in the free market of ideas the dominant system and the
[44:49.480 --> 44:53.920]  example and that builds renaissance that will take us to the stars not what
[44:53.920 --> 44:57.720]  they're establishing now here's David Knight in a four-minute report breaking
[44:57.720 --> 45:02.880]  down the unprecedented propaganda dealing with the bullets yes they bought
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.600]  millions of bullets and yes it's for us here it is you've got even neocons
[45:08.600 --> 45:13.720]  fessing up to what info wars has made the public aware of and former governor
[45:13.720 --> 45:16.840]  of Alaska Sarah Palin has warned that the federal government is stockpiling
[45:16.840 --> 45:20.960]  bullets in preparation for civil unrest adding that America is finished if it
[45:20.960 --> 45:26.560]  cannot deal with its debt problems she wrote that on her Facebook page and you
[45:26.560 --> 45:31.000]  know now you have you have neocons from Mark Levin Michael Savage now Sarah
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.920]  Palin admitting that the federal government is arming itself to the
[45:35.920 --> 45:39.840]  teeth and the only people who don't know about that now or who act like they
[45:39.840 --> 45:42.760]  don't know this is going on is the federal government now you've got neocon
[45:42.760 --> 45:47.360]  Sarah Palin talking about this from more on this issue we go to our very own
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.240]  David Knight so David Knight tell us a little bit about your thoughts on this
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.560]  issue well the media has gone into full damage control with this after Sarah
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.440]  Palin came out with it you've got Politico you've got Atlantic wire you've
[46:00.440 --> 46:04.480]  got Huffington Post you've got everybody basically saying these are debunked
[46:04.480 --> 46:08.800]  conspiracy theories and they're not debunked we're not making this up as a
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.360]  matter of fact it was Politico that even linked Sarah Palin to Alex Jones you
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.480]  know so she joins Alex Jones and Info Wars and looking at this I've got a
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.560]  graph here that basically shows how in the last ten months the DHS has ramped
[46:22.560 --> 46:29.440]  this up and Watson pulled these figures from FedBiz and from a couple of
[46:29.440 --> 46:34.600]  different sites here that are FedBid and federal business opportunities this
[46:34.600 --> 46:39.440]  one right here is actually a publication of the GSA this is the main
[46:39.440 --> 46:42.440]  source for contractors to get information about what the federal
[46:42.440 --> 46:45.920]  government is buying so this is public information this is coming from the Fed's
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.840]  site so there's no dispute that they're putting out bids to get these things the
[46:49.840 --> 46:54.160]  question is why are they buying so much ammunition well the media has tried to
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.000]  explain that away by with a couple of attempts first they came back and they
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.880]  said well they only last summer they said they start talking about the smallest
[47:01.880 --> 47:06.120]  purchases they talked about 174,000 from Social Security administration they
[47:06.120 --> 47:10.560]  talked about 46,000 from the Weather Service from NOAA and they tried to
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.040]  explain away and say this is just for practice this is for target practice but
[47:14.040 --> 47:18.240]  we're not talking about a few hundred thousand we're talking about hundreds of
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.160]  millions of purchases and when the very first one of these came out at 200
[47:22.160 --> 47:25.000]  million people were saying why are they buying so much ammunition but they
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.800]  quickly doubled down on that and bought 450 more million just a couple of months
[47:28.800 --> 47:32.320]  after that then a couple months after that they got another 750 million then
[47:32.320 --> 47:35.600]  another month after that they got another 200 million and they're just ramping up
[47:35.600 --> 47:39.320]  on this that's about war like if these bullets were all first of all talk about
[47:39.320 --> 47:42.960]  hollow points very quickly right and talk about war how let's just say this
[47:42.960 --> 47:46.800]  was all used for war how long would that be for good point you know when they
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.760]  talk about it being for target practice and they're talking about saving money
[47:50.760 --> 47:54.680]  hollow points are very expensive you don't use those for target practice so
[47:54.680 --> 47:57.680]  it's ludicrous from that standpoint if you know anything about firearms you
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.720]  know that they're gonna buy hollow points for firearms practice but if you look
[48:00.720 --> 48:05.120]  back at the amount of ammunition that was being used at the peak of the Iraq
[48:05.120 --> 48:09.440]  War that was five and a half million rounds a month okay so you're still
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.760]  looking at the quantities that they bought that would be about 24 to 30
[48:13.760 --> 48:17.800]  years worth of ammunition if they're fighting a war the size of the Iraq War
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.640]  I think they want to basically starve the marketplace of ammunition because if
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.200]  you've got guns and no ammunition it's like having a car with no gas okay it's
[48:26.200 --> 48:30.720]  pretty and one thing that they can do is they can essentially suck all the
[48:30.720 --> 48:33.920]  oxygen out of the marketplace suck all the ammunition out of the marketplace
[48:33.920 --> 48:38.240]  with these gigantic purchases we found out just a couple of months ago people
[48:38.240 --> 48:43.360]  going through looking at the recycling documents coming out of Fort Drum in
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.200]  New York found that they are not selling their one-shoes brass but they're
[48:47.200 --> 48:52.080]  turning it they're spending extra money to turn it into brass scrap and selling
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.180]  it to the Chinese as scrap metal instead of selling it back into the United
[48:56.180 --> 49:01.680]  States market as one-shoes brass which would help to keep the price of
[49:01.680 --> 49:04.520]  ammunition down right David thank you so much for that analysis thank you
[49:04.520 --> 49:11.480]  David all right so there is that report from like a month ago dealing with it
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.480]  and now there's even more purchases of the bullets and remember they told you
[49:15.480 --> 49:19.360]  that they weren't purchasing any bullets we were liars and they said okay we are
[49:19.360 --> 49:23.160]  getting them but they're not for you and hollow point bullets are for target
[49:23.160 --> 49:29.360]  practice while you just see a total training going on
[49:29.680 --> 49:35.400]  everywhere to take on the American people setting up classic spy networks you
[49:35.400 --> 49:38.800]  name it and they've always got these ridiculous coverage for why they're
[49:38.800 --> 49:44.640]  doing it this is 21st century propaganda where the general mass they'll have an
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.360]  effeminate police chief up there in a non-threatening way going we just want
[49:50.360 --> 49:53.880]  to be your friend we're here to be your friend you know we've come to your
[49:53.880 --> 49:59.640]  planet in peace you know here just just just just you know just take these
[49:59.640 --> 50:04.120]  shots and give us your guns and give us your kids and do what we say we want to
[50:04.120 --> 50:09.320]  make the world better for you golly gee we promise and of course I use the
[50:09.320 --> 50:14.080]  analogy of space aliens body snatchers you as a joke before the New York Times
[50:14.080 --> 50:17.440]  or somebody you know says I'm serious about that but they might as well be
[50:17.440 --> 50:21.760]  aliens from a foreign planet I mean it's just a culture of people that buy in
[50:21.760 --> 50:27.640]  to being conned by the system and the system is getting more and more and more
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.680]  and more out of control and you know the biggest thing hurting us is the
[50:32.680 --> 50:36.800]  television the mainline television they're dumbing everybody down the
[50:36.800 --> 50:40.040]  nation of spectators the average adult watches something like five hours a day
[50:40.040 --> 50:44.880]  the average young person eight hours of TV and video games and it's just a
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.600]  nation of a world more and more of people that just can't differentiate
[50:49.600 --> 50:55.440]  reality from fiction and so they can't even recognize classical flaming
[50:55.440 --> 50:58.520]  tyranny when it's stomping down the middle of the street towards them

[54:38.980 --> 54:43.280]  tourney as they make excuses for it they rationalize it because deep down they
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.080]  have mass Stockholm syndrome and are afraid of the system so they make the
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.240]  decision to cozy up to it as a defense mechanism believing it will protect them
[54:51.240 --> 54:56.360]  and this will not protect you from this cold-blooded disconnected corporate
[54:56.360 --> 55:00.360]  Borg that is taking over society and the fact that we've gotten away from real
[55:00.360 --> 55:04.160]  American values is why we are now going to go into bondage and they will just
[55:04.160 --> 55:10.200]  label bondage as a wonderful new thing and we'll label liberty as a thought

[56:16.760 --> 56:20.480]  30 minute interview rob dude did with the guy that went up and gotten down but
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.840]  on his face at how dare you ask questions how dare you say the government
[56:23.840 --> 56:26.960]  may have been involved he then went on to say that we said that no one was even
[56:26.960 --> 56:31.520]  bombed at the bombing when that's other people saying it's crisis actors which
[56:31.520 --> 56:36.400]  they do have for drills and things you know where they do these the mass
[56:36.400 --> 56:40.240]  shooting drills it's not us saying that we've interviewed a professor that's
[56:40.240 --> 56:43.680]  saying he believes that's what's going on from Florida and he just sat there
[56:43.680 --> 56:47.200]  with talking points attacking us maybe we'll hear some of that the third hour
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.320]  it was so amazing and then they put him on the news like he was a hero saying

[56:57.120 --> 57:01.560]  not ask the FBI known for staging things over and over again about drills they
[57:01.560 --> 57:06.120]  admittedly had that day and then I said they'll probably end up being caged by
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.480]  the FBI and basically protected and then now that looks like where this whole
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.320]  thing is going but regardless of what's behind it you're gonna have your
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.160]  liberties attacked here it is suspects friends charged in case you mass
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.760]  students alleged to have lied and removed evidence they reportedly went

[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:44.800]  are unfolding of course the war drums are beating even louder for love bombs
[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:49.720]  humanitarian peace bombs peace prize bombs maybe they put like pink little

[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:01.080]  or maybe when al-qaeda cuts the Christians heads off and throws them off
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:05.080]  the buildings and our media won't cover it as our government injects al-qaeda in
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:09.720]  maybe if they like gave the kids a little chocolate bar before they blow
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:13.080]  their heads off it make it all right because that's what Joseph Mingla would
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:18.160]  do maybe that made it okay give him a chocolate bar instead just with a
[1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:22.920]  Luger shoot little kids in the head but he was the state he was the government
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:27.800]  maybe people if they would have gone along and not fought Hitler he would

[1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:16.360]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:21.480]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that

[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:26.360]  austin texas alex jones
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:30.680]  all right here's the deal we're now into hour number two on this thursday
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:34.120]  edition we are broadcasting worldwide i want to
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:38.040]  thank all of you for joining us again on this
[1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:44.040]  thursday edition it is already the second day of may
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.360]  2013 and before i get to one of our top stories today
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:52.200]  that ties in with all the other news high school student faces 20 years for
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.560]  obama facebook threat and all he said was
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:00.440]  f the government f obama now again i don't use a lot of profanity
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:02.920]  because i think there's better words to describe things and i think if we
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.760]  obsess just over obama we actually give the globalist
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:09.960]  you know the upper hand because then when their system moves forward with a
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:12.920]  new puppet you know the next republican or whatever
[1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:16.440]  then it'll take a while to then expose that guy instead of exposing
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:19.480]  the people the special interests that are doing this
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:22.920]  and that are running over our rights and liberties and and trying to codify
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:28.360]  laws to overwrite our laws which is completely unconstitutional
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:32.920]  and and and you know flies in the face of liberty so we're going to get to that
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:36.040]  because i mean here's the deal
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:40.840]  i i think we've got a good duty now to go to
[1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:44.360]  facebook and to go to twitter and everywhere else
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:48.120]  and say what this guy said so we're going to get to that moment to talk about
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.400]  free speech they can censor us on facebook which they're doing at
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:54.520]  epidemic levels when we send out photos of the drill
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:57.640]  the bombing drill the police with the backpacks the military with the
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:01.320]  backpacks the fbi freaked out and said media don't look at these at the press
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:03.480]  conferences they had tried to have secret service
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:06.920]  outside their jurisdiction go and get in our reporter's face there's video of
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:09.560]  all that they're really clearly trying to cover
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:12.680]  something up and we said they'd have a drill they had a drill we said the fbi
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:16.120]  and cia would be all over these guys they probably would have been sent as cia
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:20.840]  at least hammerland to the caucuses under cia programs because they run all
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:23.960]  the major terror in the caucuses i mean basically all of it
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:28.120]  the russians blew their cover all of that came out
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:33.320]  because it wasn't hard to predict this most terrorist stage to provocateur
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:36.600]  to one extent or another they at least opened the door up
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:39.640]  and they used to take our freedoms we predicted that and they freaked out
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:42.600]  and and and facebook we have the screenshots of this and our listeners sent us
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:45.880]  the screenshots would not let us post articles
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:49.400]  linking to the boston globe about a drill
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:52.920]  because they're so scared that if people find out about this ladies and
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.080]  gentlemen they're going to discover they knew about the whole thing
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.120]  bare minimum just like the first world trade center bombing where the
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.280]  government cooked the bomb trend the driver all the rest of us we're going to
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:04.520]  go to your calls here in a moment but i wanted to get you know jacari jackson
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:07.560]  to show tv viewers radio listeners you can go check out
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:11.240]  it's on infowarstore.com the new
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  may issue of the magazine is in it will guaranteed sell out
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:18.600]  we sell them in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:22.280]  at cost where comes up like a dollar a magazine
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:26.600]  a big color glossy the old-fashioned rolling stone you know version
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:30.040]  uh hundreds of thousands of those are going to go out we're going to put about
[1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:33.960]  80 000 the streets of central texas from awesome down to san Antonio
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:38.120]  and there are three bumper stickers full size info wars dot com
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.760]  save the constitution so there's one that says info wars dot com one that says
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:47.000]  save the constitution under info wars dot com and a prison planet dot com and
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.680]  if you will especially in san Antonio and austin other areas in the hill
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:53.880]  country if you will go and get these four or five of
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:57.560]  these off the stand before other people get them and put them on your barn on
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:00.680]  your book bag on your car give them to friends
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:06.200]  we can put just in central texas 300 and something thousand bumper stickers out
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:09.720]  and by the way if this is successful i'm going to start putting
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:14.360]  him uh i may do three or four pages of bumper stickers in each magazine
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:18.360]  we may try to put 10 million bumper stickers up around america
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:21.800]  and see how the new world order likes that because
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:28.040]  just like the globalist when they were controlling the cia and hadn't fully
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:31.720]  taken it over yet were claiming they were overthrowing authoritarian
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:34.680]  countries for the betterment of the world really they were doing it for
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:38.520]  standard fruit or uh was it united fruit or
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:45.400]  you know all these other interests we can overthrow the globalist in the mind
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.000]  by by calling them on their fraud by calling them on their hoax
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.040]  by calling them on how out of control and disconnected they are
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:55.880]  and a big way to do it just as the french resistance put up v
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:01.160]  v for victory uh to counter the swastika we are going to put in full
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:04.600]  wars dot com bumper stickers up all over america
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:08.920]  on your business on your property on your business sign
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:13.240]  wherever it is legal and lawful or in commons areas where everybody puts up
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:15.800]  stickers and things and it's left alone in the bar district you know they'll
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.760]  freak out when we do it and say how dare of them put it in full war sticker up
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:21.560]  where thousands of other stickers are the point is
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:24.840]  get them get them out to everybody and if this is a success
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:29.880]  it costs me about 40 000 to do this i will just pump the money because that's
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:31.880]  why they're so freaked out about us making money
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:35.240]  i will pump the money into initiatives like this i will pump it into more
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:38.040]  reporters more journalists i want to hire a bunch of
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:41.080]  classically trained journalists we're doing interviews right now
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.440]  with newspaper editors and other people to come in and help us go over all our
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.280]  data to help us codify to help us hire more writers
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:51.400]  more journalists we're trying to go to the next level
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:55.480]  with me is kind of the whirling dervish Tasmanian you know
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:14:00.680]  patriot at the middle of it but but i'm trying to build a larger organization
[1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:03.960]  to really take on the new world order and really find the truth
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:08.120]  because it is a very complex world and i in general terms know the globalists
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:12.120]  are just distasteful degenerate eugenicists based
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.280]  predatory scum who try to sell the world on their altruism when it's actually
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:19.400]  opposite but we're going to drill down into all their operations
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:22.200]  we're going to go after them on every front that's what i'm really attempting
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:26.200]  to do so by the pro pure water filters i don't usually plug stuff this much
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:29.080]  because it's freaking the system out i'll start plugging even more
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.520]  you don't like me raising money well you watch in fact if i get a million
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:36.440]  dollar donation i will spend every dime on it publicly
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:39.720]  to put bumpers to one million dollars would probably put
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:42.680]  i haven't done the math and it's like forty thousand dollars to get
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:45.800]  three hundred four hundred thousand things at four thousand stickers total
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:49.720]  and then put them in a magazine what would a million dollars how many
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:53.960]  stickers would that be tens of millions i mean it's just crazy
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:56.920]  uh you know we've got the hundred thousand dollar hundred fifty thousand
[1:14:56.920 --> 1:15:00.280]  dollar film contest uh just to get a bunch of viral
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:03.240]  awesome films made and then have a winner and then make films and then
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:05.960]  we're going to put the films out for free on the internet so they can be seen
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:09.160]  hundreds of millions of times how do you like that new world order
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:12.120]  white house run media matters all you other scum
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:15.400]  how do you like that we're not going to stop and here's here's what
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:20.600]  here's what uh that the cia run national review
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:24.040]  had to admit they said if jones has done anything he has been the most
[1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:28.200]  successful person at creating grassroots aggressive journalist
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:31.880]  like we are changed and like all the other groups
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:35.560]  they accurately recognize that that we
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:38.920]  have pioneered the idea of citizens because i've been doing this for 18
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:42.440]  years going into press conferences and asking real questions
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:46.680]  and and shutting their lies down and they are scared of every one of their
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:49.800]  press conferences having citizen journalists even if you don't agree with
[1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:52.920]  me on a lot of stuff you you think you've got the answers
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:56.200]  go in there and shake it up don't be cookie cutter go into those press
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:59.160]  conferences and take them over and i want the money to hire
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:03.400]  15 reporters and fly them all over the country to take over press conferences
[1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:06.920]  that's what i really want to do but it takes money to do that
[1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:10.440]  so they're scared of us making money go to info wars dot com and just
[1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:13.800]  click on the sponsors support the sponsors support our local amen anthem

[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:24.200]  and we will sit there and just pour that money out on top the new world order
[1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:28.200]  in the most vicious truth focused savage attacks you can imagine
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:31.480]  you better believe it i'm going right for the juggler on these people i'm

[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:40.280]  their trance out of their coma they're now arresting kids that say f obama
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:44.600]  you got a right to say that bunch of authoritarian scum

[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:08.040]  high school student faces 20 years for obama facebook threat
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:11.720]  yes and keep in keep in mind alex just as for the context of it
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:16.200]  you remember last election cycle where uh many people were threatening mit romney
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:18.840]  you know similar to this guy i'm pretty sure most of the people were just
[1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:21.800]  blowing awesome steam or whatnot but yeah but they were on facebook and
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:25.480]  twitter saying kill mit rom yeah they said kill mit rom i'm gonna shoot him and
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:28.600]  i'm not saying that media don't take it out of context and white house run media
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:32.200]  matters and people i like to do what i'm saying is is they other people were
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:34.680]  saying it by the thousands and it was no big deal
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:38.520]  this guy just said ething he didn't call for violence well he did have a
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.280]  rap song and most people don't take rap song seriously had
[1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:45.640]  a snoop dog recently had the uh the nonviolent
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:49.320]  song that he made but i just want to read this one article for this one quote
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:52.600]  from the police chief he posted a threat in the form of rap
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:56.440]  where he mentioned the white house the boston marathon bombing and said
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:00.200]  everybody you will see what i'm going to do kill people and then he went on to
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:04.040]  say f politics f obama and f the government
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:06.840]  and if we can put his picture back on the screen you can see him right there if
[1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:09.880]  you're on prisonplanet.tv that guy does not look like a terrorist
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:13.080]  mastermind to me but if you've been watching the news looks like an idiot
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.000]  yeah they they've been saying all 19 years fully exactly fully getting into it
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.320]  than a rap song where he says you're not gonna believe what i'm gonna do to the
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:23.400]  government well that just you don't get arrested for
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:25.400]  saying i'm gonna do something to the government you have to actually be
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:28.680]  planning to do something of the government yeah and how this happened is
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:31.960]  i guess one of his friends at school or you know somebody at school saw
[1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:35.320]  facebook post and they took it into the principal the administration and the
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:40.520]  administration called the police and i guess the guy was arrested and charged
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:44.120]  charged and potentially faces 20 years for a facebook threat
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:47.480]  and many people write many yeah but see the way the media responded it was f
[1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:51.240]  obama what he's really in trouble for saying kill people in a rap song
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:54.120]  oh yeah it's a rap song i mean how many people has
[1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:59.320]  m&m dr dray 50 cent how many people m&m dr dray they're always talking about
[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:02.280]  killing people and again they put that on it well it's like kids they have all
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:04.840]  this violence and video games and culture and then kids get in trouble
[1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:07.400]  because they're playing with water guns in their front yard now
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.560]  i mean it's just totally disproportionate you can't be this big violent empire
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.920]  and then not have people sit there and at least mimic it in their words
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:17.880]  yeah just like when you did the report about the kids and the pop tart guns
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:19.720]  and the hello kitty guns and we went to
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:23.560]  tours or us and all the other toy stores and you just saw just aisles
[1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:27.560]  of water guns and dart guns and you know dress up like the military and
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:30.200]  shoot your shoot your sister and all that kind of stuff
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:33.000]  it's definitely something that's being advertised to kids even this guy
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.640]  probably listens to a lot of uh gangsta rap music
[1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:41.560]  and just decides to uh imitate it well that's another thing is that you
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:46.840]  imitate what the mainstream media does and then you get arrested
[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:50.280]  it's just amazing jacari jackson thanks i'll be riding shotgun with us more i'm

[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.360]  info wars
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:40.520]  you know and what are you so radio stations
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:44.120]  yeah i don't really understand what you're saying man
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:48.680]  uh you know how you got your your look your your radio show is on uh you know
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:52.120]  local radio stations and everything well they should uh have a
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:55.880]  i was saying you should try to get them to get their own show on local radio
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:59.640]  stations later on in the day so you know when people are driving their car they
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:02.760]  flip through you know on their way home as they all stick seven o'clock at night
[1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:06.360]  they can hear zikari jackson and david night on
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:10.840]  yeah it doesn't really work like that uh you know we're starting a news operation
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:14.040]  and then we do plan to do radio down the road
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:17.880]  but it's it's it's not as easy as you think to just start shows and then
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:21.560]  syndicate them second new show i want to talk about
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:26.440]  was uh michael stavage uh i i was kind of thrown back by you
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:31.080]  you uh you kind of promoting him because he never mentioned anything about
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:34.040]  info wars even the day of the show uh i
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:36.840]  that's known to see if you mentioned he was on your show he never mentioned you
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:41.480]  one uh his backstory is uh it's something else
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:45.000]  that he used to hang out ailing ginsberg back in the 60s
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.160]  which was he says that stuff that's been said about him and that is not true and
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:53.400]  and uh paul watson does listen to the show and does say that he plugs in full
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:57.160]  wars uh and has and said that he said that we
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:59.640]  should ask questions about the drill with the bombing
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:02.600]  but i don't listen to savage a lot i mean i think compared to a lot of the other
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.160]  people on talk radio he raises some important points
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:08.200]  i don't agree with some of what he says i just had him on the show
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:11.720]  because they were trying to basically black out his book
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:15.880]  about communist chinese influence in our media which we're seeing more and more
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:23.160]  with iron man and uh world war z and uh the remake of um
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:29.880]  the remake of uh red dawn they uh they uh cut that as well
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:34.600]  uh show so that's just some of what's going on
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:38.680]  i just you know uh a lot of times you know like he was on another day or a
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:41.560]  couple weeks ago and he said he's seen a muslim woman
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:45.400]  going into the store and he said uh oh i looked into her eyes i've seen the
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:50.600]  devil because islam is the devil and he's he's really a hatemonger and uh
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:53.880]  he wasn't as bad before he got fired and then when he was picked up by cumulus

[1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:42.680]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:47.640]  and my philosophy is very very simple whatever the globalists promote whatever
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:50.200]  they push with all their excuses and reasons
[1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:54.360]  i oppose i resist if they're for open borders
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:58.040]  i'm against it if they're for taking my guns i'm against it
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:01.480]  if they're against the family i'm against them
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:06.840]  if they are against national sovereignty i stand against that that's a good
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:09.800]  place to start and then you can go through each one of those topics
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:12.760]  and issues and see how there's a global corporate government
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:16.760]  forming that is above the law and exempts itself from its own laws that it
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:21.400]  foist on to us and that is not trying to
[1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:24.680]  build a better world altruistically as they claim
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:28.920]  but that is trying to secure their ill-gotten gains
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:32.200]  that predominantly come through fractional reserve
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:39.080]  banking fractional reserve banking where these
[1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:42.680]  select groups are allowed to basically create all the currency and credit
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:45.400]  they want and then loan it out to you on interest
[1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:48.120]  well if you can loan out unlimited money at interest what are you really
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:51.800]  looking for more fiat money back no you're looking for people to get
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:59.480]  overextended domesticated in debt and then collapse the society to consolidate
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:04.040]  like the willy nelson song with the high women the bankman tells me he likes me
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:07.400]  says he's my friend
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:12.360]  but he ain't my friend for the exact words of the song but
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:16.280]  that's basically it you know bankman says he likes me
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:19.880]  no that's not what's going on now is that saying there might be a corner banker
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.840]  who's a nice guy that actually tries to take risk and loan people money
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:26.600]  yeah but it's the little banks that aren't allowed to basically engage
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:30.120]  in all the same type of creative bookkeeping the big banks can do
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:33.800]  and all those trillions and zero percent interest money
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:37.560]  that the fellow reserves created for its member banks it's loaning you out
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:43.320]  that money at sometimes 30 40 50 interest they've gotten rid of the
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:47.560]  usury laws in this country or they've reversed them depending on
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.120]  the state where now corporations have protection from usury
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:56.760]  but individuals don't and you go up to these poor people that don't know what
[1:35:56.760 --> 1:36:00.360]  they're doing and you say oh i'll give you this loan it's real good
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:04.920]  that turns out to be like 30 compounded interest and you ruin that person's life
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:09.400]  and make them a debt slave and then you call that free market
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:12.200]  and then meanwhile if you criticize those big banks
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:17.400]  you are anti-establishment you hate the government you are an extremist
[1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:22.200]  our government more and more is a collection of private central banks
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:26.280]  that have come in and taken this country over and they brag about it in the
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:29.720]  foreign press how they've conquered europe how they've conquered america
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:33.560]  how how their technocrats above the law on and on and on
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:37.720]  brett in montana you're on the air welcome

[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:01.160]  be on their heels it's something really uh inspiring
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:05.000]  yeah it is historic that that that that we were able to get on the bombing day
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.160]  one and that the drill came out of the bombs
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.800]  and the and the guys being cased by the fbi and cia connections and
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:18.200]  and russia blowing their cover and killing the one brother and tape of them
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:22.440]  saying don't shoot don't shoot uh you know all the rest of it you know we
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:24.440]  didn't do it we didn't do it the other brother
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.440]  climbing out of the boat not shot in the throat and minutes later barely
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:32.120]  can't you know and and you know all bloody can't talk
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:35.000]  and then saying he confesses from his hospital bed
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.840]  when and then the american system or any other free system have you ever had
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:43.320]  the person in the hospital bed and they leak that he's confessed
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:49.400]  so that you prejudice everyone i mean i hope they don't
[1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:53.480]  you know put me in the hospital cut my larynx out cut my vocal cords out and
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:57.240]  say alex confesses you know oh yeah i mean why not just torture
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:00.360]  people right there in the courtroom they already drug people now in the courtroom
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:03.720]  to make them quote tell the truth why don't have electroshock therapy right
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:07.000]  up on the stage i mean they already guys pull this up because i was telling the
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:10.600]  reporter this earlier he he didn't he didn't believe me and i don't blame him
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:15.080]  it's so crazy pull up a court rules taser can be used
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:19.160]  to make you answer questions i'm sorry caller go ahead
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:22.280]  yeah you know i just want to say real close i was talking to my oldest son
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:26.600]  last night we still down in the la area um
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:34.760]  you know he's 15 and uh he is all rigged inside jobs but they're not
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:38.440]  fooling anybody and the word is getting out
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:42.280]  and uh so a couple things that i wanted to
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:47.960]  cover was um a local uh story that happened here
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:52.440]  uh in columbia fault you cover the story uh i think it was the day of the
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:56.680]  bombing so uh you know i've been waiting for all
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:39:02.360]  of this to kind of go over so i could call about this
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:05.640]  you know that gentleman uh mr downand who was
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:12.360]  tasered and and uh killed uh
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:15.080]  there's a lot of things that they're really not talking about
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:19.080]  in that news article that you got from the local paper here
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:25.880]  um my uh my wife actually worked with mr downand at this just the
[1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:30.520]  living home before he was transferred to the to the v a home
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:36.280]  and and uh my my mother actually worked at the home and so i know for for a
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:39.080]  fact that the residents there are actually allowed
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:43.160]  to leave and go about the business as long as they know that they're
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:49.480]  uh going to make their way back so for them to report that he was running away
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:55.560]  first of all is a lie and um you know for those that don't know about the
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:40:00.040]  case it's funny that i mentioned tasers that's what you called about um
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:02.840]  that's the case where they squatted for like 10 minutes and beating the death
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:05.880]  right and break his neck
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:10.120]  uh they tasered him and and then he was the son he was actually the son of a
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:14.040]  cop too right yeah i'm not sure i know
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:17.880]  you thought a world war two uh veteran i i believe
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:22.040]  um but he was well i mean there's so many people they taser and kill but
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:25.320]  i mean i saw the case in southern california with the schizophrenic guy
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:29.000]  whose dad was the cop who they absolutely beat the death and they sat there
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.600]  and then squatted on him and killed him and uh
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:36.680]  i mean that's just that's just what goes on and you know my point on the tasers
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.280]  is this is all part of paying compliance but go ahead and get to the point i mean
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:42.840]  what specifically are you saying about this case
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.000]  well you know i just would like to um
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  get your opinion on on on on what to do to stand up
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:56.920]  to local tyranny because i i've never done this before and you know i have
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:00.440]  serious issues with the local police
[1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:04.280]  uh forced it into the way they're acting along with the
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:09.640]  uh local uh um well this is how police act in a third
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.400]  world country in america is by and large now a third world country
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:17.080]  and it's going to get worse man i mean look people want status
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:20.360]  and the ultimate status in a tyranny is the uniform this is this is the
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:23.800]  worship of the uniform this is the north
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:28.520]  koreatization uh of our republic and i would go to city council and talk
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:30.840]  about what you're seeing the police do i would
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:34.520]  i would go a hundred times i would run for office and and
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:39.160]  bring it up in the debates i would form a citizens group that films the police
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:42.600]  uh and you will you will end up reforming them in the in the
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:47.320]  long term what has an effect is this just you know the chinese water torture
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:50.600]  of just drip drip drip never stopping i appreciate
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:56.200]  i appreciate your call man good points um let's go ahead and talk to rodney

[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:40.360]  saying that you had that you know that feeling in your stomach you know when
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:44.200]  you saw uh you know that video about the about those
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:47.960]  people getting their kids taken away this is exactly what you mean because i
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:52.600]  mean it was absolutely exactly the same thing for me when i watched that video
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:57.400]  feed and i need to uh you know and this follows also
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:01.000]  that you know the things that happened in florida as well with the you know
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:05.880]  with the the parents that they found a little bit of marijuana on and they
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:09.080]  took their kids to just that's just incredible for me
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:12.920]  and you know i left the u.s 13 years ago i go back you know
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:17.400]  several times a year of it but uh you know i'll be honest with you with all the
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:23.560]  stuff that i see uh you know and uh on youtube and stuff for police
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:26.760]  brutality that i've been checking out since i've been awake
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:31.240]  and you know it's it's actually very scary and i need to i need to call you
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:35.960]  back call you out on something um because i you know i'm i'm not advocating
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:42.040]  violence in any way shape or form but honestly alex i mean from your heart
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:49.000]  if if that was you and you were here and some police and children services
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:53.800]  came to your house and tried to take your kids away from you
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:44:00.440]  what would you do by the way i haven't even played that video yet i i
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:03.640]  sent it to chris on monday and i never got to it
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:09.320]  guys will you pull up that four-minute video it was in a don salazar's article
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:12.760]  and i've since turned on the television saw it on national tv
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:16.120]  where the couple didn't like the hospital care they were getting
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:19.480]  and so they took their child to another hospital so the cops came and attacked
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:22.920]  and knocked the dad down in his house and then say you're going to give me
[1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:25.800]  that baby and then take it away and it's just
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:31.240]  they're just nuts it's the family courts where there's no due process
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:37.320]  they can do basically uh whatever you whatever you know they want to us and
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:40.200]  yeah it did make me physically ill and then you say
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:46.840]  you're calling me out because i'm i'm not calling for violence but i mean you
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:50.040]  said i'm not i'm calling you out but i'm not calling you out
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:54.280]  because you're not calling for violence but what would you do
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:59.240]  um number one i would know how to talk to the scum at the hospital
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:02.840]  uh and say look i know you criminals kidnap kids all day
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:05.560]  and you're on power trips and you're little authoritarians
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:09.240]  just like the stanford you know university study
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:14.440]  you'd follow any order you were told but but you've engaged in malpractice here
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:18.040]  you shouldn't have the child and and and i would first have my
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:21.880]  lawyer call them knowing how criminal they are because if they hurt your kid
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:26.040]  they'll try to blame you if they kill your kid they'll try to blame you
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:29.240]  if they shoot them up and your kid dies in the hospital
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:32.840]  they'll try to blame you um this is what they do
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:36.040]  not everyone's a criminal that works the hospital but there's a reason
[1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:38.680]  authoritarian regimes always use hospital people
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:42.040]  they'll follow orders they have a disdain for the patients
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:46.680]  uh in in many cases because they're sick of dealing with you all day
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:51.880]  and they see humanity in in bad shape uh and uh we're just a decadent satanic
[1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:55.880]  society uh and and and yeah the hospitals are
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:58.840]  there to kidnap your kids they're there to pray on you
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:02.040]  and when you go in to have a baby they they've asked your wife you know
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:05.160]  are you doing okay with money uh is he nice to you
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:09.240]  and they don't reach your rights there they're about to take your kid
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:12.840]  uh especially if you're a good looking blonde hair blue eyed woman or if you
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:16.360]  got black hair and green eyes your kids are gone no matter what happens
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:20.280]  they've got like a half million dollar bounty on those kids uh and they're
[1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:23.480]  there feeding on the kids just like all authoritarian regimes have done
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:27.560]  they want the children and uh now it's a national news story that
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:30.920]  you know they almost killed this these people's kid they had them on antibiotics
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:34.680]  when the child had the flu there was one mistake after another
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:41.000]  um who's the actor from enemy mind uh he was he was in the right stuff what's
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.720]  that actor's name
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:47.800]  he's actually friends with one of my friends yeah yeah Dennis Quaid
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.720]  they almost killed his kids but see if he wasn't a celebrity
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:56.200]  they had to take in his kids you understand that's what they do
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:46:59.160]  and uh the most dangerous thing in America is a hospital
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:03.480]  and yeah and i am i mean i i am nasty about this things are out of balance
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:06.600]  with these people so i don't know what i would do
[1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:09.720]  you know quite frankly
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:12.520]  um
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:17.480]  quite frankly it would depend on the situation
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:21.320]  but obviously it's it's it's like it's like baiting someone or
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:25.800]  daring a five-year-old to go jump off a bridge to say or you i dare you to do
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:28.520]  this i dare you i dare you to stick that in a light socket you know what are you
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:31.320]  going to do with the cops come and take your kids i mean i don't think anybody
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:34.920]  should say what they're planning to do if they were planning something i always
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:38.040]  get these emails once you call for a revolution of course you know it's
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:40.920]  usually a provocateur or a fed but sometimes it's real people and of
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:44.760]  course they're the ones that want you to go out and cause some violence
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:48.440]  so they can like stir up a fight at a high school to like see two guys speak
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:54.040]  the hell out of each other uh but i would probably uh not resist it
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:59.960]  uh and then i would destroy everyone's lives suing them over and over again
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:03.720]  going after everyone following people when they go to bars
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:08.200]  showing them picking up hookers i mean i would ruin everyone's life involved
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:12.520]  and they all know that i would i would i would i would absolutely destroy
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:15.800]  everyone politically but see i have a little bit of political power
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:19.240]  but even before back when i was just a little local talk show host i learned
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:26.360]  how to go after bad guys um so i would get my kids back uh and uh but but see the
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:29.240]  state likes it to be out in the open they're taking innocent
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:33.080]  families kids and then keeping them no matter how much evidence there is
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:35.880]  because it just trains everybody to accept it how many times have you seen
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:40.120]  parents that show their boys or girls hugging each other you know one's in a
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:43.800]  towel the other's in the towel and they just hug each other and then they call
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:47.720]  it pedophilia and take their kids but the un can be running giant child
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:51.400]  kidnapping rings worldwide in the news and no one gets in trouble
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:54.760]  the truth is they're the perverts they're the scum they want your kids
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:58.040]  they have an appetite for your kids they'll be right next to a social worker
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:00.520]  that actually means well that's such a bleeding heart
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:04.040]  airhead that that they just go along with it
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:08.120]  there's a reason cps has a 50 plus percent turnover rate per year
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:11.880]  because all these people go get degrees generally because they were abused
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:15.800]  and they really want to go quote help people uh and then they find out oh my
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:19.080]  god this is really a pervert guild this is really a pedophile guild
[1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:23.320]  this is really or a mercenary guild a lot of us is buying and selling the kids
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:28.120]  or they can get 200 300 400 500 000 per child through the adoption rackets
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.800]  see because of abortion there are more people wanting to adopt each year than
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  there are kids they can even get and so that's what people get kids from south
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:39.080]  korea kids from china kids from you know africa kids from
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:44.040]  latin america but in a lot of those cases the kids are kidnapped too
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:47.560]  but let me tell you these rich families they will pay
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:53.880]  200 300 400 000 they'll want to see photos the cops a lot of times
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:57.400]  will actually take photos of the parents that are provided
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.240]  to the adoption agencies i mean if you've got a
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:05.000]  bombshell looking wife i don't care if you've got i don't care if you're young

[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:16.520]  it's over you that's the rarest you walk into one of those hospitals
[1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:20.600]  they are hunting your butt i remember my dad saying because he worked in

[1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:31.480]  he goes do not sign the organ donor card and i said why and he goes well some
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:33.800]  hospitals won't give you care if you signed it
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:38.360]  they'll let you die and i said well i didn't believe him and he said i i've
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.080]  been told it goes on in dallas 60 minutes years later i didn't believe him
[1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:47.400]  but i still didn't sign it 60 minutes reported

[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:01.560]  mean what about what about the i saw people commenting on the youtube
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:05.480]  video from the show last week where i talked about how we got the business
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:11.160]  um census that was going to be every 10 years now it's
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:14.440]  going to be every year they're talking about some businesses every month
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:17.960]  and people are like i didn't get this census it isn't real
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:25.960]  well you don't run a business dummy it's like how people will do back flips
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:29.240]  mental gymnastics to not look at what's going on
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:32.760]  and to always say that's an isolated incident that's an i know it's not an
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:37.240]  isolated incident we had police in austin a couple
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:40.680]  months ago say we couldn't hand out our magazine
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:43.560]  and and and then they said by the way you can't have info words on your car
[1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:46.200]  parked at a parking meter we say that's a violation of the
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:51.320]  advertising uh zoning ordinance and then i and then i got on the phone with
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:53.800]  him because i wasn't down there and i said are you joking and go look i'm a
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:56.840]  listener i don't like doing this i've been ordered to do this by the city
[1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:00.360]  i said you get your boss down there so then the deputy head of zoning
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:04.120]  enforcement comes down and i said fine i'm going to sue you all i'm coming
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:08.440]  and then they backed off but the point is i can't have a bumper sticker
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:14.200]  until i threaten to sue you lunatics the cops should have said no way i'm
[1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:17.880]  gonna write them tickets for bumper stickers on their freaking car excuse
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:21.400]  me excuse me man i'm sick of this and i'm sick of
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:25.720]  sitting here trying to get this country out of a coma
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.760]  and it really made me even sicker when i got down there in the cops role hey man
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:31.960]  we'll take photos with you we're all listeners we're all nice guys
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:37.160]  we didn't like doing it but exactly why did you follow the order why did you
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:41.960]  write the tickets to our street team why why why
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:47.400]  why do all these good people go along with this i'm sick of it
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:52.200]  it's like rdcveta the police chief's in my office a few weeks ago he's on here
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:56.200]  and i'm sitting there talking to him and i go look i know you guys can dial in in
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.400]  the threat fusion center thing and find my cell phone wherever i'm at without a
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:02.360]  warrant and him and and the deputy cop you know
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:04.920]  his assistant brought with him smiled to the window
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:09.240]  and artist said he goes well so what what do you have to hide
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:14.040]  what do i have to hide buddy why do you have walls up around your house
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:16.840]  it's not because there was something to hide but you know what you might want to
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:21.000]  go get on the toilet in privacy you might want to argue with your wife in
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.880]  privacy you might want some privacy buddy it's my
[1:57:23.880 --> 1:57:28.200]  privacy and i'm not guilty because i want it you freak
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:31.240]  government is making everything more and more secretive
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:34.680]  arming to the teeth giant underground bunkers full of food
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:39.480]  and we go hey we better get prepared something's going oh that's crazy
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:42.680]  but then the government lies and says they don't have cog plans
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:47.080]  for the public the government lies and says we're not playing anything there's
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.960]  nothing going on here which makes it even more creepy
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:53.000]  talking to this sq. guy and he goes well of course we're a big country they've
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.880]  got to do that and yeah they've got to have basic
[1:57:55.880 --> 1:57:59.080]  plans of a tidal wave hit the west coast or
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:02.920]  a meteor hit something but but they're not even doing that
[1:58:02.920 --> 1:58:06.760]  they have zombie drills all over the country where they practice with heavy
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:10.520]  machine guns mowing down masses of americans
[1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:13.640]  and they used to do it without calling them zombies but the marines are like
[1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:18.520]  we're trained to kill americans so they went oh it's a zombie drill
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:23.240]  it's a zombie drill to dehumanize us
[1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:27.320]  it's like the nazis said we're not killing jews we're killing rats
[1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:30.760]  and one of the la times to pick me as a rat
[1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:33.960]  i'm a rat saying the government might have been involved in the bombing no

[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:42.040]  first off this is a common alliance this isn't a leader follower you're not my
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:45.960]  leader you didn't make me the way i am i am the way i am and i saw a brother in
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:50.280]  arms who saw the world as it is we're not really you know addressing problems
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:53.880]  to identify the the enemy you know the enemy it's a potato
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:57.400]  every time i read the news i'm saying oh well potatoes got out of the potatoes
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:00.760]  a root family it grows on the dirt you know it's brown it tastes good when you
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:04.680]  put salt and pepper and butter on it it's a potato so we know it's a potato
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:07.480]  so what are we going to do with the potato all right first off
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:10.920]  info warrior street team i think it would be a good idea to maybe have a press
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:14.840]  pack with like five or ten t-shirts pass bumper stickers all the kind of good
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:17.240]  stuff that you want to go do person to person
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:20.440]  camp out in front of walmart camp out in front of the mall hand out the
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:23.240]  information let's get a hundred thousand street
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:26.920]  teams all across the country handing out t-shirts bumper stickers brochures
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:30.120]  flyers shaking hands meeting babies whatever
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:36.840]  all right second off uh i think something that we maybe might work
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:40.040]  i don't really know of any law that prevents somebody from burning their
[2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:43.320]  social security cards so how about we get our you know a million people three
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:46.120]  million people uh in front of the federal reserve when we don't burn our
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:48.200]  social security card and we succeed from
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:52.440]  you know the irish that's right the exactly this is one argument that no
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:55.640]  establishment can have even though they claim they're altruistic the private
[2:03:55.640 --> 2:03:58.680]  federal reserve and the 17th amendment turning our senators into federal
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:01.720]  minions the income tax created the same year
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:05.320]  paid to the private federal reserve is a foreign alien
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:09.640]  uh fourth branch of government and we've even got green span on pbs saying
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:12.600]  they're above the law and then and then no agency
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:16.520]  no agency of government can investigate them and it's just horsemener
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:20.440]  i want the federal reserve out of my life now god bless you and i appreciate

[2:09:56.120 --> 2:10:01.240]  to staging attacks on themselves women saying republicans threatened to rape
[2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:04.520]  them and then it turns out the posts were posted by them

[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.560]  absolute creepville
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:05.640]  taking place all over the united states as the public just has no connection
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:09.720]  to the bill rights of constitution and so why not just be completely overrun
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:16.360]  here's another one suicide rates skyrockets among middle-aged Americans
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:23.240]  and that is a article out of breitbart
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:27.160]  and they ask why is it skyrocketing so much
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:30.600]  and again i'll get to that after we take calls well i mean gee why are the
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:33.400]  troops committing suicide mass i see these articles going
[2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:37.400]  top psychiatrists don't know why they have no idea
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:40.920]  from the pentagon gee the pentagon's not going to tell in itself making people
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:44.680]  serve five six seven eight tours that sergeant
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:49.160]  bales that went and reportedly killed 18 people and some type of delusional
[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:51.720]  rage he was under psychiatric care reportedly on
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:55.160]  psychotropic drugs but they won't say which ones he had part of his foot
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:57.640]  blown off he was being sent back for a fourth tour
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:01.400]  he'd been arrested by police for going bonkers on his wife
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:06.040]  reportedly and out in the woods that all got expunged
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:09.800]  and then they sent him back and then he watched the ied blow up an armored
[2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:13.000]  vehicle and kill his buddy and watched his buddy bleed out
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.640]  and then the next night he climbs over the wall
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:20.040]  and goes and slowly kills and burns 18 people including children
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:24.840]  at multiple houses in a sleep walking rage
[2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:28.760]  yeah you put somebody i mean the folks they put prosthesis on these guys now
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:32.520]  and they'll get back out there i mean you wonder why they're committing
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:35.880]  suicide last numbers i saw seven times any previous record
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:39.560]  from the end of the vietnam war in 74 now you wonder why americans are
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:43.640]  because this is a screwed up society that's why filled with preservatives and
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:47.720]  gmo and a toxic culture of death
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:52.360]  and i'm just railing and flailing around i went out of it too
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:55.400]  i'll tell you the story and then i'll go to your calls i promise
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:12:58.200]  i said i take a lot of calls which i never can do so
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:02.600]  i'm out of control i just do what i do i went to the mid america science museum
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:05.640]  that has the biggest tesla coil reportedly in the world that's what
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:07.720]  they say and the biggest one i've ever seen
[2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:12.840]  and i've seen a couple of them and uh i'm going to upload that video to youtube
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:15.960]  but my camp my phone's not been logging into youtube as i dropped it in the
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:18.520]  sink the other day so we're going to try to get these videos up
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:23.480]  or when i get back tomorrow we'll do it but the point is
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:31.560]  is that they had this thing called uh our underground arkansas
[2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:37.080]  underground arkansas and i thought you'd go on there to be like crystals and
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:40.120]  little gnomes or something you know allison wonderland or
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:43.320]  it would show it's like underground arkansas like is a minor
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:46.840]  no it's like a it's like a c i e tortured box they
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:50.280]  you know put people in they torture you know they lock them up in a tube or a
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:54.760]  box that's what it was and my kids go in there and nobody there wasn't a
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:59.000]  sign saying don't put adults in this so i and i'm not claustrophobic i mean i've
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:02.920]  gone spelunking and you know things i i don't particularly and i've done some
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:06.440]  cave diving open cave diving you know gone back in like 50 feet and
[2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:10.040]  still conk my head and stuff and i just don't particularly like it but
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:14.760]  the point is is that i go into this thing and i go all the way back into
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:18.280]  there and it's one tube barely because i'm a big
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:23.880]  guy with 250 pounds i got broad shoulders uh and uh good size you know
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:28.840]  belly when i'm at least sitting down and i'm going through i'm like man okay
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:31.640]  this has got to be the one tube so there's another tube and another tube and
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:35.720]  another tube and another tube and another tube my kids are laughing and
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:38.120]  having fun because they're a little they can go through it
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:42.200]  and then you go through like these nightmare things with like the you know
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:48.760]  these ropes you're in and and when i got out of it i was sweating and stuff and
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:52.360]  i'd eat the big barbecue meal here i'm one of the best barbecues i ever had
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:54.920]  i think it's called mclared's mclared's or something
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:57.560]  bill clinton's favorite barbecue place i later learned it is world famous but on
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:00.120]  the cover of playboy magazine because they had that hanging out the place was
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:03.000]  like criminally good thank god i don't live in hot spring
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:06.040]  arkansas folks because i thought the best barbecue happens in memphis and i love
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:09.960]  texas barbecue don't get me wrong with this was sinfully delicious
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:13.880]  and it's a real dive too it's made even better
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:17.560]  and uh so i've got that in my stomach and i come out sweating
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:21.320]  and i had this realization i said this is what
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:28.360]  i feel like with the new world order it's like claustrophobia light i mean i was
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:31.880]  drawn to media and tv and radio because i
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:35.160]  didn't like them trying to demonize private property rights demonize the
[2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:38.360]  family demonize men demonize the second amendment
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:41.880]  because it upset me at a fundamental free spirited
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:45.640]  rebellious whatever you want to call it level
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:51.320]  and and i realized the feeling i get right now is like being in those tubes
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:54.920]  so people don't know what powers the show that's what's powering it
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:58.600]  that's why i'm angry because i but by the tenth tube
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:04.920]  i was ready to get out of there imagine a big mess in almost total darkness
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:07.880]  like it was total darkness till you come out in these areas with a little bit of
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:11.480]  black light i mean can you imagine the people they
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:14.120]  lock up like the north vietnamese would do to our soldiers
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:17.160]  in like cages for years smaller than their bodies
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:21.080]  and they would get off on it all those you know
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:25.160]  asian forms of torture and then all the medieval european tortures and then the
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:29.000]  tortures they do it's because they like it folks you know the cia hired to run
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:32.280]  those torture camps people jail guards from around the
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:35.480]  world who'd been kicked out for raping people and torturing people the truth
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:38.840]  is they torture because they like to do it and they like to get fake confessions
[2:16:38.840 --> 2:16:43.240]  they like the power of it look at our culture it's obsessed with torture and
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:48.120]  stuff in darkness and it just absolutely makes me
[2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:51.960]  want to throw up and i'm telling you being under the new world order is like
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:55.480]  watching our whole society in tubes that get smaller
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:59.720]  and smaller and there's all this propaganda of why it's good and why
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:04.280]  we're lucky and how it's a great thing and how we should appreciate it no
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:07.800]  no i know it's bad history shows it's bad and our founders
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:11.960]  said the stuff that's going on is bad bad bad and and
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:15.720]  any amount of perfume can be put on this but it's still
[2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:19.800]  it's still this whole new world order is a dead rotting pig in a box
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:24.280]  i'm telling you that's what it is and i just i had this epiphany
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:28.520]  for the last couple of tubes and i kind of relaxed and i was like this is
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:31.800]  this this is what i feel like talking about the new world order
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:38.280]  this feeling it's disgusting all right i said i'd go to your phone calls i'm
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:40.920]  trying to punch up the phone system we're gonna we're gonna skip this
[2:17:40.920 --> 2:17:43.320]  network break i'm gonna skip this break as i said i'd take
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:46.680]  nothing but calls and i've gotta i've gotta follow that promise by
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:51.000]  skipping breaks if i have to it's like salon says all i want is money
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:54.040]  actually it's kind of true i do want money to destroy the new world order
[2:17:54.040 --> 2:17:58.680]  let's go ahead and talk to joe in illinois you're on the air go ahead
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:05.320]  hi alec happy police adoration day from springfield illinois uh the cops are
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:09.160]  honoring themselves today with formations and parades
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:13.160]  and i just want to say that um i totally respect the dead
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:19.480]  but i respect all dead you know coal miners in my opinion are heroic people
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:23.400]  and oh my god i really respect coal miners now
[2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:27.640]  it's funny you mentioned that yeah after that's a dangerous profession yeah
[2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:31.000]  after they're told that that you're gonna die if you've been on there to save
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:34.680]  your buddy they go anyway so and and here's what i want to
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:38.840]  compliment you i know you hate compliments but the two things that
[2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:43.720]  they keep me listening and keep me interested but aside from the
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:47.320]  information which the seeking of truth is this
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:51.320]  two things your work ethic is second to none
[2:18:51.320 --> 2:18:56.360]  okay i was listening to you when you used to go eight hours a day on air
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:19:00.440]  the second thing is you never use profanity on air
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:05.240]  and that is very commendable it's worth complimenting i hope people appreciate
[2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:09.720]  how hard it is to sit and rant and rant and rant and never
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:13.960]  you can say hate ease instead of hell okay i mean
[2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:17.480]  well i know we have children listening but exactly but sometimes stuff is so
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:19.960]  bad you know you've got to be like you when the
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:23.640]  police are saying burn that effort down and then said they didn't mean that
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:27.080]  with dorner you have to quote them without you know you have to say the
[2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:30.520]  effing because it's the police that set it on the scanner but yes i do try to
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:34.680]  keep the show as clean as possible that's that's just uh you know
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:38.120]  it's it's it's a it's a statement to your
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:41.480]  you know what i would call your intelligent
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:46.840]  pursuit of of this of a scholarly type you know environment
[2:19:46.840 --> 2:19:50.920]  you know ignorance people who have no other
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:56.760]  you know words to use cuss and swear like jill rogan i mean i'm not putting
[2:19:56.760 --> 2:20:01.400]  him down and and especially the guy that criticized uh dandy

[2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:47.960]  anyway i had a comment to make and i had a question to ask you too but
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:50.600]  because of your show there's been going on there's a couple other things that
[2:21:50.600 --> 2:21:53.480]  came to my attention i wanted to make a comment
[2:21:53.480 --> 2:21:56.840]  why is it that all of everybody keeps referring
[2:21:56.840 --> 2:22:01.320]  this government or this corporate fastest regime as i call it as a
[2:22:01.320 --> 2:22:03.960]  government for one thing it always surprises me
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:11.080]  and that and uh number two um um also uh i wanted to
[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:14.280]  talk about the dumbing down of america i know in the in the couple your shows
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:17.880]  you were you know i guess it was sarcastically or whatever
[2:22:17.880 --> 2:22:23.080]  saying you know um uh you know usa usa and it's like
[2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:26.760]  no matter how stupid people are even with these petitions that have been these
[2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:29.640]  mock petitions that have been going out is incredible
[2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:33.320]  uh fanning pressure cookers now uh trying to turn a police
[2:22:33.320 --> 2:22:36.200]  state into more of a police state and people just mindlessly
[2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:39.240]  and you can just see their body brainlessly just sign this stuff it's
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:43.000]  absolutely amazing but anyway getting to my point i
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.880]  most of you listeners i'm sure remember flip wilson
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:50.520]  and uh remembering flip wilson you you know you have to appreciate the way he
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:54.280]  told story but there was one spin he did that i remember he may have heard it
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:22:57.880]  maybe some of your listeners may have heard it but it was called uh do ruby
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:01.800]  mcdonough ring a bell well anyway in the middle of this skit
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:05.480]  there was a part where flip wilson was talking about the story in this and you
[2:23:05.480 --> 2:23:08.600]  have to just picture how flip wilson did this and at this time it was
[2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:13.720]  funny but today it's so right on and of reality it's unbelievable but he
[2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:17.800]  talked about this uh king called king mcdonough who ruled the kingdom of
[2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:21.080]  begonia and he said like he says that's why they called it king with
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:25.000]  kingdom of begonia because that was his name so king begonia would come out on
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.480]  his perch and all the townspeople would be
[2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:30.600]  gathering around to listen to his big speech and he'd be
[2:23:30.600 --> 2:23:33.880]  and all the people are out there going yay king begonia
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:37.960]  yay king begonia and king begonia would come out with his speech and he would
[2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:40.920]  say all those that have anything it shall be taken
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:45.480]  away from them and everybody's still cheering for king begonia king begonia
[2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:49.880]  and then he says and all those that have nothing shall have even less
[2:23:49.880 --> 2:23:53.080]  and the people are just still cheering king begonia
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:56.680]  i won't finish the whole story because it gets into it but just we just uh
[2:23:56.680 --> 2:24:00.760]  bit in the middle of this skit and when you look at it today that's exactly it
[2:24:00.760 --> 2:24:04.040]  seems like what's going on you know what happened
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:07.320]  in fact we were we're going to send our reporters out i think mark dice has
[2:24:07.320 --> 2:24:10.280]  already done that we were planning it weeks ago great minds think alike
[2:24:10.280 --> 2:24:14.280]  to go out and say let's ban pressure cookers now in fact i want that asked
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:18.600]  wordy man on the street today in austin we're going to go up and say we want
[2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:21.960]  you know women's right to after birth abortion
[2:24:21.960 --> 2:24:25.480]  uh to uh you know be the law and then and then and then
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:29.080]  have a printout of the journal of bioethics having an article about
[2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:33.000]  killing children up to age three and maybe print out the cover of the case
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:36.840]  for killing granting on newsweek and then say hi we're here for
[2:24:36.840 --> 2:24:40.520]  you know you know we're here for the death panels uh like to sign a petition
[2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:44.680]  that uh you know austin texas uh euthanized the old people
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:49.960]  uh and then but but you've got to say it's liberal and go uh
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:54.280]  and as long as you go uh uh that's the key
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:24:59.720]  as we've shown in these if you don't do the uh uh uh uh you've got to do that
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:03.880]  to activate their mind control to show that's why npr talks like that
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:08.440]  it's it's all delphi technique it's very loving
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:12.120]  everything i mean if they could have tanks just going loving
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:15.400]  loving and people would walk and lay their children down in front of it for
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:18.440]  the treads to run over them they would just dance around the blood
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:22.760]  as long as the loudspeakers went liberal liberal do you understand that
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:26.600]  they would just worship obama just all americans should bow to obama a hundred
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:29.560]  times a day and just have thousands of drones just bombing other
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:33.080]  countries with huge video screens of the video of the bombs
[2:25:33.080 --> 2:25:37.320]  coming in and splattering everybody and just mountains of dead and dead people
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:41.400]  and just worshiping that with just huge loudspeakers going uh
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:45.480]  liberal uh it's liberal how's that sound
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:50.280]  that sounds great hey one other thing i'm sorry go ahead
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:54.200]  hey that's not as good as flip wilson's king begonia
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:57.880]  well hey uh one other thing you mentioned earlier
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:01.240]  about you know getting involved with the political arena and going to these
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.440]  meetings and doing all this kind of stuff and and everything and getting
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:08.600]  involved with this so we can you know uh take a charge of some of these things
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:12.680]  well anyway i know a group of us here in oregon and this has been an ongoing
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:17.320]  issue right now for probably several years i'm sorry i was being liberal
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:21.080]  that's right and the information we gather right now we have
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:25.400]  we have a sheriff's department and eight county commissioners on the chopping
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:28.840]  block for racketeering and official misconduct with the evidence we went to
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:32.600]  a meeting last night and there was a fireworks call but we have this on
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:35.640]  tape video and everything of the crimes that these people have committed
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:39.640]  including the sheriff's department put it on youtube just just like keep going
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:42.600]  after him brother put it on youtube and we'll cover it god bless you good to
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:44.840]  hear from you uh let's go to another one there i was
[2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:48.920]  being illustrating absurdity about being absurd there earlier
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:52.760]  i think they should give the bombs what they dropped on libya and now that
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:55.640]  they're giving to al qaeda to attack surya with they
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:59.320]  they should give the bombs peace prizes
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:02.440]  and they should give the un forces that are involved in mass murder all over the
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:05.400]  world they should give them peace prizes they should give their bayonets
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:09.800]  peace prizes uh as you put like bayonet cams on them when they stab
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:13.080]  villagers just because you know that's cheaper than just blowing them up or
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:18.280]  shooting them like they uh helped uh the globalists to engage in in rwanda
[2:27:18.280 --> 2:27:23.080]  that then they could give them the uh the the machetes peace prizes
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:26.600]  let's go ahead now and go to the next caller here i'm trying to punch up my
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:30.600]  call list for some reason it's not there uh

[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:48.440]  confiscated the guns or it's the bavarian soviet republic

[2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:15.000]  bianna justice ministry in 1927 the first thing they did
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:19.240]  turn in your firearms the other issues you know you were talking about to check
[2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:22.440]  a courtroom where they put you in a small confined area
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:25.880]  and slowly now put quarks in the wall so that you
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:29.880]  gradually suffocate that's one of their tortures but you mentioned this before

[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:10.280]  info wars full-size bumper stickers inside and
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:17.560]  if you are in central texas there are 60 000 in austin and 20 000 in san
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:20.440]  antonio and then a few thousand others in some other
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:24.520]  hill country areas you can go to restaurants or wherever
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:27.960]  when you see a stack of these take four or five copies and give them to
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:32.680]  friends and family but make sure they all get put up
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:36.360]  make sure but do not put them on anybody's private property
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:42.120]  put them on your private property or in commons areas where it is common
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:45.400]  practice for people to put up bumper stickers and you know there's restaurants
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:47.480]  where they want you to put your bumper sticker up
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:50.680]  there's there's there's there's like the sides of bars where there's thousands
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:55.400]  of bumper stickers you know stuff like that but but only put it
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:59.320]  in legal and lawful areas now and then again if you want to order
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:03.480]  say 10 magazines at cost and get them for like 14 bucks i think that's what 10
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:06.680]  of the magazines cost isn't it because you know that includes the shipping and
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:11.880]  everything okay then then you can
[2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:17.480]  then you can have 30 bumper stickers these are high quality these are like

[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:43.080]  patriots they're terrorists and then they then it got bad they found a pocket
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:47.480]  constitution in my film police state and the police go
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:51.320]  i don't know this is legal and they start going

[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:08.040]  i don't know if this contraband is legal uh
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:12.200]  uh is that is an extremist stuff
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:20.120]  i mean it was like porky pig with a lobotomy and they take her to jail
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:24.440]  and she the trial was on tv and the trial
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:30.280]  it was like uh that that listener in lion county kentucky kelly rushing
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:34.040]  he calls in and goes i got arrested for handing out your films
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:38.200]  i gave a state police officer them and then uh he pulled me over the next day
[2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:41.800]  and laughed to his wife on the cell phone i've got the vhs bandit
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:45.160]  and they charged him three counts it was a ron paul speech
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:50.840]  called neocond on slow play vhs tape my film wrote a tyranny and one other film
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:54.520]  and they said this is anti police and we find it threatening
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:43:57.720]  and they took him to trial kelly rushing was in the local paper
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:00.840]  and i didn't believe him at first i was still naive you know like 11 years ago
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:02.280]  this is right when the film came out
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.240]  or i was about 10 years ago and so i called the paper and they go yes
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:12.600]  mr rushing is being charged uh and and i was like okay and then i called the
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:15.960]  judge at home he's like yes mr jones uh i don't
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:18.360]  can't talk about the trial but yes we're going to be having the trial next
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:22.120]  week you'll have to follow it there and i was like what so i called and got a
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:25.400]  hold of kelly rushing i kept his number you have to report on this for us
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:28.680]  quarp and uh they went to trial and tried to
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:32.760]  put him in jail i think it was seven years it was five years in jail for each
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:36.680]  count they have memory serves it was going to be consecutive 15 years in
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:40.040]  prison and the cop got up and and and rushing
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:44.680]  got up in his own defense and said i i gave him the video and i said
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:47.800]  and then when he pulled me over a couple days later the next day whatever it was
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:52.280]  he said that was anti-law enforcement oh and one of the charges was also
[2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:55.480]  the guy said why did you give me that he said well i care about you and your
[2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:59.000]  family and then that was a charge mentioning his
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:04.440]  family mentioning his family was another threat
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:07.880]  and it turned out kelly rushing was like a prominent family old
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:12.600]  you know pillars in the in the community a bunch of you know nice people
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:16.440]  but in america they have a hunger to literally put us in jail
[2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:21.160]  so uh i'm sorry travis in nebraska yeah i have the articles
[2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:24.520]  that you mentioned here a cnn's reporting on it
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:28.520]  and and so where others is an epidemic an epidemic
[2:45:28.520 --> 2:45:32.040]  across the country of so-called leftists they're really
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:36.520]  authoritarians trying to act out and be a celebrity in
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:42.840]  in in sovietization and so you know they they put swastikas on their dorm
[2:45:42.840 --> 2:45:46.760]  or they you know they burn a cross in their yard or they
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:50.600]  claim the right-wingers raped them and they have candlelight vigils and if
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:53.960]  anybody questions that they're evil and then about 98 percent of the time it
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:57.640]  turns out to be fake but then there's epidemics all over the
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:01.000]  country of black folks who have been so filled full of
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:04.360]  racism by msnbc that whites are inherently racist and evil
[2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:08.520]  that that groups of black people like what the klan used to do to blacks
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:13.560]  are now beating up uh whites who are so domesticated on record including
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:16.680]  newspaper people they roll over and flop around the ground
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:20.040]  so i guess they deserve it no way i mean that's just and and and this is
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:23.240]  happening all over the country and the media has articles about
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:28.120]  struggling with reporting it because it is just maybe we deserve it
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:32.360]  maybe white should all walk out in public and slit their throats find a
[2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:35.160]  black person grab a big double-edged knife and just go
[2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:39.000]  hi i am evil just play blood all over me go
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.440]  just bleed out and then chris matthews will dance in the blood and
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:46.200]  it'll be a big celebration i mean you know i mean that probably
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:49.240]  wouldn't be because whites are being murdered tortured killed
[2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:53.080]  attacked all over the country and and and there's never going to be a candlelight
[2:46:53.080 --> 2:46:56.760]  vigil the news won't even say that it's what blacks doing it and again i love
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:00.360]  black people but but there are but there are racist black people filled full of
[2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:04.760]  this whole thing and that's all the media trying to create division in this
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:08.280]  country the media wants to create division
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:12.520]  and wants to keep and and keep people fighting with each other in this nation
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:15.640]  so what do you think i think they should erect giant woodchippers
[2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:20.440]  in every town center with a with a run by the city and police so it's all safe
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:24.520]  and for the children and the and the people that want to prove it they're bad
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:27.880]  um evil whites that want to prove it they're bad that they just walk up the
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:31.800]  stairs they turn it on and and everybody claps and you throw yourself into a
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:36.440]  high-powered woodchipper how does that sound amazing but the reason that i
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:40.040]  did call it it's like having scales taken off of your
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:45.320]  eyes uh in july 2nd of this past summer i was playing flag
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:51.640]  football scraped my elbow i i i uh developed a
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:55.080]  an abscess in my armpit because you're a racist
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:47:59.160]  yeah because i'm racist no and long story short
[2:47:59.160 --> 2:48:05.080]  um i went septic septic shock everything i they couldn't tell me what was
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:09.240]  wrong with me in the hospital i it was a miracle like a one percent chance of
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:13.240]  me surviving it i had five surgeries and three five or six
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:17.640]  surgeries three days i see you for a week in the hospital for about a month
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:23.000]  uh it's a it's a parasite um that they couldn't identify that came out of
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:26.840]  southeast asia i mean i bet i had i don't even know how many cdc guys coming in
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:30.920]  and saying what were you doing what did you eat for the see you're being
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:34.520]  hold on hold on you're being racist again yeah no uh uh here's the deal the
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:38.600]  third world takes antibiotics like it's candy it's sold in all the shops
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:43.800]  all this antibiotic cream ointments uh the soaps here
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:47.800]  are making the bugs absolutely high powered within three generations with
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:51.880]  most insects they become resistant or immune within 10 generations almost all
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:54.520]  of them become completely immune to poison what do you think happens with
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.000]  bacteria whose life cycle is a lot quicker than even insects
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:03.240]  arachnids bugs you name it whatever the type of insect is
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:09.320]  and you're absolutely right there is just hordes of disease pouring in double
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:12.200]  two two and i feel sorry for the third world
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:16.200]  i mean i i wish we could help them but the point is instead america
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:19.560]  and the globalists and their lust to collapse things quicker and to get a
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:23.160]  voting block that has no history of freedom there are just parasites and
[2:49:23.160 --> 2:49:27.000]  brain parasites and and weird mosquitoes and i mean look
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:30.840]  at fire ants they came from brazil where now under globalism
[2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:33.720]  i mean it's kind of like westerners coming here
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:36.440]  who were immune to smallpox are resistant because all their ancestors
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:39.720]  had already died from it so they have the genetics to be resistant and it wiped
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:43.800]  out most of the natives that wiped out some estimates are 90 of the natives
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:47.640]  so they don't have to be even be killed uh and again that was wrong but the
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:50.520]  point is is that what were you getting at with this loving
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:55.240]  parasite what type of loving parasite was it you racist
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:50:01.480]  i survived um it i went from 185 to 148 in three weeks uh it was a miracle to
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:05.560]  the doctors it was a whole thing what is the loving parasite racist
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:09.160]  okay anyway since i've walked out of that hospital
[2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:12.600]  i have been called by different government agencies
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:16.440]  uh they've identified themselves as a uh a
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:20.600]  bureau of something uh my taxes they've asked
[2:50:20.600 --> 2:50:24.600]  it doesn't matter what i bet it i've had 10 or 11 phone calls and they say the
[2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:27.000]  same thing every single time where are you living
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.960]  what are you doing where are you working are you married

[2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:42.360]  on in the government they tell us when we're supposed to care and i know i've
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:47.400]  been obsessing on that lately but i don't just turn it on and off
[2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:50.440]  like don't you care about the boston bombing and those that died

[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:19.080]  say say that parasite against we can pull it up on screen for tv viewers
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:24.040]  what are they saying it is travis i did that they sent my blood to
[2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:27.800]  six or seven different places and they all came back we can't identify this
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:31.720]  the best they could do is say it's a strand of i hope i'm pronouncing right
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:36.600]  penicillium um freely i i believe and they said it the closest
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:40.920]  relative it has is out of southeast asia so it was like a one penicillium
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:44.040]  well it could have come in on dust and stuff against the atmosphere
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:47.560]  uh could have come in from outer space but i mean penicillium isn't that in a
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:51.480]  fungus family yeah it's a mold or a mold family uh
[2:55:51.480 --> 2:55:57.160]  yeah uh very interesting travis just go with it you
[2:55:57.160 --> 2:56:01.160]  should have given your body over to the fungus and have been one with it like in

[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:31.880]  charles t cell i had his lawyers and people on they kept him in jail for
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:37.480]  years after years uh he was in charge with those medicare medicare fraud
[3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:43.000]  and no no not charged arrested and then they said you're mentally ill for it
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:48.440]  issuing a not guilty plea we're going to put you in a prison and drug you with
[3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:55.480]  antipsychotics got no criminal record and and they just rotted him and uh i just
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:00:59.880]  remember all these victims now in this case in a landmark decision united
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:03.240]  state supreme court imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court
[3:01:03.240 --> 3:01:05.400]  to order the forcible administrative or
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:08.840]  anti psychotic medication to a criminal defendant
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:11.720]  so the supreme court did the right thing and that at least partially who had
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:15.400]  been determined to be incompetent to stand trial for the sole purpose of
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:20.200]  making them competent and be able to be tried
[3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:23.400]  well they just found them incompetent because he said it was a conspiracy and
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:27.640]  the government can't do a conspiracy against you that's mentally ill
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:32.040]  specifically the court held that lower courts could do so only under limited
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:34.760]  circumstances it was one of those things where it was both ways
[3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:40.600]  and a specified criteria had been met and i and i forget even them what
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:43.720]  happened in the case but i think they just ignored the
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:47.800]  ruling last time whatever happened to him
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:51.880]  subsequent developments in 2004 cell was found
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:54.760]  competent to stand trial and the trial was scheduled a week before the trial
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:58.520]  began the prosecution defense claimed that he was mentally unfit for trial
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:01.800]  they kept him in jail for like some huge amount of time drug
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:06.520]  on april 18th of 2005 cell pleaded no contest of federal charges of fraud and
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:11.800]  conspiracy to kill a federal agent yeah that was it he was at a shooting range
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:14.760]  and and and they had an undercover there and he talked crap about him and they
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:17.880]  showed they showed him after serving eight years without
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:21.080]  trial in federal prison it's like that guy in new
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:25.000]  mexico had been in jail for like three years being pulled over for a parking
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:28.120]  ticket or something there wasn't even a record of him he was like

[3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:19.240]  and a lot of these states passed laws agreeing to keep the prisons at
[3:04:19.240 --> 3:04:24.040]  90 occupancy to get new prisons built in the state
[3:04:24.040 --> 3:04:28.040]  because that's the jobs in our state is the prison
