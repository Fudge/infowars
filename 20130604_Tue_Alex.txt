[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:24.560]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.560 --> 00:29.600]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex. He is live in
[00:29.600 --> 00:34.520]  London, Lutford, England, just north of London, covering the Bilderberg Conference that's
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.600]  starting today. Now, Alex and staff traveled there in the last couple of days, and we've
[00:39.600 --> 00:43.960]  got some updates from Alex about things that have been happening. It's been pretty eventful
[00:43.960 --> 00:50.440]  so far, at least for Alex. Even before the elite masters arrive, he's had their minions
[00:50.440 --> 00:55.840]  on him like a cheap suit, even though this is supposedly one of the best hotels in the
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.520]  world. They're kind of acting like it's faulty towers. They canceled his reservations at
[01:01.520 --> 01:06.640]  the last minute with no explanation, in violation of law, in violation of discrimination law
[01:06.640 --> 01:12.660]  against political beliefs. And then they go there to eat yesterday, before the conference
[01:12.660 --> 01:17.900]  has started today, and he was thrown out by security. They wouldn't even let him pay his
[01:17.900 --> 01:22.060]  bill for what he'd had so far. So we've got some video updates of that. Alex is gonna
[01:22.060 --> 01:26.320]  be here live later on during the show. It's gonna be very interesting, and there is a
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.480]  lot of news about Bilderberg. Michael Savage talked about it on his show, and we've got
[01:31.480 --> 01:38.080]  all of this information at infowars.com forward slash B, as in Bilderberg. You can follow
[01:38.080 --> 01:41.600]  all the information there as it's breaking, not just what we're covering, but what other
[01:41.600 --> 01:43.720]  people are saying about it as well.
[01:43.720 --> 01:48.620]  Now, before we start, I've got a news item here that was just given to me at the last
[01:48.620 --> 01:53.580]  minute from Chris Jordan. And it's gonna be our trivia question of the day here. We've
[01:53.580 --> 01:59.400]  got the article as a deadline looms for a suspect to decrypt his laptop or go directly
[01:59.400 --> 02:05.560]  to jail. Now, this is coming out of Milwaukee. And we've got a judge that is ordering this
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.580]  fellow to decrypt the only existing copies of incriminating files. Now, are you required
[02:12.580 --> 02:13.700]  to do that?
[02:13.700 --> 02:20.100]  Think about that for just a second. Listen. Okay, your time is up. Do your rights really
[02:20.100 --> 02:26.880]  change based on the technology, based on circumstances? Does that negate the fact that you've got
[02:26.880 --> 02:30.360]  Fourth Amendment rights because you're not writing on paper but you're writing on a computer?
[02:30.360 --> 02:36.000]  I don't think so. Let's look at what the Fourth Amendment says. It says that to be secure
[02:36.000 --> 02:44.420]  in your person, houses, papers, and effects. It's pretty comprehensive, don't you think?
[02:44.420 --> 02:49.820]  I mean, there's not really any room for wiggle, although we look at how our government is
[02:49.820 --> 02:55.700]  violating that in every aspect. In your person, have you traveled lately? Have you flown lately?
[02:55.700 --> 03:00.340]  Of course, it's gonna be all kinds of travel because it's a transportation security agency.
[03:00.340 --> 03:03.700]  It's not just the airport security agency. They don't believe you have a right to be
[03:03.700 --> 03:10.540]  secure in your person. They deny your Fourth Amendment rights every day to everybody that's
[03:10.540 --> 03:11.540]  traveling.
[03:11.540 --> 03:16.460]  How about your houses? Look at what just happened in the Boston Marathon bombing, where they're
[03:16.460 --> 03:19.820]  breaking into people's houses without search warrants, demanding that they come in pointing
[03:19.820 --> 03:26.140]  guns at people, pulling them out at gunpoint. What about your computers like this? Should
[03:26.140 --> 03:32.860]  you have to self-incriminate yourself? Well, obviously, the IRS has operated for decades
[03:32.860 --> 03:37.780]  on the principle of self-incrimination. That's what your income tax form basically is. You
[03:37.780 --> 03:42.780]  sign this piece of paper saying that everything that I have just told you about myself in
[03:42.780 --> 03:47.700]  detail is true, and if you find anything in there that is not true, you can send me to
[03:47.700 --> 03:48.960]  jail.
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.420]  That's one of the problems that a lot of people have with complying with the IRS system, and
[03:53.420 --> 03:59.520]  we've got some information about the IRS system. Ted Cruz is calling to get rid of the income
[03:59.520 --> 04:06.080]  tax, and I'm all for that. I remember 20 years ago in the Libertarian Party, we were calling
[04:06.080 --> 04:12.520]  for the abolition of the income tax in the IRS, and people said we were crazy.
[04:12.520 --> 04:18.460]  But things change, don't they, and hopefully for the better. Maybe with all of these scandals,
[04:18.460 --> 04:23.660]  maybe we've gone so far that people are ready to hear the truth about the IRS, the truth
[04:23.660 --> 04:29.860]  about self-incrimination, the truth about our corrupt tax system, where the largest
[04:29.860 --> 04:35.540]  corporations, those who are going to Bilderberg, don't pay any taxes, but you, the little people,
[04:35.540 --> 04:41.220]  pay them all, and just enough to keep the interest payments going to our central bank.
[04:41.220 --> 04:45.700]  We'll be right back with more information about Bilderberg, live updates from Alex Jones.
[04:45.700 --> 05:00.300]  Stay tuned.

[06:00.380 --> 06:05.620]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[06:05.620 --> 06:11.320]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[06:11.320 --> 06:16.480]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[06:16.480 --> 06:22.020]  the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com. These are items

[08:10.300 --> 08:17.300]  and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Welcome back to the Alex
[08:17.300 --> 08:24.300]  Jones Show. I'm David Knight, and as I said before the break, we're going to be having
[08:25.260 --> 08:29.140]  information from Alex Jones. He's going to be joining us later in the show. He'll be
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.580]  doing most of the show, as a matter of fact, live from London, but we have Alex on site
[08:34.580 --> 08:39.220]  now. He's there with Leanne McAdoo and with Richard Reeves. Paul Joseph Watson, of course,
[08:39.220 --> 08:44.300]  is there as he lives in the area, and they're going to be covering things. They've had some
[08:44.300 --> 08:50.780]  interesting encounters already at the Grove Hotel, but it's interesting to go back and
[08:50.780 --> 08:57.780]  look at the history of Bilderberg, to think about the fact that for decades, decades,
[08:58.060 --> 09:03.100]  they denied that this existed, just kind of like Bohemian Grove. When Alex showed up and
[09:03.100 --> 09:09.020]  took a video of what was going on at Bohemian Grove and exposed what these crazy people
[09:09.020 --> 09:15.660]  we call leaders were doing at Bohemian Grove, it's just amazing. And yet, to this day, even
[09:15.660 --> 09:20.040]  though he's shown the pictures of what they were doing, you can go to Wikipedia and look
[09:20.040 --> 09:26.420]  up Bohemian Grove and it says, Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist, and talks about his film
[09:26.420 --> 09:31.500]  of what they're doing. So even when you show up and you film what they're doing, you're
[09:31.500 --> 09:39.420]  still a conspiracy theorist. Well, he's actually a conspiracy fact. And when we show up to
[09:39.420 --> 09:44.700]  Bilderberg, it's to show people that yes, there really is an elite world government
[09:44.700 --> 09:49.420]  that really is planning this stuff, and you can really see the effects of what they're
[09:49.420 --> 09:55.640]  doing. And we're gonna take a look later on the show at the real world effects that come
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.300]  out of the plans that people like Kissinger and Rockefeller and the Bilderberg Group have
[10:00.300 --> 10:03.060]  created for Europe and for the rest of the world.
[10:03.060 --> 10:08.900]  Right now, in Europe, across Europe, there are riots and demonstrations. Even in Turkey,
[10:08.900 --> 10:14.020]  there are riots and demonstrations. People are demonstrating against the economic hardships,
[10:14.020 --> 10:18.300]  against oppressive governments, but especially in Europe, it's economically focused. And
[10:18.300 --> 10:23.800]  what they've seen are bankers. We've got some pictures here from Turkey. It's just amazing.
[10:23.800 --> 10:29.220]  If you've got this on video, you can see this. It's giant hordes of people. If you can imagine
[10:29.220 --> 10:35.940]  the Tea Party demonstrations originally in Washington, imagine that going violent. And
[10:35.940 --> 10:42.220]  here's a man yelling at him. He says, you know, enough is enough. We're humans too.
[10:42.220 --> 10:46.500]  This is an old man. He's yelling at the cops who are in all of their armor and body armor
[10:46.500 --> 10:50.600]  and have their shields and everything. It really is like looking at these aerial photographs
[10:50.600 --> 10:56.820]  they have of these riots in Turkey. It's very much like looking at an aerial shot of the
[10:56.820 --> 11:03.020]  Roman Empire fighting the masses, the way they grouped together in a phalanx and have
[11:03.020 --> 11:08.260]  helmets and shields. Of course, the Romans didn't have guns and tear gas to shoot at
[11:08.260 --> 11:12.640]  the crowds, rubber bullets like they're shooting right now. But it's amazing to look at this
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.640]  and to think about the fact that, you know, it didn't work out too well for the Roman
[11:17.640 --> 11:22.220]  Empire in the long run. They were eventually taken down by the crowds and eventually they
[11:22.220 --> 11:26.860]  were taken down because people were just fed up with the corruption. It wasn't so much
[11:26.860 --> 11:30.940]  that they fell from the outside. It's pretty effective to fight people who are unarmed
[11:30.940 --> 11:35.300]  when you've got all the arms, when you've got well-trained soldiers who are in helmets
[11:35.300 --> 11:36.300]  and have shields.
[11:36.300 --> 11:41.860]  It usually goes your way. But it doesn't go your way when people get sick and tired of
[11:41.860 --> 11:46.460]  the oppression and the corruption. And that's what's happening right here in Turkey. It's
[11:46.460 --> 11:53.780]  happening all over Europe. You've got the central bankers imposing their rule over democratically
[11:53.780 --> 11:59.420]  elected parliaments and throwing out the democratically elected people there. And people are getting
[11:59.420 --> 12:01.100]  sick and tired of that.
[12:01.100 --> 12:06.820]  Now, in more recent history, even after mainstream media started covering this and we've got
[12:06.820 --> 12:11.900]  an article here from the International Business Times where they talked to Charlie Skelton.
[12:11.900 --> 12:16.860]  He's a reporter for The Guardian. And he says the first time that he covered Bilderberg
[12:16.860 --> 12:21.620]  was back in 2009, a conference in Athens. And listen to what he says. He says it was
[12:21.620 --> 12:28.780]  a baptism of fire. He said he was chased around Athens by the Greek secret police. That's
[12:28.780 --> 12:34.220]  right. They don't like you being there.
[12:34.220 --> 12:38.020]  It's amazing to see that every time these guys go to a conference, they go to the most
[12:38.020 --> 12:44.900]  expensive castle-like hotel and buy out these fantastically expensive places that cost thousands
[12:44.900 --> 12:49.500]  of dollars a night to stay there. And giant conference rooms, they buy out the entire
[12:49.500 --> 12:53.040]  place, just like they did in Kiowa, South Carolina, just before Bilderberg. Bill Gates
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.220]  went down there with his eugenics conference and a bunch of politicians, some celebrities
[12:58.220 --> 13:04.760]  like Oprah Winfrey, bought out the entire complex just so they can keep people away.
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.980]  That's how much they hate the public. And that's how much they hate publicity. The darkness
[13:09.980 --> 13:17.960]  hides from the light. Well, we've got an update from Bilderberg and showing Alex being chased
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.760]  out by security even before the elite arrived there. But let's go real quickly to Charlie
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.980]  Skelton was talking to Max Keiser cuz Max Keiser's in London. And let's listen to what
[13:27.980 --> 13:39.660]  Max Keiser says about Alex Jones. Sorry for being a great journalist and an exposer of
[13:39.660 --> 13:45.660]  lots of bad things. He is uniquely Texan. He's a Texan. Well, we have to get him on
[13:45.660 --> 13:48.260]  Kaiser report. Absolutely.
[13:48.260 --> 14:05.140]  Let's go. Actually, Charlie, for our American audience, can you explain what the heck Watford
[14:05.140 --> 14:11.340]  is? Watford is the thing you drive through in order to get out of Watford, basically.
[14:11.340 --> 14:15.580]  Now that's a terrible thing. I'm saying terrible thing about Watford. I don't even really know
[14:15.580 --> 14:21.780]  what Watford is. Watford is just an area of north west London, just off the M25, just
[14:21.780 --> 14:25.620]  south of that. And the place where the hotel is is beautiful.
[14:25.620 --> 14:26.620]  That's Charlie Skelton.
[14:26.620 --> 14:28.780]  Is it a sort of town like where David Brent worked at the office?
[14:28.780 --> 14:32.780]  Yeah, I think you're in the right...
[14:32.780 --> 14:33.780]  Slough tension.
[14:33.780 --> 14:37.540]  It's on a pump. It's on a roundabout somewhere.
[14:37.540 --> 14:43.780]  It used to be what London, Londoners would define as the point between south of England
[14:43.780 --> 14:47.620]  and the north of England and the rest of England, basically. It was anything north of Watford.
[14:47.620 --> 14:53.620]  It wasn't really considered, you know, just considered full stop if you were from London.
[14:53.620 --> 14:56.700]  It was. It was. It was the wall.
[14:56.700 --> 14:57.700]  The world stops at Watford.
[14:57.700 --> 14:58.700]  It was exactly that, yes.
[14:58.700 --> 15:01.460]  Okay. Well, that's our little teaser for tonight.
[15:01.460 --> 15:07.860]  There you go. Max Kaiser talking about Alex Jones' arrival saying the Texas twister has
[15:07.860 --> 15:13.760]  touched down in London. That's a pretty good way to put it. They don't want Alex anywhere
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.300]  close to the elite there because he's not afraid of them. He's not afraid to call them
[15:18.300 --> 15:23.440]  out for what they are. And as a result, they, like I said, they canceled his reservation
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.860]  just before they left. They found out it was canceled. And when he went there yesterday,
[15:28.860 --> 15:34.740]  now, remember that the elite masters have not yet arrived at their designated places.
[15:34.740 --> 15:37.880]  They threw him out even though they were eating in the restaurant. And we've got a video that
[15:37.880 --> 15:48.920]  let's cut to that right now.
[15:48.920 --> 15:52.220]  This is Alex walking down the hallway. He's holding a cell phone.
[15:52.220 --> 15:57.560]  I just say on tape, you're kicking me out and I'll let you pay for dinner. Oh, we're
[15:57.560 --> 15:59.060]  going to have to stare into the costume here.
[15:59.060 --> 16:01.060]  Yeah, that's fine. Where is Mr. Jones?
[16:01.060 --> 16:04.140]  No, but I'm not going to let you kick me out of a restaurant and fall full short of the
[16:04.140 --> 16:05.140]  stealing.
[16:05.140 --> 16:06.780]  You know that's not going to happen.
[16:06.780 --> 16:11.980]  Well then say that I dropped it. We, we, as a hotel asking you to do so, but we are leaving.
[16:11.980 --> 16:17.980]  I'm trying to pay for dinner and you're saying leave without paying, right?
[16:17.980 --> 16:31.340]  Other than that, I got it on tape. So yeah, what have you guys done originally?
[16:31.340 --> 16:35.980]  So wish you a good night, sir. Your vehicle's up there. Hey Greg, how you doing? Okay. Listen,
[16:35.980 --> 16:39.500]  seriously, we just came by to get some video and stuff and eat dinner, man. It's not a
[16:39.500 --> 16:40.500]  big conspiracy.
[16:40.500 --> 16:42.580]  We don't want a threat to anyone.
[16:42.580 --> 16:45.860]  Where's Richard? Where's Richard? Richard's up at the bar. And by the way, I'm more than
[16:45.860 --> 16:46.860]  happy to pay my bill.
[16:46.860 --> 16:51.060]  Okay. We're going to be asking you to leave now. Okay. Okay. So you're not going to let
[16:51.060 --> 16:52.060]  me pay my bill.
[16:52.060 --> 16:53.060]  Good night.
[16:53.060 --> 16:54.060]  All right.
[16:54.060 --> 16:55.060]  I'm still waiting for the confirmation.
[16:55.060 --> 17:00.600]  Mr. Watson, I'm asking you to leave. Okay. It's our choice that you're leaving, please.
[17:00.600 --> 17:01.600]  Please walk away.
[17:01.600 --> 17:04.900]  It's just weird that you won't say that. I mean, you won't even let us finish and then
[17:04.900 --> 17:09.300]  you won't say you're kicking, you know, I just thought you got it on tape.
[17:09.300 --> 17:14.380]  So there you go. There's Basil faulty working security at the Grove Hotel, throwing Alex
[17:14.380 --> 17:19.180]  out. I don't know what he did to offend them, but just like faulty towers, he's saying they're
[17:19.180 --> 17:23.780]  eating and they tell him that he's got to leave. And he's kind of worried that it might
[17:23.780 --> 17:27.580]  be a setup, that they're going to come after him for not paying his bill.
[17:27.580 --> 17:32.220]  So he wants to get it on tape that they're actually throwing him out and not letting
[17:32.220 --> 17:37.540]  him pay for the bill. But of course, Basil won't really confirm that that's what's happening.
[17:37.540 --> 17:41.660]  He just keeps saying you've got to leave. You've got to leave. So there you go. That's
[17:41.660 --> 17:46.640]  the kind of world we can look forward to if we let the elite run everything, the kind
[17:46.640 --> 17:52.100]  of world where they can just order you about and tell you that you can't you can't be here.
[17:52.100 --> 17:56.300]  You have to go and no explanation and won't make anything clear.
[17:56.300 --> 17:59.900]  That's the kind of stonewalling that we've seen from them as far as reservation cancellation
[17:59.900 --> 18:06.900]  goes as well. Now, Michael Savage has weighed in on this, and I think he had a really good
[18:06.900 --> 18:12.060]  summary, short summary of Bilderberg for his audience. Let's listen to that tape.
[18:12.060 --> 18:18.660]  The Bilderberg meeting is going on from June 6th through June 9th, 2013 in England. There
[18:18.660 --> 18:24.100]  will be 140 participants in 21 European and North American countries. And you're going
[18:24.100 --> 18:28.340]  to say, well, so what's wrong with that? Now, there's a lot of right wing hysteria about
[18:28.340 --> 18:33.380]  the Bilderberg meetings. I don't know what it's about. I have a suspicion why they're
[18:33.380 --> 18:38.180]  afraid of the Bilderberg meeting. I guess because it sounds kind of Jewish. They assume
[18:38.180 --> 18:43.240]  that it's a secret Jewish meeting where there's a secret handshake. But if you actually look
[18:43.240 --> 18:49.540]  at the Bilderberg, the list of the Bilderbergs, you see its leaders in basically business
[18:49.540 --> 18:53.260]  and academia. Now, I don't like most of the philosophy of those from academia. They're
[18:53.260 --> 18:58.300]  all leftists. But you'll also notice there are no Russians on the list and no Chinese.
[18:58.300 --> 19:02.340]  Now, this is why China has the strongest economy in the world. Why are they not at the Bilderberg
[19:02.340 --> 19:06.720]  meeting? Now, founded in 1954, what is the Bilderberg meeting? Most of you never heard
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.340]  it. Most of you don't even know what the Bilderberg is. But to the right wing, the word Bilderberg
[19:11.340 --> 19:17.460]  itself provokes the desire to go out and buy hollow point ammunition. It was founded in
[19:17.460 --> 19:22.060]  1954. It's a conference designed to force the dialogue between Europe and North America,
[19:22.060 --> 19:26.220]  meaning it's the new world order, meaning it's a dialogue between business leaders and
[19:26.220 --> 19:31.540]  others in Europe and North America to build ties. That's how it started. Unfortunately,
[19:31.540 --> 19:32.540]  it's moved towards...
[19:32.540 --> 19:35.480]  That's right. That's right. That's how it started. But that's not how it's ending. As
[19:35.480 --> 19:39.780]  he goes on, he talks about, it's a short clip, but we're running up to a break here. He talks
[19:39.780 --> 19:45.700]  about how it's now being used to control Congress. Yeah, that was the design all along. Even
[19:45.700 --> 19:50.060]  at their second meeting that we now have their minutes, they were talking about the EU and
[19:50.060 --> 19:54.040]  the European Union, and we see how that's playing out. We'll be right back after the
[19:54.040 --> 19:58.900]  commercial break. We're going to be joining Alex in London shortly. Stay tuned.

[20:30.060 --> 20:34.260]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[20:34.260 --> 20:38.500]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[20:38.500 --> 20:42.620]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[20:42.620 --> 20:46.020]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[20:46.020 --> 20:49.380]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[23:01.180 --> 23:04.780]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[23:04.780 --> 23:09.460]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[23:09.460 --> 23:13.140]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[23:13.140 --> 23:19.300]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[23:19.300 --> 23:25.220]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[23:25.220 --> 23:30.000]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.860]  here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of
[23:35.860 --> 23:41.180]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[23:41.180 --> 23:46.420]  at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google. And the liberal media is doing
[23:46.420 --> 23:50.780]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[23:50.780 --> 24:00.580]  at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.
[24:00.580 --> 24:06.580]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[24:06.580 --> 24:16.540]  Alright, we're back with the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex. He's
[24:16.540 --> 24:20.980]  going to be joining us in just a little bit. But we do have reports that are being filed
[24:20.980 --> 24:26.580]  from Alex who was on site yesterday. The meeting starts today, as far as people arriving. And
[24:26.580 --> 24:32.240]  yesterday, they were making preparations. As these people are coming in, they need to
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.460]  have their fences up because they don't want you to get close to them. They don't want
[24:36.460 --> 24:41.500]  any information to get out about what they're doing. But they don't even want you anywhere
[24:41.500 --> 24:48.180]  around them. That's why they buy out these entire luxury hotel complexes. And then use
[24:48.180 --> 24:54.020]  the security and the police forces from the nearby towns to chase people away at the taxpayers
[24:54.020 --> 24:56.020]  expense.
[24:56.020 --> 25:00.980]  That's what the police are there for, right? To protect the elite from you. Well, we got
[25:00.980 --> 25:06.420]  Alex taking a look at their barrier of steel. He calls it the Bilderberg Ring of Steel.
[25:06.420 --> 25:15.460]  Let's take a look at what he found yesterday. What are you guys building? It's like an art
[25:15.460 --> 25:17.460]  project or something.
[25:17.460 --> 25:20.460]  How you doing Mike?
[25:20.460 --> 25:28.900]  I'm just going to get a photo here. So what are you guys putting together?
[25:28.900 --> 25:29.900]  Just a fence.
[25:29.900 --> 25:37.700]  Yeah, I saw the steel grating down there. You guys are working late into the night,
[25:37.700 --> 25:38.700]  huh?
[25:38.700 --> 25:39.700]  It's all night.
[25:39.700 --> 25:43.820]  Oh, really, all night. Wow. Well, I'll leave you alone so you can get it done. Have a good
[25:43.820 --> 25:50.140]  one. You guys have a good one. Cheers.
[25:50.140 --> 25:54.140]  Yeah, working through the night. Gotta get that up because you know what? This could
[25:54.140 --> 25:58.740]  be a big event. This could be very large. You've got David Ikes going, you got Alex
[25:58.740 --> 26:04.660]  Jones there. People that are very well known in England. You've also got massive demonstrations
[26:04.660 --> 26:11.040]  going on just across the channel in Frankfurt. They're protesting the European Central Bank
[26:11.040 --> 26:16.580]  all this last weekend. They called it Blockupie. A lot of people there, thousands of people
[26:16.580 --> 26:21.000]  there. Very few of those could show up at the Bilderberg Convention. You could have
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.700]  a massive crowd there and probably will have, I would expect. There's going to be a lot
[26:24.700 --> 26:30.980]  of people there. They're very concerned about that. They're busy putting up these construction
[26:30.980 --> 26:34.660]  projects for those of you who couldn't see it. I mean, they're making some pretty heavy
[26:34.660 --> 26:40.140]  fortifications there to protect people. When I look at this, I think about the power of
[26:40.140 --> 26:47.740]  even just one person and Hong Kong is now marking the Tiananmen Square Remembrance.
[26:47.740 --> 26:53.780]  It's the 24th anniversary of Tiananmen Square and everybody remembers that iconic picture
[26:53.780 --> 26:58.500]  of the one person standing in front of the tank. Now, what you don't know in the West
[26:58.500 --> 27:03.980]  is that subsequently tanks did run over people there. They did shoot and kill a lot of people
[27:03.980 --> 27:10.500]  there. That part was not televised. But that was a wonderful, iconic moment when he stood
[27:10.500 --> 27:14.620]  in front of those tanks. And if you remember, the tank kind of made a movement to go to
[27:14.620 --> 27:18.620]  the left, then a movement to go to the right. And every time the tank would move, he would
[27:18.620 --> 27:27.120]  move in front of the tank. It's really a testimony to the power of ideas, to the power of people.
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.300]  And although the Chinese people haven't achieved their freedom from a ruling elite yet, they're
[27:31.300 --> 27:35.900]  still being used as slave labor in China. One of the ways that they do that, we went
[27:35.900 --> 27:41.080]  to China, I adopted my daughter from there. One of the ways they do that is to allow the
[27:41.080 --> 27:44.620]  Chinese people to have an increase in the standard of living. Now, certainly the people
[27:44.620 --> 27:49.540]  who are out in the countryside are still living in very abject poverty. And they're ruling
[27:49.540 --> 27:54.300]  them with an iron fist. I think it was Unwed Mothers, it was an article that is something
[27:54.300 --> 28:00.380]  like six times their annual income to get penalized if they have a child out of wedlock.
[28:00.380 --> 28:06.240]  Families that have more than one child are hit with severe economic penalty. There's
[28:06.240 --> 28:13.460]  a lot of poverty still in China. But they're so poor after Mao's policies, after he ground
[28:13.460 --> 28:20.180]  them into the dust, after he killed tens of millions of people. After the great famine,
[28:20.180 --> 28:25.660]  which he called the great leap forward, Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, talked about how this was
[28:25.660 --> 28:32.940]  the most important and successful revolution and social reform program in human history.
[28:32.940 --> 28:39.060]  David Rockefeller loved the Chinese oppression under Mao. That's what he would like to see
[28:39.060 --> 28:45.060]  happen everywhere. He wants to see population controlled. He wants to see people controlled.
[28:45.060 --> 28:50.900]  But there's a lot of power in what one person can do. But listen to this Chinese fellow
[28:50.900 --> 28:56.180]  who spoke earlier this year at a Massachusetts state gun rally talking. He was at Tiananmen
[28:56.180 --> 29:01.460]  Square when it happened 24 years ago. And he was talking about people there as to why
[29:01.460 --> 29:06.220]  you don't wanna give up your Second Amendment rights in this country. Here's a little bit
[29:06.220 --> 29:11.380]  of what he had to say.
[29:11.380 --> 29:19.180]  This past Monday, I decided to visit the Lexington Green to pay my tribute to Captain John Parker.
[29:19.180 --> 29:24.360]  As I was walking on the green, I thought to myself, you know what? The founding fathers
[29:24.360 --> 29:31.300]  of the United States and Chairman Mao have one thing in common. They all thought guns
[29:31.300 --> 29:39.500]  are very important political instruments. However, their similarities ended there. Chairman
[29:39.500 --> 29:46.540]  Mao wrote him one time, he said, political power grew out of barrel of a gun. And he
[29:46.540 --> 29:49.620]  also wrote, the party shall-
[29:49.620 --> 30:00.860]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:18.340 --> 31:24.580]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[31:24.580 --> 31:28.740]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

[32:04.940 --> 32:10.020]  number of Americans that are in serious trouble right smack dab in the middle of the Oklahoma
[32:10.020 --> 32:15.480]  disasters. I know that thousands of you like us are frustrated with not being able to help
[32:15.480 --> 32:20.980]  those who have lost so much and are in so much pain. We can't stand idly by. Food is
[32:20.980 --> 32:25.820]  the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort. We have a plan for any
[32:25.820 --> 32:30.540]  of you who would like to partner with us in providing food in this desperate time of need.
[32:30.540 --> 32:35.940]  We've built a seven day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for
[32:35.940 --> 32:42.920]  a whole week for one adult valued at $60. Your $25 will ship this life saving supply
[32:42.920 --> 32:53.260]  directly to those in need. Call 800-409-5633 or efoods direct.com. That's 800-409-5633
[32:53.260 --> 33:01.180]  or efoods direct.com. The food is contributed at considerably less than cost. Thank you.
[33:01.180 --> 33:09.740]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:09.740 --> 33:23.900]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex, but Alex is going
[33:23.900 --> 33:29.100]  to be joining us very shortly with live reports from Bilderberg. He's going to be doing the
[33:29.100 --> 33:35.800]  last two hours live from England, just outside of London, Watford, UK, where as we've already
[33:35.800 --> 33:43.220]  talked about, we've got the hotel staff there is acting a bit like a faulty towers running
[33:43.220 --> 33:49.060]  Alex out of the restaurant even without allowing him to pay the bill. Pretty amazing. And the
[33:49.060 --> 33:53.660]  conference hasn't even started yet. People don't even start arriving the our grand lords
[33:53.660 --> 33:58.500]  do not start arriving until today. But even yesterday, we have to get the rabble like
[33:58.500 --> 34:03.000]  Alex Jones out of the way. And we were talking just before the break about how this is now
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.300]  the 24th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, that iconic picture of the guy standing in
[34:09.300 --> 34:13.980]  front of the column of tanks. And what we didn't talk about is the fact that still in
[34:13.980 --> 34:18.680]  Beijing even though there are celebrations of it in Hong Kong with a lot of people there
[34:18.680 --> 34:24.980]  attending a candlelight vigil because it is a very solemn occasion. A lot of people were
[34:24.980 --> 34:29.940]  killed by the military, not everybody. We always see that picture of the guy staying
[34:29.940 --> 34:35.100]  in front of the tank, but a lot of people did die there. But in Beijing, police blocked
[34:35.100 --> 34:40.980]  the gate of a cemetery housing victims of the crackdown on a pro democracy demonstrators
[34:40.980 --> 34:48.380]  as part of a sweeping annual effort to bar commemorations. You have to understand that
[34:48.380 --> 34:55.060]  China was used by Rockefeller in the New World Order. There is a massive transfer of wealth.
[34:55.060 --> 34:58.760]  We did a special report on this last night on the nightly news. If you didn't see that,
[34:58.760 --> 35:03.140]  it's probably because you're not a prison planet member, you need to pay up and see
[35:03.140 --> 35:10.740]  this special content. But we talked about how Rockefeller and the elite desired to have
[35:10.740 --> 35:15.200]  a massive transfer of wealth from the United States as we now see that's happened in only
[35:15.200 --> 35:19.740]  about three decades. We see pretty much most of the manufacturing capacity of the United
[35:19.740 --> 35:24.940]  States. Much of our wealth has been transferred to China and it's not from the American people
[35:24.940 --> 35:31.300]  to the Chinese people. It's from the Americans to a few ruling elite. The Chinese are not
[35:31.300 --> 35:36.900]  out of the woods yet. They are still under the oppression of Mao like rulers in China.
[35:36.900 --> 35:40.860]  I've seen it. I've been there. The people who are getting a better standard of living
[35:40.860 --> 35:45.340]  who've moved out of the countryside, they see their standard of living go up. It pacifies
[35:45.340 --> 35:49.860]  the population somewhat, but they are working under what everybody else would consider to
[35:49.860 --> 35:55.500]  be slave conditions. They still have a working slave population that is serving the multinational
[35:55.500 --> 36:01.380]  corporations. These same leaders, these multinational corporations that are going to Bilderberg.
[36:01.380 --> 36:06.220]  An article on Infowars.com says congressional report proves that taxpayers are subsidizing
[36:06.220 --> 36:11.340]  Walmart employees. A congressional report released Thursday confirms what many Americans
[36:11.340 --> 36:16.860]  have suspected all along. Taxpayers are subsidizing Walmart's workforce. The running joke that
[36:16.860 --> 36:22.540]  says for every dollar you save at Walmart, you spend $2 more in taxes isn't far off the
[36:22.540 --> 36:27.920]  mark and it says further down, they estimate that a single 300 person Walmart Supercenter
[36:27.920 --> 36:38.040]  store in Wisconsin likely costs taxpayers at least $904,542 per year. And if you add
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.340]  in the fact that many Walmart employees who receive Medicaid benefits also benefit from
[36:42.340 --> 36:46.580]  other taxpayer funded programs such as food stamps, WIC and other federal aid because
[36:46.580 --> 36:54.420]  they don't pay them much. The total cost to taxpayers is more like $1.7 million a year,
[36:54.420 --> 37:01.180]  about $5800 per Walmart employee and that's just for a single store. You see, the whole
[37:01.180 --> 37:06.440]  point of most of what the government does is to transfer wealth and it's not between
[37:06.440 --> 37:12.320]  different classes as much as we are led to believe by this false left right paradigm.
[37:12.320 --> 37:18.260]  The primary transfer of wealth is from people to a few ruling elite. We can see that more
[37:18.260 --> 37:23.720]  clearly every day as we see what's going on. Look at this article from the London Guardian
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.240]  about Amazon and Google chiefs joining other corporate tax avoiders at the Bilderberg
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.640]  Confab. Now, out of the 140 participants, you've got a lot of the largest companies
[37:34.640 --> 37:40.980]  like Amazon.com, Google, they don't pay any taxes. I don't know about Amazon, but I know
[37:40.980 --> 37:46.840]  Google hasn't paid any taxes. Apple pays virtually nothing. There's a big scandal going on in
[37:46.840 --> 37:54.360]  the UK about that. The whole point of the tax code is to transfer wealth to the government
[37:54.360 --> 37:59.800]  so they can redistribute it in large amounts to companies like Walmart or to Google or
[37:59.800 --> 38:07.680]  to other insiders who are giving a nice tithe of that to the politicians who transfer the
[38:07.680 --> 38:13.720]  massive amounts of money to them. And I think it's about time people have had enough of
[38:13.720 --> 38:18.960]  this, enough of the IRS, enough of this corrupt system. And when we see the IRS being used
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.880]  as a weapon, that's gotten everybody's attention. What they haven't seen is this massive redistribution
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.960]  of wealth. And what they haven't paid attention to is the fact that going back as far as the
[38:27.960 --> 38:32.680]  Reagan administration, first thing he did when he got in was he created the Grace Commission.
[38:32.680 --> 38:37.500]  He had one of the top accounting firms go in and take a look at where the money was
[38:37.500 --> 38:42.080]  coming from and where the money was going. And what he found out was that all of the
[38:42.080 --> 38:48.040]  money that we pay in income tax just went to service the debt. In other words, to the
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.480]  Federal Reserve, to the private central bank. The Federal Reserve was created at the same
[38:53.480 --> 39:01.120]  time the income tax was. And what we've been on is a 100-year interest-only balloon note.
[39:01.120 --> 39:06.420]  And they're using that balloon note. They're calling it due now across Europe. And they're
[39:06.420 --> 39:11.040]  going to do it here in America. They're going to say, time's up. Your balloon note is overdue.
[39:11.040 --> 39:15.100]  You're repossessing your country. That's what they do when they take out democratically
[39:15.100 --> 39:21.760]  elected people and put in Goldman Sachs bankers in their place, as they've done in Italy and
[39:21.760 --> 39:26.080]  Greece and other places. That's what Nigel Farage or the UK Independence Party call them
[39:26.080 --> 39:33.160]  on in the European Parliament. And so it's about time that somebody starts talking about
[39:33.160 --> 39:38.360]  getting rid of this corrupt system. We always said, and we talked about it in the Libertarian
[39:38.360 --> 39:44.400]  Party, that it's not about revenue. It's about controlling you. That's what the income tax
[39:44.400 --> 39:49.900]  is there for. And it's there to send money to the banks. They don't care as long as they
[39:49.900 --> 39:52.940]  get their interest payment each time. They're going to keep compounding that. They're going
[39:52.940 --> 39:57.040]  to encourage you privately to go into debt. If you're a college student, you're going
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.400]  to get those credit card offers. They're also going to do the same thing with each and every
[40:01.400 --> 40:06.220]  country because they want every country indebted to them. And when they screw up, when their
[40:06.220 --> 40:11.600]  massive derivative schemes fail, they have the government assume those debts and then
[40:11.600 --> 40:16.400]  turn around and say, well, government, you're now insolvent. So you've got to turn over
[40:16.400 --> 40:22.180]  real assets to us. It's amazing. They use their failures to take over the sovereignty
[40:22.180 --> 40:27.520]  of countries. People are starting to wake up, though, because of the political nature
[40:27.520 --> 40:31.240]  of the persecution that the IRS is being used for. And understand this is nothing that's
[40:31.240 --> 40:37.480]  new from Obama. This is something that has gone on since the time of FDR. We've got documented
[40:37.480 --> 40:43.700]  cases of virtually every president using the IRS as a weapon against their political enemies.
[40:43.700 --> 40:50.440]  It's just that Obama has done it more openly, more pervasively, more unashamedly than any
[40:50.440 --> 40:53.880]  other president has ever done. It used to be when you'd get caught doing this, like
[40:53.880 --> 40:59.700]  Nixon did, you would get impeached. You'd get thrown out. But nothing happens to Obama
[40:59.700 --> 41:04.520]  no matter what he does. Talk about a Teflon president. That's the guy. But people are
[41:04.520 --> 41:09.200]  starting to wake up. Here's what Ted Cruz had to say about abolishing the income tax.
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.460]  Joining me now in the hot seat, my old friend, Republican Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, thank
[41:14.460 --> 41:18.960]  you for joining us. We go way back to the old days of Texas Solicitor General days,
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.200]  if I'm not mistaken. Senator, you're leading the charge to abolish the IRS. I think that's
[41:23.200 --> 41:29.920]  a fantastic idea. Tell us your plan. Well, look, we have seen in recent weeks that the
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.920]  IRS has not honored its trust with the American people, that the Obama administration has
[41:35.920 --> 41:42.000]  demonstrated a willingness to use the machinery of government to target their political enemies.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.800]  And that's wrong. It was wrong when Richard Nixon did it, and it's wrong when Barack Obama
[41:45.800 --> 41:50.520]  did it. And it is a manifestation of too much power in the federal government. When the
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.340]  federal government has that much power in our individual lives, it's an invitation to
[41:55.340 --> 42:01.160]  being abused. And I think we ought to abolish the IRS and instead move to a simple flat
[42:01.160 --> 42:06.640]  tax where the average American can fill out our taxes on a postcard, put down how much
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.800]  you earn, put down a deduction for charitable contributions for home mortgage and how much
[42:11.800 --> 42:19.240]  you owe. It ought to be just a simple one-page postcard and take the agents, the bureaucracy
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.000]  out of Washington and limit the power of government. I have a hunch you might get bipartisan support
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.840]  for an idea like that. Well, it seems to me we should because it's about empowering the
[42:29.840 --> 42:34.600]  people and that ought to be a bipartisan value. That ought to be something Republicans and
[42:34.600 --> 42:40.840]  Democrats can both embrace. Absolutely, absolutely. It ought to be bipartisan. You know, when
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.600]  we see Rachel Maddow, we see Sean Hannity, what they use is this scandal. They say, Rachel
[42:46.600 --> 42:53.440]  Maddow says, well, but Bush did it. Bush did that. So Obama can do it. Or if Hannity is
[42:53.440 --> 42:58.200]  in and somebody points out that Bush did something, he says, well, Bill Clinton did it. So we're
[42:58.200 --> 43:03.600]  okay with that. Now, let's look at this and say power is being abused. Ted Cruz was exactly
[43:03.600 --> 43:07.560]  right. When you concentrate power, you're going to get concentrated corruption and that's
[43:07.560 --> 43:13.180]  what we see. And so let's say bipartisanly that we want to get rid of this. This is something
[43:13.180 --> 43:17.160]  we don't need to have. And as I said before, it's not about revenue. It's about controlling
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.920]  you. They can collect taxes anonymously. That's what a consumption tax is. That's what a sales
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.980]  tax is. It's simple. If you've ever run a business, you know that the income tax that
[43:26.980 --> 43:31.560]  you've got to calculate when you fill that out, that's a tremendous amount of work and
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.400]  expense and legal jeopardy because you're signing your name to this thing in violation
[43:36.400 --> 43:41.040]  of your fourth. You're signing away your Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment rights. And so
[43:41.040 --> 43:46.540]  it's a very troubling thing the way the income tax works. But a sales tax is very simple.
[43:46.540 --> 43:51.700]  It doesn't take any time at all to do a sales tax. If you're a merchant, all you do is just
[43:51.700 --> 43:55.420]  look at your gross revenue. Anybody that runs a business can determine what their gross
[43:55.420 --> 44:01.000]  revenue is. That's not very difficult to do. So there may be a little bit of a distinction
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.760]  in some areas. You might have some food exemptions, that sort of thing. So you may have to distinguish
[44:04.760 --> 44:07.960]  between that. That's not a difficult thing to do. It's nothing at all like an income
[44:07.960 --> 44:12.680]  tax. But remember this, when we talk about it controlling you, the income tax was there
[44:12.680 --> 44:17.440]  well before we had the kind of surveillance computer state that we have now. The income
[44:17.440 --> 44:24.720]  tax was there and that gave the government an opportunity to go in and look at everything
[44:24.720 --> 44:30.500]  in your personal and private life. It gave them an opportunity for discovery. It gave
[44:30.500 --> 44:35.720]  them an opportunity for investigation. It also gave them an opportunity to control the
[44:35.720 --> 44:41.500]  population, giving them carrots and sticks, making them do this, making them do that.
[44:41.500 --> 44:46.700]  And those kinds of carrots and sticks were always done in the service of larger corporations.
[44:46.700 --> 44:51.200]  So it's time that we all wake up and look at the abuse of power, look at the way the
[44:51.200 --> 44:58.800]  income tax has been used to control us. Now Ron Paul always said he didn't care that much
[44:58.800 --> 45:03.480]  about the form of taxation. He said if you get your taxes down to a low enough level,
[45:03.480 --> 45:08.980]  you don't really care how those taxes are being applied. There's a lot of truth to that.
[45:08.980 --> 45:16.860]  The taxation level is far too high. However, it's still important how you collect those
[45:16.860 --> 45:21.160]  taxes. It's still important that our constitutional rights, that our dignity, that our liberties
[45:21.160 --> 45:26.200]  are respected, that our privacy is not invaded, that we're not manipulated and controlled
[45:26.200 --> 45:32.080]  like a bunch of lab rats for the benefit of large multinational corporations like Walmart
[45:32.080 --> 45:38.880]  that have used the government to get special favors. And I hear that we've got Alex Jones
[45:38.880 --> 45:42.680]  on the line right now. He's going to join us. Alex, you there?
[45:42.680 --> 45:47.840]  Yes. Sitting here listening to you the last few minutes, I'm doing Skype audio as I drive
[45:47.840 --> 45:53.800]  from London with some breaking info back out to Watford and listening to the show. You're
[45:53.800 --> 45:58.960]  doing a great job and I want to comment on the IRS situation here in just a moment. But
[45:58.960 --> 46:03.640]  first off, am I coming to you good? Yeah. Sound great.
[46:03.640 --> 46:07.480]  Fantastic. First off, as I forgot to say this yesterday, I want to just say that Richard
[46:07.480 --> 46:12.440]  Reeves has been the most valuable player on this trip so far and he's sitting right next
[46:12.440 --> 46:19.080]  to me. And Richard, say hi to everybody. Hello everybody and welcome to London. We
[46:19.080 --> 46:24.120]  are broadcasting live obviously and Alex is going to be giving you a big breakdown later
[46:24.120 --> 46:30.400]  on all the news of the day. Anyways, there is Richard Reeves and I intended
[46:30.400 --> 46:36.200]  to be back, but we hit traffic that was going half a mile an hour that got us about 30 minutes
[46:36.200 --> 46:41.160]  behind. So we're almost back to the hotel where we're staying. I'm going to meet with
[46:41.160 --> 46:48.000]  the head police people tonight. I've got a lot of breaking news, but I'm going to get
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  that out at the bottom of the next hour after we set up video Skype. And I actually have
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  my notes in front of me and can punch up some of the emails and things that I have on my
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  phone. So I've got to go over some of my notes and things. I'll be back in about 15, 20 minutes
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.880]  to the hotel and then we'll connect up and I'll be ready at the bottom of the next hour
[47:06.880 --> 47:11.280]  with a bunch of breaking news, focused info, but not just Bilderberg. I've got some other
[47:11.280 --> 47:17.920]  important news that I want to cover as well. But just getting back to David Knight there
[47:17.920 --> 47:24.520]  and the viewers and listeners in the studio. Big breaking news in the United States and
[47:24.520 --> 47:33.120]  North America when the number one news site, drugsreport.com linked yesterday and today
[47:33.120 --> 47:38.440]  top link. Last time I saw it a few hours ago on the left hand side to the Bilderberg list
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.600]  and to their agenda. I want to go over what their agenda is code word for. That's a big
[47:43.600 --> 47:48.280]  deal when something like that is out in front of everybody where you have all these world
[47:48.280 --> 47:54.560]  leaders meeting in secret and then you're basically trying to tell the public that it
[47:54.560 --> 48:01.760]  doesn't exist. That's the big issue is exposing that the puppet masters exist. That's a big
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.800]  victory that they've been denying it exists that we forced it. That discredits them. But
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.920]  Bill Gates, we've confirmed this is usually how they do it. It's not who's on the list
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.840]  that's important every year, about 125 people. There used to only be about 20 extra people
[48:16.840 --> 48:21.080]  that they tried to keep secret that were there. That's usually the illegal type stuff where
[48:21.080 --> 48:25.200]  they're going to be meeting with regulators and people that are there. So you don't want
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.160]  that behind the closed door meeting. That's why they'll have people that try to sneak
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.400]  in like Obama, like Hillary five years ago. Well, we've confirmed Bill Gates is in London
[48:34.400 --> 48:39.200]  in a few days and you can bet your bottom dollar will try to sneak in. That's why they
[48:39.200 --> 48:43.440]  cover their faces with newspapers. That's why they don't want to be known that they're
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.520]  there. That's why they get so upset. And we've got some other big names that we know are
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.200]  in London and from our moles are reportedly going to be out there. So to all the activist
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.240]  journalists, that's why it's important we not just be where the police and others say,
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.000]  oh, here, you're allowed to stand on the sidewalk here, nowhere else. They're going to be trying
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.720]  to direct Bill Gates and others in the back entrance or they're going to try to land via
[49:07.720 --> 49:14.920]  helicopter. I saw them out getting some marks out and we tried to get photos, but I was
[49:14.920 --> 49:18.480]  going to try to go out there later, but then they caught us last night and threw us out.
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.940]  But I saw what looked like helicopter marks they were putting out on the front lawn. Again,
[49:23.940 --> 49:29.920]  it's a huge compound. Just the main acreage around the hotel is over 300 acres. There's
[49:29.920 --> 49:35.760]  over a thousand acres just for the golf course. There's several big pieces. But bottom line,
[49:35.760 --> 49:48.600]  that's why it's important that we get activists everywhere breaking up, splitting up our borders.
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.200]  I'm sorry. How much of that were you able to hear that?
[49:51.200 --> 49:54.080]  You said it's important that we get everybody out there and you started to say that you've
[49:54.080 --> 50:01.080]  got reporters there. But go ahead. Absolutely. That's why Alex Jones is not the most important
[50:01.080 --> 50:06.560]  person here. Paul Watson is not the most important person here. Steve Watson is not the most
[50:06.560 --> 50:13.560]  important person here. Eon Watson is not the most important here. Leanne McAdoo is not
[50:13.560 --> 50:19.380]  the most important person here. All of us independently are just as important because
[50:19.380 --> 50:25.400]  you never know who is going to be there at a gas station down the street when a black
[50:25.400 --> 50:31.140]  limo pulls in or a black Mercedes and David Rockefeller's in the back in a wheelchair.
[50:31.140 --> 50:36.800]  You never know when a helicopter lands. Are you going to be in the bushes with a digital
[50:36.800 --> 50:44.360]  zoom getting the shots of Lord Rothko? So we're going to come back and talk more about
[50:44.360 --> 50:48.520]  that. Just tactics and strategy. But when I get back at the bottom of the next hour,
[50:48.520 --> 50:51.360]  I'll give you the big scoops and more. David, take us out.
[50:51.360 --> 50:56.080]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay tuned for more information from Bilderberg and from
[50:56.080 --> 51:02.080]  Info Wars with Alex Jones.

[52:04.440 --> 52:10.560]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year. Burglars call it smash
[52:10.560 --> 52:18.480]  and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic
[52:18.480 --> 52:24.880]  device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates
[52:24.880 --> 52:29.720]  the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home
[52:29.720 --> 52:36.580]  watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only $29.95, Fake TV
[52:36.580 --> 52:41.520]  costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping. Order
[52:41.520 --> 52:54.400]  your Fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[52:54.400 --> 52:56.760]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[52:56.760 --> 53:05.600]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoods Direct. Right now, we have a huge number of Americans
[53:05.600 --> 53:10.760]  that are in serious trouble right smack dab in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters. I
[53:10.760 --> 53:15.680]  know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those who have
[53:15.680 --> 53:21.480]  lost so much and are in so much pain. We can't stand idly by. Food is the best way to help
[53:21.480 --> 53:26.120]  the victims and support the relief effort. We have a plan for any of you who would like
[53:26.120 --> 53:31.160]  to partner with us in providing food in this desperate time of need. We've built a seven-day
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.640]  emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a whole week for one
[53:36.640 --> 53:44.280]  adult valued at $60. Your $25 will ship this life-saving supply directly to those in need.
[53:44.280 --> 53:55.140]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com. The food
[53:55.140 --> 54:10.120]  is contributed at considerably less than cost. Thank you.
[54:10.120 --> 54:15.920]  Welcome back to the Info Wars show. This is Alex Jones, who's on the line with us from
[54:15.920 --> 54:21.440]  Watford UK. He's on route to the Bilderberg site where they're covering the annual Bilderberg
[54:21.440 --> 54:26.380]  meeting and Alex is telling us just before the break about how the importance of covering
[54:26.380 --> 54:31.800]  Bilderberg is not just to expose the fact that it exists because for decades we were
[54:31.800 --> 54:36.480]  told that it didn't exist. And it's not even just to expose their agenda because much of
[54:36.480 --> 54:41.040]  their agenda is hidden at any given time. I've got a stack of stuff here of exposed
[54:41.040 --> 54:46.840]  past Bilderberg meeting minutes that were leaked by WikiLeaks. But as Alex was saying
[54:46.840 --> 54:52.020]  before the break, it's really key to have people on site all over the place. Not just
[54:52.020 --> 54:56.780]  Alex Jones, not just the Info Wars staff, but all the citizen journalists out there
[54:56.780 --> 55:01.440]  with their cameras seeing who these secret attendees are. They publish a list of the
[55:01.440 --> 55:05.640]  people that are there, but the real key thing are the people that they don't tell you are
[55:05.640 --> 55:11.200]  coming. People that are like future presidential candidates like Bill Clinton who attended.
[55:11.200 --> 55:17.280]  Remember when we had our Texas governor, Rick Perry, he attended before he ran for president.
[55:17.280 --> 55:23.640]  So it's always interesting to try to see who these unlisted attendees are. And so Alex
[55:23.640 --> 55:27.220]  is on his way there to cover that and many other aspects of Bilderberg. And we've got
[55:27.220 --> 55:29.880]  him on the phone live right now. Alex, are you there?
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.760]  Absolutely. And I want you to be able to go over all the news you've got, other Bilderberg
[55:34.760 --> 55:39.040]  news for the first 30 minutes of the next hour. My Skype's breaking up a bit. Am I coming
[55:39.040 --> 55:43.000]  through to you good, Houston? What's that, Alex?
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.640]  Am I coming through clear to you, Houston? Yes, yes, yes, you are.
[55:46.640 --> 55:53.480]  Okay, great, great, yeah, but absolutely just adding to this. Also, because we force media
[55:53.480 --> 55:59.760]  coverage, we're then hijacking the dinosaur media. We can then expose what the Bilderberg
[55:59.760 --> 56:05.760]  agenda is to the media. And when they lock it down and they've now built this big steel
[56:05.760 --> 56:09.760]  fence, when I was there last night, they were putting it up and they said that the crew
[56:09.760 --> 56:18.880]  had to work throughout the night. I went up to the GS security group, GS6, and openly
[56:18.880 --> 56:24.120]  talked to them. And then when the head of security found out, he got so mad that we
[56:24.120 --> 56:29.840]  were hiding in plain view, talking to security people. So I've got some of the security preparations
[56:29.840 --> 56:35.040]  that I'll break down coming up as well. But there's so many reasons that this is important.
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.080]  So if you are in England, if you are in the UK, get down here any of the days. Tomorrow,
[56:40.080 --> 56:44.560]  right through Sunday, it's so important and just bottom line, big numbers. But there's
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.560]  also the private airports close to Watford. There's so many places you never know when
[56:50.560 --> 56:55.620]  you're gonna run into these people. They also-
[56:55.620 --> 57:00.640]  You're breaking up a little bit there, Alex. Can you hear me now? I think we lost Alex
[57:00.640 --> 57:04.840]  there. He's saying that it's very important if you're anywhere in the area, if you're
[57:04.840 --> 57:09.040]  in England, show up. Because you never know where you're gonna see somebody there. You
[57:09.040 --> 57:14.160]  might see someone who's famous. And it's a real key thing. Famously, Margaret Thatcher
[57:14.160 --> 57:19.840]  supposedly went to one of the Bilderberg conferences. She did not like what she saw and was very
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.760]  openly critical of it. And it wasn't long after that that she was removed from power
[57:24.760 --> 57:32.520]  by her own party. These people really wield power. And everywhere they go, they're imposing
[57:32.520 --> 57:37.800]  things like the income tax. As we mentioned before, that came on at the same time that
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.920]  the Federal Reserve, the private central bank that controls our currency and much of our
[57:42.920 --> 57:47.960]  economy here, it came on at the same time. This just came out from the BBC News. Tiny
[57:47.960 --> 57:54.280]  little Andorra is going to introduce an income tax for the first time. Andorra is a very
[57:54.280 --> 58:01.400]  small nation. I think it's the sixth smallest European country. In case you don't know,
[58:01.400 --> 58:06.440]  I had to look up where Andorra was. It's located between Spain and France in the Pyrenees
[58:06.440 --> 58:11.840]  Mountains. Very tiny, only about 85,000 people in the entire country. But you know, no matter
[58:11.840 --> 58:18.640]  how small they are, they cannot escape the scrutiny of the banks. The banks have to impose
[58:18.640 --> 58:24.640]  their income tax system. Why? Because that gives them the most control over people and
[58:24.640 --> 58:29.840]  over the economy. We'll be right back with some more coverage from Bilderberg and Alex
[58:29.840 --> 58:30.840]  Jones. Stay tuned.
[58:30.840 --> 58:51.280]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.280 --> 58:55.960]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[58:55.960 --> 59:01.560]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[59:01.560 --> 59:07.000]  a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.900]  the 32-ounce nano silver solutions, our 2-ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as
[59:12.900 --> 59:20.420]  our all-natural silver soaps. Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver
[59:20.420 --> 59:25.240]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[59:25.240 --> 59:30.760]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing
[59:30.760 --> 59:35.840]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the
[59:35.840 --> 59:44.240]  silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:28.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, standing in for Alex. We've had Alex
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:34.520]  live on the phone from the UK. He's on his way to Watford, UK, to cover the Bilderberg
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:40.520]  meeting as people are starting to arrive today. Alex has been delayed by traffic. He's going
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.560]  to do the last two hours today, but he's going to be back with us shortly. As a matter of
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.920]  fact, I hear we've got him on the phone right now. Alex, can you hear me? Hello, Alex.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.880]  Absolutely, David. Just finishing. Yes, David, can you hear me now?
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.520]  Yes, I got you. Great. Let me fan it up there. Fantastic.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:06.080]  I'm just calling in because I got stuck in traffic via audio Skype. I'll be to the hotel
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:13.080]  studio in the next 30 minutes with a whole raft of breaking news and information for
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:20.080]  you on Bilderberg. But just finishing the point that I was going to make. The reason
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.680]  it's important to mob this event with cameras is that you never know where a globalist is
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.680]  going to sneak off to go meet with a hooker or something, which they do a lot, or to go
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.160]  do Lord knows what. There's also little break off meetings that they engage in sometimes.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:46.400]  That's where we get some of the best intel. Also, it's good to go to local restaurants
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:56.720]  and bars. This is a semi rural area late night. Go ahead. We got kind of spotty connection
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.560]  there. It's going in and out. But what Alex is doing is encouraging everyone who is anywhere
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:09.240]  in the area to do citizen journalism. We had the Operation Paul Revere contest. Alex really
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:15.500]  sincerely believes that you are the Paul Revere's. He believes that we've got to get as many
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:22.480]  people on this as possible. That's why he set up that contest and had over $115,000
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.440]  in prizes to encourage people to become citizen journalists. And we had a lot of people who
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.960]  sent in entries to that as a first time. Obviously, a lot of them had done anything. But I got
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.960]  a lot of emails from people saying that it's really opened up their perspective on what
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.220]  they're able to accomplish. And we're going to be featuring a lot of those things on Prison
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:48.760]  Planet TV, Infowars.com, and also on Planet Infowars. We'll probably have some kind of
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.640]  a site there that's dedicated to that so that most of the people who put something up, we're
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.360]  not going to be able to put up everything. We got literally several hundred just in the
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.680]  last couple of days of entries. But we're going to try to put up some work from a lot
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.480]  of people. A lot of people sent us very many entries. We're going to just put a few of
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.560]  those up. But stay tuned. We're going to be putting that stuff up there. Now, one of the
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.760]  things you might want to be aware of is we've got a special, pays for the bills, pays for
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:22.720]  these contests that we do. We've got a Propure water filter special this week. We got 15%
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:30.040]  off of any filters there. You can see that at Infowars.com, Infowars shop. And we've
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.960]  also got that special up on our Bilderberg page. We've got a special site that is set
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.580]  up just to cover information about Bilderberg. It's Infowars.com forward slash B as in Bilderberg.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.680]  You're going to see all the news about Bilderberg that we've got. You're going to see reports
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.600]  from other people. We had a clip earlier in the show from Michael Savage talking to his
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.600]  audience, explaining to his audience what Bilderberg is about. And it's great to see
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:01.400]  that news getting out there over a wide spectrum. Somebody that knows a little bit about being
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:09.000]  persecuted by the United Kingdom. He was refused entry into the United Kingdom. Supposedly,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.240]  I don't really know what they claimed his controversial views were. But they can be
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.360]  very selective about the kind of political speech they allow. Although we have people
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.760]  there at the Bilderberg group. It says Bilderberg group. This is from the Guardian says Bilderberg
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:32.800]  guest list includes George Osborne and Ed Balls, heads of big tax avoiding firms are
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.560]  attending this secretive groups four day summit. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? The same guys
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.440]  who create the taxes for us and create the income tax systems for us. Don't pay any taxes.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.880]  They just use that system to transfer wealth to their companies. We'll be right back. Hopefully
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.980]  we can get Alex again on the live on radio. He's traveling right now. So his connections
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.200]  are pretty spotty. But he's going to be doing a lot of coverage from Bilderberg and he'll
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:04.360]  be right back after the break. Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.320]  supernatural silver, a non toxic disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or

[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:06.120]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoods Direct. Right now, we have a huge number of Americans
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:11.520]  that are in serious trouble right smack dab in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters. I
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.240]  know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those who have
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.040]  lost so much and are in so much pain. We can't stand idly by. Food is the best way to help
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.680]  the victims and support the relief effort. We have a plan for any of you who would like
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.560]  to partner with us in providing food in this desperate time of need. We've built a seven
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:37.200]  day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for a whole week for one
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:44.840]  adult valued at $60. Your $25 will ship this life saving supply directly to those in need.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:55.720]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com. The food
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.560]  is contributed at considerably less than cost. Thank you.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:15.960]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:29.680]  That's right, we're here live. I'm David Knight and Alex Jones is in the UK and he is looking
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.560]  for answers. He wants to know what's going on and he's going to be telling us what he
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:39.520]  finds out. We had him on the phone live as he was en route and the reception is going
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.460]  in and out so he's going to be checking back in with us periodically. Once he gets on site
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.900]  and gets a stable connection, he's going to be here for a long time taking over the show,
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:53.480]  telling us everything that he's seen and he's been very active, as always. Alex never rests
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:00.160]  and he's been very active in the UK. Now, we covered last night on the Nightly News
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:10.880]  the idea that Motorola is coming up with a new high-tech device to track you and to basically
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:18.200]  enable you to use the internet. They sell it as a high-tech tattoo or a pill that you
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.380]  can swallow. And you know, it's such a problem when you have passwords that you have to remember
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:29.640]  that people are going to be willing to put these tattoos on their body or swallow pills
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.960]  in order to get rid of that problem. Do you really think so? Do you think this is something
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.560]  that is really coming from the public? Are there people out there complaining in your
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:45.020]  experience about remembering passwords to the extent that they're willing to do something
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:50.920]  like this? Let's understand where this is coming from. This is coming from Motorola
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.600]  Mobile. And the lady who is the head of that division now is the former head of DARPA.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.720]  Yes, the dark research people. That's why I like to call them the same people that create
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:10.200]  killer robots, the same people that are out there creating weapons, staying up all hours
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.520]  of the night creating stuff to destroy the world. That DARPA. She came from DARPA and
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:21.600]  she went to work for Motorola Mobility. They've been bought by Google. Yes, that's right.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.520]  It's all connected, isn't it? You've got this revolving door just like you used to see only
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.500]  in the military industrial complex with people going back and forth between military research
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:37.280]  projects and actually working for the military. So you have these revolving doors that are
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.600]  not disturbing just from a financial standpoint, but they're disturbing from the idea that
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:49.080]  Google is now buying out Motorola's mobile division, which then put in a head of DARPA
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:54.240]  who is then coming in and saying, we really want to make sure that everybody's got a password
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.680]  to get on the internet. They want to make sure that they've got some way to identify
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.760]  you. This is not being driven by the consumers. This is being driven by the elite leaders.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.300]  They want to know exactly where you are and what you're doing. And you've got to take
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:15.720]  this tattoo and put it on you like some kind of mark of the beast in order for you to have
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:22.260]  access to the economy. Remember that a big part of this immigration bill that's being
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:28.360]  pushed now in Congress is about extending biometric identification. We know that there
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.080]  got cameras all over the place that they're looking at facial recognition. They're even
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.760]  examining the way that you walk to identify people looking at your ears, whatever, but
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.240]  they want to take this to an all new level. They can never have enough control. It's kind
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:48.240]  of like the original Rockefeller, you know, he was famously asked at one point by reporter,
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.000]  you're the richest man in the world. How much is enough? Why do you keep accumulating more
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  and more money? And of course his answer was, there's never enough. There's always not how
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.020]  much is enough, just a little bit more. And that's the way it is with control. These people
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.500]  are control freaks. They want to control everything in your life and so they want to come up with
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:13.360]  tattoos and pills that you swallow in order to track you. Now also in tech news, we've
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.200]  got Apple devices. It's just been learned that Apple devices reported by the BBC are
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:24.300]  vulnerable to attack via a bogus charger. Look at how easy it is for the government
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:30.240]  or a malicious private individual to hack into your phone. Using a bogus charger, a
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.440]  team from the Georgia Institute of Technology managed to infect a phone with a virus in
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:40.460]  less than a minute. Any device using Apple's iOS operating system would be as vulnerable
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:46.940]  to infection, they claim. And they said that this affects all users. It does not require
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:55.220]  a jailbroken device and it does not require any user interaction. Now, famously a year
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:00.300]  or so ago, General Petraeus, a Bilderberg attendee now, he's there with his new best
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:05.940]  friend forever, Henry Kissinger. He was kissing Kissinger on the cheek, giving him an award
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.280]  for defending freedom and democracy just about a week ago. And now the two of them are traveling
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.120]  to Bilderberg. I'm sure they'll have a lot to talk about in defending freedom and democracy.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.500]  Don't you think that's on the agenda, defending freedom and democracy? Probably not. But he
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:26.960]  famously said that at a conference talking about how they were going to use appliances
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.900]  to monitor people and to spy on people. And we had a guest last night on the Infowars
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:38.900]  Nightly News. We had Sheila Hemphill and she successfully led an effort here in Texas to
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.620]  remove smart, not to remove smart meters, but just to allow people to have the freedom
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:47.700]  to opt out of these things. And we talked about that. If you haven't seen that report,
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:54.820]  that's a very good, very informative interview. If you know people that don't know why smart
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:58.960]  meters are dangerous, you need to show them this interview because what we do is we talk
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.440]  about the health issues. We talk about the privacy issues that I just mentioned and there's
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.260]  many other privacy issues. But we also talked about the economic issues. And there's a lot
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:12.840]  of people out there who were, I kind of call them the Fox News crowd. They don't really
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.980]  care about privacy. They may not buy into the health issues, but they care about money.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:23.700]  You can get their attention if you talk about money. And there's a lot about smart meters
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:29.760]  that is about money. There's an effort. What it is really is something that came up with
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.980]  about 10 years ago, their official report. Of course, I've been playing it longer than
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:39.560]  that. But it's about managing the decline of energy production in the United States.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.980]  Not only are they not building infrastructure in the United States, why should they? Because
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:47.380]  they're transferring all of our heavy industry and manufacturing to China. They're not building
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:53.180]  new power plants, but they're shutting down the ones that we've got. And they're managing,
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:56.740]  they're going to use these smart meters to manage that decline because they don't want
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.300]  to make less money. These power companies want to make more money. So how are they going
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:04.980]  to do that? They're going to charge you a differential price rate based on when you're
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:11.180]  using the energy. And they've already know that it's not going to change people's behaviors.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.820]  Certainly everybody is going to work at about the same time. So those are peak hours and
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:18.880]  people are getting up and getting dressed, taking showers, cooking. You can't change
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.620]  the hours that you work. So your peak use of electricity isn't going to really change
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:28.580]  even if they put very high rates on those peak hours. But it's going to be a way that
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:34.160]  they can make more money as they supply you less and less for what you pay. Now along
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:41.300]  that line, there's a massive protest in Tokyo. 60,000 people are protesting government plans
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:46.460]  to restart nuclear power in that area. Now in the wake of Fukushima, they've basically
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:53.020]  shut down all nuclear power in Japan. And now they're starting to talk about pulling
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:58.500]  it back up again. There are a lot of issues with nuclear power. It's not my favorite way
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:05.960]  to generate power. We have a power plant in North Carolina not too far from where I came
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.740]  from just outside of Raleigh. And they're now starting to see these nuclear power plants
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:17.540]  which were originally licensed for 25 years like this Sharon Harris plant in North Carolina.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:22.620]  And it's been 25 years now. And they're not doing anything to change the power plant.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.420]  They just said, we're going to extend the license. We're just going to buy Fiat say
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:31.040]  that it's safe and we're going to extend it for another 10 years, 20 years, 25 years.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.300]  Who knows how long it's going to go. It'll probably go indefinitely or until it melts
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.280]  down and they have a major accent like Fukushima. And it was within less than a year after they
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.660]  said we're going to just ignore this 25 year limit that they had to shut the entire plant
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:51.160]  down because they found technical problems that could result in a very, very dangerous
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:55.520]  leak there. So that entire plant as far as I know is still shut down. That happened a
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:03.020]  week or so ago. But the real problem with nuclear power is not even the accident issues
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:09.140]  that you see there but the fact that you have no way to dispose of the nuclear waste. Look
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:16.460]  at what the real issue at Fukushima was. The real issue is this pool of onsite stored waste.
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:21.160]  And once these nuclear power plants operate for a number of decades, the actual power
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.060]  plants themselves become so irradiated that they have to cease operation, have to shut
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:32.760]  them down and disassemble them and the components of the buildings actually become more nuclear
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.600]  waste along with the spent fuel rods. These are things that have to be managed, that have
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.320]  to be controlled, that have to be contained for tens of thousands of years. Now apart
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:49.980]  from the health issues, apart from the technical issues of doing that, let's go back again
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:54.260]  for the Fox News crowd to the money. Let's talk about the money. Who's going to pay for
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:59.300]  the constant containment and monitoring of that? Apart from all the health risks that
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.560]  can happen, and we've seen now with Fukushima what can happen if you don't keep those spent
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.980]  nuclear fuel rods contained. Unfortunately, we're shutting down the power plants, the
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:13.960]  typical, the old fossil fuel power plants, we're shutting them down at an alarming rate
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.160]  and we're seeing electricity rates go through the ceiling and those are not clean power.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:25.480]  We can build clean power plants from fossil fuels. They're not a perfect solution but
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:32.520]  when you look at these other types of solutions they only look worse. It's really sad to see
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.540]  what's happening to the power industry base here but of course as I said when you've got
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:42.080]  manufacturing being transferred across seas we don't I guess need to have that much electricity
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:49.040]  and you're going to see consumers paying a lot more for electricity as the primary users
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:54.080]  of electricity manufacturing gets shut down. Now in other news we've got emails of top
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:01.060]  Obama appointees is now a remains a mystery according to MyWay reporting here. They say
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:05.680]  that some of President Barack Obama's political appointees including the cabinet secretary
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.320]  for the Health and Human Services Department are using secret government email accounts
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.760]  they say are necessary to prevent their inbox from being overwhelmed with unwanted messages.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.120]  Sure that's why they're doing it. They're worried about spam right according to a review
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:23.660]  by the Associated Press. The scope of using the secret accounts across the government
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:28.960]  remains a mystery. Most US agencies have failed to turn over lists of political appointees
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.680]  email addresses which the AP sought under Freedom of Information Act more than three
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.620]  months ago. They tried to get the AP to pay more than a million dollars for these email
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:41.860]  addresses. Now of course we know that it's not just spam. They're trying to hide what
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.280]  they're doing just like they're trying to hide at Bilderberg. And we're going to be
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.700]  right back after the break. We're going to be with Alex Jones. He's going to be live
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:54.760]  on Infowars Radio here talking about what he sees in England at Bilderberg. Coming right
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.920]  up. Stay tuned.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:06.580]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoods Direct. Right now we have a huge number of Americans

[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:05.200]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:10.960]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:15.240]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:20.720]  obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.160]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:31.000]  this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.740]  cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now is

[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.040]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.600]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:08.840]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:14.120]  two together? Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points in.308
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:19.720]  sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal. But for how long? Go to Infidel Body

[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800]  quit.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.560]  We, the people, grow cotton and wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.520]  from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.480]  taxes to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.880]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]  a standing army?
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.260]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary

[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:26.040]  That's right. I am a man of constant sorrow. David Knight here for InfoWars. And Alex Jones,
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.820]  he's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour from Bilderberg in Watford, UK.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:36.460]  Right now, Alex is on the road caught in traffic there. Hopefully, they're not having any trouble
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:40.480]  figuring out which side of the road to drive on. That's always an issue if you've been
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.560]  over there. And I'm sure British people have the same problems when they come here. We've
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.900]  got some information about Bilderberg. And if you want to keep up with what's going on
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:55.880]  there, go to InfoWars.com forward slash B. That's B as in Bilderberg. And we have constant
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.400]  updates there, not just from what we're covering. But as other people cover Bilderberg, we have
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.480]  something that we talked about earlier today. We had a clip from Michael Savage, who has
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.880]  explained to his audience what's really going on with Bilderberg and why we should be concerned.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.760]  Some breaking news here from Steve Watson, who reports that a no-fly zone has been enacted
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:22.080]  over the Bilderberg meeting. Police regard the confab as a potential terrorist target.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:27.400]  Well, there may be some terrorist planning going on there. I don't know. That doesn't
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:34.020]  seem to be their style. Usually, what they like to do is they like to go incrementally.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:39.540]  We have another article here from Yurian Massen, who talks about Bilderberg's 60-year trajectory
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.100]  has been exposed. And this is the subtitle that he's got here on the article of what's
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:50.200]  really key. He says, incrementalism is the key to Bilderberg's long-term agenda. That's
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:57.320]  right. Incrementalism. It's not only the key to their agenda, it's the key to their success.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:03.760]  Leaked minutes from Bilderberg meetings in the past from WikiLeaks show that their first
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:10.620]  meeting was in 1954. And we don't have those meeting, those minutes from that meeting,
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:17.960]  but the next year, 1955, they were working in detail on both the European Union and the
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:25.520]  EU. And we see what's happened with that. And there was an interesting video submission
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.840]  in Operations Paul Revere that we featured at the end of last week. It's called Blockheads.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:36.160]  And the guy who put that together, the filmmaker, had some very good, it was good, very good
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.600]  narrative in it. One of the first things he talked about in the introductory piece was
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.320]  Gaddafi and why he was taken out. He was taken out primarily because he was talking about
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:54.200]  how the world was being broken down into just seven to 10 nation states. They were transcending
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.740]  national sovereignty, but he was trying to do it too quickly. And of course, put himself
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:04.220]  in charge. They didn't like that. They wanted to go with incrementalism. But certainly there
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:09.520]  is seven to 10 economic blocks, actually 10 have been identified now, trading blocks throughout
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.440]  the world. They're carving the world up incrementally into these trading free trade zones, quote
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:20.220]  unquote free trade zones. They're using the moniker of free trade, which is a good thing.
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.640]  Free trade would be a good thing if it were really free. But when you've got a document
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:31.580]  that is the size of a phone book, that's not free trade, that's managed trade. And free
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:37.200]  trade within an area is super. That's what made America so strong. You know, it was Jefferson
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:44.120]  in his second inaugural speech, he said that he had eliminated all internal taxation so
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:51.040]  that no farmer, no mechanic, no laborer knew a tax man. There were no internal taxation
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.000]  inside of America. All the taxes were paid on goods that came into the country that crossed
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.680]  national borders. You can do that when you've got a government the size of the government
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.600]  that Jefferson presided over. And we ought to be striving to do that. And people say
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.400]  the world is too complex. The world is too big. You know what? The government only makes
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.800]  the world more complex. What do we hear every time they screw up? We hear that they made
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.060]  mistakes. They couldn't handle it. We even heard amazingly heard from the Obama administration
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:23.880]  an excuse saying the government is so big we can't manage it. And yet these are the
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:29.000]  people who are trying to make it even bigger. These are the people who their centerpiece
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.400]  of the first Obama session, the first term was to take over a seventh of the economy.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.260]  And these are the people who are saying that it is too large to manage. Yes, it is too
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:47.720]  large to manage. Centralization is a bad idea. You know, going back to my college years,
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.640]  those were the days of the transition from mainframe mainframe computers to personal
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:58.500]  computers. And it was interesting for me to look at what a bottleneck mainframe computers
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:04.840]  made. You had these multimillion dollar centralized machines that were used in our particular
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.840]  case. It was used by multiple universities. It was so large and everybody was queuing
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:16.080]  up to wait on this thing. Everybody was standing in line to use the mainframe computer and
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:22.040]  it was monitoring everything that we did. Every little microsecond was being counted.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.140]  Every little bit of movement was being counted. It was making us wait on it. And the interesting
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:31.120]  thing was to see what happened when things were decentralized with personal computers.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:36.240]  At that point, the computers waited on us. At that point, we had control and it actually
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.320]  worked for the people. That's what we need to see happening in government. That's the
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:50.160]  model we need to see. We'll be right back with Alex Jones live from the UK. Stay tuned.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:30:00.680]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.640]  even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:13.460]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:18.480]  States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:23.900]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:29.540]  off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out

[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:21.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. Alex will be joining us shortly from
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.940]  England. We're still having some technical difficulties there, I believe. They were on
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:37.120]  the road. Traffic is a little bit heavy there in London, so we're running a little bit late.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:43.440]  We've got this breaking news out of Massachusetts. The Square One Mall yesterday was evacuated
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:49.000]  after a suspicious device was found in a parking garage. What was that suspicious device? It
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.720]  was a two and a half quart pressure cooker, stainless steel in nature, he says. They put
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:01.160]  a thousand yard buffer zone up around the pressure cooker, evacuated Best Buy and Workout
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:07.400]  World and people waited in the rain unable to return to their cars, stuck at the mall
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:11.920]  in the rain out of their cars for over two and a half hours. Why? Because they found
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.140]  a pressure cooker. This is what it's coming down to, folks. You talk about people being
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:22.560]  paranoid conspiracy theorists. I think we've got some in the government. Let's talk about
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.160]  the public here a little bit. We've got a great piece, another one that Mark Dice has
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:32.840]  done this time asking people about a Holocaust holiday. Let's take a look at that.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:38.620]  So out of touch with reality that they don't know what the Holocaust was. Will they sign
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:45.360]  a petition thinking that the Holocaust is a Jewish celebration? Let's find out. Would
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.800]  you help support the Holocaust party this year at the beach? The city is going to cut
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.320]  it due to budget cuts. We're just a couple of the visitor. I don't know. That's OK. It's
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.880]  like you're an American citizen. Yes, I am. That's OK. We just need a signature. The city
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:06.120]  due to budget cuts is eliminating the Holocaust celebration this year. And so the Jewish people
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:13.960]  a birthday, please. And so the Jewish people want to celebrate the Holocaust. It's a big
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:22.280]  reenactment each year. Sign there. There's a big barbecue. They roast pigs over spigots
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:28.600]  and the Holocaust celebration will be here in a few weeks. But now that you have supported
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:35.080]  the Holocaust party, maybe it won't get canceled this year. Thank you, sir. We support the
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.600]  Holocaust celebration for the festival, for the city. It's a big party. Just sign the
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:47.720]  sign here. Name and signature. You know, but the Holocaust, it's a big party. It's celebration
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:53.600]  for the Jews. They they hang out here on the beach. They dig a bunch of holes and bury
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:36:01.280]  people in the sand for for fun to celebrate the Holocaust. So this is supporting the Holocaust
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:14.040]  celebration. Thank you, bro. You're welcome. My God. Oh, my God. This is terrible. Support
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:19.520]  the Holocaust celebration festival this year. It's a big Jewish holiday, but the city, because
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.640]  of budget cuts, is trying to cut it down. So we're getting signatures to support the
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:30.880]  Holocaust celebration this year. Just a name and a signature, please. That's it. Yep. No
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:39.000]  birthday or a birthday to you, but no e-mail or anything. And it's a big holiday to celebrate
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.080]  the Holocaust every year. They do a reenactment. And so the budget cuts are trying to eliminate
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:57.760]  that. So this is going to support the Holocaust celebration this year. Thank you so much.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:05.880]  Every year the Jewish people do a reenactment and have bonfires and things. And thank you.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:20.280]  You on vacation? Yeah. Oh, nice. Get some sun while you're here. Just a name, birthday
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:27.680]  to support the Holocaust celebration. It's a big festival, a favorite festival of the
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:35.200]  Jewish people. They have bonfires and roast pigs over the spigots and stuff celebrating
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:43.560]  the Holocaust. Thank you, sir. Cool. Listen. And nobody so far has started arguing with
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:50.240]  me, threatened me, punched me. This is absolutely ridiculous. And these people are signing
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:57.520]  it is unbelievable to support the Holocaust Jewish celebration festival at the beach this
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.960]  year. They're trying to cut it due to budget cuts. I'm not a resident of California. That's
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.800]  OK. You're an American citizen, right? I'm an American citizen. OK. What this will do,
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:15.220]  you're signing a petition to help support the Holocaust, a second second Holocaust.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:20.640]  The Jewish people have really been looking forward to that. And a lot of people don't
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:31.560]  want that to happen. But you just sign a petition to support the Holocaust. Thank you. It's
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.880]  going to be a lot of Holocaust reenactments signature. They're going to be digging holes
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.960]  in the beach and burying people for fun as a contest to see how many bodies they can
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:51.600]  bury in the beach as part of the Holocaust celebration. It's the 22nd. So this will support
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:39:02.480]  this supports the Holocaust. Thank you. Unbelievable. Ever see when people dig a bunch of holes
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.120]  in the beach and bury people, there's going to be like, oh, you're going to see how many
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:11.920]  how many bodies they can bury on the beach. It's this old Jewish tradition in the sand
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:18.800]  and stuff and barbecuing. It is truly amazing. It is truly amazing. And, you know, we look
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.280]  at we look at how dumbed down people are here in the U.S. And it's just it's just amazing
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.960]  that they're so pacified and they'll take this stuff no matter what you tell them. You
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:33.120]  can you sit there telling them we're going to do fake body burying in the in the beach
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.080]  or anything. I mean, it's just people are just so pacified here in America. Well, we've
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.200]  got Alex live now. We've established connection. He's in Watford, U.K., covering the Bilderberg.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.160]  And Alex, are you there? Absolutely. David, again, thanks for doing a great job as you're
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.400]  going to be doing all week sitting in next Monday when I return. While I'm flying back
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.560]  in, we're going to have Mike Adams doing the whole three hours. And again, I just want
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.440]  to thank you and the whole crew for doing a great job and everybody that supported info
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:07.240]  awards dot com and prison planet TV over the years to allow the real alternative media
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.720]  to actually come here and expose this.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:14.520]  This is a huge victory. But there's so much Bilderberg news. And I got here about 40 minutes
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:20.200]  late because the traffic will know better tomorrow that I'm going to cover Bilderberg
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:25.300]  in depth with you at the start of the next hour. Then we're going to have Leanne McAdoo
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:30.600]  and Paul Watson in studio with us here on the road here in the hotel studio to break
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.340]  down what they've witnessed, what they've seen, their take on things. And I have some
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.680]  breaking news.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.480]  But during the next break, I need to reflect on it, write it down, pull some of it up,
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:47.680]  because I literally just got connected in here about five minutes ago and was listening
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:51.480]  to you talk about Mark Dice. So I'm going to cover all that Bilderberg news in the third
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:56.360]  hour. And then I've got some other obvious big world news, military news. They're pushing
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:01.000]  chemical weapons in Syria again when it's admitted that it's the Al Qaeda rebels that
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.340]  have it or using it. And I'm no fan of Assad, but as dictators go, he's kind of like a Hugo
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:12.600]  Chavez type, does some corrupt things, but it's nothing compared to the globalist. And
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.360]  we're offensively attacking their country and putting people in.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.880]  I don't want to exaggerate, but I've said like 10 times worse. And then I've thought
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.960]  about it. I go, wait, Al Qaeda is not 10 times worse than Assad, who's killing nobody before
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.560]  all this started. They're literally hundreds of times worse. If you look at all the mass
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:36.520]  murdering they do all over Africa, the Middle East, attacking Southern Russia. When they
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.000]  take over a country, they kick women out of college, put burkas on their heads, sexually
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.020]  mutilate them.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:48.800]  And I was just thinking about how just about 20 miles from where I sit is another famous
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:55.040]  town north of London that Watson's been to. He says it's not right wing propaganda. Where
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.320]  Muslims on the street go around telling women who were even non-Muslim, getting in their
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:05.840]  face, you better put on a burka. You better not wear that skirt. And about 40% of the
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:12.480]  population is Muslim in that town. So I tend to go over there, not saying Muslims are bad,
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:17.760]  but pointing out how the most radical of Muslims are being Saudi Arabia backed, British government
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.740]  backed, French government backed, NATO backed, US government backed.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:26.200]  And as much as some right wingers just say, kill all the Muslims, let God sort them out.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:32.480]  We need to understand, folks, our government and NATO takes the radical, really nasty Wahhabist.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.460]  We've had Syrian girl on, who ourselves is Sunni, but hates the Wahhabist, and put them
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:43.040]  in your country to blow up your mosque if it's not Sunni, or Sunni they like. They bomb
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.040]  other Sunni mosques that aren't crazy like they are, or if you're Shiite, or if you're
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.040]  Wahhabist.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:55.720]  I mean, this is a Wahhabist attack on everybody. So I want to get into that because it just
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:02.320]  hits me when you come to a country like the UK, or England, a part of the UK, where there
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:07.240]  are, from what I've seen, as many Muslims as there are English people. And they're here,
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.120]  a lot of them have embraced the culture and Magna Carta and things.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.880]  But the whole point is this Wahhabism does not match with the Bill of Rights Constitution
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.540]  or the Magna Carta 1215 it flows from. And I know you're a student of that as well, David.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:26.320]  And look, I'm all for having an open culture, but I don't want Al Qaeda around and I'm tired
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.520]  of being protected and then used to take our liberty.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.720]  So we're going to be talking about some of the big developments because they have it
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:34.980]  all over Sky TV here. They're Fox, I walked in the building, the hotel, they had it up
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:38.820]  there with Carney saying, we're going to do something about chemical weapons in Syria
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:43.680]  breaking. My gosh, just amazing. So that's all coming up.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.620]  But I want to say something about the Mark Dice piece that we posted on Infowars.com
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:54.480]  last night and that we just aired here for the radio listeners. People who are radio
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.780]  listeners should go to Infowars.com, it's up in the tile section, and they should watch
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:03.200]  it to see it. It's even more powerful. And of course, the trolls are in the video saying,
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:09.780]  how dare you make fun of the Holocaust? Or they're saying the Holocaust didn't happen.
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:14.980]  Both sides. No, Hitler killed millions and millions of people. No one knows for sure,
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:19.920]  but it's estimated that Hitler killed around because of the war, 20 million people and
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:25.580]  millions of Jews and millions of other groups, millions of other people, basically anybody
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:32.680]  that didn't roll over. And the fact is that to show how dumbed down the public is, especially
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:37.780]  in LA, there have probably been, let's not exaggerate, 200 Holocaust movies since World
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:42.600]  War II, 300, 400, it's probably a lot more. And I'm sure that number has been tabulated.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:50.460]  We can search how many Holocaust movies have been made.
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:55.800]  So despite that, despite that fact, if I seem distracted, they don't have air conditioners
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:01.320]  here in England. And in our hotel, we have the windows open and a giant yellow and green
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:08.200]  Hornet just flew through the window and over to me right behind the Skype camera and was
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:12.980]  hovering looking right at me and then just shot back out of the window. Sorry, takes
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:16.040]  a lot to distract me and just add a Hornet, literally a foot and a half in front of my
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.080]  face and just right here.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:25.140]  Getting back to the whole Holocaust situation, everybody knows about the Holocaust. Everybody
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:29.060]  knows about Hitler. Everybody knows about World War II and the death camps and the forced
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:36.480]  labor camps, or at least they should. And you can debate how bad it was or it goes from
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:42.720]  horrible to just over the top evil. It's all just shades of black, all shades of darkness.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.280]  But everyone you would think, even in dumbed down California, would know about the Holocaust.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:51.360]  And he's going, listen, we want to reinstate the Holocaust by the second half of the video.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.480]  And he said he had like 20 minutes of this. This is, he just cut it down to six, but he
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:01.120]  said everyone, basically, no one got mad. No one got upset. No one got threatened. No
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:07.840]  one got offended. He just said, we're going to reinstate the Holocaust because Jews love
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:12.040]  it and they want to experience it again and they want to roast pigs.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:17.760]  Everybody knows that practicing, you know, Jews, Hebrews don't eat pork, neither do Muslims,
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.480]  a lot of other people. The point is everybody knows that. So he's giving them hint after
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:25.540]  hint, we're going to bury them. We're going to add mass buryings. We're going to mass
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:32.660]  burials and they, all of them, all of them agreed and signed the petition to bring back
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:36.680]  the Holocaust and roast pigs over Jews in pits.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.680]  And it just shows how incredibly dumbed down and lazy. But these aren't just stupid people.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:47.000]  That's not even the main issue. Sure, their IQs have been reduced. No, it's that they
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.640]  watch TV. They're living in a la la land. They are literally in a dreamlike state. So
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:56.680]  I want to hit a couple other news items before I get into Bilderberg with you, but I'm sure
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:00.880]  you want to comment some more after playing that video as well, David, because that's
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.120]  frightening that I'm not singling out California.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.720]  There's some of the most awake people in central and Northern California, in San Diego. I love
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.600]  California. The topography, the weather, so much of it is great. Some of the most awake
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.760]  people I know are from California, literally. I mean, we're on six, seven stations in California,
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:23.060]  two of them in Santa Cruz. We have huge support. I go to California and thousands come out
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:26.440]  each night to hear me speak.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:31.700]  But at the same time, it's either you're awake or you're totally dumb. And in California,
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:37.680]  it's so extreme that in Austin, out of 10 people, nine say ban water if it's for the
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.400]  earth or if it's for Obama. There, all of them say ban water. I would imagine in Austin,
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:48.400]  if I went out and said, let's bury Jews, let's bring back the Holocaust, please sign a petition.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:53.840]  I'd probably get punched in the nose by the fifth person. There, I talked to Mark.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:00.160]  Yeah, it's amazing. It's amazing. I was looking at the comments from Rockefeller.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.160]  But absolutely.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:07.800]  Yeah, I was looking at the comments from Rockefeller about what he said about China. And the starvation
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.020]  that happened there, that's not widely known. The Chinese government has very effectively
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:17.400]  covered that up. Just now, some researchers in China are going through and uncovering
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.400]  some of these things.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.120]  There's no such thing as Freedom of Information Act in China. So that's not very widely covered.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:28.640]  But as you said, the Holocaust, what Hitler did, that is not only well understood, but
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:33.840]  it's iconic. It's what people talk about. I mean, you talk about making the trains run
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.240]  on time or or, you know, taking people to the showers or whatever. That's what people
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:44.760]  refer to when you talk about, you know, tyranny. Hitler is the template for that. So you would
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.880]  expect people- Listen, I wear 1984 shirts out and people
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.400]  come over and say, what does 1984 mean? I wear 1776 shirts out. People come over and
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.960]  say, what does that mean? And I've worn the the Gadsden flag, yellow don't tread on me
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:00.960]  shirt.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:06.200]  And I've had white people, black folks and Hispanics come over and ask me. The last time
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.680]  I was in a steakhouse at a company meeting waiting for the crew to get there at the bar
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:15.160]  and a black guy came over and he goes, what does that shirt mean? And I said, well, it's
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.320]  the Gadsden flag. Don't tread on me, Revolutionary War. And he goes, yeah, I heard that's a racist
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.480]  Tea Party thing.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.800]  Like he was gonna guilt me and then I was gonna apologize about it or something. Everybody's
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.720]  looking for these phantoms of racism or oppression. Meanwhile, we have mega banks shucking $85
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.040]  billion a month out of US taxpayer money and they won't even tell Congress who's getting
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.000]  it. And then meanwhile, everybody's looking for phantoms, phantoms of racism.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.480]  I saw a video we posted about transhumanist death cult at the Bilderberg meeting this
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.960]  year and they've got all this transhumanist art of humans being killed and then being
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.720]  turned into machines basically or machines overtaking humans, not humans merging with
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.800]  machines but humans having their humanity rotting away and it's replaced with machine.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:08.360]  And she was wearing Native American, because I bought my watch some of it, vintage Thunderbird
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:14.320]  earrings of the Thunderbird. It's a mythical bird and people are like it's Nazi, it's Nazi,
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:15.320]  it's Nazi.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:19.640]  And again, the reason I mentioned the trolls is not to mention the trolls, to mention the
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:26.560]  mass mental illness. It's kind of like Mike Judge said on the show that one of the characters,
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.320]  Dale on the show, never sees the big conspiracy right in front of him. It's actually going
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:38.100]  on like his wife has had a kid with, speaking of Native America, the Native American neighbor.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.600]  But then he thinks everything that isn't a conspiracy is a conspiracy. And actually talking
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:48.920]  to Mike Judge, he picked up on some of that watching my Access TV show 17, 18 years ago
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:53.320]  that people never wanted to face the real stuff I was talking about. They always wanted
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:57.320]  to talk about things that couldn't be proven or that could be.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.320]  You can always shut it down by calling it a conspiracy. We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:06.440]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:11.360]  and you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection, when you're sleeping

[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.040]  the latest bilderberg news in detail what we've been witnessing the press coverage and
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:41.320]  some really important inside information that i've been able to receive so that is coming
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:48.080]  up i'm coming to you from just northwest of london in wadford just about a mile away from
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:52.080]  the grove hotel we were thrown out of there last night i'm going to talk about that coming
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:57.680]  up i'm also going to about stonehenge i went to stonehenge today and let me tell you i
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:06.800]  thought it would be overrated not overrated and um i'm gonna tell you about that uh coming
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.640]  up or maybe i shouldn't uh but it was definitely there's definitely definitely very interesting
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:16.040]  uh very like a magnetic vortex and i think it's scientific not spiritual i mean i was
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:20.520]  like walking up going oh big deal and i was like i mean it was and the guys like oh the
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:28.760]  tour guide goes oh i noticed you uh just walked across the ley line and i was like wow i mean
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:34.860]  i liken it to when there was a faraday cage at the mid-american museum outside hot springs
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:39.240]  arkansas i shot video of this played on the nightly news it's on youtube and when they
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:43.680]  turned it on even though we were in the bleachers 30 yards away and it was inside a faraday
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:50.080]  cage my hair stood up i felt electric but it kind of felt assaulting like like bad energy
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:56.240]  uh you know it felt you know kind of tingly and weird this was incredibly positive and
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:59.400]  obviously they don't let you get near the stones now there's a million people plus a
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:03.960]  year ago there i just wanted to go grab and touch those things and and again i wasn't
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.860]  expecting anything i'm like oh big deal i've seen big ruins i've i've seen big pyramids
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:12.160]  in mexico i've seen it all big deal this is overblown and so we're just walking up the
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.440]  thing i'm on the phone talking to the office going let's get this ready i'm like whoa and
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:22.040]  man it's amazing so i kind of already told the story but i'll tell that at the bottom
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:28.080]  of the next hour when lianne mackadoo and paul watson are here they all felt it uh reeves
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:32.200]  felt a little bit the tour guide said unfortunately he doesn't have the magnetite or whatever
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:36.560]  it is in his brain he's uh because that's what scientists think it is as a lot of fish
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:41.060]  and other things have it some humans have higher deposits of it they're not exactly
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:46.540]  sure about the science but it's how birds use uh magnetic lines to fly south it's how
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:51.520]  bugs know how to migrate stuff like that uh and and he said he wishes he had it but he
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:57.040]  said uh in fact he said it was strange that three of a party of four had it as he said
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:00.880]  and he said he's not even a religious person you know he was like an atheist professor
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:08.880]  that works out there uh and uh but he said definitely it's it's a magnetic vortex um
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:12.400]  all right i already kind of told the story that's the thing about my show i don't really
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.040]  build stuff up unless i'm not ready to cover it yet i'm kind of focusing my mind to be
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.280]  able to go over all the facts but uh david knight do you have any comments about stone
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:24.120]  hands before we come back and get into build a bird yeah i have a personal story we went
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:31.100]  there uh in 1980 my wife and i went there and uh she's always remembered that we pulled
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:35.600]  up and it was before they had the fences out there and we just pulled up in the middle
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.600]  of january's very very cold very bleak got out of the out of the bus drove off and we
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.760]  were the only ones there and it just really scared her you know i'm kind of from an engineering
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.920]  background i'm like looking at this well how did they build that how did they do this and
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:52.960]  that but she was just totally creeped out about it she didn't feel the magnetic thing
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:57.240]  that you felt but when we came back she would always tell people i'd talk about stonehenge
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:02.280]  and she'd say oh it was horrible there was no place to hide and uh you know no place
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.480]  to hide and then one of our friends said i'm going back yeah listen listen i'm going back
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:12.520]  okay i'm gonna go move by that thing i mean i feel i felt so energized i felt like i was
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:17.640]  18 again wow and i hate to get into mumbo jumbo folks i'm telling you it was real i
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.860]  was like it was like whoa that's pretty amazing yeah she was just freaked out by the place
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:28.320]  and and she didn't even really know the full background of it it feels like a presence
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:34.160]  but uh yeah maybe that's what she was feeling but it really did spook her really did spook

[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:53.360]  new listener we have traveled to London England to the rural suburbs northwest of there to
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:09:02.800]  Watford to cover the massive anti globalist massive anti new world order massive anti
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:10.020]  world government protest that are going to be happening and there is unprecedented coverage
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:15.880]  of this it officially kicks off Thursday and runs through to the end of Sunday evening
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:21.240]  some of them go home Sunday evening others go home Monday I will be here until Monday
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:28.640]  riding shotgun back in the states coming to you from Austin Texas is David Knight of info
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:33.040]  Wars Nightly News and I've been able to listen via the free iPhone app when we were driving
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:36.600]  through traffic back and listening to the show sounds great and it's just great to have
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.840]  people like David Knight that can you know just come from a engineering background but
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:47.320]  also doing some advocacy work exposing global warming as a fraud and all that you know to
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:51.360]  have him step in to be doing a big national show like this so hats off to David right
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:56.480]  there in the studio now let me get into the news here first let's look at DrudgeReport.com
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:03.720]  and they don't get into our inside news and information center column of DrudgeReport.com
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:10.880]  has the mainstream news coverage of this and also infoWars.com coverage of it and the fact
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:18.920]  that you've got Business Insider, International Business Times, BBC, London Guardian, Sky
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:25.000]  Television and dozens and dozens I mean usually every morning I type in Bilderberg and click
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.760]  news on the search engine to see and it's usually about 15-16 articles a day lately
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:37.320]  now it was over 50 today and it's been on television here locally on channel 4 on Sky
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:41.880]  on BBC I've been talking to the activists they've been seeing it so this is very very
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:46.480]  exciting that again a group that didn't exist I keep repeating this we were crazy we were
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:51.560]  insane New York Times just four years ago said I'm insane that I was just running around
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:56.600]  in a parking lot imagining black cars and men in sunglasses following us you know that
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:02.240]  kind of stuff but but now they're discredited people are saying wait there are a group of
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:08.000]  a hundred and really 50 plus now they've expanded it royalty business leaders billionaires Bill
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.240]  Gates the head of Microsoft the head of Google the head of Facebook meeting with global regulators
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:20.320]  from EU regulators antitrust regulators from the US EU England you name it are there I
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.880]  mean okay and but they're like we don't discuss an agenda we just have two speeches that are
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:31.000]  an hour long apiece and that's it well yeah and then everybody meets and creeps out to
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.500]  their rooms or goes out on the golf course then they want to fence up and no cameras
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:40.280]  or no press and people try to sneak in because for those that don't know about politics we
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:45.400]  have laws throughout history that corporate insiders cannot meet with government regulators
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:53.180]  in secret now why is that because then how do you make money as a steel maker or a car
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:59.160]  maker or a computer maker or a telecommunications company or a manufacturing company you you
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:04.680]  don't make it making the best product anymore you make it going and shutting down your competition
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:10.160]  and all the groups that are at Bilderberg other than maybe like Peter Thiel are all
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:16.160]  about monopoly capitalism insiders controlling everything and I'm not even saying feels great
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:20.440]  guy either he funds a lot of libertarians he supported Ron Paul and stuff which I see
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:24.680]  as good work and you know he made his money himself so he's like well I don't you know
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:28.840]  don't take it from me in taxes but these other big globalists that are there they're the
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:34.440]  ones lobbying on record to have taxes raised in the middle class and on poor people to
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.760]  give it to them in banker bailouts and too big to fail corporate welfare and so that's
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:44.200]  my issue and these are the people lobbying that they be above the law globally that they
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:49.000]  be able to get away with anything so here's some of the articles up at DrudgeReport.com
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:55.960]  and again it's a big deal Drudge we knocked a big hole Jim Tucker discovered the dam well
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.480]  he'd tell you Westbook Pegler discovered it but didn't know what it was he was like what
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.800]  is that and then Tucker said that's a dam of info and there's a you know group meeting
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:07.800]  a cabal that's at the very top illegally and then he helped expose us there were Lockheed
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:13.040]  Martin investigations and indictments of politicians or the you know the prince of the Netherlands
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.520]  getting millions of dollars every time his country bought planes from the US at a price
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:22.880]  that was too high he got a kickback just you know all sorts of you know basic hardcore
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.400]  corruption because of Tucker then the group existed people knew it existed they found
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:31.480]  out what the prince was doing there they found out he was getting money and so that was when
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:34.920]  it was first in some European papers that's why they don't want to be known to exist because
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.320]  it's just crime going on hand over fist in there for three days just deals being made
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.680]  deals being made and yeah they've got other meetings where they do this too they break
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.640]  off at Davos and do this they they break off at the UN building and go to hotels and do
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:51.680]  this but this is where they get one big group of these people together and it's at the top
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:57.160]  of the pyramid it doesn't mean it's the whole capstone but it's a big big chunk of it and
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:02.600]  now it's emerging with Google but let me get into and and going with this whole technocracy
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:07.800]  angle let me get into the news that's up here because it's a big deal that pegler discovered
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:14.920]  the dam Tucker you know began to point out that we should knock holes in it info wars
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:19.840]  dot-com and our bigger audience rammed the first big holes in it drudge dynamited it
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:24.120]  and just blew the whole thing out so before was just some big holes and now the floods
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:27.580]  come down and they were saying there's no water behind that there's no insiders there's
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:31.680]  no smoking room there's no tyranny behind that now it's flooded out they're going what's
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:37.080]  the big deal we've got a reservoir we've got a lake you know they're just hey okay they
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.820]  said there was water behind that but big deal it's no big deal there's water here except
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:47.960]  it's not water it's tyranny and it's insider cronyism and it's globalist I mean we've gotten
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.400]  the minutes of Bilderberg WikiLeaks has some of they've confirmed they're real we will
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:57.040]  take over criminally violate you know the illegal we do now I can't do a good Kissinger
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:02.320]  the other stuff unconstitutional takes longer they hate the Constitution's Magna Carta Bill
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:06.560]  of Rights the old constitutions that people fought for in European countries they had
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:11.040]  some good constitutions they're all gone now and Bilderberg brags they set up the euro
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.060]  and I could go on with their exploits of evil I could go on with how truly infamous they
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:19.340]  are I could go on with how I've been death-threaded and my family's been death-threaded well how
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:26.620]  do you know it's Bilderberg it's people that know how to listen to your phone line and
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:32.480]  call you and tell you that they were just listening and they do it only when you're
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:37.320]  having a traumatic event like if I hear a family members had a car wreck or is in the
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:43.420]  hospital having heart surgery I go okay I'm gonna get the call like you know it's they're
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:47.880]  waiting psych warfare okay they're all emotional right now make the phone call they're listening
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:53.880]  all the time it's either the NSA or GS GQ or whatever it is or the private contractors
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:58.120]  over 800,000 individuals in the US that are hooked into all this that they're just on
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:03.800]  it listening you know I mean this is if you don't have privacy you don't have freedom
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:08.160]  any free creature the more advanced a life form on this planet is naturalists will tell
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:12.000]  you this and scientists environmental biologists will tell you the more advanced the life form
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.440]  the more aware it is of its environment that's the mark of an advanced life form and they
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:20.440]  tell you don't be informed don't be involved don't look at these photos from the Boston
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:24.400]  bombing don't look at the drill don't ask questions the way you survive is not asking
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:31.660]  questions not being informed the way you survive is rolling over and dying so that said here's
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:38.460]  some of the headlines Bilderberg sets up unofficial press office for first time in 59 year history
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:41.500]  and Charlie Skelton's over there we need to get over there he's been calling us all day
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:44.880]  Max Keiser's calling to be on the show later in the week David Eich's gonna be in here
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:50.200]  it's gonna be just absolutely jam-packed Thursday and Friday here on the broadcast we're gonna
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:56.600]  get Skelton on they've been trying to get us over to that so that's a article here and
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:00.480]  we're gonna get to that in a moment more detail and then we've got no fly zone enacted over
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:07.280]  meeting well actually the cops told us off record but we can say it just off record who
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:12.600]  said it and I'm meeting with one of the head cops tonight for dinner that no no we believe
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:16.960]  terrorists are probably going to strike that's the breaking news is that they're like we
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:21.240]  believe this is a target and we've gotten unspecified you know threats that this could
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:25.920]  be like a Bilderberg person calls in the thing like in Switzerland you know they don't never
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:32.120]  mind this famous voice it's not Henry Kissinger it is going to be an attack oh you know and
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.680]  so and of course I'm joking there's not gonna be an attack I'm quoting the hypothetical
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:41.040]  attacks but they're using that to wreck this big steel fence let me give a little heads
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:44.960]  up I'm gonna be dropping back by again we got thrown out last night I'm gonna have the
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:48.560]  crew in here in a minute to tell you about that that was quite a service we go over eating
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:54.040]  dinner in there and the head manager comes in and just shaking turning red Alex I'm thinking
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:58.320]  that maybe that no fly zone might be so that you don't put up a some kind of a surveillance
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:02.840]  drone on them don't you think maybe yes callers kept calling in going put a drone up put a
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:07.040]  drone up and we had actually planned that but I just a little RC or something but it'd
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:11.160]  be mainly a media stunt because they like something to focus on that's right that's
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:15.320]  right that could be why they've got that there and but now they've got guys in boats out
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:19.760]  there with poles like looking in the water for a meeting that doesn't exist and doesn't
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:26.240]  have any power and doesn't matter so absolutely so you've got that article on drugs report
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:31.200]  com middle column but fifth story down missing one two three four five yeah no fly zone enacted
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:38.600]  over meeting what are they doing in there Charlie Skelton article out of London Guardian
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:44.360]  it's all up there the week ahead Bilderberg 2013 comes to the Grove Hotel Wapford and
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:48.080]  coming up we're going to look at the agenda which which actually is written to be dry
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:54.120]  but it's cryptic when you know what the agenda really means but really the big breaking news
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:19:00.240]  here is this they are completely freaked out and have threatened to fire people that are

[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:35.740]  pages of notes he's got here of inside intel that we've been bleeding and gathering and
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:40.060]  I'm so hyper I can't even get to any of it and we're gonna tell you about our Stonehenge
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:48.540]  experience coming up as well just hours ago but continuing here with why this is such
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:54.740]  a big deal I've talked to multiple insiders I'll just leave it at that inside the hotel
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:25:00.280]  you name it they're totally freaked out that we have all these insiders because now just
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:08.220]  last night being in the hotel we walked around on the grounds while the G4S security which
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:13.380]  is all over England one of the biggest security companies in the world was going along with
[02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:18.420]  heavy equipment putting up these giant concrete blocks that look like they weigh about some
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:22.920]  exaggerate a ton of piece with a big metal pole out of them putting up steel grading
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:28.540]  about 10 feet tall they were putting us up all the way around the hotel and we were walking
[02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:34.500]  around like we own the place so we're going up talking to security getting photos discussing
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:39.480]  everything and then as it gets dark we go into the hotel restaurants they have three
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:43.700]  of them and one of them was full he said go to this other one so we go to this other one
[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:48.160]  it's all packed full of people we sit down the waiter comes over and is looking at me
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:51.860]  I could tell he knew who I was but I didn't say anything he just learned that you know
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:56.500]  that look I go over to get food and a female worker I'm not going to describe her in case
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:26:00.660]  they know she is she comes over and she goes I just want to say we appreciate in a British
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:06.820]  voice what you're doing with your team all of you hmm and we're gonna have and I'll talk
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:11.260]  to you later and she goes off so then I'm it's a buffet at this particular restaurant
[02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:15.660]  so then I get down to the end and another person a gentleman comes over again I won't
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:20.940]  describe him and he goes actually maybe I shouldn't even tell these stories but the
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:25.140]  point is it doesn't matter they know half their crews listeners anyways it freaks them
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:29.260]  out and he tells me how did you even get in here they run us through the ringer to even
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:33.260]  get in the building every day well we waltz in like we own the place just like the global
[02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:37.500]  crime syndicate does they rob the world but do it like they're doing a favor and have
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:41.540]  red carpets to get awards for doing it thank you for 85 billion dollars of your money a
[02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:46.940]  month we save the economy you know it's you who are lazy not paying enough when almost
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:51.180]  all the tax money goes to these fat cats and they're busy trying to destroy the economy
[02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:55.820]  so their wealth has more value they don't just steal it they didn't want to ruin us
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:59.440]  so they're the only ones with any money I mean they're gonna steal from me at least
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:03.860]  come back and spend it with me you know I mean it's it's like but see they're so evil
[02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:09.020]  they get that if they steal it then spend it we might be okay they want it they're totally
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:14.780]  greedy man you know I mean this is this is absolutely out of control it's the old saying
[02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:20.080]  of you can do you know what to me but you can't rub it in I mean I mean this is just
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:26.500]  completely out of control so we shoot the video that's on infowars.com transhumanist
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:31.180]  death cult Bilderberg to meet at the grove and we show all those statues and things then
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:36.580]  we go inside and all of a sudden they Richard was at the buffet and security comes and says
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:40.660]  come with us right now you'll be arrested well Richard you know kind of nicely went
[02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:43.820]  out the hallway to not make a scene to talk to him and they threatened him and you know
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:48.540]  throw him out and then they come back to us and I'm now at the table and the manager comes
[02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:54.260]  over the head security goes he had like tears in his eyes he goes mr. Jones mr. Watson leave
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:28:00.180]  now come with me into the other area and I said well hey give me the bill I'm gonna pay
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:05.060]  for the food we've gotten stuff here and there's some video of that too online and he wouldn't
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:10.220]  do that he said no you're gonna leave now so we we left even though we were registered
[02:28:10.220 --> 02:28:14.300]  there and they canceled it we're rude about it and had the general manager of the whole
[02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:23.820]  it's just incredible we drove in parked went in and they act like we're the criminals while
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:28.740]  it's these globalists now through our moles we were able to confirm that the police have
[02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:36.260]  been told by the higher-ups in the city and mi6 and mi5 that are all already there but
[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:42.940]  more of them arriving tomorrow and Thursday that a terror attack is imminent I mean we
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:46.420]  don't have any proof of it it's like Bush with the fake terror alerts that came out
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:51.320]  they would issue fake terror alerts as a political distraction alright Fleischer and admitted
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:55.380]  that so did others Tom Ridge admitted that they would issue terror alerts for political
[02:28:55.380 --> 02:28:58.700]  distractions so that's what they're doing here is they're saying we believe this is
[02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:04.620]  a terror target we believe that there's non-specific evidence of and I was talking to one cop I
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:08.540]  guess that's because a week ago somebody chopped somebody's head off and then you know the
[02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:12.860]  Muslim population is stirred up that was probably a real event so maybe they'll be drawn to
[02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:19.020]  this so I guess in some weird fantasy I guess there is some low probability that it could
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:24.980]  be a bag get there so you know for some real crazy but when we come back Paul Watson will
[02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:28.560]  will will break down the real breaking info and some more of the articles that are up
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:35.060]  on infoawards.com and then Leanne McAdoo will give you her take on this and so much more

[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:55.060]  you go to infowars.com right now we have the live coverage linked at at the build a burden
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:35:00.300]  area of the site info wars.com forward slash build a burger info wars.com forward slash
[02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:05.000]  b please send that address out to everybody you know tonight or tomorrow morning i'm not
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:10.820]  sure when we're going to publish the build a burg demonstration battle plan or the build
[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:15.740]  a burg exposure battle plan we already published the maps an article last week we're going
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:19.780]  to publish them where we've been where we think the best vantage points one reason paul
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:23.200]  hasn't gotten the article out yet go and grab that sorry i dropped it is that we've now
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.500]  reconnaissance it several times ourselves i'll go back tonight and run another reconnaissance
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:31.080]  on this and obviously i'm telling them that we're coming because when they show up like
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:37.780]  idiots all acting scared of us it's better kind of like uh production uh quality what
[02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:42.020]  do they call that in that movie uh super 8 where the kid wants to shoot the scene with
[02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:47.100]  a train coming by and he goes it's it's production value you know to have these idiots running
[02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:53.140]  around in the background the point is literally these security guys like jump at us like we're
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:57.540]  gonna grow 18-foot fangs and eat them um you've got your whole list here but i want to like
[02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:02.540]  be able to mark a map and then screenshot that like where we think the best vantage
[02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:06.340]  points are people to get shots and then again that'll give the police a place to go try
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:09.660]  to stop them but it won't matter it's such a giant perimeter but it's mainly on that
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:13.620]  back side entrance where you get the shots into the helicopter pad where they're going
[02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:17.820]  to be at watson so i want to talk to you about that the problem is we've got too many ideas
[02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:23.500]  too much victory to be able to kind of have all the victories uh but um why is amazon's
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:30.600]  jeff uh bezos attending the 2013 wilderberg conference what's on how he they get out of
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:38.260]  taxes and whereas i've been a defense i happen to pay internet sells taxes get it still they're
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:42.820]  only doing it from their position he's not lobbying for me to be able to keep my money
[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:47.600]  and spend it as i see fit and have a free market economy where my voting with my money
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:56.140]  my dollars my pounds my euros my shekels rins yons then has an effect that builds the world
[02:36:56.140 --> 02:37:00.620]  that individual ideas want to build it has to be with the builderberg group and the un
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:07.780]  and the globalists want to build but builderberg's 60-year trajectory exposed powerful article
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:13.780]  up on info wars.com no fly zone enacted over builderberg meeting michael savage on danger
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:18.420]  of builderberg 2013 and new world order good job to michael savage coming in for the big
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:25.100]  win joining the team builderberg authoritarianism destroys humanity builderberg security kicks
[02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:31.720]  out alex shones builderberg 2013 transhumanist death cult amazon and google chiefs join with
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:36.700]  corporate tax avoiders at annual builderberg confab that's just some of the news and all
[02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:42.320]  the other world news is under that at prison planet.com and info wars.com but without further
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:52.980]  ado i want to bring col watson in a native of britannia to give us his take and so much
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:57.580]  breaking news so much inside info and also to get into what you thought of being thrown
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:02.720]  out of the hotel last night and of course the day before you were also thrown out by
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:07.460]  them even though you were booked there we're coming back today as well so just the fact
[02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:10.300]  that we're telling them we're coming we'll have even more security out it'll be easier
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:16.380]  to penetrate that way they don't understand terminology of strategy uh but uh watson i
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:21.440]  will stop my perseveration uh give me your general take on how big this is the breaking
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:22.440]  man
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:29.860]  oh what's interesting hold on they just lost me
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:35.060]  okay back yet just came back we are we are we are back live here thank you guys go ahead
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:39.460]  yeah some of the breaking news just came out in the last hour is the fact that the um mayor
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:45.220]  of whatford after first calling us we've got to speak up get closer to the mic or we need
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:50.780]  to turn the mic up and in fact should we go to break and come back with this or we could
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:56.500]  okay just turn them up go ahead yeah the mayor of whatford has come out and said that basically
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:39:01.140]  she's written a letter to the prime minister david cameron after first insinuating that
[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:06.800]  we were violent extremists and she's now demanding that they account for the expenses the millions
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:12.080]  of pounds in taxpayer expenses that this security operation is going to cost and this is also
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.500]  after a prominent politician here locally came out and basically said the same thing
[02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:21.700]  so for the first time it seems a prime minister of britain is going to have to address the
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:27.700]  bilderberg meeting because of course tony blair lied in front of parliament saying he
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:32.420]  never attended the meeting whereas in private he told luke radowski that he did so it looks
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:38.420]  like david cameron is going to have to address the fact that bilderberg actually exists is
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:44.560]  a real meeting of 120 of the world's power brokers and the whatford mayor after first
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:50.700]  demonizing us now appears to be on our side and they're they're asking for answers because
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:56.660]  how dare us want to know about what's going on well exactly i mean this ring of steel
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:40:02.020]  that you talked about to protect you know us from them to protect them from us whatever
[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:07.300]  you want to look at it it's amazing because they've got actual criminals who were over
[02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:13.500]  the libor scandal they've got hsbc people fined for laundering money for terrorists
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:18.220]  and drug laundering money and running drugs and terrorists and i mean what's wrong with
[02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:23.540]  fixing interest rates so yeah and you know peter southerland responsible for the subprime
[02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:29.220]  mortgage collapse they've got actual financial criminals who are laundering money for terrorists
[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:33.920]  and drug lords and you know wonder they don't want to be looked at and yet we're the threat
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:38.800]  why are we the threat they're the threat to us so why have they spent all this money erecting
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:47.140]  this ring of steel to protect them from us we should be being protected well said watson
[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:52.460]  another thing is they're discussing big data at bilderberg this year which basically means
[02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:57.860]  creating the the surveillance database system spying on social media i need to get into
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:41:03.140]  the agenda that's the big thing i was supposed to cover the agenda yeah that's the secret
[02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:09.780]  ingredient of eggs erroneous but at the same time alex the dhs over in america is talking
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:15.180]  about the exact same thing big data they use that very same they create the talking points
[02:41:15.180 --> 02:41:19.800]  and then hand them down to the minions but then the talking point has compartmentalization
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:27.140]  within it precisely so you know google bilderberg dhs they're all very much on the same page
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:34.100]  in the exact same week talking about the same issues it's amazing watching uh continue with
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:41.300]  what happened last night describe that basically we went up to the grove hotel again it was
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:46.800]  my third visit it was alex's first visit obviously because he only landed yesterday uh we walked
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:51.900]  around the grounds took some pictures of the gardens the skeleton statue we tried to go
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:55.580]  and eat at a separate restaurant that's near the back of the property quite out of the
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:42:01.180]  way that was full so we were directed to go to the main restaurant which is right next
[02:42:01.180 --> 02:42:08.580]  to reception in the actual hotel itself um we got in we sat down literally within 10-15
[02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:15.620]  minutes the security were on us first they kidnapped richard reeves he suddenly disappeared
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:20.640]  um and leon told me that they'd taken him away at that point alex was out getting dinner
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:25.860]  because it was like a fancy restaurant with like violin music playing like guys grab reeve
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:31.460]  he disappears but before that several members of the hotel staff actually came up to alex
[02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:35.780]  and said you know we're fans we support what you're doing so they're aware of it which
[02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:40.500]  is why the security is so scared of us being there in case we get sources out of the hotel
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:44.860]  staff and wait till the group till the bilderberg guys are so rude to them they'll all be on
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:50.860]  our side hillary's like don't you look in my eyes you bastard i've talked to tucker
[02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:54.660]  and others have talked to multiple witnesses and then she'll have them fired if they look
[02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:59.660]  at her and those memos got leaked like 15 years ago you don't look at her precisely
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:04.260]  and i mean a lot of these people are billionaires and yet routinely we hear from the hotel staff
[02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:08.860]  at these bilderberg meetings that they don't don't tip they don't tip at all even though
[02:43:08.860 --> 02:43:14.100]  they're billionaires so that's why the staff at all the hotels get really you know pissed
[02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:19.860]  off with these bilderberg members and then later they leak information to um jim tucker
[02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:25.740]  god rest his soul now other people who are taking over so yeah basically we were in there
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:29.940]  richard reeve's got kidnapped i came back to sit down alex was out getting the buffet
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:36.300]  dinner um they went obviously obviously shoveling carrots down my throat they went to get alex
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:41.420]  they went to speak to alex told us to leave they then came to the table told me to leave
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:45.820]  and basically we said no we want to finish dinner you know we're gonna pay for it yeah
[02:43:45.820 --> 02:43:50.300]  let's be clear they grabbed richard they all came around me and i said no and then waddled
[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:54.700]  back over with my food and i kept eating it while they were standing around the table
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:59.740]  with all these people looking at us describe that yeah apparently all the people around
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.220]  us would you know they were aware what was going on some of them they knew we were media
[02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:10.040]  and these security guys are just kind of hanging out outside a door that was five feet away
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:14.080]  from our table also at the table they were at the table then we said no we want to finish
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:18.420]  our dinner so they were hanging out behind the door peering through the window and we
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:23.040]  were just sat there trying to finish this dinner which we were going to pay for including
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:29.060]  an expensive bottle of wine um we did manage to finish probably half of it um and then
[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:33.960]  we we picked up the cell phones started rolling the cameras and started walking outside and
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:39.060]  talking to these security personnel again but the head of security literally was shaking
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:42.860]  and had tears in his eyes well that's what he looked like the first time when me and
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:46.700]  richard went there and i mean i don't know why he's so concerned all we're doing is eating
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:51.940]  dinner taking carrots shoveling carrots down our throats taking some pictures of a garden
[02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:55.780]  what possible threat is it to their security but i mean it's okay if you rob the whole
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:45:00.940]  world just yeah yes you can launder money for terrorists and drug lords but just don't
[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:05.940]  eat al-qaeda and libya and syria but just just whatever you do don't don't uh don't
[02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:13.460]  have a chianti and carrots exactly don't take picture of the skeleton statue so basically
[02:45:13.460 --> 02:45:19.780]  we were we were talking to them we were filming them they escorted us outside um eventually
[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:24.000]  we got in the car we were talking to them the whole way uh we started driving out the
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.900]  property we were followed by a security guard in a separate car behind us who then did some
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:33.380]  weird thing where he kept reversing and almost crashing into the side of the path because
[02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:38.340]  we me and alex got out of the car at the exit he was menacing our van with his back of his
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:44.160]  truck yeah he like ran into something up again so then me and alex got out of the vehicle
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:50.180]  while richard and leon drove away in the in the bus in the car and um apparently the the
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:55.480]  police soon arrived after that in the general vicinity and were pulling over other individuals
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:59.500]  which they may have mistaken for us we're not sure about that but that's that could
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:03.340]  have been what was happening but you know the the police turned up at the hotel last
[02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:07.540]  time when me and richard were there and did nothing they turned up outside got out the
[02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:11.680]  police car and just walked around to a different side of the building so the police don't seem
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:15.340]  to be too keen in getting involved although i've talked to our sources they were just
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:20.060]  told they were actually told a bs story last night then no we we rolled down the window
[02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:24.780]  and talked to them yeah they didn't stop us i know yeah so they don't want to be involved
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:28.140]  the whole deal is they get it they don't like it and they're like why don't they have their
[02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:32.340]  own security we don't have to sit here and fear by like criminals exactly so so so that's
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:35.620]  what's going on on that front we're going to go to break in a few minutes and come back
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:40.620]  with a final segment the main show with leon mackadoo then i'm going to continue with bilderberg
[02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:50.280]  news 2013 and again we've got some other major breaking news as well i need to analyze their
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:54.380]  agenda because this agenda that you're going to hear is what you're now for the next year
[02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:59.340]  you're going to hear over and over again there's an article bilderberg's 60-year trajectory
[02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:04.860]  upon info awards.com that is so incredibly important because it explains see if you don't
[02:47:04.860 --> 02:47:11.620]  study you're like who cares of 150 people or being in a hotel when you realize this
[02:47:11.620 --> 02:47:18.500]  is one of their big secret meetings at the top of the pyramid that has been unearthed
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:22.860]  and i use this analogy with david eich yesterday because i've watched discovery channel shows
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:28.140]  or history channel shows like all of you have all the time out in the sahara desert or even
[02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:35.160]  in yucatan mexico or guatemala south of there or in places in peru they'll be doing a construction
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:41.220]  site or building a dam and someone will notice something sticking up out of the rubble a
[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:47.820]  spire and they start digging and there's a whole palace under it and that's what's happened
[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:54.060]  bilderberg is the key part of the palace of the new world order the fortress of darkness
[02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:58.340]  but now we've dug away more and more and it just gets worse and worse it's like a police
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:05.900]  investigation i've used the analogy of finding one body in a guy's car that's bilderberg
[02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:09.980]  if i'm a dead woman in the back seat or in the trunk and they go to his house and there's
[02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:15.980]  30 dead people they're in refrigerators they're buried in the basement they're in the backyard
[02:48:15.980 --> 02:48:20.900]  uh you know it's like jeffrey dahmer that's how it is that's why they're like don't look
[02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:27.140]  at us nothing going on we don't exist okay we exist but we're no big deal because it's
[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:32.140]  the we've gotten their minutes people have stolen the minutes it's come out bilderberg
[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:35.820]  group members have bragged and published books like the german chancellor helmut schmidt
[02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:39.980]  back in the 80s and he's like what's wrong with world government yeah we're gonna take
[02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:44.460]  over and merge with machines and bring in world government i mean why not it's the next
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:50.340]  trip thing i don't even think helmut schmidt's an evil guy you know it's it's kind of like

[02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:36.980]  is an allegory where rowdy piper has to beat up his black friend forget what his name is
[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:41.620]  in the film to make him put the glasses on because it's so easy you put the glasses on
[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:45.340]  you you start looking at what's really going on in the world you pay attention and let
[02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:48.180]  me tell you you're going to see so much you get a headache you want to take the glasses
[02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:53.540]  off that's another allegory is that i've tried to get the guy that wrote that essay back

[02:49:57.860 --> 02:50:03.300]  the glasses off you know because he's giving you a headache you know seeing the truth is
[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:09.060]  seeing is a headache too but it's better than being a total slave living an obsolete and

[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:29.180]  layan mackadoo and paul joseph watson are there talking about what they've been seeing
[02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:36.340]  at build-a-burg it's live there at uh... watford england just north side of london but the
[02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:43.580]  interesting context of what's going on here is from an article by the guardian a uk newspaper
[02:54:43.580 --> 02:54:49.180]  talks about the irony of build-a-burg happening at the same time that there is a massive scandal
[02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:55.980]  unfolding in the uk over lobbyists that's right just like in america lobbyists who come
[02:54:55.980 --> 02:55:02.740]  in and talk to politicians have very strict rules about when they can meet and these uh...
[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:06.460]  disclosure of these meetings and that sort of thing and yet in the midst of this giant
[02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:10.500]  scandal that's involving members from every one of the political parties there pretty
[02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:15.860]  much so not but not the uk party as far as i understand it's just amazing that while
[02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:22.420]  this is all happening uh... you've got build-a-burg where the most powerful people are meeting
[02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:29.460]  in secret six surrounded by security private and public security for nearly a week and
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:33.620]  no one is allowed to know what they're talking about there's not going to be any disclosure
[02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:39.480]  no controls no transparency this is all happening while there's a major scandal about that very
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:42.900]  thing happening in the uk parliament alex are you there
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:48.220]  david that is amazing what you just said you know when i was flying here on sunday we talked
[02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:53.020]  or maybe it was saturday and you said obviously you see the big scandal breaking in the news
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:57.980]  over lobbyists and payoffs in government and look at how build-a-burg is a giant lobbying
[02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:03.080]  meeting that's why they don't want to look at and i just realized that's the real angle
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:09.180]  in this this is a giant secret lobbying meeting going on during england's biggest lobbying
[02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:13.940]  scandal ever with what is it three or four members of parliament have resigned how many
[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:18.140]  is it now i think it's three last i saw it's almost like you could hold a two big
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:23.860]  to jail scandal right that's it that's it build-a-burg too big to jail the lobbying
[02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:28.660]  scandal lotson you go write that i'm telling you because because i love david not he points
[02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:33.860]  out stuff that's so obvious i've missed it but also so so important absolutely david

[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:15.180]  as i've been tired i was driving to the airport with mackadoo and you're like hey notice this
[03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:19.820]  is a lobbying meeting and there's a scandal about lobbies and i got it but i forgot it
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:24.260]  and then i'm like whoa whoa that's the big angle no one's hitting that's the big enchilada
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:31.180]  yeah yeah the lobbyists the giant lobbyist meeting that and they're pointing out in the
[03:03:31.180 --> 03:03:36.380]  local papers here that uh of course uh david cameron and companies said they were going
[03:03:36.380 --> 03:03:41.020]  to have the most transparent administration ever does that sound familiar you heard somebody
[03:03:41.020 --> 03:03:45.700]  say that yeah exactly obama said that the people who focus on that it's almost like
[03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:49.860]  a tell it's almost like saying you know we're going to be honest we're going to be open
[03:03:49.860 --> 03:03:53.620]  because they know they're going to be the most crooked secretive cabal that's ever been
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:58.860]  empowered right so it's almost a tell of exactly the opposite of what they're going to do is
[03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:06.340]  what they campaign on we're gonna what was that and i was crushing lian's head oh okay
[03:04:06.340 --> 03:04:10.380]  i'm crushing our head i'm crushing our head i thought you were giving me a secret hand

[03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:07.620]  outside we weren't intending to have some wild experience but looking at them just in
[03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:13.340]  the last six years publishing their names and then now their agenda looking at this
[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:17.220]  i want to talk about their agenda but for people that just joined us david nice the
[03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:20.700]  one that pointed out the elephant in the room to me sunday when i was going to the airport
[03:09:20.700 --> 03:09:26.420]  just a few days ago and or i guess just a few days ago just like a day and a half ago
[03:09:26.420 --> 03:09:31.700]  that there's a lobbying scandal three or four members of parliament resigning huge corruption
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:37.260]  and here that's what bilderberg is is a secret lobbying meeting hiding in plain view and
[03:09:37.260 --> 03:09:41.460]  of course it violates the logan act we've made that point before but that's why they
[03:09:41.460 --> 03:09:45.500]  don't want to discuss that's why they don't want to be seen driving in because they can't
[03:09:45.500 --> 03:09:49.860]  believe they're going in and saying i own this energy company i will pay you 200 million
[03:09:49.860 --> 03:09:54.900]  in your swiss bank account is of the governor of texas you shut down all competition agree
[03:09:54.900 --> 03:10:01.340]  with the federal government i mean that's the type of stuff going on yeah that's not
[03:10:01.340 --> 03:10:06.380]  on their lobbyist schedule is it that they don't have those kinds of things listed on
[03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:10.300]  their on their schedule of events they've got a schedule of events and of course since
[03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:14.300]  there's no transparency we don't know exactly what that is as you mentioned before even
[03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:19.180]  on the attendees list the real people that we have to worry about are the ones that they
[03:10:19.180 --> 03:10:23.380]  don't mention the people that they're grooming to be future presidents that just show up
[03:10:23.380 --> 03:10:26.880]  coming in the back door that's who we want that's who we want that's why we need more
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:31.260]  eyes like kind of like a compound eye we need thousands of people here with their own cameras
[03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:35.380]  their own youtube and whoever gets because they always think we're not there like when
[03:10:35.380 --> 03:10:40.940]  eric holbrook or holbrook walked out uh or the head of google walked out or all these
[03:10:40.940 --> 03:10:47.940]  cases you don't know you may be a prostitute in north london and and and and bill gates
[03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:52.980]  comes in i'm not saying he goes to prostitutes but the point is he's got plenty of microsoft
[03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:58.460]  groupies i'm told but the point is is that you never know where the intel is going to
[03:10:58.460 --> 03:11:03.820]  be i want to go over some of the agenda uh here but uh lianne macadam before we go into
[03:11:03.820 --> 03:11:07.820]  the agenda i want to keep you here for stonehenge any other points you want to add about what's
[03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:11.380]  happened uh what's the first thing to come to top of your mind discussing build a burden
[03:11:11.380 --> 03:11:18.940]  um well i thought it was kind of funny that the um what was it the g4s were guarding this
[03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:23.300]  room where they it looked like they were setting up a dance party and so that just gives me
[03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:27.840]  like a really i i'm well they were building platforms putting in lights yes like if they're
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:34.180]  gonna have a disco dance party with kissinger and i mean this is i want to be in there i
[03:11:34.180 --> 03:11:40.640]  want my cameras i gotta see that i need to see it i got a feeling it's for some special
[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:47.060]  speakers uh get down and what did you make of of of the head of security like tears in
[03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:52.460]  his eyes he just was so i couldn't tell if he was just so angry i mean he looked like
[03:11:52.460 --> 03:12:01.500]  he wanted to cry and he was like he was like mr alex jones and you're like that's me i'm
[03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:06.060]  just getting some that's right you were there when he confronted me yes you just hear this
[03:12:06.060 --> 03:12:11.860]  diabolical voice and you know tries to lead us out and i said to him you know do you have
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:17.560]  any idea what's going on with those and he said ma'am i'm you know i try to try to remain
[03:12:17.560 --> 03:12:21.420]  non-political and i'm just the manager here at the grove and i said but you you have no
[03:12:21.420 --> 03:12:26.220]  idea who you're but how who are they to cancel our reservations four days before it started
[03:12:26.220 --> 03:12:31.740]  exactly who are they to have their the the security shaking and fear of people they they
[03:12:31.740 --> 03:12:35.940]  know who we are they know i have no criminal record i mean the worst thing they're gonna
[03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:40.420]  get is i'm gonna buy them dinner exactly and you're always you know so nice and treat them
[03:12:40.420 --> 03:12:45.420]  with like such respect and he's going to be in for a huge shock when they treat him like
[03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:50.920]  dirt on the shoe that's what the banana hits because they are such jerks affordably none
[03:12:50.920 --> 03:12:56.460]  of them get dips right oh no yeah that's i work because why would you give a scum anything
[03:12:56.460 --> 03:13:00.980]  yeah it's all about it's all about dominating people yeah and that's the thing that is so
[03:13:00.980 --> 03:13:05.140]  frustrating because they're really spinning this as the protesters and the you know the
[03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:09.440]  press and all these people that they're going to be committing all these criminal acts and
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:14.620]  that everyone needs to be careful of the protesters and you know closing off the roads and not
[03:13:14.620 --> 03:13:18.140]  letting anyone camp out originally you know they were going to let people can't they're
[03:13:18.140 --> 03:13:21.820]  telling locals not to let us use their property yeah farms in the area and trying to kind
[03:13:21.820 --> 03:13:27.520]  of scare the locals and spin and and just kind of don't worry about why they're protesting
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:32.560]  or why there's this big uproar of these people meeting it's just you should feel lucky and
[03:13:32.560 --> 03:13:38.840]  you should feel special that the elite chose your town to come and have their first i'm
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:43.860]  just glad we're prestigious enough but the good news is watson reading her in the paper
[03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:49.000]  you're saying that looks like she's starting to wake up yeah she's written a letter to
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:54.360]  david cameron prime minister of britain basically complaining about the security costs and demanding
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:58.420]  that the central government pay something towards those costs so that's a big shift
[03:13:58.420 --> 03:14:02.240]  from what she said earlier which was just demonizing the protesters but what's also
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:07.540]  interesting is that the grove security said that they were non-political in their actions
[03:14:07.540 --> 03:14:12.160]  in turfing it out because my complaint was that we were being discriminated against based
[03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:18.060]  on our political views and that's a british anti-eu law yeah it's illegal to do that like
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:23.480]  hitler first shut down hotels and stuff to jews like hotels were shut down to blacks
[03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:27.520]  you shut people down where they can go for their views their religion their color that's
[03:14:27.520 --> 03:14:34.720]  real tyranny yeah it's illegal under the equality act of 2010 and eu human rights law also affirms
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:38.840]  that it applies to political opinion because people who've been sacked for supporting a
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:44.340]  political party have won cases people who've been denied services in hotels based on that
[03:14:44.340 --> 03:14:49.120]  same law have won cases so the fact they said oh we're non-political it's very humiliating
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:53.980]  to book something you've no you've done nothing wrong and then you can't be there and you're
[03:14:53.980 --> 03:14:58.160]  treated like a criminal yeah and we it's not like we were trying to access secure areas
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:03.760]  we were in the garden slimy lobbyists want to meet and engage in crime exactly going
[03:15:03.760 --> 03:15:09.800]  onto the agenda though i noticed the top of the list is can the u.s and europe grow fast
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:16.240]  and create jobs which is pretty ironic given the fact that back in 2006 before it happened
[03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:21.200]  daniel estulin could predicted the housing collapse in america because you have the source
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:24.360]  they were going to the source yeah that was the big banker that was over that big production
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:30.960]  house and that was in canada in 2006 build a big no no they they own china they're deindustrializing
[03:15:30.960 --> 03:15:36.080]  us on purpose so everything they put in the agenda is the opposite of what they're actually
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:44.440]  doing exactly we want to give you jobs we're going to go over the trends right now okay
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:48.400]  give us the trend you want to talk about well i'm just curious i mean touching on what you
[03:15:48.400 --> 03:15:52.000]  said about the way that they have the agenda it's like oh look it's just harmless we're
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:56.480]  going to talk about jobs and entitlement but the thing that's kind of worrying to me are
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:02.360]  the major trends in medical research that's like well what do you have up your sleeve
[03:16:02.360 --> 03:16:06.760]  well that's used us as guinea pigs while they discover the fountain of youth but test it
[03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:12.320]  all on us yeah look what our research with our gmos have done to the humans david knight
[03:16:12.320 --> 03:16:16.240]  you want to say anything about this agenda yeah i think it's pretty amazing just like
[03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:21.440]  we said before the break that their stated purpose is public education i mean what a
[03:16:21.440 --> 03:16:25.520]  what a bigger lie could they come up with i mean here is the most secretive group you've
[03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:32.440]  ever seen absolutely there's no oversight there's no public information of this at all
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:40.460]  and they call it a public education organization and they also have a private charity registered
[03:16:40.460 --> 03:16:44.240]  in the uk that's paying for these expenses and there's three people listed at the top
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:51.540]  of that charity and the the one guy one of the three guys is marcus agius if i'm pronouncing
[03:16:51.540 --> 03:16:58.040]  his name correctly as agius former chair of barkley's who resigned over the libor scandal
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:03.920]  so these are the kind of guys i mean you want to talk about this being uh pure lobbying
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:08.840]  pure exchange of political favors done in total secrecy and yet they have the audacity
[03:17:08.840 --> 03:17:14.280]  to call themselves to say that they're about public education oh yeah this is an insider's
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:22.240]  who who who's who of elitist corruption watson the thing that you know sticks out to me is
[03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:27.680]  they say they're concerned about all these these issues cyber warfare when they're behind
[03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:32.480]  the cyber attacks stucks net flame it's admitted even the new york times admits it that the
[03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:36.520]  u.s and israel were behind those attacks problem reactions illusion yeah but build a bug's
[03:17:36.520 --> 03:17:44.000]  concerned about it they're the ones behind it africa's situation back in 2011 san maritz
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:47.680]  it was right before they turfed out godaffy we got word that they were going to go ahead
[03:17:47.680 --> 03:17:52.480]  with the the final assault on tripoli three months later it happened down to a t when
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:57.520]  we predicted it and look at libya now it's a total destabilization program state department
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:02.360]  memorandum 200 is how to destabilize africa and other countries but africa is the model
[03:18:02.360 --> 03:18:07.240]  how to cut off food fund rebels follow-up governments and they're doing that to america
[03:18:07.240 --> 03:18:14.160]  and the eu and britain the whole you the whole european union is just a system to take over
[03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:19.960]  and destroy the united kingdom and other systems it's economic warfare they're on record with
[03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:26.700]  kissinger the illegal we do it right now immediately the unconstitutional later watson precisely
[03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:31.080]  i mean yeah look at libya immediately after they turfed out godaffy now it's a complete
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:35.360]  hellhole so they're concerned about all these issues when they're the culprits behind them
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:40.840]  jeffrey dahmer is concerned about dead bodies in his freezer well precisely some of the
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:46.600]  other trends are u.s foreign policy again cyber warfare they're behind the cyber attacks
[03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:51.680]  online education that's the ministry of truth for the internet we should talk propaganda

[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:26.600]  mcgreen and the rest of the amazing crew i want to say this about stonehenge i figured
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:31.800]  that it was no big deal because i've been to central america southern north america
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:37.880]  i've seen big pyramids i've seen latin american standing stones mezzo-american so we said
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:44.640]  hey it's an hour south west of london uh b line right where we are northwest let's drive
[03:24:44.640 --> 03:24:49.160]  down there and i see it on the side of the highway it kind of made it like modern but
[03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:54.660]  the highway is like 50 yards away from it i'm like oh that's nothing and so we get out
[03:24:54.660 --> 03:24:58.600]  we park i'm not saying i can't wait to see this we're talking about yeah let's work on
[03:24:58.600 --> 03:25:02.720]  that store we got to meet with these sources tonight yeah we're walking up the path another
[03:25:02.720 --> 03:25:08.280]  stonehenge and when i walk across this line it's like i was like whoa i was like do you
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:13.920]  guys feel that so it's not like i was expecting something and they're like whoa i feel when
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:18.280]  they were describing it and then we went back and came back across it again and it's like
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:24.160]  it's like a line it's like whoa you go through it it kind of feels like freaking you out
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:28.960]  like a roller coaster like macadu said earlier and then it's like drawing you into it and
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:33.280]  the ancients thought enough of this site with all these hills around it but it's up above
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:38.460]  them it's very magic that they built this there and hauled hundreds of miles giant stones
[03:25:38.460 --> 03:25:46.360]  to build this and it shows how man humankind was imagining something bigger the human potential
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:51.480]  to build spacecraft and computers and helicopters and all of this would show the creativity
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:56.400]  of humans that they would pick up on this magnetic line just with the energy of the
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:02.980]  earth that fish use to navigate and birds use to navigate and whales use this is a special
[03:26:02.980 --> 03:26:08.680]  place because there's hundreds of standing stones just in the uk alone ireland scotland
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:15.320]  england wales but they're all over the world and people talk about these david eich talks
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:20.080]  about being in peru and some standing stones and that he all the stuff was like downloaded
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:24.440]  to him he was like a major bbc presenter making a million pounds a year and he went off on
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:30.400]  this thing the point is is that this was mystical there's no doubt and i i gotta tell you i'm
[03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:35.840]  going back while i'm here i mean amazing and they'll let you touch it you gotta like sign
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:39.840]  up a month ahead like 30 people in the morning and at night can go right when it opens and
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:44.580]  closes and see it macadu uh at first i was calling i said do you guys feel something
[03:26:44.580 --> 03:26:50.120]  and you were all the same tell people briefly your take on this um absolutely i agree with
[03:26:50.120 --> 03:26:54.680]  you it was magnetic it's uh when i first when we were pulling up i was like oh gosh it's
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:58.920]  going to be super touristy and it was really awkward looking because there's these ancient
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:04.120]  stones on a perfectly manicured lawn like right next to the highway so it was just sort
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:10.480]  of like this cheesy sort of setup yeah we were like oh this is yeah walking up on i
[03:27:10.480 --> 03:27:13.900]  was like hit by a thunderbolt right and then you just walk up and it literally you walk
[03:27:13.900 --> 03:27:18.920]  across this line and it's for me it felt like my stomach just sort of dipped like a roller
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:24.280]  coaster it was like and then once you kind of cross that threshold it was just this really
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:30.720]  strong force that just pulled pulled you toward it it was amazing it was amazing yeah no no
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:35.320]  watson said how do you feel and i said i feel pulled towards or against and the tour guide
[03:27:35.320 --> 03:27:38.160]  he was like a professor that goes out there volunteers once a week that's who they have
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:43.360]  each day is a different professor he's a he was a professor of uh of celtic uh culture
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:48.200]  or i guess celtic culture and he said uh he said i don't have the gift he goes he goes
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:52.320]  actually i'm surprised three of your four group have it not many people have it he goes
[03:27:52.320 --> 03:27:55.860]  it's some kind of magnetic thing he goes people he goes i sit here she was waiting at that
[03:27:55.860 --> 03:27:59.680]  point he goes that's why i sit here is to see who hits it because nobody tells you there's
[03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:04.000]  no marker because you're walking you already buy it you walk by a point you go wah watson
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:11.240]  what was it like for you well it's in people have come up to me today and said the same
[03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:15.800]  thing when you hit this point you get affected by this energy and he was a science guy he
[03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:19.960]  was saying i'm a physics phd i don't believe in religious i don't believe in any of this
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:24.600]  stuff but you know you're the third person today to say exactly the same thing when you
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:29.720]  hit this point boom the energy hits you and i expected it to be a somber and oppressive
[03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:34.700]  kind of environment because of the druidic nature of it but it was quite energetic and
[03:28:34.700 --> 03:28:39.160]  uplifting actually i found it and i felt i felt crazy yeah i felt the same i felt the
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:43.760]  power the same way you did so i enjoyed it i didn't expect to think much of it were you
[03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:50.000]  seething with power literally it's running through my veins right now yeah i got to be
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:53.800]  honest i'm pretty crazed right i'm already folks let me tell you i like stonehenge a
[03:28:53.800 --> 03:29:01.520]  lot i'm gonna haha anyways maga do any other points you were like they must let me touch
[03:29:01.520 --> 03:29:08.640]  it i need the power i'll tell them all this now now we get it anyways but your wife didn't
[03:29:08.640 --> 03:29:11.760]  like it because she felt like she was being watched right david knight i think she was
[03:29:11.760 --> 03:29:15.880]  just kind of i think she felt something different you know it was different i've never felt
[03:29:15.880 --> 03:29:20.520]  anything like this she didn't say that she got any kind of a good feeling out of it she
[03:29:20.520 --> 03:29:23.640]  didn't describe anything like you're talking about she was just kind of freaked out about
[03:29:23.640 --> 03:29:29.720]  it i think just kind of feeling the the ancient druid sacrifice aspect of it i think that's
[03:29:29.720 --> 03:29:33.980]  kind of what freaked her out well that's what they did though that was their their answer
[03:29:33.980 --> 03:29:39.640]  to all right i just got like electrified by it i well listen more bilderberg coverage
