[00:00.000 --> 00:26.720]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[00:26.720 --> 00:32.880]  and this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.240]  CNN and other MSM outlets shearing on the rape in fact it's been found that
[00:39.240 --> 00:45.080]  these systems actually direct the monstrous seal Zuckerberg against the
[00:45.080 --> 00:49.920]  free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit but most sad of all
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.880]  is other penguins in the independent media simply looking up into the sky and
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.480]  ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place
[00:59.480 --> 01:02.680]  right in front of them
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.360]  we are in a complete war and you idiots don't join with the Republic you fools
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.600]  I want them shut down I want them silence I want them muted I think they are
[01:13.600 --> 01:19.600]  horrible for our society yes now Facebook is gonna be banning Alex Jones and
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.000]  info wars for not only their main platform Facebook but also from
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.280]  Instagram
[01:39.160 --> 01:44.000]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions he's prescribing which
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.240]  political opinions you're allowed to have I want them shut down we're losing
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.080]  the thread of the concepts that are important to this country I don't like
[01:53.080 --> 01:58.240]  Alex Jones but Alex Jones gets to speak everybody gets to speak
[01:58.240 --> 02:00.240]  I'm a bad person, I have question bags, I'm evil
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.240]  How dangerous is info wars?
[02:09.240 --> 02:17.520]  I am told this is a garbage disposal I've never seen a garbage disposal I never
[02:17.520 --> 02:24.680]  had one in any place I've ever lived it is terrifying I don't know what to use it
[02:24.680 --> 02:32.800]  for or what its purpose is like food scraps like is this environmentally
[02:32.800 --> 02:48.800]  sound I don't know
[03:02.800 --> 03:28.720]  info wars tomorrow's news today well that's right it's now all over the news
[03:28.720 --> 03:37.000]  that there was a secret FISA ruling put out in the middle of 2017 that the
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.520]  inspector general of the federal courts released saying that they were given
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.160]  false information and lied to in three cases now they knew this because the
[03:47.160 --> 03:54.160]  head of the national security agency went and warned Trump right after he got
[03:54.160 --> 03:57.960]  into office that the treason had been carried out and that he was unaware of
[03:57.960 --> 04:07.440]  it we broke that information it was not put in the federal register for several
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.720]  months and then it was decided kind of like Trump sometimes just declassifies
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.160]  things out into the open but doesn't announce it but we were given the
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.000]  exclusive on that and again I'm not here at the start of this broadcast bragging
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.080]  I'm explaining to you why they want us destroyed because that was released that
[04:30.080 --> 04:37.160]  was declassified and then no one else I guess would run with it because we got
[04:37.160 --> 04:43.240]  the phone call from the former deputy head of the NSA that the actual technical
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.400]  head of it so when we come back I'm gonna give you a ton of next year's news

[07:17.680 --> 07:23.020]  media equals tyranny and then they came for me here it is
[07:23.020 --> 07:26.920]  Eisenhower said beware the military industrial complex and I would say that
[07:26.920 --> 07:31.400]  that needs to be updated to be aware of what I call Tim technology intelligence
[07:31.400 --> 07:53.920]  and media that's pretty powerful for radio but for TV it's a must-see we've
[07:53.920 --> 08:00.120]  posted the video up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com we're gonna

[08:38.400 --> 08:45.000]  everyone that's pro america everyone that stands against collectivism the
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.280]  big major corporations everyone who believes in free speech is either being
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.320]  shadow band or outright fan everywhere and now they've announced they're coming

[09:01.640 --> 09:05.320]  gonna put up with big corporations using this big digital system where they
[09:05.320 --> 09:10.680]  steal our data and oppress us and spy on us and Alexa listens to us in our house
[09:10.680 --> 09:16.000]  and portal watches and listens to us yeah Google's assessed it's all in the
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.840]  news that they're using it for data against you and shelling it to other
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.320]  companies and people put up with that so now Facebook's not just gonna watch you
[09:25.320 --> 09:31.160]  in your house they're gonna tell you whose name you can say or whose website
[09:31.160 --> 09:36.760]  you can say and and just a reminder is mark nice tweeted mark zuckerberg says
[09:36.760 --> 09:41.240]  you will not make any positive comments about Alex Jones or you will be banned
[09:41.240 --> 09:47.720]  that's in their official statement again beyond 1984 we've got a ton of news
[09:47.720 --> 09:54.120]  today that ties into all the censorship more but the big issue that I just
[09:54.120 --> 09:57.520]  realized last few days we've not been beating the drum hard enough on we we
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.480]  have in the past I have gone and looked at the what is it 22 Democrats running
[10:02.480 --> 10:10.520]  right now and I just randomly last night went through more than 10 of them and
[10:10.520 --> 10:16.720]  all of them say banned semi-autos and confiscate them and Cory Booker says if
[10:16.720 --> 10:21.040]  you don't turn your guns in we're gonna come to your house and kill you with a
[10:21.040 --> 10:25.360]  SWAT team this is where these maniacs are going total civil war and you look at
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.360]  their looks on their faces and the power trips they're on this is a clear and
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.760]  present danger that stories of Steve Watson article on info wars.com and
[10:35.760 --> 10:40.280]  news wars.com ring the alarm raise the alarm get that article out but I've
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.320]  asked some of the writers put together a compendium of quotes and statements
[10:45.320 --> 10:52.600]  because it's official the Democratic Party's official policy is repeal the
[10:52.600 --> 10:56.400]  second amendment and forcibly confiscate and I'm gonna read you the New York
[10:56.400 --> 10:59.200]  Times the Washington Post and play some of the quotes right now but we could
[10:59.200 --> 11:02.720]  spend a whole hour on this they're really coming after the guns they're
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.640]  really coming with forced inoculations they're really saying heterosexuality
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.200]  is bad they're really saying the family is bad they're really already killing
[11:10.200 --> 11:17.280]  babies after they're born in five states now after they're born I mean it
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.320]  what comes next the bottom has fallen out in dim control areas and anywhere
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.320]  else socialist control things it's a nightmare because their looters their
[11:27.320 --> 11:34.720]  pirates their operating system is El Diablo the serpent the snake the devil
[11:34.720 --> 11:44.480]  Satan the morning star bat the mat the Elsie Bob you know Molek the bad guy
[11:44.480 --> 11:52.000]  old scratch the devil people say why do they want other way to do it they're
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.560]  evil they're a crew of evil you look at Booker or Harris or Hillary or they all
[11:59.560 --> 12:03.920]  look like psychopathic killers if you walked into a store and they came over
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.480]  to help you you get the shivers and whoa I mean these are scary people their
[12:08.480 --> 12:24.280]  eyes glow with evil because there's nobody home folks their avatars look out
[12:24.280 --> 12:29.920]  look out here is a very important piece up I don't normally play something four
[12:29.920 --> 12:34.160]  or five times a day but this is a compilation just of a few of the people
[12:34.160 --> 12:38.440]  on mainstream news saying ban everybody with the most authoritarian relish
[12:38.440 --> 12:43.440]  you've ever seen why are they doing this now well it's a good question as to why
[12:43.440 --> 12:49.400]  they waited this long but yeah exactly yeah I mean they so Alice's out Jones
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.440]  has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time but now they banned him
[12:53.440 --> 12:57.160]  they banned his like little underling Paul Joseph Watson now that they keep
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.200]  them off the platform that's great for now but it doesn't roll back the clock
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.800]  but you have also excesses in the first amendment and the second amendment right
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.440]  now you know I don't think that the four of the forefathers said well you can
[13:08.440 --> 13:11.760]  say yeah you know all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world
[13:11.760 --> 13:16.120]  literally spread it through the internet I have no issue with it at all I want
[13:16.120 --> 13:19.680]  them shut down I want them silence I want them muted I think they are horrible
[13:19.680 --> 13:28.440]  for our society I want them shut down I want them muted I want them completely
[13:28.440 --> 13:38.000]  silenced that's not creepy at all is it Mr. Tucker Carlson famously said that's
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.520]  what's going on here that's the plan that's the program flaming naked
[13:45.520 --> 13:51.200]  authoritarianism coming for you and they believe you're weak they look at you and
[13:51.200 --> 13:56.880]  they think you're a pushover they think they can completely dominate you now
[13:56.880 --> 14:01.400]  we're gonna go to break and come back with the plan to take your guns and you
[14:01.400 --> 14:07.920]  think Trump's gonna protect you we're two years out from him being gone if he
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.640]  doesn't wake up and defend the first amendment and I think right now Trump's
[14:12.640 --> 14:15.800]  gonna be removed from office they're gonna engage in election fraud they're
[14:15.800 --> 14:18.640]  gonna remove him he's even said that he said they can only win by cheating and
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.960]  they're going to cheat these are criminals they've already been caught
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.840]  cheating and and and then they're gonna go to full civil war you think well
[14:24.840 --> 14:29.240]  that's crazy yeah they're crazy so if you care about your family your future and
[14:29.240 --> 14:33.960]  I know you do we're in a red-level emergency now we're going to break but
[14:33.960 --> 14:38.760]  one reason we've had trouble funding ourselves the last five months is our
[14:38.760 --> 14:45.520]  third biggest seller is secret 12 high-quality vitamin B12 methylcobalamin
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.360]  and people love it it goes over the tongue energy stamina focus your whole
[14:49.360 --> 14:52.560]  body it's a building block everything it's just as important as clean iodine and
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.600]  it's just been really hard to get we've had really problems sourcing it but we
[14:56.600 --> 15:02.200]  were able to and we were able to with a new contract and a new company to have
[15:02.200 --> 15:06.800]  the high-quality organic methylcobalamin highest quality out there and to
[15:06.800 --> 15:13.080]  double the strength of it so I'm changing the name of secret 12 from
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.720]  secret 12 to ultra 12 now I know how people are they always love the
[15:18.720 --> 15:25.040]  original name hey guess what fun little gimmick when you peel off the label of
[15:25.040 --> 15:31.720]  ultra 12 under it it's a secret 12 plus treat us they'd already labeled a secret
[15:31.720 --> 15:34.920]  12 plus and we thought people don't even know what it means when we say plus that
[15:34.920 --> 15:40.080]  means more call it ultra 12 and so I put the new label on it so it becomes kind
[15:40.080 --> 15:44.480]  of a gimmick we didn't intend but it'll be called over 12 after that and it's

[18:14.400 --> 18:20.880]  comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[18:20.880 --> 18:24.800]  people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and
[18:24.800 --> 18:28.880]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[18:28.880 --> 18:33.600]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting

[19:55.240 --> 19:59.080]  eight two five three three one three nine
[20:02.920 --> 20:08.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:08.240 --> 20:34.000]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind and there's a war out
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.120]  there to keep me from expressing what you have to say in the new telecommunication
[20:38.120 --> 20:43.840]  digital town square of the world in the future everything's digital apps digital
[20:43.840 --> 20:48.400]  systems Facebook Google is buying up almost every company and now they're
[20:48.400 --> 20:55.760]  saying if you don't tell the line with us we're gonna turn your app off and not
[20:55.760 --> 21:01.520]  let you call people and CNN's licking their lips like something out of a
[21:01.520 --> 21:08.360]  nightmare dystopia novel but it's really here because we've acquiesced to
[21:08.360 --> 21:12.680]  their criminal racketeering and so they're getting you all ready for the
[21:12.680 --> 21:17.000]  civil war they have planned they already had planned once Hillary was in
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.960]  office it was gonna be women against men minorities against whites so they
[21:20.960 --> 21:24.840]  still followed that whole divide and conquer playbook and strategy and that
[21:24.840 --> 21:29.120]  leg of the globalist program they admitted all and WikiLeaks and public
[21:29.120 --> 21:32.240]  statements you can see almost every Hollywood movie TV shows everywhere
[21:32.240 --> 21:36.320]  white people are the devil on and on and on men are bad women are in charge of
[21:36.320 --> 21:41.000]  everything it's it's it's just an attack on the human community period nobody's
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.280]  a winner here we're all being targeted only the globalists think their winners
[21:44.280 --> 21:48.240]  ruling over us but they themselves lose their humanity in the process but see
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.120]  they project their own hatred of themselves on us and say oh humanity's
[21:52.120 --> 21:57.920]  obsolete we're gonna merge with the AI gods that's the mainline religion of the
[21:57.920 --> 22:01.680]  crazy tech owners and I guess when the average tech owners worth like 50
[22:01.680 --> 22:05.800]  billion dollars there's about a dozen of them they got a bunch of underlings
[22:05.800 --> 22:09.440]  worth a billion or so a couple thousand of them they're all taking a bunch of
[22:09.440 --> 22:14.040]  hallucinogenic drugs and everything else they really believe they're God and so
[22:14.040 --> 22:19.280]  of course we can tell 2.2 billion users at Facebook jokes you use that name of
[22:19.280 --> 22:26.160]  Voldemort Jones don't you say his name people say yes sir boss how how do I
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.400]  jump and of course they're always gonna move in the old goalpost but what's
[22:31.400 --> 22:36.240]  coming next when Trump loses in 2020 because they steal the election and
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.160]  because he they've cut the legs out from under him and the grassroots is
[22:39.160 --> 22:43.320]  unable to communicate with others and magnify the message what's gonna happen
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.960]  they're gonna plunge the nation into physical civil war and in blue state
[22:47.960 --> 22:51.600]  areas first they're going to start gun confiscation which is already begun with
[22:51.600 --> 22:56.240]  this red flag rule and here's Cory Booker saying oh yeah when we say they're
[22:56.240 --> 22:59.100]  illegal you better turn them into you're going to jail well that means the
[22:59.100 --> 23:04.600]  SWAT teams are coming I hear the train are coming it's rolling round the bend
[23:04.600 --> 23:10.040]  and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in police
[23:10.040 --> 23:16.400]  state America and time keeps dragging on and they just keep coming to get my
[23:16.400 --> 23:21.560]  guns and they just keep coming to get my kids and they just keep coming
[23:21.560 --> 23:26.960]  with all their GMO they just keep coming to kill the newborn babies because
[23:26.960 --> 23:33.480]  they're so liberal they're so loving oh they're so good let's go ahead and hear
[23:33.480 --> 23:41.000]  from Cory crazy eyes booker and I have a record on dealing with gun violence we
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.880]  did a lot of gun buybacks and even other creative ideas that I think we
[23:45.880 --> 23:51.120]  should have when I'm pretty creative ideas that's how they banned guns over
[23:51.120 --> 23:55.920]  a hundred countries is first they have buybacks that you used to that turning
[23:55.920 --> 23:59.760]  guns in in the news for all the sheeple to see if people wind up turning guns in
[23:59.760 --> 24:05.040]  like that's something you do you know they're bad they're evil and and then
[24:05.040 --> 24:10.320]  they register them and then they confiscate them buybacks registration
[24:10.320 --> 24:14.840]  forced confiscation and those usually aren't even buybacks and they swat team
[24:14.840 --> 24:18.120]  a few people at the real crocodile Dundee and kill them at their house to scare
[24:18.120 --> 24:22.720]  everybody else into it so just everything he says is a lie original
[24:22.720 --> 24:27.480]  ideas is everything he says is a lie I'm Cory Booker I'm a real innovator I'm
[24:27.480 --> 24:31.200]  not a total puppet carrying out a global program under the UN small arms
[24:31.200 --> 24:35.720]  treaty that Trump's about to pull out of I'm not following a UNESCO script I'm
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.440]  original I just came up with this here let's hear it and I have a record on
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.080]  dealing with gun violence we did a lot of gun buybacks and even other creative
[24:45.080 --> 24:50.520]  ideas I'm sorry dealing with gun violence all the blue cities have the
[24:50.520 --> 24:53.600]  highest crime rates because that's you people run them with the narcotics and
[24:53.600 --> 24:56.920]  all the prostitutes and it's allowed to operate the Democratic Party does the
[24:56.920 --> 24:59.560]  child trafficking and the human trafficking it's all on record
[24:59.560 --> 25:05.520]  senatorial reports so you're not dealing gun violence you're disarming the
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.360]  general public's only criminal have them so that you can have criminal rule over
[25:09.360 --> 25:12.480]  the streets because you're like the penguin are the Joker but in the real
[25:12.480 --> 25:24.560]  world yeah that's right let's go back to him when I'm president United States the
[25:24.560 --> 25:30.640]  critical thing is I think most Americans agree that these weapons of war should
[25:30.640 --> 25:34.560]  not be on our streets again would you would you prosecute people do you
[25:34.560 --> 25:37.680]  support the government buying them back and if not potentially people could go
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.520]  to jail if they don't want to sell them back yes or no again we should have a
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.920]  law that bans these weapons and we should have a reasonable period in which
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.560]  people can turn in these weapons right now we have a nation that allows in
[25:51.560 --> 25:55.200]  streets and communities like mine these weapons that should not exist
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.840]  weapons that should not exist except in your bodyguards and your SWAT teams in
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.080]  your system so just everything he says is a distortion or a line so here's the
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.000]  New York Times you know at least they're being honest I've got a bunch of four
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.560]  minute three-minute clips of just Democrats saying we're gonna confiscate
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.040]  your guns we're gonna take them Mr. and Mrs. America get ready to turn them in
[26:14.040 --> 26:19.840]  but the past in the past they would lie about it say oh that's not really our
[26:19.840 --> 26:25.800]  plan now here's the New York Times John Paul Stevens repeal the Second
[26:25.800 --> 26:30.840]  Amendment that's a Supreme Court justice repeal it repeal the Second
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.280]  Amendment another New York Times article repeal the second it's all over the
[26:37.280 --> 26:44.080]  news ladies and gentlemen so this is the corrupt elite that that they control
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.600]  the crapple areas once great cities still have some great areas but are
[26:50.600 --> 26:56.120]  being fed on my Democrats New York Chicago San Francisco Los Angeles they
[26:56.120 --> 27:01.400]  confiscate the guns they ban most of guns DC all hell breaks loose they have
[27:01.400 --> 27:04.880]  the highest crime rates just criminals don't follow the rules but like a third
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.680]  world nation all the Democrats had their own armed guards that follow them
[27:08.680 --> 27:11.280]  around and they drive around armored vehicles and they live in gated
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.680]  communities but you don't you the average person just get fed on so the
[27:15.680 --> 27:19.160]  criminals can break in your house and steal your jewelry and still your
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.280]  computer thing go to a pawn shop and sell it to buy drugs the Democrats most
[27:24.280 --> 27:30.800]  Democrats at high level are narcotics traffickers most Democrats actually run
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.120]  smuggling operations even child kidnapping rings and it's all come out in
[27:35.120 --> 27:42.080]  the news Obama smuggled tens of thousands of small children in the US that
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.120]  disappeared and were used for sex slavery Washington Post even reported that
[27:46.120 --> 27:52.600]  Senate report where the kids go it's a perfect way Hillary got busted UN report
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.200]  the UN report on itself AP reported tens of thousands of missing kids hundreds
[27:57.200 --> 28:04.520]  of dead in Haiti her own top people caught smuggling kids in look into it so
[28:04.520 --> 28:08.960]  that's the reality here the truth is crime rate has been dropping with guns
[28:08.960 --> 28:19.640]  since 1992 and it went down 59% on some numbers 61% of you look at professor
[28:19.640 --> 28:25.120]  lots numbers so went down 60% or so and then it went back up about 10 points in
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.480]  the last four years five years there's been some crime going on back up well
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.760]  there it is so so so some crimes gone back up a true but nothing like it was
[28:32.760 --> 28:41.520]  and that's the truth 61% and now it's back to about 50% less than it was but
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.000]  the media creates the perception that it's going on everywhere but they don't
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.800]  report a little kidnap Mexican kids getting gang-raped by Democrats and
[28:50.800 --> 28:54.480]  sex parties oh yeah that's why they're pissed I'll talk about their favorite
[28:54.480 --> 28:58.160]  thing these are devil worshipers they kill already-born babies and they want
[28:58.160 --> 29:02.440]  to kill you everyone knows even good people fall on hard times your credit

[34:45.640 --> 34:52.720]  take everybody else down but we've been chosen for a virtual annihilation because
[34:52.720 --> 35:00.360]  we are rebooting a very pure form of Western Americana Renaissance system a
[35:00.360 --> 35:06.520]  wavelength an energy force a spirit that will counter and defeat the globalist
[35:06.520 --> 35:13.440]  cold-blooded system our hot-blooded fire breathing system is unstoppable if
[35:13.440 --> 35:18.480]  people pick up the spirit but if they don't pick up the spirit that comes from
[35:18.480 --> 35:24.760]  God they will be slaves now here's the goodness of the bad news rumors swirl
[35:24.760 --> 35:32.960]  about huge layoffs at CNN that Brian Stelter denies well if Brian Stelter
[35:32.960 --> 35:40.640]  tells you something he lies even when the truth would serve him well or better
[35:40.640 --> 35:48.960]  but here's the deal CNN and all the rest of the corporate whore media are
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.840]  shadows of their former selves and now still shadows of that's all break down
[35:52.840 --> 36:02.680]  the numbers on that it's a good thing to get into very very important also there's
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.440]  a big league politics article out that's important Facebook notified mainstream
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.600]  media ahead of info wars ban showing I was a giant PR rollout also the famous
[36:11.600 --> 36:17.760]  shame were white supremacist you know if you go anywhere on the internet anywhere
[36:17.760 --> 36:25.800]  on the internet show this article to Kim if you go anywhere on the internet
[36:25.800 --> 36:36.120]  YouTube Facebook Twitter anything to do with info wars anything anything a third
[36:36.120 --> 36:42.040]  of the comments many of them left to spam are that Alex Jones is a Zionist
[36:42.040 --> 36:49.280]  shill who supports the censorship of people that are against Israel now I'm
[36:49.280 --> 36:51.880]  not here to talk about my shelf to defend my shelf I'm here trying to reach
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.640]  out to people that aren't bots and who aren't mentally ill I don't support
[36:56.640 --> 37:02.920]  censorship against anybody and I stood up against censorship of people that
[37:02.920 --> 37:12.280]  don't like Israel like David Duke and Minister Farrakhan and I'm on record so
[37:12.280 --> 37:22.000]  that's not true so see that's mental illness that's a b I don't hardly think
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.600]  about Israel except when I'm constantly like the little one-trick pony see
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.640]  people say this you know how big a headache that gives me when I study
[37:32.640 --> 37:38.280]  real geopolitical forces and the chai comms in the EU and Latin America
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.760]  collapsing and the mega banks in Hollywood and of course Israel's got a
[37:41.760 --> 37:44.760]  big part of that and of course there's a lot of leftist Jews that are involved
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.640]  with it you know some of the big leftist groups trying to in free speech and all
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.360]  that and I'm just at war with corruption whether it's chai comms or
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.640]  whether it's leftist Jews or whether it's leftist Germans adults or leftist
[37:55.640 --> 38:01.080]  Russians there are leftist globalists around the world who all support the
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.200]  same ideologies radical Islam's in league with it and then there are
[38:04.200 --> 38:08.880]  nationalist and capitalist and free marketers and pro-christians and pro
[38:08.880 --> 38:14.920]  Renaissance and that's who I am so see the proof is in the pudding of what I
[38:14.920 --> 38:19.440]  do and I don't respond to all the anti-Semites and people because they hurt
[38:19.440 --> 38:28.720]  me I respond to you because it's not logical to say that I support censorship
[38:28.720 --> 38:36.360]  when I don't and it's not logical you know without evidence and it's not
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.840]  logical to say that I work for Israel when I don't but then the reason I
[38:41.840 --> 38:50.680]  raised this today is thousands of articles with the headlines thousands
[38:50.680 --> 38:58.560]  all over the world Alex Jones removed with other anti-Semites from face
[38:58.560 --> 39:04.640]  book and they say David Duke was removed he wasn't removed off YouTube or all
[39:04.640 --> 39:12.080]  those places and that's a point I've made I've said why is David Duke and all
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.040]  these people able to operate on YouTube and I say they should be able to but
[39:16.040 --> 39:21.960]  then I'm not able to and then I have the white supremacist literally obsessed
[39:21.960 --> 39:27.600]  with me and hating me and then I've got the left always saying I'm a white
[39:27.600 --> 39:36.360]  supremacist it's just mental illness it's not real but you see people that
[39:36.360 --> 39:40.280]  aren't really intellectual or informed if they just if you're on the left you
[39:40.280 --> 39:47.920]  call somebody a Nazi and if you're on the whatever
[39:47.920 --> 39:56.600]  Islam slash weird left-wing right-wing Jews run everything tangent it's just
[39:56.600 --> 40:03.280]  easy to have a unified field theory that everything is is is Jews you know if
[40:03.280 --> 40:06.680]  you really want to get down to brass tacks it's a lot of the groups trying
[40:06.680 --> 40:13.640]  to take us down are captained by leftist Jews and man they call me a Nazi and
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.480]  they're coming after me they don't come after you they don't take you off the
[40:17.480 --> 40:20.720]  internet they take me off because you know what the Democratic Party is
[40:20.720 --> 40:24.280]  teaching racial division for control and power they admit it in the WikiLeaks
[40:24.280 --> 40:28.680]  and their own statements and I'm trying to create unity I'm trying to bring
[40:28.680 --> 40:31.840]  people together no matter what color they are or they came from around free
[40:31.840 --> 40:37.160]  market and good ideas and real open society you notice George Soros calls
[40:37.160 --> 40:40.400]  his group the open society foundation because it's the opposite he wants
[40:40.400 --> 40:44.080]  closed controlled societies with authoritarianism where they control
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.440]  speech and man I've got him and all these other groups coming after me
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.560]  financing lawsuits against me breathing down my neck and yeah George Soros is a
[40:53.560 --> 41:00.960]  Jew and he's a Jew that collaborated for Hitler so see how that works doesn't
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.280]  make any sense to just pull back and say Jews are all bad or to say the
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.360]  Catholics are all bad or to say the Masons are all bad or to say that's
[41:10.360 --> 41:18.240]  mental illness that's stupid that's dumb and you know three years ago I went
[41:18.240 --> 41:26.160]  and met with Lewis Farrakhan nation of Islam reached out we reached out to
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.840]  them years before and I actually put out a two hour real interview with Farrakhan
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.560]  we heard actually what he actually said and normally he could say anything and
[41:35.560 --> 41:39.240]  the media pick it up everywhere and it'd get 10 million views it was totally
[41:39.240 --> 41:43.080]  shadow banned on YouTube instantly they were monetizing everything I was doing
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.440]  but not that interview because Farrakhan was trying to say I've said some
[41:47.440 --> 41:51.040]  things were probably taken out of context I didn't mean years ago I realized
[41:51.040 --> 41:54.080]  the globalists want to race for now and there's still a lot of racism on both
[41:54.080 --> 41:57.640]  sides but Islam needs a reformation and so do other groups and we need to come
[41:57.640 --> 42:00.640]  together because he he said I really think Trump's probably good but I don't
[42:00.640 --> 42:04.800]  know how to get my constituents to understand it and he's tried that where
[42:04.800 --> 42:11.120]  he said isn't it funny Trump's getting rid of all our enemies which is true so
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.200]  see I actually went and met with Farrakhan I'm gonna probably meet with
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.200]  him again soon because he invited me to meet with him again but I was in the
[42:17.200 --> 42:20.040]  middle of a divorce and had all this crazy stuff and I couldn't even leave
[42:20.040 --> 42:23.080]  town when when he wanted to meet at a trial coming up for the custody of my
[42:23.080 --> 42:29.320]  kids I couldn't come in so I reached out I want to speak to him again but think
[42:29.320 --> 42:34.000]  about that now when I tried to have David Duke on to try to get him to go hey
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.560]  eugenics is hurting everybody hey abortions hurting everybody hey everybody's
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.840]  being targeted by this he just wanted to talking points and score points on me
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.800]  and I wasn't trying to score points man oh David Duke kicked your ass in that
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.480]  debate I wasn't trying to debate David Duke I was trying to talk about other
[42:50.480 --> 42:57.320]  issues other than what color somebody is that's it so the interview went nowhere
[42:57.320 --> 43:02.160]  we'll be right back stay with us living in volcano may sound more dramatic than
[43:02.160 --> 43:07.240]  it really is the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us
[43:07.240 --> 43:11.400]  on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
[43:11.400 --> 43:17.340]  acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could
[43:17.340 --> 43:22.200]  lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employ the series
[43:22.200 --> 43:28.120]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
[43:28.120 --> 43:33.040]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.320]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[43:37.320 --> 43:42.560]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[43:42.560 --> 43:48.120]  levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.800]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.720]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[43:57.720 --> 44:03.280]  purify it I want to say brain force is great I want to say turbo force is
[44:03.280 --> 44:08.720]  amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it
[44:08.720 --> 44:12.040]  the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.640]  about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out
[44:17.640 --> 44:21.240]  there you've got the children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil
[44:21.240 --> 44:24.520]  if you're gonna get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really
[44:24.520 --> 44:27.960]  strong they don't give you the burpees but krill oil is the best and it'll give
[44:27.960 --> 44:31.000]  you the damn burps and I'm sorry you want something like this you don't get
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.840]  stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view I'm
[44:34.840 --> 44:37.600]  not a medical statement here but let me tell you something I eat five
[44:37.600 --> 44:43.320]  cabinets of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so
[44:43.320 --> 44:51.840]  your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.000]  profit off of it but you notice I just obsessed cuz whatever the best is we've
[44:55.000 --> 45:02.280]  got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it it's time to show them what a real

[47:31.120 --> 47:38.680]  from the front lines of the information war I'm Alex Jones I'm your host well if
[47:38.680 --> 47:44.820]  you were wondering when you turn on the radio or watching on television how Joe
[47:44.820 --> 47:49.200]  Biden would come back from the hundreds of videos of him bizarrely groping
[47:49.200 --> 47:54.520]  children and hundreds of videos of him bizarrely groping women grabbing women
[47:54.520 --> 47:57.680]  in restaurants pulling them down his lap running his hands through their hair
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.240]  sniffing their ear sniffing their hair I mean does this guy run a swingers club
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.040]  or something and then the grabbing the kids and rubbing their necks and whisper
[48:08.040 --> 48:12.240]  it in their ears and rubbing his torso into them hundreds of people have gone
[48:12.240 --> 48:18.920]  public so creepy Joe how's he gonna come back from that well he's got away now
[48:18.920 --> 48:24.640]  that he says he's able to come back from it we're gonna tell you about that
[48:24.640 --> 48:29.720]  here in just a moment and I'm gonna put the phones up after that in the next two
[48:29.720 --> 48:36.240]  hours ahead of Paul Joseph Watson joining us but before I get to that the
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.400]  cavalry is here you know the last four months info wars five months has been in
[48:41.400 --> 48:45.800]  the red because of them cutting off our ability to even sponsor and sell our
[48:45.800 --> 48:49.160]  products outside of our radio and TV show so our products are so popular that
[48:49.160 --> 48:52.920]  even so highly rated they show well on the internet on other sites that that's
[48:52.920 --> 48:55.960]  getting blocked and we're having to pay for own bandwidth we're having to do
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.040]  everything our ourselves and build our own infrastructure it's been hard but
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.600]  we did an analysis and we're like yeah we've been sold out of secret 12 which
[49:04.600 --> 49:11.200]  is a super high quality mythical boleman just does incredible things for the
[49:11.200 --> 49:17.120]  body you have to have B12 to live and especially northern Europeans Japanese
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.080]  are similar in that genetic trait and other groups cannot absorb vitamin B12
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.440]  so I went in separately since I was selling a secret 12 the highest rate
[49:26.440 --> 49:31.040]  in the country private label bias they've had buzzfeed to a test and say well
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.400]  there's is pure but this is the best brand and it was who are private labeling
[49:34.400 --> 49:37.840]  well we've now done that again but made it twice as strong I'll tell you about a
[49:37.840 --> 49:45.200]  moment but I went in for my 40 year old checkup five years ago and at this nice
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.840]  clinic with a doctor that's a fan he said do you want to do genetic testing to
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.080]  see what you have proclivity for and I said no no I don't want to do it then
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.720]  about a year ago I did it it was a couple thousand dollars this wasn't just my
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.880]  genetic background I'd already done that years ago and do what it was ought to
[50:01.880 --> 50:05.800]  publish that pretty interesting if you believe in this I'm quite a bit in the
[50:05.800 --> 50:09.520]  end or thought that I'm proud of that they're supposedly psychic but expanding
[50:09.520 --> 50:16.520]  on that I'm there and you know a few months later it comes in so I went in
[50:16.520 --> 50:20.440]  for an hour with the doctor and went over what it all meant later I went and
[50:20.440 --> 50:23.600]  looked it up I didn't just believe him and sure enough because I'm a northern
[50:23.600 --> 50:29.800]  European almost completely other some Native American I cannot absorb I have
[50:29.800 --> 50:35.440]  double genes turned off for B12 and he was like automatically he's like you
[50:35.440 --> 50:43.880]  need prescriptions for methylcobalamin injected twice a week into your stomach
[50:43.880 --> 50:49.840]  fat and incredible what it does if you can get it from a doctor it's the same
[50:49.840 --> 50:53.920]  stuff we have don't inject this it's not labeled for that but basically it comes
[50:53.920 --> 50:57.600]  from the same place the same thing but again those obviously with injection or
[50:57.600 --> 51:01.560]  another type of container so don't inject this it's front of the tongue you
[51:01.560 --> 51:06.720]  get the doctor said depending on your genetics when you inject it something
[51:06.720 --> 51:10.920]  like 50% or more upload in your body it's incredible and by the way that's
[51:10.920 --> 51:15.240]  people get cancer especially northern Europeans you'll be like folks in
[51:15.240 --> 51:17.440]  Minnesota are mainly northern Europeans they were the highest cancer rates in
[51:17.440 --> 51:20.840]  the country different types of cancer because B12 goes out you can't absorb it
[51:20.840 --> 51:27.360]  you're bye-bye and B12 is only really naturally in some things like seal meat
[51:27.360 --> 51:33.000]  or things like mushrooms but still as you get older you go from being able to
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.960]  absorb the doctor told me 3% if you're a northern European to 1% or less what
[51:38.960 --> 51:44.120]  happens under the tongue depending on the study as high as 10% all those blood
[51:44.120 --> 51:49.680]  vessels so you take it you put it under your tongue it's good for children and
[51:49.680 --> 51:53.480]  very important for over 40s and you put it under your tongue for about a minute
[51:53.480 --> 51:57.000]  and the longer you can do it the better because if you just drink it down you
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.760]  don't get that much absorption in your intestines in your stomach and your
[52:01.760 --> 52:05.240]  upper and lower intestine of course your stomach above that so what I'm getting
[52:05.240 --> 52:11.520]  in here is B12 just like clean iodine is essential just like oxygen just like
[52:11.520 --> 52:18.320]  water and so many types you go to the store are synthetic they're not
[52:18.320 --> 52:23.640]  absorbable by the body you take these pills and it doesn't do almost anything
[52:23.640 --> 52:28.640]  if you're African-American you absorb a lot of it if you have your if you're
[52:28.640 --> 52:35.920]  have some of those backgrounds but white people because of we are a mutation red
[52:35.920 --> 52:42.160]  heads are a mutation of the mutation that there's genetic facts and I mean
[52:42.160 --> 52:46.400]  mutations bad just the point is is that it's a mutation of a mutation and so
[52:46.400 --> 52:51.480]  there's little quirks and things like black people can't drink fluoride it's
[52:51.480 --> 52:54.800]  four to five times worse for them it's already super deadly just there's
[52:54.800 --> 52:58.240]  differences humans are humans but we have differences it's like Native
[52:58.240 --> 53:01.040]  Americans are well-known they can't drink or eat a lot of sugar or they get
[53:01.040 --> 53:05.240]  diabetes either anybody else you drive down the street my god half the Mexicans
[53:05.240 --> 53:09.840]  you see sometime I've got their legs cut off it's very sad this is the reality of
[53:09.840 --> 53:13.920]  genetics folks Hispanics can't have a bunch of sugar and white people better
[53:13.920 --> 53:19.840]  get B12 I mean this is this is how the world works and everybody needs basic
[53:19.840 --> 53:25.120]  things like vitamin C basic things like good iodine but I'm digressing so what
[53:25.120 --> 53:31.680]  happened is I said I want to come out with secret 12 plus even stronger
[53:31.680 --> 53:36.040]  because a new formulation came out we can make it even stronger in the same
[53:36.040 --> 53:42.200]  bottle and it didn't cost even that much more and by law you have to call it
[53:42.200 --> 53:45.280]  something else once you change the formula so we called it plus but then we
[53:45.280 --> 53:50.320]  got data in we're starting to finally do marketing data you know we have to use
[53:50.320 --> 53:55.200]  this one by the scene of my pants let me give you the inside baseball here that
[53:55.200 --> 53:59.040]  people for some reason don't get plus means more or better which it really
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.840]  does just be better to call it something completely different so I said all right
[54:02.840 --> 54:07.920]  and I told the graphics folks call it ultra 12 twice as much medical bolliman

[59:57.920 --> 1:00:12.920]  Mark Dice is about to knock it out of the park again that dirty American
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:18.840]  that's right that dirty American Mark Dice has really been thumbing his nose
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:23.320]  on Twitter and YouTube and Facebook defending my free speech knowing
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:28.520]  anybody that does it at his level gets vaporized he's acting like that six foot
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:32.720]  four red-blooded American he is he's standing up against tyrants with the
[1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:37.080]  spirit that actually founded this country what have other people start doing
[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:42.680]  what he's doing over the weekend president Trump retweeted Paul Joseph
[1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:47.560]  Watson twice and defended him after Facebook banned him for being a dangerous
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:51.880]  individual he also retweeted Lauren Southern and a brief video by info wars
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.560]  Millie Weaver showing her interviewing a bunch of black people who love
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:00.120]  president Trump as you can imagine social media's hall monitor Frank Stelter was
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.680]  not very happy about it a big move by Facebook banning several accounts and
[1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:09.320]  now there's no blowback from the commander-in-chief president Trump's
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:14.800]  furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is I'm sorry to say
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:20.840]  the info wars president he is promoting the same alternative universe is
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:25.960]  sharing videos from repugnant characters info wars of course is that
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:30.360]  web show website led by Raja Hallux Alex Jones and back to your point though
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:34.680]  about the info wars presidency I want to know and I tweeted this other day what
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:38.400]  is the difference right this point between Trump's Twitter feed and info
[1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:41.760]  wars dot com you know info wars might have been banned from from Twitter but
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:45.080]  it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed and while he's
[1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:48.440]  promoting and legitimizing this news organization we should also talk about
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:53.160]  how he's trying to tear down incredible sources for news the Washington Post the
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:57.880]  New York Times CNN these news organizations have the ability to be
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:01.760]  on Twitter why are they not banned right while saying that the info war should
[1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:06.080]  be reinstated it's it's it's nuts well CNN is the biggest purveyor of
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.160]  conspiracy theories and hatred in America so if Facebook's gonna be fair
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:15.000]  maybe you should be banned too I did make a mistake in last week's video talking
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.200]  about this latest purge when I said that news reports from CNN and other outlets
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:23.800]  came out a few minutes before they were actually banned it turns out that they
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:28.560]  came out an hour before they were banned once again CNN's Oliver Darcy was
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:33.480]  personally working with the tech companies to facilitate the ban and had
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:37.600]  his article already written and ready to go for the moment that they were banned
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:42.760]  but he made a mistake and published it an hour early here he is admitting that
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:47.040]  he's also trying to determine whether or not Alex Jones uses WhatsApp the text
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:51.720]  messaging application which is also owned by Facebook so he could get a band
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:57.200]  over there too now Facebook is gonna be banning Alex Jones and info wars from
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:01.160]  not only their main platform Facebook but also from Instagram I checked in also
[1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:04.440]  to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp which is also owned by a
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:08.280]  Facebook and a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's I guess
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:12.360]  unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts according to the
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:15.360]  spokesperson all right but we know you'll continue to check on it Oliver
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:19.160]  Darcy good to see you thank you yes thank you I also checked with Costco to see if
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:22.080]  they would be banning Alex Jones's membership because we wouldn't want
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:26.480]  someone like him to be able to eat now would we of course CNN's Anna Navarro
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:30.760]  the fake Republican commentator is thrilled with the new censorship I have
[1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:34.560]  no issue with it at all I want them shut down I want them silence I want them
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:38.400]  muted I think they are horrible for our society I want them shut down I want
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:42.080]  them silence I want them muted I think they are horrible for our society while
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:45.560]  Alex Jones Paul Joseph Watson Milo Unopolis Laura Lumber and others aren't
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:48.480]  allowed to have a Facebook page anymore because they're considered to be
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:53.560]  dangerous individuals Facebook doesn't have a problem allowing the Muslim
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.960]  brotherhood to have an official page which has been designated a terrorist
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:03.320]  organization in multiple countries there are also people saying that they're
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:07.080]  having photos taken down off of their Instagram account for violating the
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:12.120]  community standards because those pictures include those individuals having
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:16.200]  met with some of the people who apparently you're not supposed to even
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:20.400]  show pictures of online anymore rapper Snoop Dogg's upset about the latest
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:25.240]  round of censorship because included in this latest purge was Lewis Farrakhan to
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:29.720]  try to give the impression that it wasn't just conservatives being censored
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:34.640]  Facebook and Instagram I'm gonna ban Minister Lewis Farrakhan for putting

[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:47.200]  issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States it read
[1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:52.840]  when certain obstructionists become too irritating label them after suitable
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:59.200]  build-ups as fascist or Nazi or anti-semitic and use the prestige of
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:04.120]  anti-fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them in the public mind
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:08.880]  constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a
[1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:14.840]  bad smell the association will after enough repetition become fact in the
[1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:19.880]  public mind why are they doing this now well it's a good question as to why they
[1:07:19.880 --> 1:07:25.840]  waited this long but they did exactly I mean they so Alice is the Alps Jones has
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.720]  been banned from Facebook for a long period of time but now they banned him
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:33.440]  they banned his like a little underling Paul Joseph Watson now that they keep
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:37.440]  them off the platform that's great for now but it doesn't roll back the clock
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:41.080]  but you have also excesses in the first amendment and the second amendment right
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:44.920]  now you know I don't think that the four of the forefathers said well you can say
[1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:48.040]  yeah you know all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world

[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:03.240]  comedy piece you know I had this idea we were in a IT writing meeting yesterday
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:07.480]  and I said you know the globalists just want to dominate people they want to like
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:12.160]  giant job of the huts sit on top of us and rape us and Kate Daniels one of our
[1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:17.480]  great writers one of our great managers here he said you mean like sea lions
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:22.920]  raping penguins and we and I looked at him and we all sort of laughing there's
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:27.080]  like eight people in the room and I think Rob do or something goes actually I saw
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.360]  that on like Animal Planet that's a new phenomenon they like rape them to death
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:35.600]  and and of course it's not funny it's upsetting so you giggle about it so this
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:38.280]  Arizona Animal Planet we can air it here they'll probably you'll say it's evil
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:40.880]  but it's going viral on Twitter viral on YouTube right now it's um
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:44.880]  paddled on info wars.com if your radio listener want to see it I'm going from
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:48.240]  memory we can pull it up it's on info wars.com this is last night video Mark
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.400]  Zuckerberg rapes Americans free speech hell he rapes it worldwide so it's
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:10:00.160]  Zuckerberg as a lion seal raping me a penguin they put my head on a penguin king
[1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:05.000]  penguins is what they're called but what's very sad about this is it's so
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.840]  crazy because it's so funny because not the raping he put Brian Stelter and
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:13.680]  Oliver Darcy's heads on the albatrosses that are just waiting for the seal to
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:20.280]  get the the seal to kill the penguin so they can eat its guts so that birds do
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:23.560]  eat the eyeballs and then pull the guts out the so that's that's how it is I'm
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:27.520]  like I'm sitting here with Facebook on top of me raping me they just kicked me
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:30.000]  off they said I'm a white supremacist while they did it's like we're not just
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  gonna kick all your fans off and anybody supporting you off and and and say
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.160]  your name can only be said if it's attacked that's beyond 1984 he believes
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:42.120]  it's happening but that you're a white supremacist everywhere and that you're
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:47.400]  dangerous so so so this is the crazy thing yeah it's on our own servers at
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:51.480]  info wars.com it's going crazy on Twitter right now so let's go ahead and
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:56.240]  roll this for radio listeners you can go find it info wars.com but yes it's I'm
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:00.520]  doing kind of a David Attenborough accent here at the start here it is and this
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:06.560]  shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:12.160]  other MSM outlets shearing on the rape in fact it's been found that these
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:18.120]  systems actually direct the monstrous seal Zuckerberg against the free speech
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:23.320]  enemies and anyone that tries to not submit but most sad of all is other
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.400]  penguins in the independent media simply looking up out of the sky and
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:32.000]  ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.840]  right in front of them we are in a complete war
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:44.360]  and you idiots don't join with the Republic you fools. I want them shut down I want them
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.960]  silence I want them muted I think they are horrible for our society. Yes now
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:54.080]  Facebook is banning Alex Jones and info wars for not only their main
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:59.160]  platform Facebook but also from Instagram. President Trump please save the first
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:05.240]  amendment please do the right thing and stand up against big tech. Mark Zuckerberg is not
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:09.800]  simply censoring opinions he's prescribing which political opinions
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.040]  you're allowed to have. I want them shut down. We're losing the thread of the
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:19.400]  concepts that are important to this country. I don't like Alex Jones but
[1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:30.280]  Alex Jones gets to speak everybody gets to speak. I'm a bad person. I have a question there because I'm evil.
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:42.800]  The changes is info wars. Alright folks we're back live. I appreciate you joining us here on the transmission.
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:49.000]  I don't want to make myself the whole focus of this broadcast but it's like when
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:57.360]  Rush Limbaugh said 12-13 years ago he said the NFL is pushing black guys into
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:02.840]  quarterback positions who aren't as good as part of political correctness. Now
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:06.800]  that's his opinion. I'm not a big enough follower of the NFL enough time to know
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:10.680]  that's true. I really don't care as long as they don't politicize the NFL which
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:16.240]  they've done but nobody can deny the NFL is like 80% black so I remember just
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:21.280]  when I was watching they were in the news always pushing that. I don't care
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:25.600]  whether all the quarterbacks are black or none of them but they tried to take
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:31.560]  Limbaugh off the air. They took most his sponsors and I'm a capitalist and I
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:37.120]  thought Rush Limbaugh with $12,000 a minute spots when I knew good and well
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:40.760]  even back then my audience on radio was you know a third of biggest his on the
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:47.680]  internet bigger than his. We were selling like $1,200 spots. When his spots went
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:52.520]  down to like $3,000, $4,000 a piece I said now that's more like it. So I said
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.720]  I'll run some ads for some of my films like Terror Storm exposing Deep State
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:02.320]  on Limbaugh show and I did that though because I thought hey I'll get my money
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.240]  back which I made some money not a lot but it more than broke even and I got to
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:12.040]  support Rush Limbaugh. See how that works and even if I disagree with Rush Limbaugh
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:17.240]  on 90% of what he had to say and I of course agree with him on about 95% I
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:22.480]  would have advertised with him if it had been Bill Maher and you know I've had
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.120]  some guests on that have said some things about Bill Maher that I don't think
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:29.200]  have been proven and I think are wrong and then I got a few phone calls from
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:32.000]  people that I know that know Bill Maher other famous comedians saying look we
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.760]  know Bill Maher he's not into kids like the rest of Hollywood he's into full
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:39.760]  grown women it's well-known and so I should apologize to Bill Maher. I didn't
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:41.960]  call him a pedophile I just said it's a little weird his production company is
[1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:45.680]  called Kid Love but there's a lot of reasons you can say that. The point is
[1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:50.120]  is that at least Bill Maher did stand up and say Alex Jones deserves free
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:53.840]  speech and you know it's it's it's really that simple remember everybody was
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:57.880]  supposed to get that in America everybody and it's it's very very
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:04.600]  dangerous when people do things like that it's very very dangerous and so I am
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:07.600]  just very very thankful for the audience for all your support all your prayers
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:12.800]  and this great crew and I don't do this to kiss Drudge's ass because Drudge only
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:18.040]  links two of you wants to. I wouldn't be here and I almost don't want to say this
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:20.680]  because it will make him come after me more but they already know this. We
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:27.480]  wouldn't have survived without Matt Drudge. Two plus years into just the total
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:32.720]  assault and so thank you Matt Drudge thank you so everybody click on Matt
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:37.240]  Drudge's sponsor support him I know for people that know Drudge well and I know
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:40.640]  him some but he's gone through a lot too everybody goes through a lot that
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:44.720]  stands up for what's right but that's the process of radicalizing us up to the
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:47.920]  level of the globalist to counter them we're all just nice guys but we're not
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:53.480]  laying down so I salute the audience and I salute drudgereport.com a real man

[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:06.000]  Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:12.360]  that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed and that's the
[1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:18.400]  videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:23.280]  authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when Trump won
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:27.600]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:32.880]  political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:37.680]  to shut in fours down this is a fight about taking your speech away not just
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.760]  my speech about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a

[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:05.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:24.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:35.000]  well so does he lie from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:55.840]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen I'm alex jones your host we're gonna open
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:01.720]  the phones up in the next segment and cover a ton of news obviously that's
[1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:07.840]  breaking that I haven't gotten to yet but just look at the latest information
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:13.720]  pouring in to info wars.com and news wars.com you know Germany has a
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:19.560]  parliamentary system so they have a chancellor and they have a president
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:23.160]  just like you can have a president you can have a premier and there's
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:26.360]  different systems but normally the parliamentary system you have an upper
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:32.880]  and lower house and in Germany they have a president over one of the houses and
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:35.800]  a chancellor over the other the chancellor has veto power is a little
[1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:42.600]  bit more powerful that's why Hitler was the chancellor he was first elected by
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:47.000]  a minority which again parliamentary systems let happen. Internet
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:55.200]  regulation could take the wind out of the sales of populist. What do you think's
[1:21:55.200 --> 1:22:04.960]  going on? What do you think's happening? What do you think is unfolding? If you go
[1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:09.960]  back to three years ago top globalist at Davos top globalist in the financial
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:15.080]  times of London the New York Times in establishment articles said if we don't
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:19.400]  stop Trump there will be populism spreading all over the world it started
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:23.640]  with Brexit we've got it happening all over Europe we've got to start censoring
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:30.080]  they're going to win and they did censor but the tidal wave was so big it made
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:39.880]  it over the seawall and so now that's all going on here it's all unfolding
[1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:46.080]  here and it's happening in Brazil and it's happening in Germany and it's
[1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:49.120]  happening in Spain it's happening and even in countries where we've gotten
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.920]  populist elected they still got globalist forces there like Russia has
[1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:55.720]  globalists all over it and sorrow spending billions a year of State
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:58.400]  Department money to overthrow their elected government just like they did
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:04.680]  Ukraine and so when they talk about meddling and they claim Russians that
[1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:09.560]  Russian troll farms meddled the election it came out in the FBI's own
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:25.400]  reports 80% of it 80% of it right at 80 was pro-Hillary well of course 80% of
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:30.120]  the money was spent by the Democrats is that funny again everybody knows this
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:35.600]  but you go to Russia and other countries because they'll let you buy a
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:39.200]  company buy time in the company to influence something and so Hillary's
[1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:42.800]  been using Russia using Russia for the fake dossier and all the rest of it but
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:51.520]  I only raised this point to show how you have multinational globalist absolutely
[1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:58.240]  everywhere who know exactly what they're doing who are calling for more
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.760]  censorship so see the censorship's already gotten massive it's out of
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:05.320]  control they arrest you in Germany if you criticize open borders if you
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:08.800]  criticize radical Islam if you criticize Muslims raping people if you
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:12.520]  criticize communist and old people being thrown out of section 8 housing to be
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:18.720]  given to Islamist but now they're openly saying we're censoring people to
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:24.280]  stop the movement we're censoring the populist they're not calling you right
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:27.800]  wing they're not calling you Nazis because now the left all over Europe
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:33.240]  goes our pension funds are not going to be here to pay for Muslims who are 90%
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:38.760]  on welfare that's 90% was 80 something now it's 90% just don't work why
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:43.800]  should they they sit around in leisure suits all day for whatever reason I don't
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:47.440]  know why Russians and Muslims all in Europe wear leisure suits where you
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:54.360]  know the track outfits jogging suits but the culture of gang bang black
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  gangster rap is the operating system of the world now all from Japan to Russia
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.080]  to Germany it doesn't matter to white doesn't matter they're Arabic you know
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:06.000]  just all these kids on welfare just dressed like gangsters and call women
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.840]  whores and all of the chivalry all the west is draining out of us like her
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:20.960]  legs are chopped off in the blood they must say in this to be negative I'm
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:27.760]  saying this because it's the truth and it's what's going on and he was quoted
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:34.020]  in major newspapers and a full speech that he gave us video of it that it's
[1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:40.180]  it's time to shut down populist who are against globalism and the corrupt EU. See, now it's
[1:25:40.180 --> 1:25:44.020]  not that you're Nazis, they're dispensing with all that. They're saying you're not allowed to be
[1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:48.660]  against the EU expanding its power and having its own military so you can't get out of the European
[1:25:48.660 --> 1:25:56.900]  Union. States that never voted to be in it, they tricked them in a trade deal just like NAFTA GATT
[1:25:56.900 --> 1:26:05.060]  or the TPP. In a speech delivered to Republica, Internet Conference in Berlin, German President
[1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:13.780]  Frank Walter Steinmeier scolded big tech platforms for not doing enough. See, that's how all these
[1:26:13.780 --> 1:26:20.340]  fines work. I have an article right here. $5 billion fine that the Democrats want for Facebook
[1:26:20.340 --> 1:26:24.580]  illegally spying on Americans and the Republicans think it should be $20 billion. Let's see how
[1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:30.180]  the Democrats work it. They get them to censor me and other conservatives and now they've made
[1:26:30.180 --> 1:26:34.420]  hundreds of billions spying on people in America. Now they just got to pay a little fine of $5
[1:26:34.420 --> 1:26:40.340]  billion. How like banks that get caught money laundering $387 billion like Wells Fargo did
[1:26:40.340 --> 1:26:45.620]  and they paid a billion dollar fine, like $998 million. Remember that 10 years ago? It was in
[1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:50.820]  Bloomberg everywhere. So if you rob a bank, you've got a whole truckload of stuff you just stole,
[1:26:50.820 --> 1:26:55.860]  the cops bust you. They go, just give us one bag of coins out of 100 bags of coins and we'll let
[1:26:55.860 --> 1:27:01.860]  you go. So it's the same thing here. He scolds social media like Merkel, the chancellor did two
[1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:06.580]  years ago, to Zuckerberg saying, you're not stopping Germans criticizing open borders
[1:27:08.260 --> 1:27:12.020]  and Islamic invasion. And he said, don't worry, I'll do it soon, which he's done.
[1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:20.020]  Yeah, you guys found $1 billion for their mortgage abuse. It was Wells Fargo, $300 and
[1:27:20.660 --> 1:27:24.740]  something billion dollars in laundered money. They paid a billion. It was a $9 or $98 million fine,
[1:27:25.380 --> 1:27:33.700]  but continuing. The president said the new internet regulation could be the most effective way
[1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:40.100]  to take the wind out of the sails of demagogues and populist, those evil populists that don't want
[1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:44.500]  people running them that are getting rid of their country, bankrupting and bringing in foreign
[1:27:44.500 --> 1:27:51.540]  invaders that don't work and who want to take your free speech. How dare you want to be involved
[1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:58.500]  and have speech against people that want to smuzzle you. Flaming authoritarians. I want them
[1:27:58.500 --> 1:28:07.460]  silence. I want them muted. I want them shut up. How you Hitler, he says. That's what Hitler did.
[1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:15.940]  That's what authoritarians do. Totally sick. Thumbing his nose at small groups, he calls,
[1:28:15.940 --> 1:28:20.660]  who cause disproportionate amount of noise. He said the new liberties need new rules,
[1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:27.940]  the new liberties. Talk about 1984. Take your liberties away. Take your speech away and call it
[1:28:27.940 --> 1:28:39.780]  a new liberty. The freedom of being a slave. War is peace. Freedom of slavery. Two plus two
[1:28:39.780 --> 1:28:44.500]  equals whatever we say it does. Unbelievable. Okay. Okay. I don't have time to tell you what's
[1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.620]  coming up next, but there's a bunch of it and I'll give the number out. It's all coming up.
[1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:52.980]  This is the American resistance. This is the info war. This is your voice. So amplify it
[1:28:52.980 --> 1:28:58.980]  or the enemy could win. Fight now or lose forever. Stocks and options trading involves financial

[1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:04.420]  of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[1:32:04.420 --> 1:32:08.660]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[1:32:08.660 --> 1:32:15.060]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA.
[1:32:15.060 --> 1:32:20.260]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the
[1:32:20.260 --> 1:32:26.180]  body and it supports the mfore. It is a classical 360-win. This is the formula that I personally
[1:32:26.180 --> 1:32:30.740]  have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:35.140]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your
[1:32:35.140 --> 1:32:40.580]  family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and
[1:32:40.580 --> 1:32:47.140]  as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those
[1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:51.460]  brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support
[1:32:51.460 --> 1:32:55.540]  and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with
[1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:57.540]  ZShieldM4sLive.com.
[1:33:01.780 --> 1:33:05.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:05.540 --> 1:33:25.540]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:35.540]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:55.700 --> 1:34:14.820]  All right folks, I want to stop right there and I want to give the number out but it's hard to
[1:34:14.820 --> 1:34:17.940]  turn Alice Cooper off so I'm gonna play a little bit more Alice Cooper here in just a moment. You
[1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:21.700]  know, he's a patron, he's a listener. I've never been able to get a hold of him. I didn't really
[1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:24.980]  ask for his phone number from the folks that told me he was listeners. Two different major
[1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:30.500]  rock stars but it's not about name dropping. Oh, Alice Cooper likes me. It's the fact that Alice
[1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:35.620]  Cooper we know is a Trump supporter and a patriot and it's just one more person. All the cool people
[1:34:35.620 --> 1:34:43.540]  like Bruce Willis or like Rowdy H, you know, in Rawhide who's actually, you know who, right?
[1:34:43.540 --> 1:34:48.340]  Greatest actor in U.S. history because he's a real patriot in Air Force that are in Clint Eastwood.
[1:34:48.340 --> 1:34:56.500]  All those folks are listeners. You know who else is a listener? You know who? Kurt Russell.
[1:34:57.220 --> 1:35:03.940]  It's like every person I actually like from Hollywood is a patriot and all the others I
[1:35:03.940 --> 1:35:12.340]  could never care less about and then you find out that they're patriots and then you find out
[1:35:12.340 --> 1:35:22.340]  that they're so humble they don't see themselves as going out and saying something like it's arrogant
[1:35:22.340 --> 1:35:26.260]  if they get politically involved. Well, all the leftists get politically involved all day
[1:35:26.260 --> 1:35:32.740]  and tell us how to live and tell us what to do. So we need all those people to go public and some
[1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:38.260]  that I won't name that I've talked to have said some things after they've been challenged but
[1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:44.740]  if you run into those people in Maui let's say you're at the grocery store like a lot of folks
[1:35:44.740 --> 1:35:50.420]  have done imagine if I went to Maui once and ran into Clint Eastwood that'd be cool but that would
[1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:57.940]  be a private matter and then challenge them to say something and to do something because
[1:35:57.940 --> 1:36:05.380]  everything is in the balance right now. Now I'm gonna give the number out and have a few other
[1:36:05.380 --> 1:36:11.780]  things to hit on here but I want everybody to understand something. Hillary Clinton sicked
[1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:16.500]  the entire media on this audience because she fears you that's what she fears is a focal point
[1:36:16.500 --> 1:36:24.740]  I'm just a focal point and we know and I'm not gonna bring these big political guns out until
[1:36:24.740 --> 1:36:30.900]  it's time we know George Soros and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are financing the lawsuits
[1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:39.220]  against us. I mean we go to court hearings sometimes there's eight lawyers and many of them
[1:36:39.220 --> 1:36:43.540]  formerly worked for Hillary Clinton. Now in the end we know and appeals even if they rigged
[1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:47.540]  stuff we're gonna win but we're gonna fight every step of the way as they try to overturn the first
[1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:54.420]  amendment but here's a big league politics dot com story by the great investigative journalist Tom
[1:36:54.420 --> 1:36:59.140]  Pappard that we're gonna post to info wars dot com that I hope you share but share it from big
[1:36:59.140 --> 1:37:05.300]  league politics dot com that's not a censor is info wars. Facebook hired former Hillary press
[1:37:05.300 --> 1:37:16.980]  director to inform media of Alex Jones ban and you've heard Hillary is gearing up
[1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:27.220]  to run in this field of 20 plus you say that's arrogant that's insane well she wants to keep
[1:37:27.220 --> 1:37:31.860]  getting money into her foundation she still wants to project her power so that people are scared to
[1:37:31.860 --> 1:37:35.780]  go after her for her criminal actions because she almost needs to run to stay out of prison
[1:37:35.780 --> 1:37:45.380]  and now mainline pundits are actually saying that. I just know that I was authorized the first time
[1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:56.740]  a person in security just like Secret Service at the RNC said Hillary has a black ambulance
[1:37:56.740 --> 1:38:01.300]  she's having convulsions on average every 45 minutes when they get her off the drugs so she
[1:38:01.300 --> 1:38:06.980]  can talk she has to take guess it's depacote and a bunch of other stuff that keeps you from
[1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:13.700]  having seizures they got a mobile medical center follows her around remember this three years ago
[1:38:14.420 --> 1:38:18.100]  we had Millie Weaver shadowing her all over the country and and then she'd go to tent for an hour
[1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:22.500]  and they'd have emergency and they'd cancel her speeches and then a fella visiting caught her
[1:38:22.500 --> 1:38:27.460]  collapsing on 9-11 2016 in New York and the media cut the tape and said we made it up
[1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:32.260]  fake news that she only stumbled no she fell down like a sack of potatoes like a side of beef
[1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:41.060]  the reason I'm getting at this is Secret Service told us we can't tell you here at the RNC
[1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:47.380]  you will be given a message in the next three weeks in Austin of the specifics and they said
[1:38:47.380 --> 1:38:52.500]  you've got to follow her everywhere this is unprecedented the animals the Secret Service but
[1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:57.780]  they knew how criminal she was she's a foreign agent of the Chai Cops well about a month later
[1:38:57.780 --> 1:39:04.900]  we get the message and they said you got to get her you know Ohio you got to get her in New York
[1:39:04.900 --> 1:39:10.180]  you got to get her in DC and they said why haven't you already gotten her we already told you she's
[1:39:10.180 --> 1:39:14.180]  already had convulsions repeatedly that could have been caught on tape that's why they'll park
[1:39:14.180 --> 1:39:18.180]  in a remote area and then sneak her in they don't just pull right in I mean that lady was so sick
[1:39:18.180 --> 1:39:22.420]  back then she probably had their third brain surgery since then we don't know we know she had two
[1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:30.980]  before like Biden she's always falling down the reason I get it that is they don't want us on air
[1:39:30.980 --> 1:39:38.980]  the next time to deal that political death blow and that's why they've got a raging hard on to
[1:39:38.980 --> 1:39:47.140]  take us down and then here's the article Facebook press contact had extensive work with the Clinton
[1:39:47.140 --> 1:39:52.100]  family and Obama White House yeah I'm saying every bit of this they're breathing down my neck and
[1:39:52.100 --> 1:39:59.220]  I'm not bitching but other people aren't willing to take these monsters on I am that's why I'm
[1:39:59.220 --> 1:40:03.940]  thanking our MNF affiliates and our TB affiliates but they all get great ratings and they get some
[1:40:03.940 --> 1:40:10.180]  threats and they get some boycotts so what we're fighting for America this is it and so yes I'm
[1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:15.540]  fighting for my identity they say I'm a liar they say I'm fake news they say anything I've ever
[1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:19.540]  admitted we made a mistake on that I'm a that I did it on purpose they never admit when they're
[1:40:19.540 --> 1:40:24.740]  wrong because they do it on purpose I don't and that's what I'm saying we're fighting for our lives
[1:40:25.940 --> 1:40:30.420]  and here it is huge Facebook hired former Hillary press director to inform media
[1:40:30.420 --> 1:40:36.420]  of Alex Jones being taken off and what do they want my name not even mentioned they're running it
[1:40:37.460 --> 1:40:40.660]  when big league politics contacted Facebook to clarify with Alex Jones Paul Joseph Watson
[1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:45.460]  Lord limmer and my leg anopolis were banned by Facebook and Instagram we discovered that Facebook
[1:40:45.460 --> 1:40:49.220]  employee oh this has got to go on drudge I never tell drudge what he needs to do but my god
[1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:54.820]  the Facebook employee assigned to handle these communications as a former press director of

[1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:17.700]  and explained that the decision was made in part because Jones interviewed gab McGinnis
[1:41:18.580 --> 1:41:23.140]  on his radio program who they designated as a hate figure because they falsely quoted the FBI
[1:41:23.140 --> 1:41:28.180]  saying it was a terror group which was made up but by using that they then put it in inner poll

[2:00:21.460 --> 2:00:26.260]  i just remembered it was in my stack and i was fumbling around for the four different articles
[2:00:26.260 --> 2:00:32.180]  the last two days of democrats threatening and harassing and yelling at pro-livers at pro-life
[2:00:32.180 --> 2:00:38.020]  rallies or conservative events and again the ones friday sunday and yesterday were all hails satan
[2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:42.340]  and we love the devil can you guys pull those videos up to they were in the last three days list
[2:00:43.780 --> 2:00:49.220]  because again that's what i'm saying there's so much of this there are so many make america
[2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:54.980]  grading in hat people people wearing the hats being beat up i can't even watch the videos anymore
[2:00:54.980 --> 2:01:02.100]  there's like 10 a day that i see and that's what you see you think the enemy attacking will make us
[2:01:02.100 --> 2:01:06.820]  fight back no no no there's a strategy in different warfare systems you can give it different names
[2:01:06.820 --> 2:01:11.940]  but if you can get people to just get used to being attacked and get and submit you can then
[2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:17.140]  ratchet up the attacks till they're fatal and no one cares so it's getting bad but this particular
[2:01:17.140 --> 2:01:23.220]  has come back this representative is gets to be on facebook twitter everywhere and publish video
[2:01:23.220 --> 2:01:28.020]  where he attacks young women calling him all sorts of names saying he's going to dox them
[2:01:28.020 --> 2:01:34.900]  and send people to his houses what a pig creature brian sims uh this is a uh representative in
[2:01:34.900 --> 2:01:41.460]  pennsylvania look at this bully look at this bully boy but see he's gay so it's like tim kook's case
[2:01:41.460 --> 2:01:46.740]  he can run slave factories in china i don't give a rash behind what you're shoving up your butt
[2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:53.620]  the point is is that is is it doesn't give you a little halo to harass people here it is and uh
[2:01:53.620 --> 2:01:59.220]  representative brian sims here and i am outside the planned parenthood at southeastern pennsylvania
[2:01:59.220 --> 2:02:06.100]  oh no they're leaving now what we've got here is a bunch of protesters a bunch of pseudo christian
[2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:10.260]  protesters who've been out here young girls for being here and so here's the deal i've got a hundred
[2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:14.900]  dollars to anybody who will identify any of these three so we're gonna donate the planned parenthood
[2:02:14.900 --> 2:02:18.900]  i'm gonna donate the planned parenthood so look a bunch of white people standing out in front of a
[2:02:18.900 --> 2:02:23.860]  planned parenthood shaming people the first layer of this is spanish i don't know what's nothing christian
[2:02:23.860 --> 2:02:28.580]  at all about what you're doing nine nothing christian or loving or godly about what you're doing so
[2:02:28.580 --> 2:02:33.460]  i've got a hundred dollars to anybody who will identify that it's a hundred dollars see if you
[2:02:33.460 --> 2:02:37.700]  got some friends out here a hundred bucks it'd be easier if you just give me your name and your
[2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:44.660]  address um rich rich way from uh thanks rich what makes you think that it's your job to
[2:02:44.660 --> 2:02:48.020]  tell women what's right for their body and the truth is i'm not really asking because i now they
[2:02:48.020 --> 2:02:52.020]  want to kill the babies after they're born well you have a free speech right so now he wants to
[2:02:52.020 --> 2:02:56.660]  dox people so here's another woman who's just coming in to talk to plan parenthood and where
[2:02:56.660 --> 2:02:59.620]  they can tell them they get hundreds of thousands of dollars for their babies on adoption but they
[2:02:59.620 --> 2:03:03.140]  don't want you to know there's a bigger market for adoption than abortion they want the babies dead
[2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:09.220]  like the black uh member of the Louisiana senate said we gotta kill these black babies before they
[2:03:09.220 --> 2:03:13.860]  get born i have to kill them later in fact cue that up but uh here he is going after the lady
[2:03:13.860 --> 2:03:18.660]  calling her all sorts of names about plan parenthood shaming people for something that they have a
[2:03:18.660 --> 2:03:26.420]  constitutional right to do you can pray at home for children it's probably the same place that you
[2:03:26.420 --> 2:03:31.140]  could feed a child but you're not instead you're out here shaming people for something that they have
[2:03:31.140 --> 2:03:35.540]  a constitutional right to do who would have thought that an old white lady would be out in front of a
[2:03:35.540 --> 2:03:40.180]  plan parenthood telling people what's right for their bodies shame on an evil white lady
[2:03:40.180 --> 2:03:43.620]  they don't want to kill all the black babies at the same time that you're shaming other people there's
[2:03:43.620 --> 2:03:48.900]  a difference again in the fall this thug has a right to harass this lady on the street is free
[2:03:48.900 --> 2:03:53.380]  speech she's involved in political action she can be harassed to the point where she gets in her car
[2:03:53.380 --> 2:03:59.060]  the young ladies he tried to dox that's that's really a terroristic stalking event and is illegal
[2:03:59.060 --> 2:04:05.140]  uh and basically any jurisdiction especially if somebody gets hurt it's funny acts on it
[2:04:05.140 --> 2:04:11.060]  but he's acting like they're bad for being out and if you try to go out the plan parenthood
[2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:16.100]  i've seen this on facebook or twitter and you try to just nicely talk about the babies and how
[2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:19.620]  they're viable you get banned because that's hateful because you're trying to get rid of somebody's
[2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:25.060]  right these authoritarians are incredible the left wants children dead and wants their organs
[2:04:25.060 --> 2:04:32.340]  harvested let's go out to break with this thug does it protect me protect you and and that's okay
[2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:37.700]  you're allowed to be out here that doesn't mean oh i am leftist right to be out here shame on you
[2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:42.100]  what you're doing here is disgusting this is wrong you have no business being out here
[2:04:42.900 --> 2:04:50.820]  no business being out here yep disgusting so do me a favor please if you're watching this
[2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:54.740]  plan parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania's one of the most heavily protested we'll be right back
[2:04:54.740 --> 2:05:00.420]  stay with us you know the worst part about getting old and i'm still strong at 45 is that i won't be
[2:05:00.420 --> 2:05:04.580]  there for my children someday that's why i didn't make them strong now now i can be there for my
[2:05:04.580 --> 2:05:09.860]  children now i can make them strong now i can instruct them now i can teach them what i've
[2:05:09.860 --> 2:05:13.700]  learned but not once i'm gone you think of this digital age your word's going forever but now
[2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:18.660]  they're even better getting rid of what you said they were before it's so much easier to burn video
[2:05:18.660 --> 2:05:24.740]  or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning isn't it but i have joined my will
[2:05:24.740 --> 2:05:29.780]  to the resistance i can't be destroyed now as long as i realize i've done right and the long as the
[2:05:29.780 --> 2:05:34.980]  people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something
[2:05:34.980 --> 2:05:40.580]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it there is a magic that then takes place the transcend
[2:05:40.580 --> 2:05:45.380]  space and time when you commit the award of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and
[2:05:45.380 --> 2:05:51.380]  videos that overrides everything the enemy's doing so please now commit to support info wars
[2:05:51.380 --> 2:06:07.300]  however you can and realize your provision to info wars is your own provision
[2:06:07.300 --> 2:06:17.140]  from the front lines from austin texas it's alex jones
[2:06:21.620 --> 2:06:27.940]  you know i grabbed this off an old tv's greatest hits music that i bought in like 1990 or something
[2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:34.340]  and it's not the best quality i heard a hawaii 50 of this on youtube the other day
[2:06:34.340 --> 2:06:38.900]  but we should redownload and play it where it just sounds so crisp and so good
[2:06:38.900 --> 2:06:43.940]  it's that that big band song it's kind of a redo of the music they had in the 20s and 30s and 40s
[2:06:43.940 --> 2:06:50.660]  imagine a 30-piece band playing something like this crank it up
[2:06:50.660 --> 2:07:05.300]  can you see everything in the news this is about you it's not about me
[2:07:06.100 --> 2:07:11.220]  it's how i'm a loser how i'm failing how i'm being banned on this how i'm being sued for that
[2:07:11.220 --> 2:07:15.460]  all like if you're americana if you believe in freedom if you believe in the right to keep
[2:07:15.460 --> 2:07:22.100]  bare arms if you believe in god and family you're losing no i'm winning and our audience is winning
[2:07:22.100 --> 2:07:27.300]  we are the tip of the spear we are the vaunted 1776 worldwide and i don't tell you that to puff
[2:07:27.300 --> 2:07:34.420]  you up folks came out in big league politics 45 minutes ago that hillary clinton is quarterbacking
[2:07:34.420 --> 2:07:43.700]  myd platforming her staff members of course she is she's still planning to run or at least
[2:07:43.700 --> 2:07:50.180]  broker some convention deal like she's the kingmaker that's why they're trying to shut us down
[2:07:50.180 --> 2:07:54.740]  that's why they're censoring so much to kill populism i've got the german president came out
[2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:58.980]  and said censor all the populists from america to germany shut them up or our new world order is

[2:08:55.700 --> 2:09:02.020]  fun things to do these are the good things to do i can't tell you how many people have called me
[2:09:02.020 --> 2:09:08.580]  written me letters that said you know i took a vaccine when i was 14 it almost killed me but
[2:09:08.580 --> 2:09:14.260]  despite that we gave our newborn son rounds of shots in 18 months he went into a convulsions
[2:09:14.260 --> 2:09:20.340]  and has been in a coma for two years i wish i'd have seen your flyers before but i put up 500 of them
[2:09:20.340 --> 2:09:26.020]  in st louis last week and i had some people thanking me and some threatening me that that's a real
[2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:32.100]  phone call i got and you know i've been asked by people around to tell these stories and i won't but
[2:09:32.100 --> 2:09:39.700]  let me just tell you something you need to stand up and i know you are but instead of just listening
[2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:48.340]  i know most of you are taking action you need to we need to create a whole smattering make it easy
[2:09:48.340 --> 2:09:54.260]  for you or maybe people can send in to show tips at info wars dot com who that's the answer images
[2:09:54.260 --> 2:09:57.780]  that are what's the size of a piece of paper i forget what these are what are these uh
[2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:04.660]  eight and a half by 11 that's all i got to do and you can just say vaccines kill
[2:10:05.860 --> 2:10:10.740]  and then just say it's known that you can get learned immunity from attenuated viruses and
[2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:16.420]  bacteria but it's admitted in the lengthy inserts that come with the shots that are never given to
[2:10:16.420 --> 2:10:21.300]  the patients by the nurses or doctors that it can give you hundreds of different disorders
[2:10:21.300 --> 2:10:29.860]  including cancer gion berets and narcolepsy and death and it can cause type one diabetes it eats
[2:10:29.860 --> 2:10:43.140]  your pancreas i mean that's in the damn inserts now i mean i'm not a mr angel cake share but you
[2:10:43.140 --> 2:10:48.020]  know what when i see pregnant women in the grocery store with their husband i have this thing about
[2:10:48.020 --> 2:10:52.900]  not messing with a woman out with her husband and you know obviously she's taken she's pregnant
[2:10:52.900 --> 2:10:56.740]  it's creepy if a guy walks over some woman in the ice cream aisle you know she's wanting some
[2:10:56.740 --> 2:11:02.660]  ice cream because she's nine months pregnant not just say hey listen i'm not getting your business
[2:11:03.300 --> 2:11:08.500]  because i want anything or i'm with any group i've got children and i wish somebody would have
[2:11:08.500 --> 2:11:11.940]  warned me in my family early on and warned others that a lot of friends that have had their kids
[2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:18.980]  hurt and died don't believe me ask for the insert with the vaccines and almost every time the woman
[2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:24.260]  and their husband say either oh we know you we actually we're debating her mom or my dad about
[2:11:24.260 --> 2:11:29.860]  that or no no we got friends that it yeah well what where yeah i went into walgreens and they gave me
[2:11:29.860 --> 2:11:36.180]  a fact sheet and it said it was fine but you're right there's an insert i'm like yeah well do you
[2:11:36.180 --> 2:11:41.060]  know about the vaccine damage court they set up 1984 to cover up millions of brain damage
[2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:49.380]  and they're like no if there was a well out in the let's say the desert and wagon trains were
[2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:52.900]  coming through and there was a little town before you went into the desert and you know went down
[2:11:52.900 --> 2:12:00.180]  through novata into utah and you knew that 20 miles out there there was a spring that people
[2:12:00.180 --> 2:12:06.740]  might think was good that had arsenic in it you'd probably ride out there and put a sign up saying
[2:12:06.740 --> 2:12:11.460]  don't drink that water just because it's a normal thing it's what you do and you'd be still worried
[2:12:11.460 --> 2:12:16.580]  when you saw a sweet family coming through that sometimes those signs blow over and you'd say
[2:12:16.580 --> 2:12:24.820]  hey listen out at dry Gulch about 15 miles through the valley off the road you'll see water
[2:12:24.820 --> 2:12:30.340]  don't drink it or give it to your horses it's bad water bitter water make sure you take plenty of
[2:12:30.340 --> 2:12:38.740]  water with you before you go through the valley humans are supposed to not be busy bodying
[2:12:38.740 --> 2:12:43.860]  tattling on their neighbors for crap to the government but you're supposed to be helping each
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:53.220]  other and i get so exhausted i'm going to your calls next segment so exhausted being here on
[2:12:53.220 --> 2:12:58.020]  air and after i make all the decisions and do all these things that i have only so many
[2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:07.060]  decisions i can make during the day and then my brain goes it's done but i commit that just as
[2:13:07.060 --> 2:13:11.380]  a symbol of what needs to be done we're going to put these posters out in the next few days
[2:13:11.380 --> 2:13:15.220]  we're going to send in your posters whatever political idea or slogan or thing you have
[2:13:15.940 --> 2:13:20.820]  and we'll post them all up to info wars dot com on a page people can download them and print them
[2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:25.300]  and then let's all just whether small town whether you're in england or new zealand or
[2:13:25.300 --> 2:13:31.220]  mexico or the us wherever you are let's go print those suckers off and let zuckerberg and let apple
[2:13:31.220 --> 2:13:35.620]  and all their slave factories in china let them know man you may think you control this universe
[2:13:35.620 --> 2:13:43.780]  but you don't control the third dimension and you're not gonna stop us from getting the truth
[2:13:43.780 --> 2:13:55.620]  out do you understand me it's simple when you go out to a lake
[2:13:59.700 --> 2:14:02.580]  and there's rocks in certain spots they put place bullies on them
[2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:10.580]  but in this modern world they've removed all the buoys and they tell you take all the psychotropic
[2:14:10.580 --> 2:14:16.260]  smoke all the marijuana do whatever you want have a good time and i'm a libertarian i think you
[2:14:16.260 --> 2:14:25.700]  shouldn't go to prison for it but let me explain something i have known in the last 30 years
[2:14:28.180 --> 2:14:33.700]  about a third of the people that smoke marijuana on a routine basis becomes schizophrenic
[2:14:35.700 --> 2:14:39.460]  and i talked about that at court one time when they brought up to ever smoke marijuana and i said
[2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:45.140]  yeah about once a year to test it and everybody thought that was funny i don't like it i don't
[2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:49.860]  like feeling fear i never feel fear unless i smoke marijuana then i get all paranoid a lot of folks
[2:14:49.860 --> 2:14:56.340]  have that effect but i said that marijuana in some studies is up to 60 to 70 sometimes a hundred
[2:14:56.340 --> 2:15:02.980]  times stronger than say mexican brown weed folks were smoking in the 60s had to smoke two joints to
[2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:07.780]  get a buzz they said in the marijuana george washington was smoking his pipe for a toothache
[2:15:07.780 --> 2:15:17.460]  it's got a lot of great effects it is a brain damaging weapon now schizophrenia and marijuana
[2:15:17.460 --> 2:15:27.780]  trigger a treatment and folks i know so many people who become full-blown paranoid lunatics
[2:15:27.780 --> 2:15:32.500]  on marijuana i'm gonna take your calls in last segment with the marijuana stuff but just like
[2:15:32.500 --> 2:15:36.180]  i told you 20-something years ago aspartame's eating people's brains it was in the study
[2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:41.860]  this is serious and the marijuana is genetically engineered now it's weaponized and you can take

[2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:16.580]  ingredients and they're all organic root things like that that i trust you know because i've seen
[2:19:16.580 --> 2:19:20.340]  a lot of other vitamins they don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're
[2:19:20.340 --> 2:19:24.020]  often not things that are natural i appreciate that well what happened with ultimate female force
[2:19:24.020 --> 2:19:27.620]  tell us about it well it's really great you know it's like a multi vitamin i take it it tastes
[2:19:27.620 --> 2:19:31.860]  good it doesn't have that nasty aftertaste it actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and
[2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:35.380]  you know it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day so i really like it well
[2:19:35.380 --> 2:19:39.860]  just so you know we look at whatever the best herbs are they're known to turbo charge women
[2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:46.340]  and then we get the organic ones and put it in it so yeah stamina libido energy these are amazing
[2:19:46.340 --> 2:19:51.620]  things and ultimate female force so i'm glad you plugged it in four store dot com or triple eight
[2:19:51.620 --> 2:20:07.540]  two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:15.460 --> 2:20:19.140]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're going to write to your phone calls right now
[2:20:19.140 --> 2:20:22.900]  and then i'm going to get later in the next segment just for a minute or so
[2:20:23.460 --> 2:20:28.980]  Nigel Farage has been attacked all over the european union in the financial times of london
[2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:38.260]  in the guardian that's right for association with good old alex jones because now that facebook
[2:20:38.260 --> 2:20:44.420]  has waved her magic wand instead of a terrorist and anti-semite what anyone ever talked to is
[2:20:44.420 --> 2:20:50.340]  see how the lie just dominos what a criminal group of people right now let's go to phone
[2:20:50.340 --> 2:20:55.860]  calls we're going to everybody on the board here let's go to brie brie calling from the great state
[2:20:55.860 --> 2:21:04.100]  of samalia i'm sorry the great state of saudi arabia i'm sorry the great state of minnesota
[2:21:04.100 --> 2:21:11.700]  you're on the year welcome brie thank you welcome yeah so um i think one thing that's
[2:21:11.700 --> 2:21:17.620]  really important here is we're trying to get people informed about what's going on and between
[2:21:17.620 --> 2:21:21.940]  censorship and people not getting accurate information i think it's really important for
[2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:28.580]  people to continue to connect with each other on an individual basis um because you know part of
[2:21:29.380 --> 2:21:34.980]  achieving their agendas is you know people in power separating the people from each other
[2:21:34.980 --> 2:21:40.020]  and creating divisiveness and that's you know is is how they're going to get what they want um
[2:21:40.020 --> 2:21:47.300]  and i think in that too there's a real opportunity to find common language and specifically you know
[2:21:47.300 --> 2:21:54.100]  comes to mind um when you have people advocating for abortion rights there's the slogan of you
[2:21:54.100 --> 2:22:00.580]  know my my body my choice hands off my body well how about hands off my brain hands off my mind
[2:22:01.140 --> 2:22:09.220]  um i have a real problem with people saying what ideas are appropriate for my you know feeble lady
[2:22:09.220 --> 2:22:15.060]  brain to be consuming that i was about to say how how elitist how cultic is it to have facebook and
[2:22:15.060 --> 2:22:19.620]  others saying you can't say alex jones you can't look at a site unless it's negative you're too
[2:22:19.620 --> 2:22:27.460]  weak-minded we the elite are going to tell you what you can see that is so cultic it's it's ridiculous
[2:22:27.460 --> 2:22:34.260]  and it's completely an affront to our freedom of speech and our constitution and what our
[2:22:34.260 --> 2:22:39.460]  country was built on and a precious price has been paid for us to live in a land with those
[2:22:39.460 --> 2:22:46.820]  rights i mean every soldier sailor and marine who's ever sacrificed served has paid a price to
[2:22:46.820 --> 2:22:52.500]  uphold that for you every person in parts of the world who has been born lived and died under
[2:22:52.500 --> 2:22:59.780]  bondage true bondage and oppression not mild inconvenience and offense the sense now you're
[2:22:59.780 --> 2:23:06.660]  right it is totally over the top for me what is it like to watch all those newscasts cnn ms nbc abc
[2:23:06.660 --> 2:23:11.940]  new shane ban them shut them up gag them i and a lot of times they want us arrested they want us
[2:23:11.940 --> 2:23:19.300]  imprisoned they they are flaming authoritarians it's awful and and we have to we have to stand
[2:23:19.300 --> 2:23:25.300]  up for each other not just those that we we agree with but you have to reach out and and
[2:23:25.300 --> 2:23:32.020]  express that you're standing up for all people's right to stay what they want because it's well
[2:23:32.020 --> 2:23:36.260]  brie it sounds like you're a classical americana liberal we don't have room for you god bless
[2:23:36.260 --> 2:23:39.540]  you and i appreciate your call it's just crazy how in america this is how dangerous it is
[2:23:40.260 --> 2:23:47.620]  communist china last year last january almost a year and a half ago now praised the quote fake news
[2:23:47.620 --> 2:23:52.820]  movement and banning conservatives and people i mean it's insane again the german president
[2:23:52.820 --> 2:23:56.580]  it just came out and said ban all populist just ban everybody
[2:23:59.140 --> 2:24:05.780]  incredible let's go ahead and talk to another fine lady christin in the great state of
[2:24:06.900 --> 2:24:12.980]  governor qualmo go ahead hi elix i'm a listener for the last three years i love you show thank
[2:24:12.980 --> 2:24:18.180]  you for calling you stand for thank you ma'am i just want to answer you you put out the question
[2:24:18.180 --> 2:24:24.820]  about what can we do how do we get to trump what do we need to get these techno crap companies under
[2:24:24.820 --> 2:24:31.620]  control well one thing we need is term limits for all these people who make a life out of serving
[2:24:31.620 --> 2:24:38.100]  people that they don't serve they they get money they have backdoor deals we have no say in our
[2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:44.980]  government i live in new york i am surrounded by people who think that they know what the
[2:24:44.980 --> 2:24:50.820]  constitution stands for and it's a disgrace and i'm ready to leave but i have my family i have my
[2:24:50.820 --> 2:24:57.380]  job and it really no i understand i mean i saw numbers that 42 percent of people living in new
[2:24:57.380 --> 2:25:01.220]  york city they said they want to get out in the next year something like 30 percent of the people
[2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:06.580]  in the state it's a beautiful state in many areas a great american pastime at new york when i get
[2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:10.580]  there i feel a lot of energy i have a good feeling in the city i feel like i'm gonna die in la and
[2:25:10.580 --> 2:25:16.340]  in san francisco but but i mean new york has its evil but it also has its good and you know you
[2:25:16.340 --> 2:25:20.580]  saw governor qualmo say last year if your pro life or pro gun get out of the state what are they
[2:25:20.580 --> 2:25:25.220]  going to do as everybody that's a producer leaves they admit it's already falling apart what are
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:31.060]  they thinking he just legalized killing already-born babies that's right and and we're a pro gun family
[2:25:31.060 --> 2:25:36.420]  we're a pro constitution family my family's been here for generations why do i have to leave
[2:25:36.420 --> 2:25:41.860]  why doesn't he represent the people he's supposed to be serving all of us not just the select that he
[2:25:42.580 --> 2:25:47.220]  takes money from and has deals with did you see when they signed that bill to kill babies after
[2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:52.260]  they're born how he and others literally almost had an orgasm and smiled and laughed like they just
[2:25:52.260 --> 2:25:56.180]  want to be laughing and cheering who are they what are they cheering for the decimation it was a
[2:25:56.180 --> 2:26:01.460]  demonic celebration he looked like the gremlins uh from i am legend remember that tom cruise movie
[2:26:01.460 --> 2:26:10.420]  yes they literally have it's gonna be sweet as power when i kill that unicorn
[2:26:11.460 --> 2:26:18.580]  that baby that innocence i mean they are the art type old demons you cannot but you know there's
[2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:23.220]  a consensus forming that they're demons everybody i know now everybody from you name it goes they're
[2:26:23.220 --> 2:26:27.140]  demons they're literal demons i know i know people that were atheists who now believe that these
[2:26:27.140 --> 2:26:31.540]  people are demon possessed because they used to know people who were normal liberals and now they're
[2:26:31.540 --> 2:26:39.380]  like i like to kill babies what do you think's happened to these people i i think that i agree
[2:26:39.380 --> 2:26:45.060]  with you i think they are possessed i think there's something really going on under the whole spiritual
[2:26:45.060 --> 2:26:50.020]  realm and we are in trouble and if we don't stick together and we can't get the word to trump we need
[2:26:50.020 --> 2:26:55.700]  some kind of an executive order that puts some of these politicians will get on it and they will
[2:26:55.700 --> 2:27:01.620]  serve for term limits but the rest of them will never vote for term limits when it's their job on
[2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:09.220]  the line i mean look at what they do they make a lifetime 35 years in congress 40 years what what is
[2:27:09.220 --> 2:27:14.820]  this it's a nightmare it's a nightmare we need these people here we're not just demonizing them
[2:27:16.180 --> 2:27:20.580]  i go to democratic events and i used to go to democrat events when i was anti-war which i still
[2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:24.100]  am but it's offensive and i wasn't for the republicans or democrats they were still a little
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:29.460]  neurotic and a little weird and worshiping it radical islam and still pro-abortion and and
[2:27:29.460 --> 2:27:34.580]  and like the men were all real weird and the women were weird and and but but but but still
[2:27:34.580 --> 2:27:39.060]  there wasn't an open demonicness there were some nice people you go to democrat events now you're
[2:27:39.060 --> 2:27:46.260]  like are we at a body snatcher convention because i mean they're almost all look like they escaped
[2:27:46.260 --> 2:27:51.300]  from a mental institution i don't feel good seeing them like that i don't feel elitist something
[2:27:51.300 --> 2:27:55.620]  happened to them they're all on medication i think they're all under pharmaceutical
[2:27:56.340 --> 2:28:01.620]  medication and they are being controlled i can't even have conversation with some family members
[2:28:01.620 --> 2:28:07.220]  they're out of control they can't sit down and have a normal conversation based on facts discussing
[2:28:07.220 --> 2:28:11.620]  things that are important what if the founding fathers never sat down and had a conversation
[2:28:11.620 --> 2:28:17.140]  our country would never be what it is today and this is what a disgrace it's become it's become
[2:28:17.140 --> 2:28:21.540]  oh it's you can't talk about politics you can't talk about religion you can't what am i supposed
[2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:27.380]  to talk about the Kardashians this is important this is not important and this is what they've
[2:28:27.380 --> 2:28:33.060]  made our country into it's almost a partial joke and i'm sad to say that because i love america
[2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:38.740]  and i love my country and i feel like where it's being stolen from us right from under our feet
[2:28:38.740 --> 2:28:43.700]  right from under our feet and i'm fed up and i know many people are fed up but some people

[2:34:23.860 --> 2:34:31.060]  the story but I'm just telling you how popular freedom is folks how popular freedom is you know
[2:34:31.060 --> 2:34:36.580]  Matthew Bellamy's a huge listener woke him up had him on the show a few times and then a couple years
[2:34:36.580 --> 2:34:41.700]  after that it doesn't matter that he's a rock star but they do make some great music like that one
[2:34:41.700 --> 2:34:47.860]  song he does about uh never use that as bumper music what's that famous Bellamy song music where
[2:34:47.860 --> 2:34:55.780]  it's about uh rise up take the power back that was all inspired by info wars and his own great
[2:34:55.780 --> 2:35:01.140]  brain but then they threatened his future record contracts and being able to sing at stadiums
[2:35:01.140 --> 2:35:08.500]  so he renounced us not in the mean way just said well I'm not that now that's fine but Ted
[2:35:08.500 --> 2:35:13.460]  Nugent didn't Ted Nugent would make 15 to 20 million dollars more a year said he basically
[2:35:13.460 --> 2:35:18.660]  just breaks even it takes everybody because he can't sing at any corporate event he has to go
[2:35:18.660 --> 2:35:25.220]  at vfw's or city-owned Coliseum's because he's pro-guine she and I'm just saying think about
[2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:30.420]  what we have to pay in this matter in this country how we have to be bankrupted to have free speech
[2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:38.180]  see again blame Bellamy what what is that music song uprising let's play some now we come back
[2:35:38.180 --> 2:35:42.740]  to make the next segment but let's go to your calls right now now I just took two calls gave
[2:35:42.740 --> 2:35:47.140]  them both like 10 minutes you're awesome folks great callers we got to give each person like
[2:35:47.140 --> 2:35:51.380]  a minute and a half we won't get to everybody so I'm gonna go to nick who's been holding the longest
[2:35:51.380 --> 2:35:57.220]  then Dave then Keith I'll just go right through who's been holding the longest nick in michigan
[2:35:57.220 --> 2:36:02.260]  thanks for calling you're on the air welcome hi mr. Joel it's honor to talk to you it's the first
[2:36:02.260 --> 2:36:08.500]  time callers well honor to talk to you man um I just want to do uh you asked the question about
[2:36:08.500 --> 2:36:12.580]  what trump and congress is going to be doing you think about this whole big tech situation
[2:36:13.220 --> 2:36:18.980]  and in my honest opinion I know it is it is really really messed up right now with it just
[2:36:18.980 --> 2:36:23.220]  every it's the silence thing and everything but I'm telling you I think it's going to get
[2:36:23.780 --> 2:36:29.780]  even worse within the next two years of course I think once and once trump it is reelected which
[2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:35.700]  will god willing happen I do think that that's when he is going to finally make a move on it but
[2:36:35.700 --> 2:36:41.220]  right now with everything else that's going on and I mean there's just there's just so much going on
[2:36:41.220 --> 2:36:45.380]  it and I mean don't get me wrong it's no I agree that's the thinking at the winehouse it's starting
[2:36:45.380 --> 2:36:49.780]  to change because they run arrogant headlines in the Atlantic that trumps too weak Facebook doesn't
[2:36:49.780 --> 2:36:55.060]  listen to him Facebook knows it can just ignore and push Trump around that's the headline this is
[2:36:55.060 --> 2:37:00.420]  not just censorship on private platforms it's racketeering it's intimidation it's letting CNN
[2:37:00.420 --> 2:37:07.300]  into people's phones to see what apps they have it's a leftist terrorism with privatized NSA
[2:37:07.300 --> 2:37:14.020]  interfaces through these big tech companies set up by the NSA and Incutel that our government
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:18.900]  set these all up and let private people run them trump hasn't been given all that info it's why
[2:37:18.900 --> 2:37:23.380]  they're scared he's starting to win because once he gets full understanding he'll understand
[2:37:23.380 --> 2:37:27.540]  we've not really been a free market economy we are quasi we're a controlled market free market
[2:37:27.540 --> 2:37:34.180]  economy and our government and our people set all that up through DARPA and when they become
[2:37:34.180 --> 2:37:39.220]  destructive of the aims of the internet and my DARPA set it up they can be relinquished so I hear
[2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:43.540]  you and I appreciate your call but it's bigger than censorship it's organized election meddling
[2:37:43.540 --> 2:37:50.180]  and racketeering and I'm asking what do we do Trump must make it the central issue or he's going
[2:37:50.180 --> 2:37:54.900]  to lose because they're going to engage in fraud and he won't have a grassroots to communicate
[2:37:54.900 --> 2:38:02.980]  when they steal it up next Dave in Nevada Dave thanks for holding it on the air go ahead
[2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:10.100]  hey Alex how you doing good buddy hey I just wanted to talk to you about uh maybe something
[2:38:10.100 --> 2:38:17.460]  you should do is call the bluff let's just let him put his tax returns out if all these states want
[2:38:17.460 --> 2:38:24.580]  to let him be off the ballot because he won't return or put his tax returns out put them out
[2:38:24.580 --> 2:38:29.700]  there and then call for everybody else because fair game is fair game oh that democrat bill to do
[2:38:29.700 --> 2:38:33.220]  that's not going to go anywhere people's people to keep their tax returns private they want to
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:37.620]  harass everybody's ever done business with he has complex tax returns because you own real estate
[2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:42.340]  each one has to be to the jurisdiction and it's just a total harassment what about Hillary and
[2:38:42.340 --> 2:38:47.380]  her foundation and four billion dollars from foreign governments how about you and die her ass then
[2:38:47.380 --> 2:38:52.340]  let's talk about his tax returns from 20 years ago Dave appreciate the call or move it faster
[2:38:52.340 --> 2:38:58.420]  I'm sure by calling in Jennifer in Michigan you're on the air go ahead hello Alex good welcome thank
[2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:05.700]  you for taking my call thank you we are under spiritual attack I believe that I have it has
[2:39:05.700 --> 2:39:12.180]  to be coming from the game inside and it's a cult I'm not joining their cult I'm standing up with you
[2:39:12.180 --> 2:39:17.140]  Alex I think that what you're doing is spot on you are telling the truth I can't even imagine
[2:39:17.140 --> 2:39:25.780]  the attacks that you must be under but I believe that President Trump should attack with the law
[2:39:25.780 --> 2:39:33.300]  we as a country agreed we have a law as a spiritual being as a people in our third dimension as you
[2:39:33.300 --> 2:39:40.340]  say we must abide by certain laws and they are you you start being the power in many ways as you know
[2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:50.180]  and I live close to Ann Arbor in Michigan and I'm going to go to as many democratic all of these
[2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:55.620]  conventions I'm going to go and I'm going to blast them with the info wars by the way let me just
[2:39:55.620 --> 2:39:59.620]  say this over the years I love all the states we've always had disproportionate calls from
[2:39:59.620 --> 2:40:05.620]  Michigan for your population Michigan's the second state we get calls from Texas is the number one
[2:40:05.620 --> 2:40:10.580]  but it's the most second most populace that makes sense Michigan is just full of good people
[2:40:10.580 --> 2:40:14.820]  outside of Detroit Detroit's got some good people too just look at the democrats ruin that amazing
[2:40:14.820 --> 2:40:20.500]  city and just god bless you I hear what you're saying it's all happening and they're racketeering

[2:40:25.940 --> 2:40:29.860]  going to have a five billion dollar fine and then facebook's allowed to spy forever illegally
[2:40:29.860 --> 2:40:33.380]  when they made hundreds of billions off americans and republicans are saying making a 20 billion
[2:40:33.380 --> 2:40:39.780]  dollar fine who cares about the damn fine facebook is engaged like they bragged three years ago
[2:40:39.780 --> 2:40:43.700]  working for the democratic party and other governments they're out of control and they
[2:40:43.700 --> 2:40:49.380]  lied to congress about it there's a thousand ways to break their back and it's time to happen

[2:50:30.260 --> 2:50:33.860]  you knew it was coming ladies and gentlemen you know i was in an airport flying back from
[2:50:33.860 --> 2:50:39.940]  doing joe rogan's podcast in la and it was early morning i was getting some breakfast
[2:50:39.940 --> 2:50:44.100]  wait for the flight and i heard that song come on i'm like man what's that band who is that
[2:50:44.900 --> 2:50:48.260]  that's right 10 years ago like oh mesi bellamy i talked to him on a bunch of phone he came on
[2:50:48.260 --> 2:50:52.020]  the show a few times he listened to the show every day he said you inspired me to write this
[2:50:52.020 --> 2:50:56.100]  whole album these songs you know billy corgan still is a fan i inspired like four or five of his
[2:50:56.100 --> 2:51:01.060]  albums he's a great guy and i'm not bragging about that but i'm saying it's continually going back
[2:51:01.060 --> 2:51:08.580]  and seeing how we that's all of us you have been the epicenter of the change i'm a train wreck
[2:51:08.580 --> 2:51:14.180]  sometimes i'm unlistable it doesn't matter we have been anointed by god for this mission
[2:51:15.220 --> 2:51:20.660]  and i i knew it 30 years ago i had to get on air 25 years ago i got on air and i knew the mission
[2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:26.900]  was i'm not going to be the leader i don't want to be the leader i'm preparing the way for the
[2:51:26.900 --> 2:51:32.820]  leaders god was so clear you will prepare the way for the leaders you will lay the ground
[2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:38.100]  you will take on the enemy you will awaken the people you will be the paul revere and you will
[2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:44.740]  get other paul revere to take action and i just and god literally told me you execute this operation
[2:51:44.740 --> 2:51:49.380]  if you're willing to get destroyed in the end you will carry this out and we will win and it's happened
[2:51:52.020 --> 2:51:56.020]  it is a william barrett travis type mission that's a good point i'm not bragging about this folks
[2:51:56.020 --> 2:52:00.900]  the enemy knows the office that we're all in the office you're in as americans to the whole world
[2:52:01.460 --> 2:52:05.780]  a message of freedom a message the enemy wants to snuff out this is powerful
[2:52:05.780 --> 2:52:12.500]  and everything you do like a rock and a pond changes the world you think big tech wants to
[2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:19.460]  silence you to make you feel weak you're not weak because they've silenced you you're powerful
[2:52:19.460 --> 2:52:24.420]  that's why they've silenced you because you love god and justice all right key sorry i'm ranting
[2:52:24.420 --> 2:52:29.220]  finish up your point about uh big tech how should the president counter how should we counter
[2:52:29.220 --> 2:52:34.900]  all right um yeah i think uh he definitely needs to do something hopefully by the end
[2:52:34.900 --> 2:52:39.780]  of this year because you know the elections next year i know he planned on waiting until uh after
[2:52:39.780 --> 2:52:44.820]  the election but he better not because we need all we need info wars now the media is saying he's
[2:52:44.820 --> 2:52:48.660]  ahead in the polls he was always ahead in the polls the fact that they're saying he's invincible
[2:52:48.660 --> 2:52:52.740]  is to make him go to sleep he knows that he said the only way the democrats can win is cheating
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:57.140]  he knows that well they're gonna cheat mr president so you better give it to him with
[2:52:57.140 --> 2:53:05.220]  both political barrels now strike now no more waiting yep all right uh well thanks for taking
[2:53:05.220 --> 2:53:11.460]  my call everybody buy his product keep him online and uh take care of alex just keep us on air long
[2:53:11.460 --> 2:53:16.020]  enough to complete the mission and i know we'll be here a while longer but and i don't just say this
[2:53:16.020 --> 2:53:22.900]  people for me say this for like 15 years i i i god told me you will be destroyed in the end
[2:53:22.900 --> 2:53:29.380]  i mean that means physically that doesn't mean i will be they i'm not trying to make this come
[2:53:29.380 --> 2:53:33.380]  true i just have known this i god said you're gonna do all this but you're gonna have to go through
[2:53:33.380 --> 2:53:38.820]  a lot of pain and it's gonna get real bad but in the end you're gonna salt the earth and that means
[2:53:38.820 --> 2:53:43.060]  our whole audience looks like you've gone through a lot this is a mission this is a good mission
[2:53:43.060 --> 2:53:48.260]  and we take the power from the enemy when they bankrupt us or kill us or imprison us when we
[2:53:48.260 --> 2:53:53.460]  still do it for god and the unborn for what's right we circumnavigate their fraud and their
[2:53:53.460 --> 2:53:59.300]  worldly system and say we don't care about what you do to this body it's the soul right here that
[2:53:59.300 --> 2:54:05.700]  matters forever all right let's go back to the calls here this is epic stuff ladies and gentlemen
[2:54:06.580 --> 2:54:12.900]  epic times to be alive incredible times to be alive who's been holding longest now let's go to
[2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:20.420]  you bob in new york bob thanks for holding go ahead hey alex welcome brother bless you man
[2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:25.460]  god bless you your staff and thank you so much for the resources that you commit to this whole
[2:54:25.460 --> 2:54:29.460]  thing that's really something that people don't it's your resources brother i'm just trying to be
[2:54:29.460 --> 2:54:34.020]  a good steward of them yeah you know i support you i buy a lot of stuff but i didn't want to talk
[2:54:34.020 --> 2:54:39.300]  about that i mean i wanted to talk to you about a couple things i mean duke when you had david duke
[2:54:39.300 --> 2:54:44.420]  on i can't believe he gave him that much air time he just kept digging the hole for himself
[2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:49.140]  and then when he went on pierce morgan uh i was like that's how we're supposed to go on television
[2:54:49.140 --> 2:54:55.540]  he's supposed to take over the airways and that's the importance of of uh freedom of speech i mean
[2:54:55.540 --> 2:55:02.580]  if they take away your voice you can't do that well i went to duke to have him on because they
[2:55:02.580 --> 2:55:07.860]  were asking to come on the same way i went to fair con to try to like create racial unity and i was
[2:55:07.860 --> 2:55:13.140]  like saying really shouldn't we just you know the average jew is not to get to the average black person
[2:55:13.140 --> 2:55:17.620]  and i was just like you know this is all program he just he was robotic and wouldn't listen to me
[2:55:17.620 --> 2:55:22.420]  fair con was like absolutely let's do it all that's why they ignored the fair con interview
[2:55:22.420 --> 2:55:25.940]  and promoted the duke interview and i'm not promoting fair con because he's black and duke's
[2:55:25.940 --> 2:55:32.340]  duke's a white guy duke's a very well-spoken very smart guy the point is is that it was very
[2:55:32.340 --> 2:55:37.940]  synthetic it was like i was talking to a robot i know and uh you know now we're never at the point
[2:55:37.940 --> 2:55:43.060]  though if they if they cut off uh twitter or facebook goes down for a little while i mean they can
[2:55:43.060 --> 2:55:48.580]  really uh enact like operation gladio in a in a bad way and you know i mean you're talking about
[2:55:48.580 --> 2:55:54.580]  eight minutes of something being misconstrued or or delayed i mean or day or three hours you know
[2:55:54.580 --> 2:56:00.340]  they can really do start a race war um oh that's their plan and fair con's worried about that
[2:56:00.340 --> 2:56:03.220]  and they take things he says out of context and i'm not the fitting everything he ever said
[2:56:03.220 --> 2:56:09.860]  i'm the fit everything i ever said but fair con he had a very strong will very loving and you
[2:56:09.860 --> 2:56:13.300]  couldn't help but fit one of the most probably the most charming person because you're one of those
[2:56:13.300 --> 2:56:17.700]  people that have those presence and you know he's an old guy now still had a very powerful presence
[2:56:18.260 --> 2:56:24.500]  um and and and he was i i didn't get he was looking for me for leadership and like how to
[2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:28.660]  stop a race war i was just there listening to him and at the end he was kind of frustrated
[2:56:28.660 --> 2:56:32.100]  because i didn't tell him what i thought he should do but it's kind of hard you're sitting there with
[2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:35.540]  like a guy like that tell him what he should do that's why i'm gonna go meet with fair con again
[2:56:35.540 --> 2:56:39.300]  and have a real meeting with him uh and i'm not defending some things he said some of it's out of
[2:56:39.300 --> 2:56:44.740]  context the point is he is not even a closeted trump supporter he told me point blank and i said
[2:56:44.740 --> 2:56:48.900]  is that for public consumption he said yeah but he said i'll support trump in some of his aspects
[2:56:48.900 --> 2:56:54.180]  if he does the right thing i know the enemy hates him but uh and and he thought that i could get a
[2:56:54.180 --> 2:56:59.300]  message to trump and the times i thought the trump ever brought up was fair con but imagine if loose
[2:56:59.300 --> 2:57:05.460]  fair con came out and support trump you know they didn't just throw him in as a token uh other person
[2:57:05.460 --> 2:57:10.260]  you know leftist or whatever to make it look like the band wasn't of conservatives they know he's
[2:57:10.260 --> 2:57:15.380]  behind conye west co and public i'm letting out something big there that's who's behind it's loose
[2:57:15.380 --> 2:57:22.660]  fair con they know loose fair con he gets it is changing with the times that's what he's selling
[2:57:22.660 --> 2:57:29.220]  out and i'm not even defending loose fair con i'm saying the enemy with their ai computers
[2:57:29.940 --> 2:57:37.220]  and their you know what systems have sat there and portended jones must be shut down fair con
[2:57:37.220 --> 2:57:42.260]  must be shut down watson must be shut down all the wildcards stay with us we'll be right back

[2:57:48.660 --> 2:57:54.180]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate
[2:57:54.180 --> 2:58:00.580]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[2:58:00.580 --> 2:58:06.980]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:12.900]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[2:58:12.900 --> 2:58:18.260]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast
[2:58:18.260 --> 2:58:23.620]  acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[2:58:23.620 --> 2:58:29.060]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it
[2:58:29.060 --> 2:58:34.660]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and

[3:00:07.380 --> 3:00:12.500]  as your calls you can and then poll watch is coming up with huge news on the first amendment we knew
[3:00:12.500 --> 3:00:17.380]  it was coming wait till you hear this next segment really important information i told you their main
[3:00:17.380 --> 3:00:22.180]  enemy what wait we called it not hard they told they told us what they were going after but
[3:00:22.180 --> 3:00:27.940]  it's happening give alex jones all the attention is a diversion we're an important enemy to the
[3:00:27.940 --> 3:00:31.540]  globalist but then move on to everybody that's coming up next segment okay let's go through
[3:00:31.540 --> 3:00:36.900]  these right now who's been holding the longest next year that would be kenan and then wendy
[3:00:36.900 --> 3:00:41.700]  kenan and texas you're on the here thanks for holding hey are you doing alex good brother put
[3:00:41.700 --> 3:00:47.060]  me on hey uh i want to point out that sometimes the obvious is not obvious and i think that if
[3:00:47.060 --> 3:00:52.900]  people step back and and think about what i'm about to say that'll make perfect sense you know
[3:00:52.900 --> 3:00:59.300]  say albert pike had uh come up with a new order of 225 years ago so all the all this stuff has been
[3:00:59.300 --> 3:01:05.780]  pre written and pre planned out and what dawned on me the other day is that big tech was created
[3:01:05.780 --> 3:01:11.060]  by the deep state they've always been in 10 steps ahead of us on the invention of the
[3:01:11.060 --> 3:01:16.020]  computer and the internet the internet was created by the u.s. government and they knew
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:20.660]  that they were gonna need programs where people would just put their information out there for
[3:01:20.660 --> 3:01:25.460]  free where they could track people which sets the pressure that you have no privacy yes well
[3:01:25.460 --> 3:01:30.580]  they created these facemen i call it zuckerberg you know it's it's just not incidental that he's
[3:01:30.580 --> 3:01:36.820]  related to sorrows they say i think that dorsey and the the guy created youtube i think these are
[3:01:36.820 --> 3:01:42.420]  all fictional people that are popular in front of the public to make the public believe that
[3:01:42.420 --> 3:01:47.060]  these people create oh you're totally right darpa did all this but but now it's been hijacked
[3:01:47.060 --> 3:01:51.140]  given to china and that's what the u.s. government must take back control of it or is trump really
[3:01:51.140 --> 3:01:56.420]  going along with this and is he sandbagging us well and they use the fact that these companies
[3:01:56.420 --> 3:02:02.100]  are pride companies that's an excuse them to not regulate these companies that way they're not under
[3:02:02.100 --> 3:02:08.260]  foyer exactly that's right so whenever people know the gig is up that we've all been fooled into
[3:02:08.260 --> 3:02:13.620]  thinking that all of these websites was created that holds its private so we can spy on you and
[3:02:13.620 --> 3:02:17.860]  let oliver d'arcy in your phone and ban you making phone calls we can spy on you because we're
[3:02:17.860 --> 3:02:23.700]  private no it's all illegal it's all a load of crap right good deal well that's all i wanted to
[3:02:23.700 --> 3:02:28.020]  say i want to say a couple things about the products i've tried them all one recommendation
[3:02:28.020 --> 3:02:33.940]  is that i'd add some more paste to the toothpaste maybe put some uh baking powder in there because
[3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:39.300]  i think it liquefies a little before you're done brushing your teeth and the thing is i think your
[3:02:39.300 --> 3:02:44.820]  best product by far is the the knockout and i think if you were able to get this product on the
[3:02:44.820 --> 3:02:51.300]  counters of every convenience or um in the country that not only would destroy people to the website
[3:02:51.300 --> 3:02:58.020]  by you know finding the info info wars war dot com you know on the back that that product is so
[3:02:58.020 --> 3:03:04.900]  powerful i think that that product alone would fund the operation it's just a meeting no i agree
[3:03:04.900 --> 3:03:08.100]  with you we really should all do this might as a distributor to gas stations around the country
[3:03:08.100 --> 3:03:13.780]  give us a call we'll do it god bless you yeah i told the developers of of the the global silver
[3:03:13.780 --> 3:03:19.540]  iodine fortified and fluoride free toothpaste i said i don't want any fillers because they're like
[3:03:19.540 --> 3:03:24.180]  well half of toothpaste is fillers silicate and all these other things so people get used to
[3:03:25.300 --> 3:03:30.900]  sand in their toothpaste and we don't put but a little bit of that in there so you're actually
[3:03:30.900 --> 3:03:36.340]  getting nothing but what's actually in toothpaste so but it is very concentrated very strong
[3:03:36.340 --> 3:03:42.020]  doesn't take very much of it but i've actually via request just last week said to my dad is a
[3:03:42.020 --> 3:03:46.500]  retired role surgeon dentist i said let's put out a standard toothpaste with no floor of an iodine
[3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:52.180]  on a cold silver that's the classic paste you'll fit people like that i'm getting requests for that
[3:03:52.180 --> 3:04:01.860]  and but technically i guess we won't call you know i guess calcium or silicate or sand a filler i
[3:04:01.860 --> 3:04:06.420]  just you know we don't sell you a tube of sand like the average toothpaste is you know a half of
[3:04:06.420 --> 3:04:11.780]  its sand uh so i hear you it's a great point okay here's the deal we got 20 phone lines
[3:04:11.780 --> 3:04:16.260]  they got to like 20 calls and i want to get to wendy i want to get to shawn and we have to patrick
[3:04:16.260 --> 3:04:20.100]  ken and criss but paul watch has taken over so if you guys love open phones again tomorrow
[3:04:20.100 --> 3:04:26.340]  they call head of the line thank you for holding i really appreciate that paul watson is coming up
[3:04:26.340 --> 3:04:29.780]  on the other side i'm going to introduce him and read some of the new articles that are on info
[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:35.460]  wars dot com and news wars dot com i i challenged paul nine months ago we were getting banned i said
[3:04:35.460 --> 3:04:41.700]  you need to start your own stuff you need to you need to not be so he's totally loyal he didn't
[3:04:41.700 --> 3:04:47.140]  lead to his own thing because because he wanted to yeah i mean i thought that was good he did too
[3:04:47.140 --> 3:04:51.700]  he still does work for us he still works in force he's doing his own thing at summit dot news we're
[3:04:51.700 --> 3:04:59.300]  very excited about that i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship and
[3:04:59.300 --> 3:05:06.100]  i've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most
[3:05:06.100 --> 3:05:13.460]  suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[3:05:14.020 --> 3:05:18.820]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won
[3:05:20.020 --> 3:05:24.740]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what political action did
[3:05:24.740 --> 3:05:30.660]  it and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in fours now this
[3:05:30.660 --> 3:05:36.900]  is a fight about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away
[3:05:36.900 --> 3:05:42.740]  this country is in a war so again i want to thank you for what you've done but i want to remind you
[3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:45.860]  if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great
[3:05:45.860 --> 3:05:51.300]  products we have and fund us in the 360 wind we're dead in the water i'm in your hands you're in my
[3:05:51.300 --> 3:05:59.220]  hands info war store dot com thank you we've got it we're coming to you
[3:06:03.300 --> 3:06:13.460]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[3:06:13.460 --> 3:06:20.580]  all right the last few hours we've learned a lot the last few minutes we've learned even more
[3:06:20.580 --> 3:06:26.740]  i'm gonna have paul watson take over right now from summit.news he also does work for info wars.com
[3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:32.420]  and news wars.com but the motherships got big gaming blast holes in it it's important for
[3:06:33.060 --> 3:06:40.340]  folks to go out and procreate in the information war huge facebook hired former hillary press
[3:06:40.340 --> 3:06:46.100]  director to inform media of alex jones band that's big league politics.com tom papert very
[3:06:46.100 --> 3:06:50.980]  important paul watson's latest article on info wars.com you want to share it from news wars.com
[3:06:51.780 --> 3:06:56.900]  prison planet.com or summit.news because those don't get censored by the filters as much alex
[3:06:56.900 --> 3:07:02.660]  jones is a verboten word according to lord zuckerberg and others they all coordinate info wars
[3:07:02.660 --> 3:07:09.060]  is verboten so promote news wars.com summit.news prison planet.com still gets all the same info out
[3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:16.580]  and then word of mouth info wars is the battle cry first amendment instagram to fact check memes
[3:07:16.580 --> 3:07:21.060]  and paul and they got a lot of stuff to cover when we hit this first instagram to fact check
[3:07:21.060 --> 3:07:27.060]  and remove memes so remember they've got ai already at facebook that owns instagram in live time as
[3:07:27.060 --> 3:07:31.540]  soon as you say i like alex jones god bless alex jones it's banned just like they said they do
[3:07:31.540 --> 3:07:36.740]  or an info wars link then they threaten to ban you and they ban the link but people say jones
[3:07:36.740 --> 3:07:46.100]  jones alex or info wars verboten they can still get it through so they have 20 000 fact checkers
[3:07:46.100 --> 3:07:50.020]  hired by obama and hillary from the southern primary law center this is mainline news i'm not
[3:07:50.020 --> 3:07:54.980]  joking in your computer in your profile watching is totally criminal but why not you put up with
[3:07:54.980 --> 3:07:58.980]  alex in your house listening to you i mean it's all over the news they just do what they want
[3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:06.420]  they rule you and you put up with it so they're doing it but ai can't understand memes well you
[3:08:06.420 --> 3:08:11.460]  can't fact check a meme it's a joke like let's play the penguin thing again and let paul take over
[3:08:12.180 --> 3:08:18.260]  a meme is a joke i'm in the office in a meeting yesterday with some of the riders and crew
[3:08:18.260 --> 3:08:22.180]  and i said the globalists just want power to rape us they just want to dominate us for no reason
[3:08:22.180 --> 3:08:27.060]  they're mentally ill they don't want to build a civilization and kit daniel said like lion
[3:08:27.060 --> 3:08:32.820]  seals rape penguins and i said is that a joke he said no look it up i said god we ought to put
[3:08:32.820 --> 3:08:39.460]  zuckerberg's head on that and have it me and well the rest is right there obviously zuckerberg's not
[3:08:39.460 --> 3:08:45.460]  a seal he's obviously not physically raping me i'm not a king penguin it's a joke but remember
[3:08:45.460 --> 3:08:50.180]  trump said three months ago the first time he had football players at the white house he said because
[3:08:50.180 --> 3:08:57.140]  there was a government shutdown he said i have bought mile highs of hamburgers and cheeseburgers
[3:08:58.020 --> 3:09:02.180]  washington post said there was only a thousand hamburgers or whatever so it only went up a few
[3:09:02.180 --> 3:09:06.340]  hundreds feet it wasn't a mile high it was hyperbole
[3:09:08.580 --> 3:09:16.900]  again obviously they can fact check a meme and then say it's wrong this is them trying to put
[3:09:17.700 --> 3:09:23.700]  their snopes garbage onto jokes but even when something's 100 real and confirmed
[3:09:23.700 --> 3:09:28.900]  snopes says it isn't happening so we're going to play this piece and let paul take over here
[3:09:28.900 --> 3:09:33.860]  as we go to break in a few minutes info wars dot com news wars dot com our new product is in
[3:09:33.860 --> 3:09:37.780]  twice as strong same high quality but look a bottleman highest quality you can get
[3:09:38.740 --> 3:09:43.940]  ultra 12 twice as strong for the same price 50 off right now one of our top products info wars
[3:09:43.940 --> 3:09:48.660]  life dot com go read the five star reviews of secret 12 all for 12 is the same thing just twice
[3:09:48.660 --> 3:09:55.300]  as strong info wars store dot com enforce life dot com thumb it in soros and hillary's face spread
[3:09:55.300 --> 3:10:04.340]  the links but let's go to this satire piece satire piece zuckerberg's not a 3 000 pound seal i'm not
[3:10:04.340 --> 3:10:11.620]  a king penguin this is an allegory here it is and this shocking footage is even more painful
[3:10:11.620 --> 3:10:19.300]  when you see the albatrosses of cnn and other msm outlets shearing on the rape in fact it's been
[3:10:19.300 --> 3:10:26.420]  found that these systems actually direct the monstrous seal zuckerberg against the free speech
[3:10:26.420 --> 3:10:33.060]  enemies and anyone that tries to not submit but most sad of all is other penguins in the independent
[3:10:33.060 --> 3:10:39.540]  media simply looking up in the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright
[3:10:39.540 --> 3:10:45.460]  taking place right in front of them this is pure gold the full videos on info wars dot com
[3:10:45.460 --> 3:10:50.900]  but again just like the EU is trying to pass laws and has passed laws to restrict memes to restrict
[3:10:50.900 --> 3:10:56.820]  humor to restrict alex jones you can't say his name paul is there no end to this this is this is
[3:10:56.820 --> 3:11:06.260]  beyond 1984 a thousand levels it really is like bonkers siege mentality at the moment alex the
[3:11:06.260 --> 3:11:12.180]  point about that is you can have a steven colbert or a bill more that can have his serious news
[3:11:12.180 --> 3:11:16.180]  commentary and that's treated seriously and then the rest of the time he can joke and that's treated
[3:11:16.180 --> 3:11:22.660]  as satire if you put out a joke or a meme or a piece of satire they treat that as serious and
[3:11:22.660 --> 3:11:28.020]  then when you have your serious separate opinion on the side of that they treat that as a joke
[3:11:28.020 --> 3:11:33.780]  anyone on the right can't joke they make these accusations all day long about how the right
[3:11:33.780 --> 3:11:39.940]  is terrible at comedy and when anyone on the right attempts to do comedy they take that as serious
[3:11:39.940 --> 3:11:44.820]  like the prop media matters will probably be publishing an article within the hour saying
[3:11:44.820 --> 3:11:51.060]  that you seriously claims that you got raped by mark zuckerberg after he transmogrified into a
[3:11:51.060 --> 3:11:56.260]  sea lion because we can't have jokes we can't have our memes and that's the point of this article
[3:11:56.260 --> 3:12:02.340]  which is upon info wars dot common summit dot news which is instagram has now announced that it's
[3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:09.460]  going to fact check memes and by that they mean they're going to classify something as erroneous
[3:12:09.460 --> 3:12:15.140]  misleading and they're going to prevent it from appearing in people's feeds people who are randomly
[3:12:15.140 --> 3:12:21.460]  on instagram has banned this meme zuckerberg is not a three thousand pound seal raping a penguin
[3:12:21.460 --> 3:12:27.940]  zuckerberg did not rape a penguin yeah no they do it in snopes there was a what was it the
[3:12:27.940 --> 3:12:34.500]  babel on b came out which is a satire website it says in its description this is a satire website
[3:12:34.500 --> 3:12:39.860]  and snopes takes one of their articles and fact checks it and says this is fake news yeah it's
[3:12:39.860 --> 3:12:45.780]  from a satire website you're going to start fact checking the onion dot com this is the level
[3:12:45.780 --> 3:12:53.140]  and they've hired 52 global fact checking partners to censor false photos and memes
[3:12:53.140 --> 3:12:58.100]  on the platform and of course when you look into it and this was in the pointer institute
[3:12:58.100 --> 3:13:04.740]  which recently just a few days ago had to shut down its own database highlighting unreliable
[3:13:04.740 --> 3:13:10.260]  news sites because that database was unreliable so they claim that they've got all the credibility
[3:13:10.260 --> 3:13:15.380]  and they're going to be the judge jury and executioner of your credibility listen i had
[3:13:15.380 --> 3:13:20.660]  news guard a couple of days ago saying oh we want to ask you a list of questions about how credible
[3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:25.860]  your news site is talking about summit dot news then they install the extension on the browser
[3:13:25.860 --> 3:13:31.220]  and they're trying to get windows to do it on the purchase of every new they want you to bow to
[3:13:31.220 --> 3:13:36.100]  them like they're the judge and jury they're the master oh neocons that told their wds in iraq that
[3:13:36.100 --> 3:13:41.300]  run news guard that's going to be on our browser controlling us yes master let me grovel to you
[3:13:41.300 --> 3:13:48.900]  improve i'm good oh like who would want another annoying browser extension anyway that told them
[3:13:48.900 --> 3:13:53.780]  what they needed to think about certain websites and certain news sources let people make their own
[3:13:53.780 --> 3:13:57.940]  damn mind up for god's sake so this is all going to backfire paul tell us tell us what
[3:13:57.940 --> 3:14:04.260]  else is coming up when you take over in the next segment well vice media was basically going bankrupt
[3:14:04.260 --> 3:14:08.900]  in fact they've had to amalgamate a bunch of their different sectors under one umbrella because
[3:14:08.900 --> 3:14:14.980]  they were going bankrupt like buzzfeed and cnn so now it turns out that vice media has raised
[3:14:14.980 --> 3:14:21.700]  250 million dollars in debt from investors including george soros isn't that interesting
[3:14:21.700 --> 3:14:26.740]  we don't get fat checks from george soros to rescue us do we alex when we have monetary problems
[3:14:26.740 --> 3:14:32.580]  but vice media despite the fact that it's a completely failing brand yet again gets another
[3:14:32.580 --> 3:14:38.340]  safety net from george soros who you can't even name now you can't even name george soros it means
[3:14:38.340 --> 3:14:43.620]  you're anti-semitic to even acknowledge that george soros contributes money and finances
[3:14:43.620 --> 3:14:48.980]  political movements across the world that's anti-semitic you can't say it so we've got all
[3:14:48.980 --> 3:14:55.300]  these rumors this is of course after buzzfeed had to lay off a bunch of people now rumors that cnn is
[3:14:55.300 --> 3:15:03.620]  about to lay off 300 people brian stelters out denying it but the the indications are not very
[3:15:03.620 --> 3:15:09.700]  good to cnn especially given the fact that they've lost 26 percent of their audience in the last year
[3:15:09.700 --> 3:15:15.780]  alone isn't that a coincidence given that they're now on the front lines of deplatforming censoring
[3:15:15.780 --> 3:15:21.460]  and banning their competition so we've got all these digital media outlets basically going bust
[3:15:21.460 --> 3:15:26.900]  but as they collapse they're trying to drag everyone else down with them by getting them
[3:15:26.900 --> 3:15:32.980]  banned on social media so we've got that of course we've got the big news about instagram
[3:15:32.980 --> 3:15:39.460]  we've got cnn headline asks how black will the royal baby be an absolute bizarre question
[3:15:39.460 --> 3:15:44.180]  they're saying that people who take this as a sign that race relations are in proofling are wrong
[3:15:44.180 --> 3:15:48.820]  it's not a good sign we need to be constantly at each other's throat constantly with that device
[3:15:48.820 --> 3:15:53.380]  of rhetoric we'll get into that and more on the next side of the alex joneshow info wars.com

[3:20:18.900 --> 3:20:31.220]  host paul joseph watson you're back live and one of the solutions to all this flagrant social media
[3:20:31.220 --> 3:20:39.460]  censorship right now well for the moment at least is a app called telegram now i signed up for this
[3:20:39.460 --> 3:20:47.380]  app last night so in less than 24 hours of signing up for this app i've got over 6000 followers the
[3:20:47.380 --> 3:20:52.420]  link and we're going to get a link up for alex as well as soon as possible i think there's already
[3:20:52.420 --> 3:21:02.020]  an info wars group on there but the link for me on telegram is t.me slash pjw news t.me
[3:21:02.020 --> 3:21:09.380]  slash pjw news so you can go there you can download the desktop application and you can download the
[3:21:09.380 --> 3:21:17.140]  app on your phone and it's basically like what twitter was in 2014 2015 fun you can say whatever
[3:21:17.140 --> 3:21:23.780]  you like without fear of getting banned and the reason for that is that it's owned by two russians
[3:21:24.420 --> 3:21:28.580]  and what a pathetic commentary that is on the state of free speech in the west
[3:21:28.580 --> 3:21:33.540]  that the fact that the one of the last remaining social media platforms available
[3:21:34.900 --> 3:21:39.940]  where you can have actual free speech is owned and run by russians interesting that isn't it
[3:21:40.740 --> 3:21:45.460]  similar to the vk website which i don't even use anymore but it's like the russian facebook
[3:21:45.460 --> 3:21:50.980]  never got banned on that i'm thinking of downloading weibo which is literally the
[3:21:50.980 --> 3:21:55.940]  communist chinese social media app probably be all right as long as you don't criticize the communist
[3:21:55.940 --> 3:22:02.180]  chinese government so a bunch of people who've been completely banned by every other social media
[3:22:02.180 --> 3:22:08.660]  network join telegram within the past few days and their follower rates are absolutely skyrocketing
[3:22:08.660 --> 3:22:14.580]  for the limited time they've been on there and guess what the daily beast did in response
[3:22:14.580 --> 3:22:20.980]  they wrote an article demanding that telegram ban these people headline laura luma and mylionopolis
[3:22:20.980 --> 3:22:27.860]  find life after facebook on telegram wil sommer who is basically the king of d platforming
[3:22:28.660 --> 3:22:33.300]  after facebook cracked down on right wing extremists last week many of the far right's
[3:22:33.300 --> 3:22:38.340]  loudest voices found themselves gravitating towards what appears to be their next digital home
[3:22:38.340 --> 3:22:42.740]  an encrypted messaging app previously known as a haven for terrorist recruiters
[3:22:42.740 --> 3:22:50.820]  so if you've used telegram you must be a terrorist recruiter right in the first paragraph they smear
[3:22:50.820 --> 3:22:57.140]  the users of this app who have been silenced on everything else in the same breath as terrorist
[3:22:57.140 --> 3:23:03.620]  recruiters these are the dirty smear merchants this is what they do telegram is a platform
[3:23:03.620 --> 3:23:09.060]  that allows users to offer short public facing posts akin to a twitter profile page god forbid
[3:23:09.060 --> 3:23:15.220]  this universe of users is much smaller however well it doesn't look to be that small given the
[3:23:15.220 --> 3:23:20.500]  amount of followers they've got in three days its user setup makes it harder for one to grow a
[3:23:20.500 --> 3:23:27.700]  following really well i've grown 6200 followers overnight so it's not too bad but for the purposes
[3:23:27.700 --> 3:23:31.940]  of those banished from the established platforms figures like anti-muslim activists laura luma
[3:23:32.660 --> 3:23:37.700]  right wing provocateur mylionopolis the platforms channels have had to do the trick
[3:23:37.700 --> 3:23:45.380]  so laura luma's on there very interesting feed that laura luma's got today if you want to talk
[3:23:45.380 --> 3:23:52.580]  about how um social media silencing completely ruins people's lives then that seems to be what
[3:23:52.580 --> 3:23:56.820]  what's happened in the case of laura luma unfortunately everybody should hold her in their
[3:23:56.820 --> 3:24:02.500]  best wishes so telegram is really popping off it's like twitter was four or five years ago it's
[3:24:02.500 --> 3:24:08.100]  actually fun and you can put your content on there without fear of being banned nobody's been banned
[3:24:08.100 --> 3:24:13.460]  yet as far as i know that's been prominent so that is a good way to go in terms of at least
[3:24:13.460 --> 3:24:19.220]  maintaining some kind of voice online now of course alex is talking about this story
[3:24:19.220 --> 3:24:27.540]  before the break it's up on summit dot news instagram to fact check and remove memes instagram
[3:24:27.540 --> 3:24:31.940]  has announced that it will begin fact checking and removing memes because you're a child and you
[3:24:31.940 --> 3:24:38.580]  can't handle memes they may be offensive you've got an infantilized mind you've been told to be
[3:24:38.580 --> 3:24:43.060]  triggered by literally everything and break down in crying fits at the site of something you disagree
[3:24:43.060 --> 3:24:49.780]  with so it needs to be controlled social media giant which is owned by facebook will use its 52
[3:24:50.420 --> 3:24:57.700]  global fact checking partners to censor false photos and memes on its platform no doubt blurring
[3:24:57.700 --> 3:25:02.260]  out alex jones's face in his family photographs because during the two minutes of hate against
[3:25:02.260 --> 3:25:09.220]  goldstein unlike in 1984 where they could actually see goldstein you can't see alex jones
[3:25:09.220 --> 3:25:14.580]  because he's worse than goldstein instagram is taking those fact checks and applying them to the
[3:25:14.580 --> 3:25:22.260]  same false photos and memes on its platform according to the report a meme isn't a statement of fact
[3:25:22.260 --> 3:25:30.580]  in what universe do you need to fact check a meme you authoritarian bastards this is the level of
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:37.700]  control that they want they're not content they just keep going memes deemed factually incorrect
[3:25:37.700 --> 3:25:42.980]  will no longer appear under tabs where they can be discovered by random users and that's the entire
[3:25:42.980 --> 3:25:50.260]  point so you're always preaching to the choir even if you've got a platform remaining on instagram
[3:25:50.260 --> 3:25:55.540]  only the people who choose to follow you can see what you post you'll never appear in under the other
[3:25:55.540 --> 3:26:02.820]  tabs so new users random users will never see your content the pointer institute which partners with
[3:26:02.820 --> 3:26:08.180]  facebook and this is where the article came out about this recently had to shut down its own
[3:26:08.180 --> 3:26:14.980]  database highlighting unreliable news sites after discovering inconsistencies between sources used
[3:26:14.980 --> 3:26:20.820]  to build the database in its final report so the database which they built to target and highlight
[3:26:20.820 --> 3:26:29.540]  unreliable news sites was unreliable so you can trust them so again the pointer institute is like
[3:26:29.540 --> 3:26:35.460]  news god it's like all these other fact checking websites like snopes which is literally a far
[3:26:35.460 --> 3:26:42.500]  left blog run by a cat lady and somebody who was accused of embezzling a bunch of money but
[3:26:42.500 --> 3:26:46.740]  they're trustworthy they're credible you can trust them literally a mouthpiece for the democratic
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:52.260]  party but they're neutral they're neutral facebook will partner with them they're going to be running
[3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:58.660]  this and people may ask why the need to fact check memes well it's not a mystery at all
[3:26:58.660 --> 3:27:04.180]  because as i've proven and written about in the past studies have repeatedly shown that the political
[3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:09.140]  right is far better at spreading memes of course one of the reasons for that is that
[3:27:09.140 --> 3:27:14.580]  memes are generally a little bit offensive a little bit cheeky a little bit mischievous
[3:27:15.140 --> 3:27:19.700]  and the political right is quite prepared to do that not the left because they're permanently
[3:27:19.700 --> 3:27:25.460]  walking on eggshells because you know anything humorous anything satirical that isn't orange
[3:27:25.460 --> 3:27:33.060]  man bad might transgress some politically correct thought crime so that's why the left
[3:27:33.060 --> 3:27:38.660]  sucks that's why the left can't mean and they've done studies on this a study undertaken by researchers
[3:27:38.660 --> 3:27:45.140]  at university college london found that the most effective means largely originated in two places
[3:27:45.700 --> 3:27:50.900]  the subreddit the donald which of course was a major online presence major of influence in
[3:27:51.620 --> 3:27:58.260]  rallying trump's base and getting him elected and four chans politically incorrect poll forum
[3:27:58.820 --> 3:28:05.300]  so the best the most effective means usually as this last study showed come out of those two
[3:28:05.300 --> 3:28:12.740]  places of course those are typically right wing content forums a vice write-up study acknowledges
[3:28:12.740 --> 3:28:20.340]  that the most effectively spread memes originated on the donald and paul so of course if you can't
[3:28:20.340 --> 3:28:26.180]  create the memes if you can't spread the memes let's just ban memes of course that's the new go-to
[3:28:26.180 --> 3:28:31.940]  solution and in fact there was another article which was i think it was during the state of the
[3:28:31.940 --> 3:28:37.620]  union speech headline buzzfeed lobbies twitter to ban memes that make fun of blackface democrats
[3:28:38.660 --> 3:28:43.860]  that was obviously during the time when the virginia governor ralph northam scandal was emerging
[3:28:44.660 --> 3:28:50.660]  and we had the meme of the women the democratic congress women wearing the white clothes and
[3:28:50.660 --> 3:28:55.380]  clan hoods buzzfeed wanted to the bad ban that we'll get into it more heart disease is on the rise

[3:36:47.780 --> 3:36:54.900]  harassing old women and teenage girls that's an acceptable opinion to have and to broadcast on
[3:36:54.900 --> 3:37:01.060]  Facebook headline Facebook takes no action against state rep who threatened to docks teenage pro
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:07.620]  life is on video you can threaten to docks children you can threaten to assassinate the
[3:37:07.620 --> 3:37:12.500]  president and the person who gets reported those threats gets banned from Facebook you can support
[3:37:12.500 --> 3:37:18.180]  Hamas you can support all kinds of terrorist groups you can support Antifa domestic terrorist groups
[3:37:18.180 --> 3:37:23.140]  that's just fine. Facebook has taken no action against abortion activist and state rep Brian
[3:37:23.140 --> 3:37:30.020]  Sims after he brazenly tried to docks a group of teenage girls on video the clip is in the article
[3:37:30.020 --> 3:37:35.860]  he basically walks up to them they're holding a small protest outside a planned parenthood clinic
[3:37:35.860 --> 3:37:42.020]  in southern Pennsylvania and he says on video here's the deal I've got a hundred dollars for anybody
[3:37:42.020 --> 3:37:47.860]  who will identify any of these three he then uses white people as a slur this is one of his favorite
[3:37:47.860 --> 3:37:54.660]  tactics despite the fact that one of the girls that shot the children that he's harassing and
[3:37:54.660 --> 3:38:02.580]  doxing or threatening to dox isn't even white so this guy who's white continually uses the term
[3:38:02.580 --> 3:38:08.900]  white people as a slur like it's automatically a pejorative proving he's a racist and then he
[3:38:08.900 --> 3:38:15.380]  not only on camera but in the Facebook post itself as if there was any confusion about this in the
[3:38:15.380 --> 3:38:22.100]  Facebook post itself which has been up for over three weeks on Facebook he says so let's make
[3:38:22.100 --> 3:38:27.140]  the most of it I'll donate a hundred dollars to Planned Parenthood if anyone who knows who
[3:38:27.140 --> 3:38:36.020]  these awful people are who'll join me in that 100 so he's on tape harassing teenage girls
[3:38:36.020 --> 3:38:41.140]  who are staging what looks like a peaceful protest outside a Planned Parenthood clinic
[3:38:41.140 --> 3:38:46.500]  they leave when he turns up not only is he harassing them he's harassing another young man
[3:38:46.500 --> 3:38:52.020]  he's offering on camera with his I think he's got like 200 000 followers on Facebook
[3:38:52.020 --> 3:38:57.860]  a hundred dollars for their identities to be revealed that's doxing but now that's fine because
[3:38:58.420 --> 3:39:01.860]  he's an abortion activist he's on the left different rules apply
[3:39:01.860 --> 3:39:07.620]  despite the post being reported numerous times I should receive detention on Twitter yesterday
[3:39:07.620 --> 3:39:12.580]  neither Twitter nor Facebook has taken any action against Sims while myself and others
[3:39:12.580 --> 3:39:18.660]  were banned by Facebook for nebulous hate Sims is allowed to deliberately break Facebook's
[3:39:18.660 --> 3:39:24.020]  terms of service with zero consequences he also posted another video in which he harasses our
[3:39:24.020 --> 3:39:29.380]  lady which could also be argued violates Facebook policies on bullying and harassment but there's
[3:39:29.380 --> 3:39:37.140]  no political bias honest so the way they're going to get around this is by claiming that because
[3:39:37.140 --> 3:39:43.860]  he's an elected official different rules apply to him that he can get away with certain things
[3:39:43.860 --> 3:39:52.020]  because that behavior needs to be seen by the voting public that's not the case though is it when
[3:39:52.020 --> 3:39:58.980]  Karl Benjamin and when Tommy Robinson tried to sign up for accounts on Twitter to become elected
[3:39:58.980 --> 3:40:05.220]  representatives their accounts were immediately banned so this rule about what elected representatives
[3:40:05.220 --> 3:40:11.940]  or people running for office can get away with seems to differ based on the political persuasion
[3:40:11.940 --> 3:40:17.940]  of who's doing it isn't that interesting once again another giant double standard
[3:40:17.940 --> 3:40:21.300]  now Steven Crowder tweeted about this earlier
[3:40:22.820 --> 3:40:29.460]  Dem Brian Sims claims to be a feminist while advocating for Sharia law harassing young girls
[3:40:29.460 --> 3:40:35.620]  and offering money to dox them that's liberal that's progressive ensuring born male athletes can take
[3:40:35.620 --> 3:40:41.380]  athletic titles from biological women which he also did in another post how long will
[3:40:41.380 --> 3:40:48.580]  we pretend that Democrats care about women at all so this guy is up harassing young teenage girls
[3:40:48.580 --> 3:40:54.660]  harassing old ladies threatening to dox them his post his video has been on Twitter on Facebook
[3:40:54.660 --> 3:41:02.740]  but over three weeks absolutely nothing happens meanwhile Twitter bans Jewish Trump supporter
[3:41:02.740 --> 3:41:09.940]  over AOC parody account you can't make fun of Democrats and it was interesting actually in
[3:41:09.940 --> 3:41:16.660]  relation to this somebody posted a tweet from I think it's it's verified liberal let's put it that
[3:41:16.660 --> 3:41:23.620]  way whether it's a journalist I haven't looked into it but she's called Molly Jong fast so when
[3:41:23.620 --> 3:41:30.260]  this Jewish Trump supporter who by the way I met at CPAC absolutely fun loving hilarious guy nice
[3:41:30.260 --> 3:41:37.860]  guy to the to the end's degree when he got banned for this AOC parody account she said this this is
[3:41:37.860 --> 3:41:44.740]  Molly Jong fast on Twitter this AOC parody account was incredibly mean and often retweeted as fact
[3:41:44.740 --> 3:41:49.220]  now conservatives are absolutely furious that it's been taken down imagine if there was a parody
[3:41:49.220 --> 3:41:55.540]  account making fun of young conservative congressman with the same zeal they'd be apoplectic but then
[3:41:55.540 --> 3:42:02.500]  he flashes back to a tweet from March last year where this same verified liberal on Twitter says
[3:42:02.500 --> 3:42:10.740]  Devin Nunes suing his own parody parody accounts is a pretty excellent self-own oh so again we see
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:16.340]  the double standard parody accounts targeting conservatives republicans that's just fine parody
[3:42:16.340 --> 3:42:22.740]  accounts targeting liberal leftist democrat darlings like alexandria acazio-cortez that's the
[3:42:22.740 --> 3:42:28.820]  Bolton and now not only did Twitter ban the parody account even though it said parody in the bio
[3:42:28.820 --> 3:42:36.180]  twice conformed to all their rules they banned the creator michael j morrison just as a kind of
[3:42:36.180 --> 3:42:43.460]  another way to lash out and he's been banned he had 50 000 followers i think 60 000 followers he's
[3:42:43.460 --> 3:42:48.820]  gone the parody account had 85 000 followers that's gone even though parody accounts completely
[3:42:48.820 --> 3:42:54.100]  allowed he said it was a parody account doesn't matter bye bye you're gone well info warshore.com

[3:49:26.180 --> 3:49:31.460]  again this is up at summit.news rumors swirl about huge layoffs at cnn bryan stelter denies
[3:49:31.460 --> 3:49:37.460]  after the network lost 26 percent of its audience in the past year there are now rumors
[3:49:37.460 --> 3:49:44.340]  swirling that huge layoffs are about to hit cnn ftv live reports quote cnn will cut as many as 300
[3:49:44.340 --> 3:49:51.220]  employees many being older employees with years at the network so they allege that 200 people will
[3:49:51.220 --> 3:49:56.020]  be given a pink slip and 100 more will be offered to buy out according to this report it's being
[3:49:56.020 --> 3:50:01.940]  described as a brain drain because it will mainly impact veteran reporters and employees
[3:50:03.060 --> 3:50:08.420]  however cnn's bryan stelter denied the story tweeting there's a rumor making the rounds today
[3:50:08.420 --> 3:50:13.540]  about big impending layoffs at cnn surely that's impossible given that they've lost quarter of
[3:50:13.540 --> 3:50:19.220]  their audience in a year the cnn spokeswoman is knocking it down on the record no layoffs
[3:50:19.220 --> 3:50:23.380]  that were voluntary buyouts throughout the organization and about 100 people opted for it
[3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:30.740]  then eric erickson responded with this voluntary layoffs typically happened prior to company
[3:50:30.740 --> 3:50:38.660]  to a company doing layoffs at&t which now owns cnn is notorious for doing this if enough volunteers
[3:50:38.660 --> 3:50:43.780]  walk the plank no one else is forced to so he's saying that they tried to get as many people
[3:50:43.780 --> 3:50:49.060]  to walk the plank as possible if that number is not high enough then the layoffs will follow
[3:50:49.060 --> 3:50:56.100]  and as we report of course their viewership is down 26 percent in a year the network's flagship
[3:50:56.100 --> 3:51:01.940]  prime time show well well prime time through a total of just 917 000 views in april which is
[3:51:02.740 --> 3:51:08.020]  its worst performance ever and it's just a coincidence that bryan stelter and oliver dorsi
[3:51:08.820 --> 3:51:13.940]  who funnily enough used to send tweets bashing cnn back in 2014-2015
[3:51:13.940 --> 3:51:21.140]  then he failed as a conservative commentator joined cnn and devoted his career to de-platforming
[3:51:21.140 --> 3:51:28.420]  dragging down everyone else interesting that they're now denying this we shall see meanwhile
[3:51:29.620 --> 3:51:35.300]  vice commences master brand strategy folding standalone waypoint and broadly brands so
[3:51:35.300 --> 3:51:40.340]  of course we had massive layoffs from buzzfeed a couple of months ago and then vice had to follow
[3:51:40.340 --> 3:51:45.140]  sue well now vice has started consolidating and rebranding its media verticals on device
[3:51:45.700 --> 3:51:55.460]  folding the standalone tonic noisy waypoints and broadly brands in fact i think broadly had a youtube
[3:51:55.460 --> 3:52:00.340]  channel and it was so pathetic it could barely get like a thousand views per video at one point
[3:52:01.460 --> 3:52:05.460]  the digital media companies to boost site traffic and cross pollinate readers across
[3:52:05.460 --> 3:52:11.620]  these once distinct and separate sections in 2018 vice media missed its revenue goals and then
[3:52:11.620 --> 3:52:18.740]  months later cut staff by 10 which was around 250 people but don't worry because guess who's
[3:52:18.740 --> 3:52:26.020]  riding to the rescue it's he who shall not be named otherwise you're an anti-semite yes it's
[3:52:26.020 --> 3:52:32.020]  george soros this similar kind of situation to facebook you can only talk about it's the flip
[3:52:32.020 --> 3:52:37.380]  side of the alex jones equation you can only talk about george soros if you're being polite and
[3:52:37.380 --> 3:52:42.580]  complimentary towards george soros anything negative because of course there'd be nothing
[3:52:42.580 --> 3:52:48.180]  negative about a billion a philanthropist who funds political movements worldwide there'd
[3:52:48.180 --> 3:52:53.780]  be nothing negative about that right now it all has to be positive don't criticize george soros
[3:52:53.780 --> 3:53:03.620]  or you hate jewish people vice media raises 250 million dollars not only knows how or why given
[3:53:03.620 --> 3:53:09.780]  that it's a failing brand nobody's interested in it but again it's one of the pillars of the left
[3:53:09.780 --> 3:53:17.380]  wing digital media establishment so they have to rescue it it's too big to fail now vice media the
[3:53:17.380 --> 3:53:23.940]  canadian digital venture formed out of vice magazine of course by gavin mckinnis who is now completely
[3:53:23.940 --> 3:53:32.100]  deplatformed off everything has raised 250 million dollars in debt from investors including george
[3:53:32.100 --> 3:53:37.380]  soros the financiers company is one of the number of investors in the round that has been led by 23
[3:53:37.380 --> 3:53:43.780]  capital so they've got a bunch of other investors which include shane smith obviously the co-founder
[3:53:43.780 --> 3:53:51.460]  the walt disney company a and e networks and tpg capital so the corporate behemoths are rushing
[3:53:51.460 --> 3:53:57.700]  with the safety net in which to catch vice as it crumbles and collapses so with a 250 million
[3:53:57.700 --> 3:54:04.020]  dollar injection for the foreseeable future at least that'll be just fine we might not be fine
[3:54:04.020 --> 3:54:07.700]  that's why you need to get the products right now at info wars store dot com
[3:54:07.700 --> 3:54:15.860]  now we also have an article up on the federalist this is long article i'm not going to go through
[3:54:15.860 --> 3:54:19.460]  it all but i really recommend you read it because it's a great breakdown of what's happened over
[3:54:19.460 --> 3:54:25.300]  the past week with the deplatforming kicking people off online platforms is about control
[3:54:25.300 --> 3:54:31.220]  not free speech and this is a long article but they go through it and they make the point
[3:54:31.220 --> 3:54:37.300]  those critiques here who may dismiss the critique of what about is and basically he's saying
[3:54:37.940 --> 3:54:43.540]  no one need defend any of the people recently deplatformed by facebook and twitter to understand
[3:54:43.540 --> 3:54:50.420]  that the debate is really about an establishment desperate to regain the gatekeeping power they
[3:54:50.420 --> 3:54:56.580]  believed they lost as a result of satellite technology and the internet and of course
[3:54:56.580 --> 3:55:03.060]  as a consequence of which led to donald trump's election in 2016 that is a key article to understand
[3:55:03.620 --> 3:55:07.220]  exactly why they're doing the deplatforming and why they're doing it now
[3:55:08.660 --> 3:55:13.380]  meanwhile in europe where you can increasingly not talk about any of these issues otherwise

[3:56:04.820 --> 3:56:11.540]  postal services delivery companies refusing to deliver in these heavily migrant areas because
[3:56:11.540 --> 3:56:17.540]  of the rampant crime and the threat of theft some of the postal companies in sweden have
[3:56:17.540 --> 3:56:22.100]  point blank refused to even go to those areas you can't even say that in sweden that's a hate
[3:56:22.100 --> 3:56:27.060]  crime basically and now the television crew in brussels were attacked on sunday morning while
