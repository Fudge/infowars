[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:39.000]  It is the quickening and the intensification of the globalist takeover on a planetary scale
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.000]  so much incredibly vital news that is unfolding and taking place around us all we are truly
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  living a major paradigm shift on so many fronts for the good and the bad upheaval a time of great
[00:58.000 --> 01:07.000]  change is upon us thank you for joining us it is Wednesday the fifth day of May 2010
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  we're gonna be live here for the next four hours later in the broadcast I want to spend
[01:11.000 --> 01:18.000]  at least 30 minutes talking about the nature of racism it's truly tribalism and the groups
[01:18.000 --> 01:26.000]  and organizations that promote so-called multiculturalism are actually creating division
[01:26.000 --> 01:35.000]  and tribalism so they exacerbate a problem and then sell you the big government nanny state
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  solution so I want to discuss really the great game of divide and conquer from the level of
[01:41.000 --> 01:52.000]  race and religion coming up today in fact I'm just gonna do that at the start of the next hour
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  then we have a guest joining us just for about 15 minutes in the middle of the third hour
[01:59.000 --> 02:09.000]  we saw a news report where Robert G. Rash who heads up the levy system in his area of the
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  country he's been in meetings with FEMA where they openly brag that where they're forcing
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  everyone to buy flood insurance now who doesn't need even people on hilltops that this is just
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  a way to raise tens of billions of dollars unlike the government health care bill forcing
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  you to buy insurance written by the insurance companies but they had their pundits go out
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  and claim that they were against it when their lobbying was 90 plus what 94% according to
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  the Wall Street Journal for it just like Goldman Sachs and others are lobbying for the
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  banking reform bill that actually gives them more power and control over the entire financial
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.000]  system but it's being sold in the media in fact I saw an article today Goldman Sachs relents
[02:53.000 --> 03:02.000]  agrees the bill needs to pass oh they agree they made some mistakes engineering the financial
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  collapse by design in their own records that's a mistake if you rob a bank it's a mistake if
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  you beat your neighbor in the head with a hammer till they're dead it's a mistake if you jump
[03:11.000 --> 03:19.000]  off a cliff it's a mistake if you drive to a crack house and buy drugs it's a mistake if you
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  run a cash register and you steal a thousand dollars out of it at a seven eleven it's a
[03:25.000 --> 03:35.000]  mistake it's all a mistake so we'll be discussing that today as well plus I was already aware
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  of this information by saying that I've done the research it's very accurate in fact they
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  really understated but I saw some amazing videos that were posted up on our Facebook account
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  one of our Facebook accounts we've gotten more than 15 of them fan-based sites that people
[03:53.000 --> 04:01.000]  turned over to us but one of our fan sites posted some videos to the overpopulation as
[04:01.000 --> 04:09.000]  a myth website where they put together some really excellent YouTube videos using official
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  numbers and this was put out by the population research institute who I want to get on in
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  the next few days or next week or so just amazing information I want to go to the facts
[04:22.000 --> 04:31.000]  of human population here on the broadcast and we will do that coming up today in the last
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  hour now when we return I want to get into the economy and the consolidation of the
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.000]  economy by powerful financial interest China may crash the next nine to twelve months says

[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  really a mild law the media is misrepresenting it saying that anyone with brown skin is going
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  to be pulled over and basically harassed ladies and gentlemen for two and a half years they
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  have built border patrol checkpoints as far as a hundred miles in and they have roving
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  checkpoints and we've interviewed people that have been beaten up black people white people
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.000]  hispanics all americans who every day driving to work have to go through these and they start
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  saying look you're not going to search me you're not going to ask me questions like this is
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  an airport you need to be down on the border and you remember pastor anderson who they beat
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  within an inch of his life splitting his head open all over the place tasering him over
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.000]  and over again and he got he videotaped it and he got the videotape of it and that's on
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  youtube so this already happens to americans okay i don't care what color you are and so
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.000]  the federal government oh care so much about civil rights and people's freedom and basketball
[09:36.000 --> 09:44.000]  teams are changing their names to spanish names in protest and oh my gosh you know hispanic
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  people are being persecuted and the media is telling them this to make this be a racial
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  issue because eighty percent or more of the legal aliens in this country are latin american
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  the point is we're going bankrupt i mean you see every day articles about school districts
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  firing half their teachers laying off a third or more and this is going on all the time
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  there'll be more cuts of city employees of even police i mean are you witnessing them
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  going to four day a week school days are you witnessing massive budget shortfalls everywhere
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  i mean do you see what's happening and this is what the banking system does in fact you
[10:27.000 --> 10:35.000]  know today is falsely known as sinco de mayo mexican independence it's not even celebrated
[10:35.000 --> 10:43.000]  in mexico it is not mexican independence day it's made up like kwanzaa to create more division
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  and it's just another example of all of the propaganda that's going on and and when i
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  was rereading to make sure i was accurate about this the history of sinco de mayo and
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  sinco de mayo confusion it just confirmed even more when i had historically remembered
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.000]  and you read the story of mexico it it it's the same story we've seen in greece the same
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  story we've seen in argentina the same story now in portugal the same story in england the
[11:12.000 --> 11:20.000]  united states the banks came in got the country in incredible debt the people threw off colonial
[11:20.000 --> 11:29.000]  rule not once but twice but they never escaped the banking cartel that controlled them and that's
[11:29.000 --> 11:37.000]  why mexico has triple on average by every major index the natural resources of the united states
[11:37.000 --> 11:46.000]  i mean mexico is rich rich soil rich in oil rich in timber rich in minerals across the
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  board why do they have one of the poorest populations on earth and one of the richest elites on
[11:51.000 --> 11:58.000]  earth they're in the top three after the united states in england why because it's a top down
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  vertically integrated society by design to keep control of the population and so next
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  hour i'm going to break this down and go over it but there's all this sinco de mayo confusion
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  and i have to witness every time there's a sinco de mayo in austin if you go downtown you'll
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  see giant parades day and night people drunk everywhere waving mexican flags and i'm sorry
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  it's offensive it's offensive i mean imagine if you had a giant us population mexico city
[12:28.000 --> 12:34.000]  on fourth of july running around with tens of thousands of american flags i would imagine
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  that would be offensive and look i don't want to hear that the united states belongs to
[12:38.000 --> 12:48.000]  mexico mexico was guatemala as well but they lost that all it was was the spanish empire
[12:48.000 --> 12:59.000]  and then the french empire and then a hapsburg austrian slash german empire okay it was
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  anybody who could land troops with guns it was a free for all down there all right so
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  the the claim that that that mexico of the treaty of guadalupia dalgo got ripped off is
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  a joke okay mexico couldn't even hold their forts against the native populations of comanche
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  and apache and red stick and others okay it is a sickening disgusting lie and i am sick of it
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  i have read the history up one side and down the other okay and other people should do that
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  but why does the u.s. government in colleges and in high school listen when i was at anderson
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  high school i was a couple years in dallas couple years here in austin and i was in art
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  class and they had an art field trip with the best students of the ladies five classes
[13:48.000 --> 13:55.000]  and she was a nice art teacher but a socialist basically and she took me down to ut with
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  her quote best students and i got to sit there for six hours of the university of texas at
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  their art department hearing about how u.s. stole mexico and seeing these art displays
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  about how evil white people are okay i mean you want to know what woke alex jones up it
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  was stuff like that okay because i'd already read history books and i already knew it was
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  a complete deception all right okay look does does britain have a claim on the united states
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.000]  i mean they used to have it no does spain have a claim no does france have a claim
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  no does mexico have a claim no you don't okay does does germany have a claim because yes
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  yes i mean we just say germany that's the that's the nation today it was the austrian
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  hungarian empire and then you can even debate what royalty it was they were all
[14:48.000 --> 14:55.000]  intermarried the sax coberg gothers the hapsburgs but it was basically based out of what is
[14:55.000 --> 15:05.000]  austria today okay now now they had california and texas and arizona and nevada i mean do
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  the french get it do the germans get it the austrians get it it's just as asinine a claim
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  of of people in mexico being taught in public schools and here in the united states i mean
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  it is taught in studies all over the united states almost every school district in the
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  country sits there and teaches the school kids this is mexico and it was stolen no this
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  is not mexico was not stolen if anybody has a claim to it it was the native tribes that
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.500]  lived here period and they didn't have governments they didn't have private property they didn't
[15:39.500 --> 15:45.000]  have a system and you bet via conquest the united states took it okay now you gotta
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  ask yourself a question do you want to live under the united states bill of rights and
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.000]  constitution which they're now violating people say well we don't live under america look it's
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  tyranny well that's the globalist takeover no no no i'm saying you want to live under
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  the bill of rights and constitution and habeas corpus and due process and private property
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  rights where you get to keep what you earn and you produce and you make if you paint
[16:08.000 --> 16:15.000]  an oil painting if you paint an oil painting i mean do you own that or or does somebody
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  else know if you go out and plant some corn plants in your backyard who gets to eat that
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  corn when it's ready in the fall who gets to butter that up and give it to their kids
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  or do you have to go give it to your neighbors because in a democracy i guess a 51 percent
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  of your neighborhood association decide that you've got to give your car to the neighborhood
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  association and they're going to sell it and they're going to take the money from it i mean
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  you have to do that that's slavery they call it democracy we are not a democracy we are
[16:43.000 --> 16:52.000]  a constitutional republic ok and mexico is a narco terrorist kleptocracy a monopoly of
[16:52.000 --> 17:02.000]  the rich mexico has collapsed it's nothing but armored citadels guarding the wealth of
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.320]  the elite all the slaves work in the slave factories and in the fields they have no rights
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.800]  the police wear black uniforms they have troops on the street corner now what's happening in
[17:13.800 --> 17:19.200]  america the exact same thing so no i don't want to live under an empire i don't want
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.040]  to live under the king and i don't want to live under a bunch of ale heffa's i don't
[17:23.040 --> 17:30.000]  want to live under you know the corrupt government leaders who are paid off by big mega corporations
[17:30.000 --> 17:39.400]  and that's what our government is it is it is a big uh... cesspit of corruption period
[17:39.400 --> 17:43.720]  let me explain cinco de maio confusion is a common misconception among the non-mexican
[17:43.720 --> 17:48.480]  community not states the mistake cinco de maio or the fifth of the mexican independence
[17:48.480 --> 17:53.200]  day which occurs september sixteenth cinco de maio actually commemorates the victory
[17:53.200 --> 17:58.560]  of the mexican army over the french empire at the battle it goes on in eighteen sixty
[17:58.560 --> 18:05.560]  two during the french invasion of mexico to make mexico pay debts to the empire because
[18:05.560 --> 18:16.240]  they thrown out the french colonial government and then what happened after that well with
[18:16.240 --> 18:22.800]  the backing of the polian of france a group of uh... mexican monarchs led by the hapsburg
[18:22.800 --> 18:31.480]  uh... max a million came in and took it over and what do the united states do you know
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.040]  the united states took over mexico city they sent the marine corps in the army down there
[18:36.040 --> 18:43.160]  elicits as grant and robert lee were there they went down there and they took over the
[18:43.160 --> 18:48.600]  government of mexico because mexico continued to run sneak attacks as far north as oklahoma
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.600]  and the united states pulled out the united states didn't want mexico the united states
[18:52.600 --> 18:57.640]  knew there's no way to manage this these people have never had freedom they've been slaves
[18:57.640 --> 19:02.920]  before the westerners arrived under the aztec bloodletting kingdom which is something out
[19:02.920 --> 19:09.920]  of hell raiser i mean mexico has been cursed for thousands of years mezzo america has
[19:09.920 --> 19:15.720]  been cursed for thousands and thousands of years
[19:15.720 --> 19:23.480]  it has had by any yardstick a wicked culture a wicked culture and don't tell me oh you
[19:23.480 --> 19:29.480]  can't judge cultures i judge the nazi culture is bad i judge communist culture is bad i

[24:14.840 --> 24:24.920]  news and i'm going to get into the relish with which the media and government criminals are hyping
[24:24.920 --> 24:35.640]  the failed bomb from time square i mean every radio channel local national television they've
[24:35.640 --> 24:41.240]  got all these congressmen and senators and homeland security people saying we need to be able to arrest
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.560]  us citizens and strip them of rights well what is the belligerent act they've got going through
[24:45.560 --> 24:54.680]  congress what does the enemy combatant rulings say that they can arrest citizens secretly
[24:54.680 --> 25:00.360]  torture you and that you can never be seen again well now they already have that on the books
[25:00.360 --> 25:05.320]  at the regulatory executive level but it's not real law so now they're trying to pass
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.240]  the violent belligerent act and they're saying look this guy was a us citizen let's not give him a
[25:11.240 --> 25:20.440]  trial notice what just happened with the hitari in fact guys i i am this to you but i didn't see it
[25:20.440 --> 25:26.520]  in my stack two days ago a federal judge ruled that the hitari had to be released the militia
[25:27.480 --> 25:32.040]  and then the feds went in and i've put an injunction in while they decide whether they're
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.720]  going to file an appeal to the higher federal court so just search the term
[25:41.560 --> 25:46.600]  hitari not to be released yet or something like that i i i need that when i go over this
[25:46.600 --> 25:53.560]  uh because that's what this is about they want to set the precedent to end habeas corpus in due
[25:53.560 --> 26:00.040]  process the entire homeland security system is built and set up for the american people
[26:00.040 --> 26:07.400]  and to watch lieberman on tv and others it is just a full court press to totally overturn the
[26:07.400 --> 26:13.640]  bill of rights and set up the military jurisdiction here in the u.s they've already set it up uh but
[26:13.640 --> 26:22.120]  now that they're trying to openly come out and say look you're not safe unless we can just arrest
[26:22.120 --> 26:26.040]  whoever we want and they could just disappear into a black hole and by the way that's just not my
[26:26.040 --> 26:32.360]  interpretation we had judge andrew napolitano on a few weeks ago going over uh the violent belligerence
[26:32.360 --> 26:37.240]  act and it states that you can be secretly arrested for any reason never even charged
[26:37.240 --> 26:42.920]  as a u.s citizen by the pentagon and that only an act of congress can even get you a court hearing
[26:42.920 --> 26:48.040]  that's the only checks and balance is that well if the anti-terrorism committee uh decides to
[26:48.040 --> 26:57.560]  send it to the house then maybe if you're ever even heard from again that's the type of stuff
[26:57.560 --> 27:03.400]  we're dealing with here and they're saying oh everyone's so scared they want to be safe
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.560]  don't worry we have smart cameras we just decided to put in saturday when this happened
[27:09.560 --> 27:16.040]  all over the country that face scan you and track the way you walk and uh look at suspicious facial
[27:16.040 --> 27:22.200]  expressions that's actually in the ap today and and uh we just now decided to put this in now because
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.320]  this happened oh really they've been putting them in in dallas and boston and new york and la for
[27:27.320 --> 27:34.040]  the last decade they put them in tampa 11 years ago but just like they have the underwear bombing
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.520]  which was a staged event on christmas day and within minutes don't worry we just now decided
[27:38.520 --> 27:45.000]  to put naked body scanners in everywhere they ordered them a year before that's how staged all
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.640]  of this is just like 44 000 us troops 18 000 british troops three aircraft carriers all massing
[27:52.920 --> 27:58.040]  off the coast and in the stands around afghanistan in the two months before 9 11 and bush according
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.920]  to newsweek signs the launch order to launch the attack in the next month on september 10th
[28:02.920 --> 28:09.640]  to launch the attack that he supposedly launched because of 9 11 he signed the order the day before
[28:09.640 --> 28:15.640]  that this is a huge bureaucracy and they think you're so stupid that they set it all up in front
[28:15.640 --> 28:21.560]  of you oh and by the way it's now come out that other witnesses on the ground said the day it
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.440]  happened last week that it looked like a drill and now we have the sheriff saying yeah i was there
[28:26.440 --> 28:31.640]  for a drill with the bomb squad and so i was already in cop mode so so more and more it becomes
[28:31.640 --> 28:38.360]  evident they were running a drill and just like they told you that hatari was basically admitting
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.760]  what they'd done and now they're saying that's not true and they've got to release them you can't
[28:42.760 --> 28:50.920]  believe anything that comes out of these people this guy might not even exist this this intelligence
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.960]  operative cutout remember mcveigh and that's why they don't want to have trials because if they
[28:55.960 --> 29:00.200]  have trials you'll get to see the guy you'll get to hear the evidence you'll get to see what really
[29:00.200 --> 29:04.360]  went on you'll get to find out if he was hired to take part in a drill you'll get to find out if
[29:04.360 --> 29:09.560]  he was an intelligence asset who was sent to pakistan to spy and he's some double agent they're
[29:09.560 --> 29:16.280]  setting up and burning like lee harvey oswald or tim mcveigh or dozens of other lone gunman john wilts

[35:17.640 --> 35:26.840]  shut for a holiday today here's another one euro market meltdown resumes despite greek deal this
[35:26.840 --> 35:35.080]  is out of reuters now this is a very important story because everything is not as it seems
[35:35.080 --> 35:40.360]  when you just read these news articles they're saying oh it doesn't matter of 146 billion plus
[35:40.360 --> 35:49.800]  1.46.5 billion was given in a quote bailout in a quote austerity deal they cut your pensions
[35:49.800 --> 35:57.720]  they cut your benefits they cut basic services like filling potholes and police and ambulances
[35:58.520 --> 36:05.800]  and they raise the taxes to pay the money to the six to ten depending on how you
[36:05.800 --> 36:13.640]  break them down global mega parasite banks it's incredible
[36:16.120 --> 36:21.000]  and so they're saying oh he didn't have the desired effect we thought this would stabilize
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.880]  europe how many economists have we had on for several years telling you that 19 countries
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.320]  are going to go down at least more than 12 of them in western and eastern europe and the
[36:31.320 --> 36:39.640]  mediterranean and then it would be portugal and spain next and now we're hearing the same thing oh
[36:39.640 --> 36:48.680]  my gosh oh my gosh now we need hundreds of billions more for those countries or the economy will
[36:48.680 --> 36:56.440]  fall apart and then they get the bailout and the banks restrict lending even more by design
[36:56.440 --> 37:03.960]  to destroy the real economy to destroy confidence so the state goes bankrupt further into the hands
[37:03.960 --> 37:09.560]  of the private central banks that have done this in hundreds of nations over and over again we have
[37:09.560 --> 37:17.000]  the imf world bank handbooks and then the riots come that further destroys confidence then they
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.160]  have an excuse to crack down with paramilitary police it's called the imf riot and they're preparing it
[37:23.160 --> 37:32.840]  for the united states as well but the average person reading this oh gosh a 146 plus billion
[37:32.840 --> 37:38.360]  in taxpayer money a lot of it paid by us taxpayers that wasn't enough oh we better have more
[37:40.200 --> 37:41.960]  meanwhile lending is at record lows

[55:52.600 --> 56:00.360]  stupid you know they can tie their shoelaces they can you know they can do basic things like that but
[56:00.360 --> 56:07.560]  you're an 85 iq you're you're talking about somebody almost at moron level 100 there have
[56:07.560 --> 56:14.520]  been lawsuits all over the country in dallas and philadelphia and new york and la that's
[56:14.520 --> 56:19.160]  been a policy in place for at least 20 years because you know the average cop listening
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.800]  to me right now can't even understand what i'm saying they just say terrorists terrorists
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.760]  you know the government made your son come up the government made the grass grow the government
[56:28.760 --> 56:34.600]  made it and and and and they've been trained that the tea party people are terrorist and
[56:34.600 --> 56:40.520]  that the gun owners are terrorist and and they'll do whatever they're told you know don't make fun
[56:40.520 --> 56:44.760]  of the communist chinese you know if they got suckered into going along with it don't make fun
[56:44.760 --> 56:52.200]  of the nazis they got suckered in i've studied the uh europe at that time you know the germans
[56:52.200 --> 56:58.680]  were much more moral people than we are today and they bought the the lie they you know they drank
[56:58.680 --> 57:04.760]  the kool aid and let me tell you something we drank it we drank more than any modern society's
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.440]  ever guzzled down and this country is cursed and is going to hell okay you understand that we

[57:23.480 --> 57:32.120]  us around in circles over that fire slow roasting us oh it makes me so sad and look i know there are
[57:32.120 --> 57:38.120]  a lot of really smart police but the point is the government doesn't want smart ones and the smart
[57:38.120 --> 57:46.840]  people end up maybe maybe making sergeant after 25 30 years but the thuggish roid had nuts with
[57:46.840 --> 57:53.320]  devil tattoos all over them they're going to the top and you've heard the military call in who's

[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:47.480]  mind controlled by the culture and the television you have been fed decadence and weakness to the
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:56.600]  point that you're almost defenseless just wake up listen police officers government people military
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.840]  people that sit in these big global corporate operations at mid-level you are so busy you

[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:15.960]  scheduled turn your blackberry turn your iphone off pick a day this weekend and go to a local
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:23.240]  greenbelt or national park by yourself and make yourself go up on a hilltop and just sit there
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.920]  for two hours and start thinking about what's on television start thinking about what's all around
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:34.520]  you start thinking about the stuff that's being said and then go listen to radio and tv and listen
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:41.880]  to it when you know the game plan it's unbelievable we've got to stop these people come on we can't
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.280]  let them do it they're going to run what they did in germany and russia and china and every other
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.720]  major nation here we cannot allow it they're going to slowly roll it out they're going to engineer
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:57.400]  riots and terror attacks they're going to come after the american people they already are and
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:03.560]  europe they're coming after you they're coming after everybody i think there's a bible passage
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.800]  about the beginning of knowledge is the beginning of sorrow and i just learn more and more every
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:15.400]  day i mean my knowledge is just accelerating in understanding and i just say to god i can't even
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:20.600]  handle this i mean i like last night for like four hours it was like a download of understanding
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:27.240]  to a whole other level my brain was burning with understanding and the frustration here is that i
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:34.920]  can't even articulate to you the full magnitude you think i just get up here and say they're
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:41.480]  poisoning the water and the vaccines and the food it's on record i said i'd take your calls
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:48.040]  i tried to cover news i tried to not go into a rant you know people i don't rant because uh
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:53.320]  listeners tend to like it yeah i don't rant as much as i did in the past you've noticed because
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:11:01.160]  when i rant it is when i am desperate when i am upset when i am losing control okay i don't want
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.600]  to be enemies with all the dependent people in government and on the government dole i understand
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.640]  how you were sucked into it i understand the psychology i understand your programming i want
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:17.960]  you to be free i want you to see i want you to know because the sorrow comes and not seeing the
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:26.360]  evil defeated but if you will face the full horror if you will admit to yourself how bad things are
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:32.840]  and break your conditioning and you break your conditioning it's easy to do by just realizing
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.400]  there's a big agenda afoot and there are powerful elites that are programming us you don't have to
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:43.400]  agree with the information i put out because once you take the blinders off spiritually and mentally
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:49.000]  and mentally once you remove those blinders once you start focusing on real issues once you start
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:59.240]  studying history it is unending what you will learn it is it we could build something so amazing
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:08.120]  together the species has unlimited potential and i can't stand seeing our species warped and poisoned
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:14.200]  and deformed and mind raped and mind controlled and to see the the public is under mind control
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:24.680]  different degrees of it we all are to a certain extent and this methodology of control is so
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:32.600]  destructive it's destructive by design they can't have you being a strong upright transcendent creature
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:39.080]  that is developing in your life and reaching towards god like a plant reaches towards the sun
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:46.200]  because if you ever grow you will see the control and the evil and you will be threatened by it and
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:55.160]  you will crush it the globalists are scared of us they understand our power they're evil the
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:00.600]  controllers know what i know and know what many of you know they can see the world clearly they
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:08.520]  know and they've made a conscious jealous greedy hateful decision much of it through competition
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.320]  with each other because they're so busy fighting with each other over power where it creates a
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:22.840]  synthesis of pure death death is the ultimate form of domination destroying the mind taking over the
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.600]  resources taking over the farming taking over the economy taking over the family taking over every
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.600]  taking over every level of human development and twisting it and using our normal instincts our natural
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.800]  predispositions against us it's just horrible
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:51.720]  tom in florida you're on the air go ahead hi alex several things quickly um i um recently here in
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:58.040]  alachua county florida like the uh world or the alachua county fema office where it's been on a
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.680]  calling campaign apparently to everyone i just received one of those spooky calls myself where
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.800]  i got the message on my machine in which they are asking very simply without any further
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:13.800]  explanations over lake for people to log on to the their website and allow themselves to simply
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:23.880]  be database yes and fema again is the 10 regions under the 10 federal governorships under the 10
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:31.560]  homeland security regions via north com i've seen this in the news and now fema is taking over the
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.840]  government billboards and putting out messages they're breaking into tv and radio they're admitting
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.480]  that they're going to be taking commandeering people cell phones with messages uh and uh
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:48.520]  they're they're just saying we command you to report to us and yes it is it is just the slow
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:55.640]  slow incremental march of evil really is uh very spooky and i just felt like you know white when
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.640]  they start actually calling you on the phone and whatnot over like you know they must be really
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:05.240]  really pushing their agenda so uh it's pretty weird um also well there's now more government
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:12.280]  hires than private sector hires it's it's it's cancer yeah yeah uh as far as the uh the uh
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.720]  the situation with the illegals and the whole border situation i am completely 100 percent
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:23.800]  in favor of what uh arizona is doing it may not be perfect i don't know that anything can be perfect
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.840]  but something's got to be done i know i'm of uh german descent we're like and i know that if
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.240]  there were tens of millions of germans in this country illegally i'd want them arrested and
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.360]  deported over and if i happen to get pulled over as a result of somebody checking to see whether
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.040]  i'm actually legally a citizen or not i wouldn't mind it and i will that's the one police power
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.960]  that's actually in the constitution for the federal government so it's the one thing they
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:54.280]  won't do uh but look they've got 100 mile deep checkpoints ringing the country where they harass
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:00.440]  citizens this is already being done again we've got to be trained to train us to take our shoes off
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.920]  train us to go in the body scanner train us to have our blood taken at a checkpoint you know
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.160]  train the kids they're being washed at home by the laptops uh train us that okay we take your
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.480]  baby's blood at birth and give it to the pentagon i mean they're just training you that they're
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:18.280]  going to get in your space they're going to ask you questions and then the feds say oh my gosh
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:23.480]  we're worried if the police pull a drunk driver over and he doesn't you know and he's an illegal
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.680]  that they'll also arrest him for that they don't as it is now they don't arrest illegals for basically
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:36.440]  anything i appreciate your call tom mark in oregon you're on the air morning alex
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:45.640]  good afternoon hey alex i had to ask you i'm hoping you got over your uh your ligament
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.480]  problem up by your neck and such like that from swimming in the lake the other day i was just
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.160]  whining about it because they cut to me early on the camera and i was like craning my neck around
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:58.600]  me yeah no it feels better good yeah i had one going like that for about three weeks uh putting
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.880]  some blinds in a little while back and uh it's no fun i was going to suggest if it if it lingers
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.280]  that you just simply go to a good chiropractor and that would probably be a sense for them to
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.320]  straighten that out don't have time yeah but go ahead what's on your mind well alex you know the
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.840]  the good book says that none is so blind but he who will not see so that we do have a certain
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:25.320]  amount of people in this country and in this world who actually are willingly blind and and what
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:33.160]  replaces um their knowledge of the truth of evil is their own involvement with the evil uh through
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:37.320]  that's right that's right once they get you to accept little lies then it's bigger lies
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.480]  and then more and more lies and then you become invested in the lies you don't want to admit you
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:48.760]  were wrong so you begin to to to to salute the corruption to salute the destruction and and
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:53.880]  to cheerlead it like you're part of it that's the yuppie delusion where they giggle and laugh at
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.920]  something you know like they imagine it's not affecting them oh it's it's it's it's just wanton
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:04.840]  willful ignorance yes and it does come out of uh just a basic selfishness smallness of heart
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.640]  smallness of character smallness of person they're the takers of the world not the givers but the
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:14.040]  givers i think i really have faith in humanity alex and i think you share this faith with me
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.880]  that they actually comprise a majority of humanity and that uh all of us who believe in the truth
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:26.360]  can see the lie and at this point the enemy is spread out the intimidation and the fear control
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:33.160]  factors so thick on top of all of humanity that people are just simply intimidated to the point
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:38.840]  where we cannot organize we cannot come up as one voice in this country and around the world
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.120]  which could be done i mean the organizational uh framework is already there for this to be done
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:50.520]  groups could come together we all have common cause but it's at this point in time alex to my
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.160]  view it's the the fear and the intimidation which they've intentionally uh put up as a
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.680]  bulwark against any kind of popular uprising in this country or in the world so knowing what we
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.920]  have to deal with here how do you combat the fear and the intimidation at this point is my view
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.400]  of it's more than just fear it's more than just fear and intimidation but on the fear issue i'll
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:18.840]  say this if anyone studied history they better be afraid very afraid of not manning up and and
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:25.720]  growing a backbone okay it is because i do understand what a threat this is that i am boldly
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:31.080]  standing up and calling these criminals out but separately fear i don't think is the overall
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:38.120]  driver more than that it's a feeling of powerlessness a feeling of not respecting themselves a feeling
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:44.840]  pathetic and of not having their own moral compass they're just basically a blank slate the tv and
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:50.280]  the culture programs and they just go along with whatever fad is projected on their brains
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.720]  but i appreciate your call there is a big awakening happening the globalists are concerned

[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.560]  the air how you doing mr. jones i'm just getting more and more freaked out if you're asking how
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.720]  i'm doing i mean it's just all coming through i wish i was wrong i know i know i was outside my
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:39.160]  day at my door and the state troopers on my road it was pulling people over and all the plates
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.080]  specified what county they was from and it wasn't from my county i mean hillbill county
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.760]  me you got an mjgf they're getting rid of all state sovereignty merging all the law enforcement
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:55.640]  go ahead sir yes sir and um another thing if they can stop people on my route without a
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.200]  probable cause then why are they griping about the ones who are stopping who are the illegals
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.360]  they're not they're griping for the because they want to bring the illegals in as a voting block
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.480]  to vote out our guns and our private property because the illegals over 90 vote for that when
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:15.400]  they get naturalized and then become citizens or when they cheat and and vote illegally and so
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.440]  they're tools of the new world order and and i mean of course of course i mean a warrantless

[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:41.240]  and we try to tell them how it's controlled and and and the media does what they're told to do
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.840]  they just don't bite they're just dead they're just dead people they're waking them up well
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.840]  that's why the globalists are moving against them and taking everything they've got because the
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.280]  globalists say look we got this scum these people are weak take them down they didn't do that before
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.360]  in this country because people wouldn't put up with it but now they say look we got chumps here

[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:57.960]  on eras one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one now barack obama became the first
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:04.440]  president to ever chair the un security council and we cover this in my film fall the republic
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.720]  we have a little clip of cnn admitting this is what really runs the un it has all the power of
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:15.480]  the general assembly is a debating club uh it violates uh what article one section nine
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:22.520]  nine of the u.s constitution in fact guys give me one of the uh fall the republics because
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.920]  i want to read the back the back has a section of the constitution i believe my memory serves
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:32.600]  but i want to make sure uh that i am correct about that i mean i know it violates constitution
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.960]  i'm going to give you the exact subsection they did that to set the precedent that's why they
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:43.880]  had kissinger and all these global diplomats and world leaders there and they were just gasped
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:49.320]  when he became the head of the united nations because that was illegal that was treasonous that
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:58.280]  was uh treacherous what happened and it's the same thing you've got all these members of the
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.720]  kenyan government of their parliament coming out his grandmother saying yes he was born here
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.040]  born in this village you have them with the fake uh not even birth certificate but fake
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.400]  receipt of a birth certificate you separately have the fact that he did give up his u.s citizenship
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:20.520]  to indonesia under federal law with that country at that time that uh makes it to where uh he is not
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:27.640]  a person who's eligible for president regardless that's a fact that he his real name is barry sataro
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:34.920]  he became an indonesian citizen uh clearly born in kenya and this was done to set the
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:43.000]  precedent just like obama becoming the head of the un security council yes i was correct president
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.040]  obama brazenly violated article one section nine of the u.s constitution by seating himself at the
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.520]  head of the united nations security council thus becoming the first u.s president to chair the
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:36:01.720]  world body that's covered in the film fall of the republic but the issue here is this is done by design
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.720]  they stopped declaring war after world war two so that the executive branch could set up a
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:14.520]  dictatorship and cut congress out of the loop that's illegal that's treason but we've had korea
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:20.840]  vietnam desert storm one desert storm two all these other military operations that are war
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:26.120]  they even call it war on the news before they're a little more careful and called it police action
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.240]  because it was so illegal now they just say yeah it's a war the iraq war the afghan war and all the
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:37.480]  other wars they're running just like they come out now and say yeah the u.s marines and army
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.640]  are growing the opium it's at record levels of production and we are helping ship it out to the
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:47.320]  united states and they say because if we don't al qaeda will get it and sell it well that's what
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.320]  they told our troops in vietnam but we've got to ship this opium out plus you get a bunch of money
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.760]  from it guys and we've got to corrupt you and you can even go back to the u.s when you get out of
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:01.160]  the military and be a regional drug dealer for us will make you a police chief you know over a city
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.360]  that's how this corruption works because we can't let the commies get the opium that's turned into
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:16.680]  heroin so that said the fact that he isn't an indonesian citizen the fact that he never gave
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:22.920]  up that citizenship the fact that he had to basically give up his u.s citizenship to do that
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:29.560]  at the time the fact that he was adopted that is an in your face event and then they say we're liars
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:35.560]  we're terrorist it it doesn't exist we just don't like obama no this is all illegal this is setting
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.760]  precedence to have a president who's at the head of the u.n while he's president serving a foreign
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:47.000]  power you know you can't even take a knighthood when you're in government and a bunch of people
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.600]  done it that's illegal i mean a president can't serve on the board of the corporation when he's
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:58.760]  president that's illegal well it's even more illegal to be the head of a world government body
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:03.800]  that's calling for the end of national sovereignty but even if it was a good organization it'd be
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.560]  illegal that is illegal article one section nine of the u.s constitution go read it it's
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:13.320]  like hillary clinton what the federal government had to pay a four hundred and something thousand
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.600]  dollar fine in the mid nineties when she went to a boulderberg group meeting and it came out that
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.080]  policy was being set in the meeting and so taxpayers had to pay that fine for hillary now
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:27.400]  governors go presidents go they just don't care they don't care if it's illegal
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:38.360]  and it's the exact same thing with barack obama the exact same thing he knows what he's doing
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:43.960]  and that's why he's had michelle three months ago come out and say when we went to the country of
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:51.400]  his birth you know when we went to the his homeland of kenya and then now we have a 1997 video when
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.920]  he was a u.s senator from illinois where she is saying basically the same thing so let's play
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:03.880]  the original video of her uh at a gay and lesbian event a AIDS event uh talking about it then we'll
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:10.360]  play the newest clip here it is grounding hiv testing which is still plaguing so many of our
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:16.840]  communities uh which you all know a lot of that is due to homophobia uh barack has led by example
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:25.000]  when we took our trip to africa and visited his home country in kenya uh we took a public hiv test
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.480]  uh for the very point of showing uh folks in kenya that there is nothing to be embarrassed
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:39.720]  now let's play this newest clip that just surfaced of michelle obama this time almost three years ago
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:46.520]  saying similar things here it is about a block just cheering and waving and the level of excitement
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:53.960]  what that reminded me of was our trip to africa um two years ago um and the level of excitement that
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:59.720]  we felt in that country the hope that people saw just in the sheer presence of somebody like barack
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:07.640]  obama a kenyan a black man a man of great statesmanship who they believe could change the
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:17.080]  fate of the world we are building in a country that is too mean and she goes on to repeat
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:23.160]  similar things now if that's not enough here's obama last week at the white house correspondence
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:29.960]  dinner making a joke about his approval rating is low here but at least in the country uh of his
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  birth it's higher here it is for my approval ratings which have just gone down but that's politics
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:43.880]  it doesn't bother me besides i happen to know that my approval ratings are still very high in the
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:41:02.920]  country of my birth so uh huh it's so funny and you can see the media people going you can watch
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.840]  their faces when they cut the crowd you can see all these media personalities going that is the
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.160]  country of his birth you can even read the woman's lips she's going that is the country of his
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:17.960]  birth they're all going yeah he's kenyan it's in your face hey he's gonna head the un while he's
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.000]  president he's gonna swear an oath to them while he's president hey he's gonna make jokes and then
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.440]  he went on to say there aren't several hidden provisions in the health care bill there are
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:33.320]  hundreds that's actually true because it ties into the u.s code and into the boards that set the
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:39.960]  policy uh he goes on to make jokes about the drone attacks which are real like bush saying no wmd's
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:50.200]  here no wmd's there this is in your face in your face rubbing your face in it and he went on to say

[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:32.280]  we didn't know that would happen up that these engineers that's 101 that when you raise taxes

[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:20.840]  when you're on the air i just feel like you know i'm 22 years old i'm working in boston i've worked
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:26.600]  in many different jobs and i think like now or now talk like during these days these past few days
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:32.440]  i've been seeing this a lot of people coming to me about what's going on with you know the police
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:37.480]  state people are worried about getting pulled over everywhere but according to the news everyone loves
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:43.720]  it uh because you thank god they were running a drill when the bomber hit like they are every time
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:48.680]  thank god they saved us i mean we've got to give up all our freedoms and and and and pay all our
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:57.000]  taxes and let the banks take over because if we don't al qaeda will get us oh yeah absolutely it's
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:02.440]  it's just ridiculous i i really appreciate you telling the people the complete truth about whatever
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:09.240]  is going on it's just so disgusting to watch mr obama up on screen basically telling everybody
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:14.760]  that yeah you're getting raced of your money and all sorts of things it's like i'm looking at my life
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.480]  and what it could be like 20 years down the road and i want to have a private property i want to
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.120]  be able to like live my life the way i want to live in basically you basically you're saying you're
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:30.040]  a terrorist yeah that's exactly what i'm saying it's it's it's absolutely ridiculous and it's
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.520]  and it bothers me how do we think how do we think the communists we're going to take america over
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.760]  and again communists that work for the big banks to steal our wealth the international level
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:43.480]  they were gonna stage terror attacks they were gonna do it in the name of protecting us that's how
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:49.640]  it's always done and now it's happening alex i think the most frustrating thing for people of
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:53.720]  my age and i think many people of my age and even the people that work with you can say the same
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:59.880]  thing that that the people that are about you know 50 to 60 years old that had been you know
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:04.760]  you know with the regular media for their entire lives like including my stepfather my family
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:10.280]  they just they don't know what the truth is they just look at the box and think that everything
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.680]  that comes through it is the truth and it's just it's so aggravating because when you start talking
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:19.320]  about the real issues with people they don't even want to talk about it they want to see and tv tv's
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:24.200]  all designed like you know they're reading off the teleprompter and the info babe's smiling at you
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:29.160]  and it's it's all about how they're going to keep you safe and we're your friends and the government
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:34.600]  loves you and oh we hope the tea party didn't do the bombing but don't worry we've got the army
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:41.960]  training to take them on anybody that criticizes the loving bankers wants to hurt children i mean
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:47.880]  it's just such elementary brainwashing oh it's absolutely ridiculous it's like uh you know i
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:53.640]  went through the public school systems and when i was you know about uh five you know in the fifth
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.800]  grade you know with the mcalf that came out and then all of a sudden bush took office and we got
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:02.360]  the no child left behind act i mean i didn't think about it and i mean i didn't really care but
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.440]  when i got out of it i'm thinking i'm like how do these people get through school like i'm looking
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.760]  at the grade younger than me and it's like they're they're getting caught these ridiculous you know

[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:20.280]  will set fire to restaurants and attack people like they did with torches in santa cruz or i wonder
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:24.440]  i wonder if they'll attack police again and then it won't even be on the national news
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:30.440]  or you know continue to have their all their refight beans all over all over our capital
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:40.440]  and then the other thing is that the sun's team the owner of the sun's team farger has actually

[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:08.440]  what's going on tonight is that they are wearing their spanish jerseys tonight and what we're trying

[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:37.400]  to kick us out because we were handed out freedom to fascism you know oh yeah no no no you don't go
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:43.160]  to a republican neocon tea party and have not hand out a disc calling for an audit of the fed
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:48.120]  made by a jewish guy because criticizing the federal reserve is anti-semitic you know that's
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:56.040]  the spin whenever i'm going to again they make it about that and invoke the race but uh and and and
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:02.440]  class stuff but how dare you try to hand out american freedom to fascism that is so evil
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:09.560]  you don't criticize the irs they're good the thing is that the guy said oh you're not allowed here
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:13.960]  and everything and you know we were just you know out there handing out movies we weren't drinking
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:18.440]  like a bunch of them were you know just remember that that's the tea party express not the real tea
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:23.480]  party and they're having trouble taking it over they had some success but people woke up and so just
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:27.800]  let all those republicans they want to lose their bank accounts and pension funds they want to lose
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:33.240]  their bill of rights they love naked body scanners don't worry you know if they if they're successful
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:38.520]  the republicans will come in and continue everything obama did and then the democrats will put another
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.520]  democrat in and they'll feel like their winners and then it'll just keep going and we'll all be
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:49.800]  idiot slaves so how did this end well it ended that we handed out 300 dvds of freedom to fascism

[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:20.280]  taxing authority now we'll explain how coming up but right now let's go to mark in maryland you're
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:27.320]  on the air how you doing sir pretty good my friend i just want to uh if it's okay make a few quick
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:32.680]  bullet points i'll try to be quick because i know you don't have a lot of time um first thing is i
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:39.640]  wanted to get your take on uh bill marr because i've used to be a fan but it seems like now it
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:44.200]  seems like he's just a part of it i mean i don't know if he's a part of the media that he plays
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:49.880]  the part of a left gatekeeper he'll admit vaccines have got a problem because you know that's very
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:55.400]  popular and most americans know that's the truth now despite the propaganda uh and he'll lie every
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:00.280]  time there's a dust storm he says is global warming now he pushes the police state i mean bill marr
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:09.080]  bill marr's a political operative i mean i i don't i don't doubt it because now when i listen to him
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.880]  it just really seems like he's helping push the agenda and that's because bush is out of power
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:21.160]  when the democrats are in power their supporters and hacks and pundits and and and proxies uh
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:26.680]  they then are the establishment and the republicans are posing as anti-terror now as soon as they
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:31.800]  change places again it's a it's a tag team it's like a wrestling match between halt kogan and jesse
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:37.720]  ventura it's not real as jesse has said it's not real but you tell kids i mean i'm never being a
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:41.880]  kid in dallas and i'd be at a friend's house watching wrestling and i'd say look that's not real
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:46.360]  and they'd say shut up alex it is real and the general public you just you know that they're still
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:53.000]  republicans are still the republican party is good and i like them and the democrats are the
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.360]  bob obama's good and i like them and that's why they're robbing us people have just got to grow
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:06.840]  up and get into issues and become constitutionalist not partisan twits i agree sir and two things
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:12.440]  real quick and i'll let you go um lastly three real quick george carlin he was a bill morris
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.200]  from the george carlin camp and i know george carlin would probably agree with you on everything
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.280]  so i don't understand this and well george carlin you know we have an interview with him
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:25.160]  in truth rising about nine eleven truth and he he said he said he thinks nine eleven's a lie
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:29.720]  and i don't agree with george carlin on on god and stuff but i mean george carlin was real
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:34.920]  and wasn't a political hack he said there's a club and you ain't in it there's a global elite
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:39.640]  they're dumbing you down with the schools so george carlin was about 90 percent right
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:46.040]  and uh and uh bill marz about 20 percent right so two different two different animals please let's
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:51.000]  not compare george carlin uh who i'm a fan of him on most issues and i really think he was a
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.560]  very talented person uh with uh with the other person okay the last thing real quick uh
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:02.280]  dr steve greer i know you don't like to get involved with the ufo talk because it scares away
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:06.840]  people but i've heard steve uh dr greer talk about the same stuff you're talking about about the
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:12.200]  hidden agenda of the government that we don't know about and and what about hawking last statement
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:15.720]  is that it you think has anything to do with project blue beam you know i mean to cover that
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:20.840]  forever and and steven hawking's the physicist said we shouldn't be trying to contact other
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:25.880]  civilizations which they've been doing for 50 years chances are they're going to predatorily
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:32.600]  come in here and and take over uh but the space is so big that unless it's interdimensional travel
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.720]  i mean it there's probably so much life out there if you want my opinion on all this uh
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:43.800]  like christ said i have other flocks there is so much so much life out there that we're probably
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:49.640]  like a amoeba floating along uh you know in a stream in the middle of a forest they're not
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:54.920]  particularly focused uh on the amoeba uh and i'm not saying we're not important and we're part of
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.360]  this larger system and we're going to grow into something even more amazing uh but listen i don't
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:05.240]  mind people that talk about tuba cabras and aliens and i mean that's interesting and i think it's
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:09.960]  okay to people thinking and debating and outside the political box that's probably a healthy thing
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:15.960]  overall and the whole disclosure project and the rest of it i mean good lord only knows what's
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:22.760]  going on the army is admittedly training to confiscate our guns in mainstream news and the public
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:29.800]  it calls it a conspiracy theory so i don't get off into uh you know all the other things that
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:36.440]  are going on and alien technology and things like that because because i can't bonafide prove it
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:42.040]  but but i don't slight those that want to research it and uh look at it you know like coast to coast
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:46.120]  am you know they have some shows where they cover the federal reserve in the new world order they
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.680]  have other shows where they cover you know uh you know our our aliens visiting the planet
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:56.360]  that that's number one talk show in the country uh at night uh second biggest show in the world
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:04.520]  after limbaugh 16 million listeners conservatively um and so you know i think it's it's fine what
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:08.920]  coast to coast is doing because it's at least getting people to debate and think it's not
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:14.520]  a judgment i'm making that i don't cover those subjects it's just that i'm dealing with the
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:19.560]  health care takeover i'm dealing with the census i'm dealing with the wars i'm dealing with the
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.440]  nanotechnology that they're putting into the food and vaccines i'm just sticking to what
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:29.880]  is absolutely immediate and i know i can do something about it and believe me if i'm out
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:34.920]  camping six months from now and a flying saucer lands in front of me and little green men walk off
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:42.360]  of it i'm going to be talking about it on air but i have not seen uh you know uh martians and and
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:49.160]  and so i don't cover martians uh but a lot of astronauts say that they have seen UFOs and so it's

[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.480]  the health care bill was written by the insurance companies that's now come out we've had ron paul
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:34.840]  on lord montan others to break that down dr paul craig roberts economist that's in the subsections
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:41.320]  we've covered it uh... this is corporate welfare well now fema that's the shadow government system
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:45.320]  is expanding flood plains and i was getting a bunch of calls the last two weeks about this
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:53.320]  uh... i know some folks that have a little lake cabin and it is just probably a hundred yards
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:38:00.040]  away from water sixty seventy feet from where the you know the lake uh... has ever flooded
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:05.640]  and massive massive insurance that they have been told the federal government says you've got to buy
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:11.720]  and fema underwrites it fema gets a big cut of it and we've got this tv report a levy official
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:17.240]  fema plans to scam to raise money rob rash ceo and chief engineer the levy district
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:21.560]  made his accusation saturday during a candidate forum rash cold candidates that fema officials
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:25.880]  told him the agency owes twenty billion to the u.s treasury and the way they can get it
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:31.080]  is through flood insurance premiums and so uh... but but it's also the precedent
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:35.000]  of this being set up where they're going to start making people buy flood insurance who
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.920]  were five thousand feet above sea level i mean this is really happening and it's another form
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:46.280]  it's like all the bills new ones every year on your cell phone bill now they want computer
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:50.840]  service charges for your internet uh... now they want all these other environmental fees
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:57.880]  just hundreds of new taxes all across the country uh... are coming and it's just destroying us so
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:03.400]  we appreciate uh... rob rash for joining us sir thank you thank you alex i appreciate the time
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:08.600]  you bet okay uh... i mean tell us about yourself what's happened what fema said in these meetings
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:13.800]  alex when we met with fema in washington dc they told us point blank that uh...
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.480]  that that they had twenty billion dollars worth of debt that they had to repay from
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:21.080]  hurricanes katrina and rita and the only way they had to recoup that money was through flood
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:28.120]  insurance premiums and and what they are doing in 2004 the congress uh... started the map modernization
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:34.120]  program and directed fema to update their maps but the update was just to digitize these existing
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:42.680]  maps for ease of replacement and renewal in 2006 uh... fema began a map modernization program or
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:48.840]  or a uh... or the midcourse adjustment post katrina which incorporated levies and definition
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.760]  of floodplain and what fema's doing is they are redefining floodplain across the country
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:59.960]  and requiring flood insurance so that they can recoup the money lost through hurricane katrina
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:05.240]  rita and and so what they're doing is areas that have never bought flood insurance in the past
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:11.160]  are now being at least either strongly recommended or required to purchase flood insurance and this
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:17.000]  will affect forty percent forty percent of the country uh... there's a forty percent chance that
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:24.040]  you will be caught up in this scam uh... the reason that it is a scam is because if you go to any
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:29.320]  any insurance company in the country and buy flood insurance policy fema underwrites every
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:35.320]  single one of those policies fema is setting the rules fema is defining the floodplain
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:41.480]  and they are also were setting the the insurance requirements for the purchase and they get a
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:46.760]  percentage of that money's input into a fund correct that is correct uh... they they get
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:51.960]  that money will go to the u.s. treasury or as supposed to be to go to u.s. treasury to repay
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:59.000]  the debt incurred by katrina now the with the midcourse adjustment that was all written within
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.840]  the bureaucracy that was not mandated by congress the 2004 bill uh... map modernization program
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:10.680]  was mandated by congress the midcourse adjustment was all done within fema in the bureaucracy
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:16.360]  and that is what incorporated the redefinning of floodplain and what fema is doing is they
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:22.440]  are completely ignoring the the flood control structures that have been constructed the last
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:28.280]  hundred years across this country and if you are affected at all protected at all by a man-made
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:33.320]  structure you will buy some form of flood insurance and it will affect forty percent of the population
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:39.480]  of this country so if you live even anywhere near a dam or anywhere near a levy or or or or or or
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:45.400]  any type of army corps of engineer uh... program they're now going to have this expanded tax and
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:49.080]  fema have also read but correct me if i'm wrong as i've just seen it here and there in the news
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:54.760]  that they're also saying we may not allow building in expanded areas now and so it's federal
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:01.800]  jurisdiction over where you can build what you can do federal control over the levees districts
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:07.880]  over the counties just a giant scam and if they get away with this the sky's the limit
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:12.520]  alex what they're doing right now is that every one of these every one of these municipalities
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:17.800]  across the country that is facing the map modernization or the remapping of their area
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:22.680]  they are sending ordinance from fema and i'll quote you from that ordinance this ordinance states
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:29.240]  uh... that that that they will limit that this or this uh... this municipality anyone that that
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:34.920]  that requires this or or adopt this ordinance will limit any unwise development in flood
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:40.840]  plains well who determines what unwise development is and and adverse impacts of flood plain
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:46.440]  development and what fema is doing is taking areas that people have lived and and and and
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:51.400]  raised families and and and businesses for hundreds of years and built flood control
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.400]  structures to protect themselves and they're negating these flood control structures and
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:01.480]  requiring insurance behind them in an effort to limit development and and this will destroy
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:07.240]  economic development in in numerous areas across the country and and i'll give you an example
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:12.520]  collinsworth indiana collinsworth illinois uh... the federal government and the us army core
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:18.520]  of engineers came in and built a levee system from scratch that that that exceeded the 500
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:24.760]  year level of protection under these new requirements issued by fema these levees no
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:30.360]  longer meet those requirements and although they they passed a hundred year flood in 93
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:37.400]  and 97 and protected the people of collinsville in illinois uh... they now are are considered a
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:42.520]  high risk area in all are required to buy the highest amount of flood insurance the highest
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:47.480]  well here's another example take areas of florida louisiana mississippi areas of texas
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:53.320]  there's a lot of families and individuals that bought over the last hundred years cheap property
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:58.840]  uh... they're building golf courses hotels on it i i mean you name it but people own it
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:05.080]  and i've seen articles in different newspapers where now fema and others are just saying look
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:11.320]  you can't build here anymore and if people choose to build a beach house is 20 feet off the ground
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:16.040]  because they want to be on the beach that's their business and if they don't want to have it ensured
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:21.320]  they shouldn't be forced to get that insurance but so i mean this is really tyranny and we see
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:27.400]  where this is leading just where the sky's the limit right and and what's gonna happen is fema
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:34.040]  is is requiring these municipalities to accept this ordinance or they will withhold funding for
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:39.720]  any emergency management uh... any emergency uh... whether it be a tornado whether it be an earthquake
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:44.920]  whether it be any type of emergency they are they are threatening withholding of funding
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:51.800]  unless these maps are are are accepted by the local municipality and as part of that they have got
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:58.120]  to accept floodplain management which requires everything to be elevated above that quote hundred
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:03.080]  year flood elevation as determined by fema so basically this is worse than federalization
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:09.800]  and the violation of the ninth and tenth amendment this is unelected executive branch fema basically
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:15.800]  saying look forty percent of this country we're now in control of it we're the boss
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:21.000]  we run your county we we run your city we run your state that is correct that is exactly
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:26.840]  what they're doing and and they are holding they are holding future federal federal federal funding
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:31.880]  for any type of disaster uh... as as as uh... they're dangling that carried in front of
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:36.520]  let's be clear they take our state money and on average send about thirty three cents back with
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:41.160]  strings attached that's correct
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:46.840]  i tell you pretty soon won't be able to do anything without fema's permission and if they pass this
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:54.120]  carbon tax law home inspections federal zoning laws it just goes on and on i i'm getting a lot of
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:58.280]  feedback on this and i'm seeing a lot of news articles where local flood managers and people
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:04.120]  are really upset by this uh... so it looks like at least some people are becoming aware
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:08.280]  of what's happened is there any way to stop this there is a way to stop it congress can
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:13.320]  congress can can stop this uh... it it takes it takes quite a few congressmen i'll give you
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:18.520]  an example in two thousand seven uh... there was a bill that passed through the senate requiring
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:24.600]  mandatory flood insurance across the board uh... behind or or protected by any man made
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:30.840]  structure uh... it passed with only four four votes against the senate uh... it did not it came out
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:35.960]  of the uh... out of the senate insurance committee uh... which chairman uh... dodd uh... senator
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:41.320]  dodd is chairman and and it passed uh... with only four descending votes however we now have
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:47.080]  sixteen senators that are against this mandatory flood insurance and what fema is doing uh...
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:52.440]  and and this letter has been sent to fema several meetings have been have uh... have occurred with
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:58.120]  fema to slow this down through the bureaucracy but it has to be stopped and it'll have to be stopped
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:04.840]  through the congress okay reading this article from k a tv television and this is out of truman
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:12.040]  arkansas uh... it says uh... an official at the saint france's levy district says recommendations
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:16.600]  by the federal emergency management agency for local landowners to purchase flood insurance
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:21.720]  are nothing more than a scam rob rash ceo and chief engineer the levy district made this
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:26.920]  accusation saturday during a candidate forum at truman attended by several people hoping to win
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:32.920]  the first district congressional seat rational candidates that fema officials told him the agency
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:36.920]  owes twenty billion of the u.s treasury and the only way they can get is through flood insurance
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:42.440]  premiums part of which fema gets so i mean to be specific though this is not an accusation
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:46.360]  you're saying this was openly said when you were in washington that is correct in the meeting at the
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:52.840]  mayflower hotel with the mississippi valley flood control association and fema and this uh... it's
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:57.880]  not if it's very uh... very clear and fema officials were very clear that the only way that
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:03.240]  they have to get money is through the flood insurance premiums and and that is is is what
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:08.760]  they are pushing uh... they are taking they are taking flood control structures that have federal
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:13.800]  dollars and local dollars and billions of federal dollars and local dollars to protect citizens and
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:18.440]  have been part have been designed constructed and maintained over the last hundred and fifty
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:24.120]  or two hundred years and and they're negating them completely on these flood maps and creating a
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:29.640]  fictitious fear uh... for people of of around certainly around our area for the mississippi
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:34.360]  river we're part of the mississippi river and tributaries project which provides a level of
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:39.640]  protection of that exceeds what fema but that's always i mean i mean the feds don't want development
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:44.760]  many areas they want to be able to control it as part of the rewilding uh... project and
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:46.760]  and
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:49.800]  i've seen the numbers i've had congressman on to cover it but
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:55.880]  most of the money that fema gets is used for c o g continuity of government
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:49:00.120]  uh... you know shadow government type stuff so we also
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:03.400]  and i need to understand that a lot of this flood money is going to other stuff
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:09.000]  right and and i i'm not familiar exactly where fema's money goes but i can tell you that the
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:13.800]  expansion of these flood plain uh... in the redefining of these flood plain
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:16.840]  the redefining of the risk that actually exist
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:22.040]  will will put billions of dollars in fema in fema bank account
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:25.400]  uh... and so this is this is an expansion of the system
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.880]  uh... that that this this just clearly is a scam because
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.640]  you have fema who is setting the limit they're setting the standards
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:37.000]  and they're the ones requiring it so you have what you have all three entities
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:40.520]  under one roof and they're the ones getting the money that is correct
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:44.200]  they have that is correct regardless of where you purchased this blood insurance
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:47.160]  and and this will destroy economic development
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:50.920]  in a number of areas across this country and and i want to read you so that's
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:54.120]  where everybody wants to live is on a river or a lake
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:59.000]  absolutely absolutely this is all part of flood plain management
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.960]  uh... that that was put out this is a this is from an excerpt out of the 93
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:06.600]  flood report uh... which was written
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:11.080]  uh... to uh... to to extend flood plain management to explain flood plain
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:13.320]  management and basically what it does
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:18.920]  is is it state uh... that it's state that people need to be moved from flood
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:22.360]  plain and and and need to be moved to higher ground
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:26.280]  and and what they're doing is they are redefining flood plain
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:29.240]  to extend into forty percent of this country
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:31.960]  let's be clear that is uh... let's come back and talk more about that the final
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:36.200]  segment that is so massive a total takeover and they're saying we don't
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:39.960]  want you living here and it's like the wetlands act

[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:17.000]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network that's right there is a war on for your mind
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:24.120]  we're talking to bob rash and uh he is a chief engineer of the levy district in his area of
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:30.360]  arkansas now again i'm no expert on this but i've i've read over it over the years and correct me
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:36.120]  if i'm wrong until a few decades ago you really couldn't get flood insurance from a private company
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:39.960]  private insurance company if you were in danger of flooding and you just needed to build your house
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:44.760]  and have it on stilts and and and know that you know it's freedom it's america but now
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:49.560]  fema underwrites it so basically you just go into an insurance company they're like a broker
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:54.360]  or like a title company when you buy a house and they get a little piece of it and it goes to fema
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:55:00.040]  and then the government's saying you got to buy this from us uh this is mafia well and and and
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:03.880]  just so you know on a hundred thousand dollar home you're going to spend about twelve hundred
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:07.880]  dollars a year a quarter of a million dollar home you're going to spend about twenty six
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:15.000]  hundred dollars a year per person and and so this is being used uh this is being used as a deterrent
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:21.240]  it's a federal property tax that's correct but the targeted tax is all that it is it's a targeted
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:27.640]  tax and fema is utilizing it because they underwrite the flood insurance policies they are masking it
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:32.920]  with a warning people of the risk and they are overstating every risk that they place on these
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:39.160]  flood maps in an effort to recoup money amazing i mean like i said earlier i know people who are
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:43.880]  up on hilltops and they're and they're getting these letters uh in travis county saying look your
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:50.280]  insurance is going up right and and that will happen throughout this country alex there are a
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:55.480]  number that as i said there will be there will be 40 percent of the of the population of this
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:00.520]  country that will be affected by this and the federal government is is the fema is not warning
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:04.840]  people of of uh they're not warning people of earthquakes they're not warning people of wind
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:09.080]  damage they're not warning people of tornadoes uh because they don't underwrite insurance
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:14.520]  policies for those items uh they're warning people of a fictitious risk of flooding in areas
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:21.560]  that that don't need to be required to buy flood insurance well going back to the point
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:27.320]  in closing that you tried to make as we hit that break this is all based you said on this 93 document
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.000]  and i've seen that document before go back over that document where they're saying
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:38.600]  that the real move is to basically force people out of these areas that is correct the 93 flood
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:45.720]  report which is which is which is named sharing the challenge uh it recommends people move out of
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:52.680]  designated areas which fema now has has begun designating these areas but they use this as a
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:58.760]  uh as a deterrent for economic development or for any type of development in these quote flood
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:05.480]  plain uh however the problem is that fema is redefining these flood plain uh they're redefining
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:10.520]  flood plains and ignoring improvements that have been made through the years with both federal money
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:15.800]  and and local money and and they are they are not acknowledging these flood these flood control
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:22.360]  structures and they are requiring areas they are renaming areas a flood plain and requiring flood
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:28.440]  insurance because of it and it is it is it is written into this into the 21st century and
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:35.160]  the sharing sharing the uh of the challenge uh in the 93 flood report and it and it states very
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:42.760]  clearly uh to use strict years regulations by communities to stop unwise development the problem
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:48.120]  is is that fema is defining these unwise developmental areas now this is this is
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:53.000]  isn't even federal tyranny this is just an agency out of control and they're taking over
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:58.200]  everything they're training the police uh this is a criminal operation we appreciate your courage
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:03.560]  and what you've been doing sir god bless you thank you very much alex and i appreciate you

[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:19.400]  uh congress we've got to get control of fema come on that's why i made the film police stayed for
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:25.800]  the rise of fema and we cover it all in here i mean this is the shadow government coming out of
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:31.240]  the shadows and just taking over everything this is the group merging the military and police
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:36.040]  and training the military for gun confiscation this is the group building the fema camps this
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:43.880]  is the group saying they're gonna force you out of your houses we'll be right back thank you for

[03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:16.600]  the pullboard of calls we've got but i do want to get into the myth of overpopulation explain what's
[03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:21.720]  happening i then want to get into how race-based politics is being used divide and conquer this
[03:00:21.720 --> 03:00:27.160]  society i meant to cover this yesterday didn't get to it we will cover it in this hour of the
[03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:33.240]  broadcast today some of the other news coming up senator Lieberman says deny citizenship to
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:40.760]  suspected terrorists it's a curtain memo story that links into the new york times at gcmlive.com
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:45.960]  that's gcmlive.com we're going to read this senator Lieberman deny citizenship to suspected
[03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:53.400]  terrorist well that means the american people that's like well i'll cover it after i take some
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:57.960]  calls but that's like rama manual saying if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:03.160]  that's a quote if we think possibly maybe you could be possibly a terrorist uh then you'll be
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:08.840]  denied the right to own guns no judge no jury no fly no buy you're on a no fly list no buy i mean
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:12.920]  they're really getting rid of our system of law and checks and balances in this country
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:17.560]  uh and it's just incredible uh let's uh go to matt in maryland matt you're on the air go ahead
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:22.680]  how you doing alex i'm all right my friend it's good talking to you hey i just want to let you
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:29.160]  know your work is uh just astounding and everything you're doing seems to be working as far as my
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:35.400]  office is concerned we've woken three people up well awakened i should say three people up at work
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:42.440]  just this week alone great job and uh it's working it's paying off you know uh i've actually got one
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:47.240]  i'm convinced you know that hey this is the truth this is the way it's working and then and it's
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:52.360]  unfortunate but i mean listen listen 15 years ago when i got on air and others were talking
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:59.640]  it wasn't all out in the open it's out in the open now i mean certainly and uh we're very tutorial
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:05.480]  our wonderful friend our leader he uh that's a name that a lot of people at the office just had
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:13.640]  new clue about no no no perception that they hate that this is a giant lie a giant lie that the name
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:19.720]  barack obama do you even know what it means in aramaic have you heard that alex uh i've read
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:28.520]  it before i refresh my memory in aramaic barack means from the height or lightning i should
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:37.880]  say i apologize for lightning Zeus yes where obama in aramaic means from the height now if you
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:49.240]  leave read isaac the direct reference to satan is lightning from the height that's right and
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:55.640]  that's why the uh runic in in uh germanic tribes uh you know lightning falling from the sky
[03:02:55.640 --> 03:03:01.240]  i you know the twin lightning bolts i'll have to look that up i had remembered seeing that before
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:07.720]  but that's just incredible that he would choose the fake name lightning from the heights uh
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:11.560]  but regardless we know his real name is berry sataro i mean that was being talked about two
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:17.320]  years ago it's now admitted and he was an indonesian citizen game over but now his wife and clip
[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:22.520]  after clip says we went back to his home country he's kenyan we went back and then he makes jokes
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:26.840]  about it and says yeah my approval rating is low here but not in the country of my birth
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:34.120]  and everybody laughs i mean this is flaunting this and again it sets a precedent first president
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:42.600]  to be you in secretary of the security council first uh i mean it's just amazing what do we
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:48.520]  know about this guy but notice how the bigger the lie is hitler said the more they'll buy it
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:53.960]  who would imagine that they would take somebody who was a foreigner and somebody who was
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:04:00.760]  clearly with a fake name and make him the president it's just so big and it may have
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:05.240]  something to do with it coming out later and then they'll have to change the 22nd amendment
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:11.080]  so swartzy swartzenegger can be president there you go and that that's what i was thinking about
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:15.880]  earlier when you were discussing just that while i was watching now before you came on today
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:21.240]  but then one more thing and i'll mean to take up all your time this uh terrorist attempt in new york
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:27.720]  yes it's uh it's a little odd now that you know at first we couldn't find out who was responsible
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:33.800]  for this that way they could just blame everybody oh the tea parties yeah and now i guess well we've
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:38.520]  noticed that the truth movement seems to be gaining power they seem to be doing a great job at uh
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:46.120]  uh opening people up waking them up why don't we just blame it back on uh al qaeda to validate the
[03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:51.160]  fact that it was all okay to begin with well we know that they were clearly running a drill
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:56.200]  eyewitnesses and others not just the cop are saying this we need to investigate this further
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:05:01.560]  because they run drills to cover up the stage terror attack every time we ride back they helped to
[03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:08.200]  create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new world order based upon collective
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:13.000]  action invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and

[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:34.840]  on just listing on the am and fm dial global shortwave satellite the internet
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:44.760]  had in full wars dot com and xm radio i was on my facebook this morning one of our facebook
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:52.200]  accounts alexander emrick jones account is the name of it and i was aware of the population
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:09:00.280]  research institute and their great work but they have produced three animated videos and we're
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:08.600]  going to play those right now for everybody that is patiently tuned in to see this information
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:14.920]  but you can also just go up to our facebook account and the videos are posted at the top
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:22.200]  or you can simply well i've had curtain demo also post these at info wars dot com and write an
[03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:28.840]  article about them and then this dovetails into the government and the social engineers
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:33.560]  trying to implement race war not just here in the united states but all over the planet
[03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:38.440]  as a tool to divide and conquer the populations against each other now listen if you go to the
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:44.360]  un's own official documents they say that the next 20 years this piece is 30 they're being
[03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:49.400]  conservative that the earth's population will stabilize between eight and nine billion people
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:10:03.240]  that's just a fact and once a country industrializes you see a 1.5 or lower population replacement
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:09.240]  rate now that means for every two parents for every two people that are born not all of them
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:16.760]  even become parents but to just replace the population let's say you have 300 million americans
[03:10:16.760 --> 03:10:23.720]  but you don't have immigration you know hypothetically to have 300 million americans in the next
[03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:28.840]  generation the generation after that you need to have 2.1 2.2 2.3 depending on the numbers
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:38.280]  you look at so you need to have more than two people uh being born to the average family
[03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:46.440]  to be able to just keep the numbers we've got now japan's 1.2 italy is 1.3 and dropping
[03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:53.800]  if this continues in less than a decade they say japan won't even be having one child
[03:10:54.520 --> 03:11:03.080]  for every two japanese and that goes all the way down to extinction within 300 years no more japanese
[03:11:03.080 --> 03:11:12.680]  no more italyans no more germans now america has gone from 260 something million 30 years ago
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:19.560]  to 310 million now but the united states has a replacement rate of about 1.5
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:24.200]  of americans that were already here that matter of your black white hispanic asian
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:27.960]  so the only reason our population is growing is because they're bringing in new people and we've
[03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:34.120]  had more than 50 million abortions since 1973 with rovey wade and that's just about the number of
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:37.160]  legals and illegals that have been brought in since then and the government says well
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:41.960]  we've got to have these people to replace because we've killed our workforce we've we've we've killed
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:48.520]  america the death of the west i mean this is really happening and you know i talk about this all
[03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:55.560]  the time uh you see all these black activists in fact i saw it last night on cnn uh where a
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:12:02.120]  hollywood actress sandra bullock adopted a poor homeless black baby and the black groups a bunch
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:05.880]  of them came out and said what's this white woman want a black kid for why don't you get a white
[03:12:05.880 --> 03:12:14.120]  kid you're just doing this to act liberal that's how sick these groups are you've got 52 last year
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:22.120]  some years it's even higher 52 percent of black people uh on average not being born since rovey
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:29.080]  wade more than half the black people that would exist in the united states don't exist
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:35.640]  that's why the black population is basically stable the eugenics program of saying it's
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:41.000]  liberal to have abortions uh pushing them on black people pushing them on other minorities
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:47.880]  have been successful by the globalist in these depressed economic areas now regardless of where
[03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:55.080]  you stand on that how sickening is it that that the black media owned by big corporations is so
[03:12:55.880 --> 03:13:03.000]  big on keeping everyone divided that you will never hear them talk about what good folks like
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:08.920]  the the people that run black genocide dot com are exposing and it is a fact over 50 percent of
[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:13.560]  black people are not born and then how dare somebody actually adopt that baby it'd be better
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:19.800]  that baby just dead now that's the death culture that margaret sanger and the rockefellers and
[03:13:19.800 --> 03:13:25.320]  the new world order have sold the black community now they're moving into all communities in fact
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:39.160]  right here is a cnn report where they came out a couple weeks ago on earth day and said we need
[03:13:39.160 --> 03:13:44.760]  to have a one child policy in the united states at the copenhagen treaty last year in december
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:51.160]  they officially the un called for a global one child policy now if you have a global one child
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:57.880]  policy that will more than reduce the population within one generation of half of the earth's
[03:13:57.880 --> 03:14:04.120]  population okay now they sell all these myths that there's too many people we're gonna have
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:08.360]  a hundred billion people on the planet when the un doesn't even say that humans are killing
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:13.240]  everything on and on and on but if you industrialize the third world every nation that has become
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:19.480]  industrialized stops having as many children because this modern industrialized systems run
[03:14:19.480 --> 03:14:26.600]  by eugenicists where they're targeting the population but i wanted to play some videos
[03:14:27.480 --> 03:14:35.880]  here for folks that were put out by the population research institute over population myth
[03:14:35.880 --> 03:14:41.000]  dot com and again this is also up on info wars dot com but here i found those articles uh here's a
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:47.960]  time magazine um with a report on reducing the population here's cnn in fact give me a document
[03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:53.400]  cam shot please i want to go through these for folks here's a times of london article first
[03:14:54.600 --> 03:14:58.360]  doctor sterilize usbeck women by stealth
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:08.440]  when her baby died soon after delivery and it mentions the woman's name the 28 year old poor
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:14.120]  farmer's wife long to be pregnant again after months of trying she and her husband visited
[03:15:14.120 --> 03:15:17.720]  a doctor who told her she could never have another child because she had been sterilized
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:23.480]  and then it talks about how the government is involved in a un program getting aid loan this
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:29.960]  is under state department random 200 with kissinger where if if these countries in india and and
[03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:35.960]  peru and nigeria and countless other third world nations they don't get their imf and world bank
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:40.920]  money kind of like the states don't get their highway funds if they don't accept national
[03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:46.760]  id cards but the illegals are exempt or fema just comes in and says we own 40 of the land now you
[03:15:46.760 --> 03:15:54.600]  gotta pay us a a federal property tax is basically what it is what we just covered last hour for
[03:15:54.600 --> 03:16:00.200]  flood insurance that they make you buy well when you've got the global government above you
[03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:04.920]  they tell your government you're not going to get the federal global money from the global
[03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:09.800]  federal private corporate banking structure the global system the new world order the global
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:14.680]  governance they're openly talking about unless you sterilize half your women and it was george
[03:16:14.680 --> 03:16:20.360]  bush senior before he was a cia director before he was a us ambassador to china and he got china
[03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:25.320]  to it to agree to this the one child policy who orchestrated federal documents have been released
[03:16:25.320 --> 03:16:32.200]  we cover it in my film in game that on indian reservations they sterilized in a two-year period
[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:41.160]  44 of the women the women would go in to have dental work done at the federal office they'd hit
[03:16:41.160 --> 03:16:48.440]  them with you know knockout chemicals or they shoot them up and they tie their tubes well
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:54.920]  here it is in the times of london usbeck women sterilized by stealth and you can read all about
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:17:00.600]  it and how the women didn't even know this had been done to them and we've caught them in thailand
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:05.880]  and other places where the government goes into the poor areas it actually kills the babies they
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:10.120]  give them special vaccines that then kill the babies and then the whole village who's pregnant
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:13.400]  you know the women who are pregnant the village they'll all lose their babies and i would guess
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:17.800]  they probably killed her baby as well you notice the baby died and then suddenly she was sterilized
[03:17:17.800 --> 03:17:22.280]  and the government admits they sterilized her uh here's another one uh this is sky television
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:29.320]  that's fox news in england china sterilized 10 000 to curb births in just one province alone
[03:17:30.200 --> 03:17:34.920]  women who've had already one child are to be picked up by police and to be forcibly sterilized
[03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:41.240]  there you go just to give you an example of the policy they want to hear uh in the united states
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:47.720]  here's another one uh how green is your love life seeing in and it says drive a hybrid car eat
[03:17:47.720 --> 03:17:55.960]  organic and then it says or implement a one child policy they just slip that in and tell us sex is
[03:17:55.960 --> 03:18:00.520]  bad having kids are bad and uh you've got all these pundits on television i know you've probably
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:04.760]  seen it say when you only need to have one child in america we have al gore calling for
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:10.440]  this and you should only have a 2000 square foot house max but he's got uh more than nine houses
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:15.560]  one of them 22 000 square feet one nine thousand square feet he's got two homes in california
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.600]  on the beach but he says the water is going to rise and flood it just a complete criminal liar
[03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:27.880]  so uh that's just some of the news there that i wanted to uh cover but but now let's go ahead
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:32.200]  well we're going to go to break and then i'll play these clips when we come back
[03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:37.320]  we're going to play three different uh video animation clips but the audio is also informative
[03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:42.440]  for radio listeners and uh food there's a lot of it that's the second clip we're going to play
[03:18:43.080 --> 03:18:49.320]  we're also going to play kids stable population 2.1 and we're also going to play over population
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:55.720]  the making of a myth so we're going to come back and play these and then i'm going to dovetail that
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:19:05.560]  into how state department memorandum 200 said if the governments don't sterilize their women
[03:19:06.120 --> 03:19:10.840]  we'll just start wars with their neighbors or fund gorilla groups that'll kill people
[03:19:10.840 --> 03:19:15.880]  or we'll just cut off their food supply and we know the gmo crops in india and other places
[03:19:15.880 --> 03:19:19.800]  have resulted in hundreds of thousands of people dying tens of thousands committing suicide because
[03:19:19.800 --> 03:19:25.080]  there's no money because they bring in gmo crops then they can't get seeds the next year uh it's
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:31.320]  destroy it the chemicals they've used or poisoning the people that's why it's a scientific dictatorship
[03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:36.920]  and that's why in every major study all the major gmo crops that have been approved have the side
[03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:43.160]  effect of sterile of sterilizing mammals or reducing fertility bare minimum and so you're
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:48.600]  eating gmo food right now in the west the honeybees eat it and die and you're wondering why you can't
[03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:53.800]  have children at 25 you've been hitting a hit hard by a chemical biological weapons cocktail
[03:19:53.800 --> 03:20:05.960]  the ride by gold isn't for you ted anderson president of mitis resources one of the world's
[03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:10.920]  premier gold and precious metal investing firms i get it you wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:15.480]  that the government is doing a great job that the fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars

[03:24:11.720 --> 03:24:18.760]  okay let's go to this uh video piece breaking down that you need to have 2.1 children per
[03:24:18.760 --> 03:24:25.480]  family to just eat the population and the entire west including japan every industrialized nation
[03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:31.880]  is not having anywhere near that we are dying ladies and gentlemen and it's in the west where
[03:24:31.880 --> 03:24:36.600]  they're really teaching people not to have children here's the clip from the time of the cavemen all
[03:24:36.600 --> 03:24:41.240]  the way until today humanity continues to exist because each generation of people has produced
[03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:45.880]  another generation to replace itself scientists have figured out how many people need to be born
[03:24:45.880 --> 03:24:51.640]  each generation to replace the generation before that number is one person per person all things
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:56.840]  being equal this creates perfect demographic balance since women are the only ones who can
[03:24:56.840 --> 03:25:01.880]  have children replacing every person on earth means each woman needs to have two children
[03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:07.320]  one to replace her and the other to replace the man who cannot have children the total fertility
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:11.880]  rate is the average number of children each woman in a society is having this number shows us if a
[03:25:11.880 --> 03:25:18.120]  society is growing or shrinking in developed countries the replacement rate birth rate is 2.1
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:23.320]  children per woman this will keep the population stable but even that is assuming that every woman
[03:25:23.320 --> 03:25:30.200]  has children and that there are no wars famines or disease in the real world disasters happen all
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:35.480]  the time and sadly not all children reach adulthood especially in poor countries this pushes their
[03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:40.840]  replacement rate up to 3.3 children per woman since not every woman wants to have children in order
[03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:45.400]  to keep the population stable some women need to have more than 2.1 children to balance the birth
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:50.280]  rate with the women who are only having one or no children at all maintaining this balance is of
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:55.720]  the utmost importance if society does not at least replace itself every generation human numbers
[03:25:55.720 --> 03:26:01.400]  begin to fall exponentially economic and social problems appear as elderly people retiring begin
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:07.160]  to outnumber young people entering the workplace this is already happening all over the developed
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:12.120]  world many of the world's nations are only barely replacing themselves while a growing majority
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:19.800]  have birth rates below replacement some as low as 1.8 or even 1.2 babies per woman many societies
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:30.760]  are facing a very real danger extinction think about it folks okay let's go to the next clip
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:36.680]  food there's lots of it because people say okay well there's not enough food no they pay western
[03:26:36.680 --> 03:26:43.400]  farmers worldwide not to produce food let's go to that clip according to believers in over
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:47.960]  population there are so many of us on the planet that food production cannot possibly keep up
[03:26:49.720 --> 03:26:54.920]  however according to both the un's food and agricultural organization and the world food
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:27:00.760]  program there is currently enough food on the planet for everyone to be well fed not only that
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:05.240]  but we're growing this food on less land than we did in the past this is why if the united states
[03:27:05.240 --> 03:27:10.120]  for example the government can afford to pay farmers not to grow food but instead return their farm
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:15.560]  land to the wild modern technology also allows us to grow food on land where it would have been
[03:27:15.560 --> 03:27:21.880]  impossible to do so even a few years ago agricultural experts even believe that Africa if cultivated
[03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:27.240]  using modern farming methods could eventually feed the whole world all by itself then why are people
[03:27:27.240 --> 03:27:32.600]  in many parts of the world starving the world food program lists key causes of hunger and over
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:38.440]  population is not on that list war one of the leading causes of world hunger destroys crops
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:43.720]  and disrupts relief efforts widespread poverty prevents many from buying the food that they need
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:49.080]  and a lack of infrastructure means that there isn't a reliable way to transport food to areas that
[03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:55.080]  need it this is why reducing the number of hungry people will not make the remaining people less
[03:27:55.080 --> 03:27:59.720]  hungry those who have access to the food will continue to have access to it and those who don't
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:04.280]  will still be hungry reducing population will not magically cause food to be spread around
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:10.120]  default and blaming over population for everything does nothing but distract us from the real problems
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:22.680]  that we actually have think about it perfectly done absolutely accurate that is the facts the
[03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:28.040]  west is dying and the british royal commission by eugenicist by the british government in 49
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:35.320]  said if we industrialize latin america africa and asia they will stop having even their replacement
[03:28:35.320 --> 03:28:41.960]  rate like the west that trend had already kicked in in many western countries but they said if we
[03:28:42.920 --> 03:28:49.160]  do industrialize them though that will make them politically powerful and then we can't control
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:54.120]  them through finance and military so they said what we're going to do is we're going to block
[03:28:54.120 --> 03:28:59.560]  economic development and industrial development then there will be a giant population bloom
[03:28:59.560 --> 03:29:03.800]  but we'll come in with other corrective measures like sterilization cutting off food and water
[03:29:03.800 --> 03:29:10.600]  with war and that's in state apartment random 200 from 1973 and in the cia accompanying
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:15.640]  memorandum and of course it's in the book eco science written by the white house science czar
[03:29:16.200 --> 03:29:23.160]  john p holdren with paul r earlick that they were just talking about uh in that piece we're
[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:27.080]  going to come back with the final video that actually talks about earlick and mouth is
[03:29:27.080 --> 03:29:33.720]  and where these lies came from it came from the british eugenicists now we're going to cover proto
[03:29:33.720 --> 03:29:40.600]  eugenics the the roots of the roots to understand this and what the world government's stated goal
[03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:45.800]  is for the new world order world governments only the beginning forced global extermination
[03:29:45.800 --> 03:29:51.960]  of 80 to 99 percent they debate if they they'll kill us all this is probably right back we're on

[03:33:06.440 --> 03:33:11.640]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[03:33:13.320 --> 03:33:18.520]  okay i want to get into how race is used to control and divide and conquer and we'll talk about
[03:33:18.520 --> 03:33:25.960]  about the reality of where this self-induced mental illness is going here in just a moment
[03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:33.480]  the round of time yesterday to play professor kamu kamban which is just part of the course
[03:33:33.480 --> 03:33:37.960]  but the point is the academics in the crowd are clapping and smiling and agreeing with him
[03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:41.960]  now we haven't edited the video but i gotta pause at the middle i was gonna play it but
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:48.280]  he says the n word a bunch calling white people the n word and you know you can play this on radio
[03:33:48.280 --> 03:33:51.960]  but he upsets people so i'm just not going to play that part if you want to watch the full video
[03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:57.480]  we'll give you the address if you want to go see it unedited from c span now this happened a few
[03:33:57.480 --> 03:34:03.880]  years ago but the point is this is very popular and this is pushed and this is promoted but he's
[03:34:03.880 --> 03:34:09.000]  got the same view but from another perspective as the globalist that want to reduce everybody's
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:13.880]  numbers i mean he's saying it's white people doing this i'm gonna i'm gonna break this down
[03:34:13.880 --> 03:34:19.640]  because it's just a great illustration but back to population let's play the clip here of over
[03:34:19.640 --> 03:34:25.080]  population the making of a myth that goes with those other two clips we just played and i want
[03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:29.160]  everybody to go to info wars dot com where curtain emos got all three of the articles posted along
[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:33.560]  with an article he wrote and all three of the videos so you can send that to your friends and
[03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:39.640]  family who are brainwashed and think they should pay carbon taxes for every child they have not
[03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:45.480]  only does the government own your house and now it says it owns your body uh as they collectivize
[03:34:45.480 --> 03:34:50.040]  all of our wealth into their hands and all of our rights go out the window uh but let's go ahead
[03:34:50.040 --> 03:34:57.240]  and go to this final clip the myth of overpopulation originated in england in 1798 when a vicar named
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:01.960]  thomas mouthis who fancied himself something of a mathematician saw that food production increased
[03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:08.120]  incrementally but people reproduced exponentially he sat down and did some simple math and summarily
[03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:13.880]  decided that the world would be out of food by 1890 he blamed reduced mortality rates and recommended
[03:35:13.880 --> 03:35:19.560]  killing off the have-nots of society lest the haves starve to death this cry was taken up by
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:25.320]  paul erlich of stanford university in 1968 who claimed that reckless human reproduction had
[03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:30.600]  overwhelmed the earth massive famines would result or which would destroy best case scenario
[03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:36.200]  one fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s and the planet would follow this fear produced large
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:41.880]  donations for the newly created un fpa which thrives on an imagined crisis that has been both imminent
[03:35:41.880 --> 03:35:46.760]  and rescheduled again and again over the past two centuries the truth of the matter is that every
[03:35:46.760 --> 03:35:52.760]  family on this planet could have a house with a yard and all live together on a landmass the size
[03:35:52.760 --> 03:35:58.440]  of texas which is really just a small corner of the planet the population of earth will peak in 30
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:08.440]  years start to go back down we're not overpopulated to the math now they mentioned paul erlich in
[03:36:08.440 --> 03:36:13.080]  that who co-wrote the book with john p holder in the wild house science are calling for drugging the
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:19.160]  water supply to sterilize us but they said you've got to do it incrementally so people don't notice
[03:36:19.160 --> 03:36:24.120]  that the fertility is dropping but now it has they are doing it the government is taking your
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:29.160]  baby's blood at birth i told you that over the decade ago it's now mainstream news it is put in
[03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:37.480]  the colesprings harbor slash un eugenics database the world government follows a religion of eugenics
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:45.000]  and extermination and social Darwinism you better find out about it and we covered it in my film
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:51.640]  end game blueprint for global enslavement because it just didn't get picked up by paul erlich they
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:58.040]  had to be you know simple in a minute and a half paul erlich was a crypto eugenicist and so is the
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:04.360]  white house science are and so are all these people running this system shifting gears now
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:11.240]  i'm just going to play most of this 10 minute clip because yesterday i tried to play it around
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:15.400]  a time and then i'm just going to comment after i'm going to write notes and comment after
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:19.880]  because i'm going to start commenting beforehand it's just that everything this guy is saying is
[03:37:19.880 --> 03:37:27.560]  true except he's saying white people magically are evil no human beings people are people
[03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:34.680]  black african tribes enslaved black african tribes arab tribes have enslaved arab tribes
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:39.960]  most the roman slaves were white white people enslaving white people most of the immigrants
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:47.480]  of the us before 1776 were indentured servants you know i had some family came over as pilgrims on
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:52.040]  the mayflower i had other ancestors that came over as indentured servants and you were just a
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:56.920]  sharecropper you never got out of debt you were basically a slave uh so the media only tells you
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:02.280]  about black slavery uh because that's the way to play people off against each other and when
[03:38:02.280 --> 03:38:06.200]  they bring in multiculturalism it's all about differences to make us beat each other's throat
[03:38:06.200 --> 03:38:12.920]  instead of just moving on not making it a big issue as tribalism is in all of us oh via religion
[03:38:12.920 --> 03:38:21.080]  via race uh via you know you name it uh it's there uh and and now we have tribes of you
[03:38:21.080 --> 03:38:25.320]  folks that have i'm not saying they're bad i'm just saying different tribes of cowboys and
[03:38:25.320 --> 03:38:31.240]  you know hip hop people and tattoo tribes and motorcycle tribes those are the tribes of america
[03:38:31.240 --> 03:38:36.200]  people are really into how they dress and you know how they talk and what they do that's their
[03:38:36.200 --> 03:38:41.800]  identity well my identity is liberty and freedom and science and exploration and protecting the
[03:38:41.800 --> 03:38:48.200]  innocent and working together but the globalist through the universities it was the fort foundation
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:53.320]  of the federal government that funded the radical chicano movement saying the u.s belongs to mexico
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:57.080]  and that white people are evil why they want to have us fighting with each other you're not
[03:38:57.080 --> 03:39:03.000]  going to get your oslo it's delusional uh it's to destroy the system of freedom that produced all
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:07.880]  this wealth hadn't been perfect but what we're going into is tyranny so this is social engineering
[03:39:07.880 --> 03:39:13.080]  so when he talks about he didn't get into government creating aids that's declassified uh but you know
[03:39:13.080 --> 03:39:16.760]  he gets into how they're using medicine to kill people and how they're but but he says the white
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:23.880]  man wants to sell you cigarettes now the white man pulled up almost 600 years ago in cuba and said
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:28.760]  man i like smoking this and the natives were going yeah we like it too it's really addictive
[03:39:29.640 --> 03:39:37.320]  cigars baby uh now i mean the chinese are selling cigarettes the japanese are selling them african
[03:39:37.320 --> 03:39:41.880]  come i mean there's african tobacco production black selling cigarettes to blacks
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:49.720]  there are evil mafias in the italian groups in the wasp groups in the black groups in the
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:55.400]  jewish groups but when people say well all italians are mafia that's a fraud or when you say all
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:40:00.280]  whites are evil that's a fraud you say all blacks are criminals that's a stereotype of fraud
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:04.840]  now when you say all jews you know are running the banks in a new world order well there is a
[03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:10.200]  jewish mafia involved in that and we expose it but it's not the the only group the only system
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:14.440]  that's why they have fake federal groups out there who've been caught like halterner and countless
[03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:19.880]  others trying to radicalize the in the fed movement to make it anti-semitic so that it were divided
[03:40:19.880 --> 03:40:28.120]  again and so we can't ever get the people together they want us all fighting with each other and so
[03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:34.600]  i oppose mafia i oppose criminality but there's mafia in africa there's mafia in iran there are
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:39.560]  cliques and good old boy clubs in england in israel you know there's boss hog types in small
[03:40:39.560 --> 03:40:43.400]  towns you'll have one town that's good and free because they've got good people in it that got
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:49.240]  involved and believe in freedom you'll have a town next door a county next door totally thug run
[03:40:49.240 --> 03:40:53.560]  and those counties always fall apart because everybody moves out of it that can okay that's
[03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:57.160]  why the feds don't want states rights they don't want you to be able to run state to state for
[03:40:57.160 --> 03:41:00.760]  freedom they don't want you having a choice the global government doesn't want you to be able to
[03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:05.960]  run from country to country they say this they want taxes about 80 percent worldwide they want
[03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:11.320]  everybody under their control that's what the euro's about your you heard greg palis bbc talked
[03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:16.120]  to one of the founders of the euro he admitted it's about not letting anybody have lower taxes
[03:41:16.120 --> 03:41:21.000]  and it's about bankrupting nations to take control of them it's a global economic order it's a system
[03:41:21.960 --> 03:41:29.640]  and the main reason white people have dominated this club was language and was the fact that
[03:41:29.640 --> 03:41:36.360]  they were the last domino to fall to tyranny i said i'm gonna go to this clip but there's
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:42.520]  just so much history i want to give you roam had fallen other empires had fallen because
[03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:49.080]  they become decadent but some of the science survives in the dark ages and you had the wild
[03:41:49.080 --> 03:41:57.080]  tribes of britannia albion gall germania and other areas and you had the trade system that
[03:41:57.080 --> 03:42:03.080]  had been set up by the vikings and all of that merged together in the last thousand years and
[03:42:03.080 --> 03:42:09.320]  then it came out of the dark ages in the last 600 500 you had the renaissance the great awakening
[03:42:09.320 --> 03:42:15.000]  liberty freedom literature guttenberg's printing press the greatest invention it's rated as the
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:22.120]  greatest invention by man that produced incredible wealth it wasn't perfect but the move towards
[03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:28.440]  liberty was the greatest humans had ever seen okay that produced all this wealth
[03:42:30.280 --> 03:42:36.920]  and then the tyranny moved back in to take over that wealth and it was able to set up an empire
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:42.680]  so that's why this happened you know there've been other cultures africa had had egypt it became
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:50.920]  decadent over 3000 years and fell okay uh i mean if if if if egypt had had its rise in the last
[03:42:50.920 --> 03:42:59.560]  600 700 years you would have a global african dominant system and and that's an oversimplification
[03:42:59.560 --> 03:43:05.240]  the point is is that that's why you see white people in so many positions but those same white
[03:43:05.240 --> 03:43:09.480]  people are putting poisons in the vaccines for white people they're putting fluoride in the water
[03:43:09.480 --> 03:43:14.760]  that gives you cancer and reduces fertility for everybody so it's asinine the average white person
[03:43:14.760 --> 03:43:20.360]  is a guilty person who thinks white people are evil and worships black people okay i mean that's
[03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:25.880]  i mean i'm white i know i'm around it i'm sick of it okay i like black people i like everybody
[03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:30.360]  else but i haven't done anything wrong i don't have any guilt i'm not a white devil i don't have a
[03:43:30.360 --> 03:43:38.840]  tail under here i don't have horns i'm not bad okay now there are groups of elitist doesn't
[03:43:38.840 --> 03:43:43.720]  matter if they're japanese jewish german they all have these meetings they all agree on eugenics
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:47.880]  my dad you know had a professor at ut was the head of the botany department who was jewish
[03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:53.640]  who was openly a eugenicist and said well hitler you know went too far we don't need to target one
[03:43:53.640 --> 03:44:00.280]  group we need to target dumb people i mean this this transcends okay and as long as we say it's
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:05.160]  the white people or it's the black people or it's the jews one group we're just going to be divided
[03:44:05.160 --> 03:44:10.280]  to fight with each other it should be about ideas but but listen to this guy because he's his crescendo
[03:44:10.280 --> 03:44:14.920]  is kill the white people will play part of it come back from break and play the rest ending the show
[03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:22.040]  with it here is this professor on c span and the point is this is a idea held by five six seven
[03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:28.440]  percent or so of blacks in america it's very popular it's a minority but it's popular and it was
[03:44:28.440 --> 03:44:33.640]  funded by the government and this is asinine baloney he says all this stuff that's true but
[03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:40.280]  then says the white man is the source of all evil baloney okay okay if you want to say the white
[03:44:40.280 --> 03:44:45.480]  man's the source of something i it's it's it's the you know guttenberg press here it is
[03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:52.360]  i want to say a couple of things and i really don't want you all to miss me
[03:44:53.320 --> 03:44:59.560]  before we get ready to go my wife was here and she was the president of the association of black
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:06.120]  psychologists a couple of years ago and she was responsible for taking about 500 people including
[03:45:06.120 --> 03:45:12.680]  about 300 black psychologists to Ghana west africa for their national conference reason i point that
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:17.880]  out is because i want to say a couple of things and i'm going to go out of bounds what i have to
[03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:25.960]  say relative to what we've been talking about um first of all i grew up in brooklyn and i saw
[03:45:28.040 --> 03:45:33.880]  looking back on my life i saw about 30 of my friends died you know getting shot
[03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:41.720]  over dosing on drugs any number of things that took them off the planet you know beautiful brothers
[03:45:42.600 --> 03:45:46.920]  so i as i started to become more conscious i looked around i started asking this very
[03:45:46.920 --> 03:45:51.400]  important question i think the most important question that i asked myself and that you can
[03:45:51.400 --> 03:45:58.600]  ask yourself is why and i wanted to find out what was going on so i began to change i began to
[03:45:58.600 --> 03:46:03.400]  examine everything i don't like to use the word critically but i started to really check things
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:12.200]  out so i went through a very very serious change i mean serious change and what my wife and i did
[03:46:12.200 --> 03:46:18.040]  we uh decided that we were going to drop out from the system we delivered our two of our three
[03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:25.480]  children at home using midwives she didn't take any medication we didn't go to a doctor she taught
[03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:30.520]  me into doing that but it was a beautiful experience for me to be there to help deliver our
[03:46:30.520 --> 03:46:36.360]  children they were born by the way two years apart on the same day and our oldest daughter
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:43.240]  helped us deliver our children we also changed our diets we saw the hospital system was killing
[03:46:43.240 --> 03:46:49.480]  our people so we changed our diets we have been vegan for about 30 years that means no me
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:56.680]  the hospital system is killing everybody buddy all in any form no dairy products no sugar no white
[03:46:56.680 --> 03:47:02.680]  flour the same thing that dr woodard could talk about because we understood that we were in a war
[03:47:02.680 --> 03:47:06.120]  i want to emphasize that to you we are in a war
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:14.440]  we left new york and went to north carolina and we and really it's on her again we decided
[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:19.560]  that we were not going to go in debt because the the new form of slavery was economic slavery
[03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:26.840]  but we got some land we were very fortunate and we built our own house we built a large house
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:32.440]  took us 16 months we worked night and day every day for the 16 months and she was out there with
[03:47:32.440 --> 03:47:38.920]  a chainsaw and the cold and the rain and we worked and we built the house so we would not have to
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:45.880]  give white people any money i taught on the college level for a number of years at a so-called black
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:51.800]  college and i'm down against black colleges i'm gonna tell you straight up because some of the
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:47:58.120]  madness that's going on in these schools but what i want to say is that there are two things going
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:03.480]  on on the planet now one is that when white people came to us and said we're going to free you we're
[03:48:03.480 --> 03:48:12.200]  going to emancipate you from the plantation what they did was extended the boundaries of the
[03:48:12.200 --> 03:48:18.760]  plantation and made it an international plantation that's true made us think that we were free that's
[03:48:18.760 --> 03:48:26.280]  true in addition to that they made every white every white person on earth a plantation master
[03:48:26.280 --> 03:48:32.120]  not true they made us slaves so there are two things in operation we're in an international prison
[03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:39.960]  it's not just in america but everywhere we go our people are dying so the things that are operation
[03:48:39.960 --> 03:48:46.760]  on this planet is that white people want to kill us i want you to understand that they want to kill
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:52.920]  you and it has nothing to do with what the kind of degree you have what kind of car you have
[03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:59.480]  what kind of title you have what fraternity you belong to what religion you belong to
[03:48:59.480 --> 03:49:05.560]  they want to kill you because that is part of their plan there are any number of reasons
[03:49:05.560 --> 03:49:10.600]  why they want to do that i'm not going to waste my time trying to figure out why they want to kill
[03:49:10.600 --> 03:49:18.360]  us but i know that's what they want to do and they want to do it in many different ways psychological
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  economic cultural spiritual social and biological chemical electromagnetic they want to kill you
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:35.880]  you but they also want to make prop make money in the process of your death that's true now i saw
[03:49:35.880 --> 03:49:40.600]  a brother when i was coming and he was smoking a cigarette so now he's going to kill himself
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:48.280]  but they're going to make money off of his death process the other thing is that they want us to
[03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:51.880]  if they don't kill us like they tried to kill the brother by beating him up in
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:58.040]  New Orleans if they don't kill us that way or shooting like they killed the brother in Cincinnati
[03:49:58.040 --> 03:50:05.000]  or like they killed malice green in Detroit or like they killed Greenwich up in Pittsburgh if they
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:11.240]  don't come out right and kill us straight they want to get us to kill ourselves now these are the
[03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:15.560]  only two operations on the planet and then he starts calling white people the n word we're
[03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:20.280]  going to cut out that part come back from break and play the balance recalls for killing every
[03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:25.880]  white person on earth now the issue is white people are smoking cigarettes i'll guarantee you
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:32.760]  99.9% of white people who haven't heard this show don't understand that you've got the top globalist
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:38.200]  but let me tell you something china's involved japan's involved black leaders have been bought off
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:43.080]  in africa they're involved he talks about police brutality in africa the cops act just like they
[03:50:43.080 --> 03:50:48.920]  do here are worse they're black on black it's the nature of corruption and big government buddy
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:56.360]  not the white devil we'll be right back i'm yours truly a white devil alex joe's exposing the new

[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:08.600]  all right here's the climax of the professor you know why doesn't he go out and give speeches
[03:54:08.600 --> 03:54:13.240]  against 50 plus percent of blacks supporting their babies oh he's a liberal uh why doesn't he
[03:54:13.240 --> 03:54:17.800]  uh go out and tell black folks to rally and expose the government shipping their drugs in
[03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:23.160]  or or or how black leaders are on the payroll he probably does and i want to reach out to that
[03:54:23.160 --> 03:54:26.680]  fella and tell him i wanted to come on the show but i guess he thinks i have like some evil
[03:54:26.680 --> 03:54:31.000]  intelligence and i'm like jacked into the devil and you know i'm different from him i mean it's
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:36.600]  just it's just ridiculous it's ridiculous i want everybody to live in peace and be happy and go to
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:41.800]  the stars together not kill each other but the globalists are using tribalism to play us off
[03:54:41.800 --> 03:54:47.000]  against each other and black liberation that obama's involved in is funded by the government
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:52.440]  because it's not liberation it's slavery uh let's go ahead and go back to him saying
[03:54:52.440 --> 03:55:02.440]  we must kill all the white people here it is yes now what we have to do is we have to
[03:55:04.360 --> 03:55:10.680]  devise a system or a plan for ourselves and i said earlier that each one of you is a system
[03:55:10.680 --> 03:55:15.960]  and everything that you do every thought that you think either you are supporting
[03:55:16.680 --> 03:55:23.720]  white world terror domination by your actions what you buy what you wear where you go what
[03:55:23.720 --> 03:55:29.560]  you eat how you use your time you are either supporting the white people in their process
[03:55:29.560 --> 03:55:37.960]  of death or your for african liberation is one of the other and if we don't use our time wisely
[03:55:37.960 --> 03:55:46.120]  then we're engaging in a form of subtle suicide because as i said earlier this system is still
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:50.360]  going on they still have these images on tv that are going on they're still where it has
[03:55:50.360 --> 03:55:55.800]  no children in the special ed true giving them riddling true that white kids too buddy the
[03:55:55.800 --> 03:56:03.320]  hospitals so their system is not stopping and then finally i want to say that we need one idea
[03:56:03.320 --> 03:56:10.440]  here and we're not thinking about a solution to the problem we're dealing with all these other
[03:56:10.440 --> 03:56:17.640]  things but these are diversions from the solution to the problem and we have to start to think about
[03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:23.000]  a solution to the problem so that these young brothers and sisters who are here now who are 15
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:31.160]  16 or 17 are not here 25 years later talking about these same problems now how do i know
[03:56:31.160 --> 03:56:37.160]  that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem i know it
[03:56:37.160 --> 03:56:44.040]  because they have retina scans they have what they call racial profiling dna banks and they're
[03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:50.680]  monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea
[03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:59.320]  and the one idea is how we are going to exterminate white people because that in my
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:05.240]  estimation is the only conclusion i have come to we have to exterminate white people off of the
[03:57:05.240 --> 03:57:11.800]  face of the planet to solve this problem now i don't care whether you clap or not but i'm saying
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:20.120]  to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us and i will leave on
[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:25.960]  that so we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not be
[03:57:25.960 --> 03:57:32.840]  diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem and the problem on the planet is white
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:40.040]  people well there you go yay people are crying and agreeing and clapping and talking about how
[03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:46.680]  beautiful it is uh that is sick and the globalist fund that and they fund the white supremacist
[03:57:46.680 --> 03:57:51.000]  and they fund all the rest of it to get us killing each other instead of getting a real economic
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:58.360]  system together and kicking the parasite banking system off the planet but no that's not going to
[03:57:58.360 --> 03:58:03.800]  happen if that professor and many others have his way and i've got countless videos we posted them
[03:58:04.360 --> 03:58:09.400]  blend spencer's got them of the illegal alien rallies where they have similar signs and say the
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:14.360]  same thing and then as a white person i go listen i don't want to be your enemy but you're all talking
[03:58:14.360 --> 03:58:20.920]  about how you want to kill me uh and see that's the globalist model they say well not just
[03:58:20.920 --> 03:58:27.240]  uh minority groups that are the majority worldwide but anybody that we don't get rid of is going to
[03:58:27.240 --> 03:58:31.960]  challenge us let's wipe everybody out and go to the stars that's what the globalist controllers
[03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:37.160]  are saying but they plan to kill me too they plan to kill you regardless of what color you are
[03:58:37.160 --> 03:58:40.200]  we'll talk more about it tomorrow great job crew in full wars dot com
