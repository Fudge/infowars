[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.720]  we have a very busy show of course you probably heard the news by now last night
[00:33.720 --> 00:37.840]  just after midnight there were two cops that were shot in Ferguson I believe
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.080]  they're in serious condition still Paul Joseph Watson has a story he's been
[00:42.080 --> 00:46.160]  following the reaction from some of the police some of the people who are there
[00:46.160 --> 00:51.320]  celebrating that police have been shot I'm very concerned about this because
[00:51.320 --> 00:56.720]  last night as I was heading home I heard about the resignation of the police
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.000]  chief as well as the court being taken down and this is being reported in some
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.480]  of the mainstream media they said this is because of racial bias and yes there
[01:05.480 --> 01:08.640]  is racial bias there and yes there was racial bias in what they were doing but
[01:08.640 --> 01:13.040]  the key thing that they were doing was using the Department for revenue
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.040]  collection that's against the law in Missouri as it is in many states it's
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.040]  against the law here in Texas but it doesn't stop people from doing it we
[01:21.040 --> 01:24.760]  have a clip that will play for you later in the show of a Michigan police chief
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.400]  telling the city council that that's exactly what he's doing and he knows
[01:29.400 --> 01:32.680]  that it's in violation of federal and state laws nevertheless he's going to
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.840]  do it and the city council agrees and signs off on that we're gonna talk about
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.160]  that with the National Motorist Association president this is a group that
[01:43.160 --> 01:48.560]  wants to help you to establish your rights on the highway and we do have
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.760]  rights we don't give up our rights when we travel they'll always tell you that
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.880]  driving a car is a privilege it's not moving around in this country is a
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.360]  fundamental right as fundamental as the right to keep and bear arms and we have
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.640]  to come together and collectively to fight for our individual rights and one
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.520]  of the ways that we do that is through organizations like the NRA and the gun
[02:09.520 --> 02:13.880]  owners of America that's the way we can push these people back collectively and
[02:13.880 --> 02:17.360]  we need to do that as motorists they have a very interesting program they
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.080]  want to encourage you to take this to court to fight these illegal actions
[02:21.080 --> 02:27.480]  we're going to talk about what is illegal about the traffic ticket per se but
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.640]  they offer you an incentive they offer you help one-on-one to fight these
[02:30.640 --> 02:34.000]  traffic tickets and they offer you an incentive to take it to court which is
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.080]  your right under the Constitution under state laws and if you lose they will
[02:39.080 --> 02:42.520]  back that up and pay your fine and your court costs we're going to talk to them
[02:42.520 --> 02:48.440]  very interesting story it also ties in of course they're concerned about black
[02:48.440 --> 02:52.520]  boxes how that's going to be used to spy and tax on us to drive us out of our
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.200]  vehicles to force us to give up driving all together and of course we reported
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.920]  about the black box that's found its way into cars and over the since 1994 it's
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.360]  been gradually building as of 2015 all cars have a black box in them it's
[03:08.360 --> 03:13.400]  required by law they're going to require that your cars start talking vehicle to
[03:13.400 --> 03:16.560]  vehicle communication is going to be mandated in just a couple of years on
[03:16.560 --> 03:19.560]  automobiles who are they going to be talking to well I'll tell you who's
[03:19.560 --> 03:23.760]  going to be listening we just talked about yesterday the fact that the CIA was
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.200]  supplying working with the US Marshals under the Department of Justice to spy
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.360]  on people's cell phones we've talked about this many times cell phone tower
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.920]  mimicking making your phone think that it's talking to the cell phone provider
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.320]  when actually what it's doing is it's dumping information to these phony
[03:41.320 --> 03:45.120]  towers and that's the way that they're spying and collecting information on you
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.080]  tracking you where you go don't tell me that these black boxes aren't going to
[03:50.080 --> 03:54.680]  be transmitting that information where you're driving how fast you're driving
[03:54.680 --> 03:57.400]  sending that to them so they can automatically find you so they can raise
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.200]  your insurance rates whatever that's what is happening down the road and so we
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.520]  need to be aware of that we need to stand together to fight against that we
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.880]  also have Texas representative David Simpson who's going to be joining us in
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.240]  the third hour this is the Texas representative we talked to him before
[04:13.240 --> 04:18.360]  when he fought against the TSA sexually molesting children as well as all of
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.400]  us as adults he came up with a bill to shut that down and of course it was so
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.080]  close to passing they passed unanimously in the house the first time it came up
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.280]  they had to pull out our lieutenant governor here from Texas in Texas who's
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.480]  from the CIA to shut it down well he's back with a bill that would legalize
[04:34.480 --> 04:38.800]  marijuana treating it like tomatoes and jalapenos as he points out but the most
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.720]  important thing is he takes it from a Christian perspective and if you're not
[04:42.720 --> 04:46.080]  a Christian you need to listen to this and know how is a libertarian to talk
[04:46.080 --> 04:49.840]  to Christians to shut this down because they're the biggest cheerleaders for the
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.360]  war on drugs stay with us we'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson

[08:32.320 --> 08:36.400]  be hosting the show today I have Paul Joseph Watson joining me in just a couple
[08:36.400 --> 08:39.200]  of moments to talk about the developments in Ferguson of course there's
[08:39.200 --> 08:44.080]  been several major developments just within the last 24 hours we learned
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.640]  first yesterday that the Ferguson police chief resigned I heard this as I was
[08:48.640 --> 08:53.000]  going home last night on NPR BBC it was big news everywhere now a lot of them in
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.040]  the mainstream media were spinning this as the fact that he was being forced out
[08:58.040 --> 09:02.360]  of office because of racial bias and his department that's the way the BBC
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.480]  reported it but then they go on to say in their article that the report that was
[09:06.480 --> 09:09.560]  released by the Justice Department last week detailed how Ferguson officials
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.600]  use the city's police and court system to generate revenue now what were they
[09:15.600 --> 09:19.560]  doing with that of course it was using it to generate traffic tickets this is
[09:19.560 --> 09:24.160]  another report from newspaper dot com that points out the Justice Department
[09:24.160 --> 09:28.880]  report called into question the predatory tactics of traffic police and
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.280]  municipal court in Ferguson Missouri they said they decided on money to clear
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.400]  the bench they shut down the court and they put another judge from a court of
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.400]  appeals in place so they basically shut down the court in Ferguson as well as
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.200]  the police chief and why did they do it because of predatory traffic practices
[09:48.200 --> 09:51.560]  we're going to be talking to the National Motorist Association vice
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.800]  president later in the show and we're going to talk to him about these
[09:54.800 --> 09:58.920]  predatory traffic practices they help people to fight them they offer you
[09:58.920 --> 10:03.040]  advice even for their members not only give them advice on how to fight the
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.160]  traffic ticket but if you lose in court they will even pay your fine in your
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.680]  court costs because they want people to stand up against these illegal actions
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.440]  we've seen over and over again the quota systems and the emphasis of the police
[10:16.440 --> 10:21.280]  to do this as revenue and it violates state and federal law most states have
[10:21.280 --> 10:25.440]  a violation against that of course it is a violation of federal law as they say
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.000]  here the Justice Department concluded that they did unconstitutional traffic
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  stops now there was a racial bias as part of that traffic stop but understand
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.680]  that this is like getting al Capone not on alcohol prohibition but on income
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.920]  tax evasion they got him because of the traffic stops that they're doing to you
[10:44.920 --> 10:49.080]  as well and so we're going to be talking to him also of course the war on drugs
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.080]  has been a major emphasis in taking our civil liberties especially on the
[10:54.080 --> 10:57.400]  highways we're going to be talking to a Texas representative later in the show
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.800]  David Simpson and he's going to talk about the bill that he introduced that
[11:01.800 --> 11:06.680]  would essentially remove marijuana from all of the Texas legal code treating it
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.280]  as he said like tomatoes or jalapenos the interesting thing I think also about
[11:12.280 --> 11:17.520]  David Simpson's bill is that he comes at it from a Christian perspective and if
[11:17.520 --> 11:20.640]  you're not a Christian you still need to hear this because you need to be able to
[11:20.640 --> 11:24.200]  convince the Christians who are the biggest cheerleaders and applauders
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.800]  for the war on drugs for using the hammer of force to try to change people and
[11:28.800 --> 11:32.680]  guess what that hasn't worked for 40 years we still have the same drug problems
[11:32.680 --> 11:36.880]  and we got many other drug problems but joining me now is Paul Joseph Watson
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.000]  welcome Paul hi David good to be back I want to talk to you today we've got this
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.800]  article up about the Ferguson supporters celebrating the shooting of the police
[11:45.800 --> 11:49.680]  officers before I get your comments on that of course there's also a video of
[11:49.680 --> 11:54.400]  New York protesters celebrating the shooting of police I want to play this
[11:54.400 --> 12:00.560]  clip that we had last from USA Today talking about the police chief resigning
[12:00.560 --> 12:07.480]  let's play that clip the city of Ferguson and police chief Thomas Jackson have
[12:07.480 --> 12:12.040]  agreed to a mutual separation which involves the police chief's resignation
[12:12.040 --> 12:17.840]  from the city of Ferguson the chief's resignation is effective March 19th
[12:17.840 --> 12:24.640]  2015 this was a mutual decision both by the chief of police and the city's
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.760]  administration chief Jackson will receive a severance payment with health
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.960]  insurance for one year Lieutenant Colonel Al Icoff will assume the duties as
[12:34.960 --> 12:42.360]  acting chief of police effective Thursday March 19th 2015 in addition to our
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.120]  search for a new city manager we will also begin conducting a nationwide
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.720]  search for a new police chief as you are aware one week ago today the city of
[12:51.720 --> 12:55.800]  Ferguson received its final report from the Department of Justice the city has
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.800]  been committed to and will continue to be committed to addressing each item
[12:59.800 --> 13:04.720]  outlined in the report it is the city council's goal to continue to be
[13:04.720 --> 13:10.560]  transparent as we strive to once again become a vibrant and diverse community
[13:10.560 --> 13:15.280]  on a final note I would like to say this to Ferguson residents business owners
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.080]  and to the entire country the city of Ferguson looks to become an example of
[13:20.080 --> 13:25.560]  how a community can move forward in the face of adversity we are committed to
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.840]  keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of
[13:30.840 --> 13:37.120]  professionalism and fairness well there we go now what was not said there was
[13:37.120 --> 13:42.120]  that they were operating not on protecting the rights of the accused but
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.040]  on maximizing revenue that was the report from the Department of Justice that
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.280]  got him to resign that also shut down the court but then shortly after that after
[13:52.280 --> 13:56.280]  we learned that that had happened there was a shooting of two police officers
[13:56.280 --> 14:07.240]  let's go to that video this is raw video here that's taken on the street
[14:26.280 --> 14:45.760]  okay there was just gunfire and now cops have guns drawn okay let's go to Paul
[14:45.760 --> 14:49.760]  and get his reaction Paul of course you're you've been looking at the
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.400]  reaction to a lot of Ferguson protesters one of the things that I think is
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.960]  interesting about this and I want to get your take on it of course they were
[14:56.960 --> 15:01.640]  winning they had gotten the police chief removed they'd gotten the court shut
[15:01.640 --> 15:05.000]  down it looks like they're also going to get the police department shut down in
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.160]  Ferguson because of these practices that were not only racially biased but
[15:08.160 --> 15:11.400]  were illegal trying to maximize revenue and we see that everywhere in America
[15:11.400 --> 15:14.320]  you you don't know about that yet because you haven't been here enough but
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.280]  where they basically use the police primarily as revenue enhancement we saw
[15:19.280 --> 15:25.080]  that happen in New York as a shutdown and protest of the mayor there but there
[15:25.080 --> 15:30.440]  were reports at the last night that the shots did not come from the crowd first
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.640]  the police spokesman said that he thought that the shots had come from the
[15:34.640 --> 15:38.600]  crowd but protesters at the scene and on social media said they thought that the
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.320]  shots were from farther away on top of the hill what do you think about that I
[15:43.320 --> 15:48.720]  mean it could be an agent provocateur trying to keep things going as a racial
[15:48.720 --> 15:54.440]  division as a protest against the police just as things would start to wind down
[15:54.440 --> 16:00.760]  well certainly the NYPD murders were motivated as a revenge killing in
[16:00.760 --> 16:05.840]  response to the Michael Brown verdict so you know we're not sure about who
[16:05.840 --> 16:09.720]  exactly is responsible for the shooting but what you were talking about earlier
[16:09.720 --> 16:14.760]  is key because we know that there's a genuine problem with police as predatory
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.680]  forces across the entire country whether that be revenue generation or police
[16:19.680 --> 16:24.800]  brutality which targets everybody yet what has happened with this black lives
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.480]  matter protest movement and this Ferguson movement is it's discredited
[16:30.480 --> 16:35.960]  legitimate opposition to the real problem of police brutality and we can see
[16:35.960 --> 16:40.120]  that again in the reaction to the shooting last night again very few
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.480]  details have emerged about it but even in that very video clip that you just
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.400]  played seconds after this shooting somebody's heard to say a protest or
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.200]  he's heard to say acknowledgement nine months ago would have kept that from
[16:54.200 --> 16:59.600]  happening you know acknowledgement of what the fact that Michael Brown had
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.520]  just robbed a convenience store he went out tried to grab officer Wilson's gun
[17:04.520 --> 17:10.320]  punched him in the face charged him and now even the you know holder justice
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.160]  department came out this month and said that the eyewitnesses who said that
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.320]  Michael Brown had his hands up were basically lying there's no evidence to
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.440]  suggest that there's no evidence from the autopsy reports from the forensics to
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.800]  suggest that so we've had this entire narrative based around this hands up
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.320]  don't shoot myth which has been completely fabricated and this has been
[17:31.320 --> 17:35.040]  used as this divide and conquer method as you said and that's a turn the
[17:35.040 --> 17:40.360]  majority of Americans away from opposing police brutality exactly I think pigeon
[17:40.360 --> 17:46.880]  hold it into this racial issue yeah they pick cases like Antonio Martin the guy
[17:46.880 --> 17:50.440]  that aimed the gun at an officer's head and that became the big cause
[17:50.440 --> 17:55.600]  celebrate about police brutality when you have cases like Kelly Thomas you know
[17:55.600 --> 17:59.440]  that the other homeless guy who got shot real genuine cases of police
[17:59.440 --> 18:04.280]  brutality that don't get sustained months-long media attention and that's
[18:04.280 --> 18:08.500]  because a lot of these protest groups these black lives matter groups social
[18:08.500 --> 18:12.720]  justice warriors they're not about genuinely opposing police brutality
[18:12.720 --> 18:18.240]  they're being steered this is not a grassroots movement George Soros 33
[18:18.240 --> 18:23.720]  million dollars sent to these black lives matter Ferguson groups over the
[18:23.720 --> 18:29.000]  past year according to tax records analyzed by the Washington Times so they
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.240]  they keep the story alive in the social media echo chamber through this giant
[18:34.240 --> 18:40.240]  funding through media cover you know Time magazine in defense of rioting as
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.560]  majority black owned businesses were being burned down in Ferguson Time
[18:45.560 --> 18:50.280]  magazine comes out and venerates the looters and the rioters you know and
[18:50.280 --> 18:53.800]  they don't give you the wider context behind these individual shootings
[18:53.800 --> 18:59.720]  Antonio Martin Michael Brown you name it so we're all being manipulated into you
[18:59.720 --> 19:04.280]  know being at each other's throats where this disavowing the facts behind each
[19:04.280 --> 19:08.680]  individual case and this is being used to discredit opposition to police
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.720]  brutality so then the polls come out and you see that the majority of Americans
[19:12.720 --> 19:18.160]  side with the police because you get incidents like the NYPD murders where
[19:18.160 --> 19:22.760]  these black lives matter protesters are stood there clapping and applauding the
[19:22.760 --> 19:26.800]  murders and we've seen it again I mean you can see in my article you know
[19:26.800 --> 19:31.320]  dozens of tweets from Ferguson supporters justifying and even
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.360]  celebrating the shooting of these two officers who were seriously injured and
[19:36.360 --> 19:41.080]  could have died absolutely Paul and just as you pointed out there's so many
[19:41.080 --> 19:45.720]  legitimate cases of innocent people clearly innocent people that we could
[19:45.720 --> 19:49.120]  talk about yet they focus on this one and that's one of the things that makes
[19:49.120 --> 19:52.920]  me wonder whether this really was shot from a distance we'll be right back with

[24:16.800 --> 24:20.400]  Joseph Watson we've just been talking about the shooting of two police
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.400]  officers the reaction and social media as well as we're going to show you in
[24:25.400 --> 24:29.200]  just a moment a clip of some New York protesters celebrating the fact that the
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.600]  police were shot and as Paul pointed out in the last segment there are so many
[24:34.600 --> 24:41.840]  cases of police brutality across the country people being brutalized people
[24:41.840 --> 24:46.040]  being killed by the police who are clearly innocent and yet they focus on
[24:46.040 --> 24:50.400]  Ferguson where it's very ambiguous where now even the Justice Department looked
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.240]  at it and did not force the police chief to resign because of what happened to
[24:55.240 --> 24:59.160]  Michael Brown but they forced him to resign because they were using the
[24:59.160 --> 25:02.640]  police department and the court system and the court system has gone as well
[25:02.640 --> 25:07.560]  they removed the judge but the police and the judge were focused on revenue
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.880]  collection and they were violating people's civil rights everyone's civil rights
[25:11.880 --> 25:14.360]  and most of the people that are getting their civil rights violated were black
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.160]  most of the people in Ferguson were black but this is happening everywhere the
[25:18.160 --> 25:24.000]  common problems that we have across this country with a police out of control not
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.080]  protecting our safety not protecting the safety of the citizens but coming
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.440]  after them to collect revenue is against state and federal law we're going to be
[25:31.440 --> 25:34.960]  talking to someone from the National Association of the National Motorist
[25:34.960 --> 25:40.160]  Association the NMA is going to talk about how they're trying to encourage
[25:40.160 --> 25:44.240]  people to stand up for their rights in court and they basically will pay for
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.120]  your ticket if you fight and lose they will help you to fight that ticket to
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.600]  stand up for your rights but Paul when I look at this and we've seen how they've
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.760]  used Ferguson and how they've ignored so many of these I mean every day we see
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.640]  so many reports coming across we just can't even cover a fraction of these
[26:00.640 --> 26:05.040]  reports and yet they focus on the ones that have the potential to divide us
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.560]  racially and to discredit the protests against police brutality which makes me
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.920]  wonder if this itself is not some kind of an agent provocateur attack against
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.560]  these police or if it's not some kind of a false flag what do you think I don't
[26:19.560 --> 26:22.840]  I don't think they need to carry out a false flag because there are so many
[26:22.840 --> 26:26.920]  lunatics out there who are willing to do this I mean just look at the article
[26:26.920 --> 26:30.880]  which is at the top of drudge now actually Ferguson supporters celebrate
[26:30.880 --> 26:37.280]  shooting of police officers a series of tweets quote clock chief Jackson steps
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.640]  down and two pigs get shot best day Ferguson has had in years quote I'm glad
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.800]  two pigs wounded in Ferguson quote kill the pigs quote serves those two pigs
[26:47.800 --> 26:52.640]  right I hope organized public militancy continues so you have all these people we
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.720]  have the NYPD murders which were motivated as a revenge attack for Ferguson now
[26:57.720 --> 27:02.080]  that's acknowledged and then we have this video video footage out of New York
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.240]  from back at the end of last year which we're going to play in which these
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.520]  Ferguson protesters chant for dead cops so they have to bear at least some of
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.400]  the responsibility oh yeah people shooting at cops when it's self calls
[27:16.400 --> 27:20.560]  for dead cops so we've got that clip they've been very successful at building
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.000]  that racial division let's play that clip from New York
[27:26.000 --> 27:41.720]  I can't make out what they're saying
[27:41.720 --> 27:51.960]  dead cops dead cop death cops dead cops yeah
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.880]  there they get closer you get here they want to take i think okay we get the
[28:09.880 --> 28:15.560]  idea. You're Helmets Paul. Yeah, so that was at the end of last year, Channing, what do
[28:15.560 --> 28:21.280]  we want dead cops? When do we want it now? So they have to bear some responsibility for
[28:21.280 --> 28:26.340]  these kind of shootings. That was before the NYPD murders. Now we have another two shootings
[28:26.340 --> 28:33.120]  last night. So you cannot legitimize shooting at cops by claiming, you know, police brutality
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.560]  in these kind of ambiguous incidents. We had another one a couple of weeks ago in Skid
[28:38.560 --> 28:45.680]  Row, where this convicted bank robber tries to grab a cop's gun and ends up getting shot.
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.800]  And again, for days, there was this whole social justice warrior freak out about racist
[28:50.800 --> 28:54.840]  police targeting black people, even though one of the cops in the incident was black.
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.960]  And, you know, if you try and grab a police officer's firearm, the consequences aren't
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.000]  normally going to turn out too well. And then we had Antonio Martin, you know, aimed a gun
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.960]  at a police officer's head and was shot dead. For days after that, there was a big social
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.600]  justice warrior movement. And yet there are real cases, as we said, where people, innocent
[29:15.600 --> 29:20.720]  people who don't do anything violent, barely even resist, get pummeled, get killed by
[29:20.720 --> 29:27.920]  cops, Kelly Thomas being the prime example. So they seize upon these cases. And then the
[29:27.920 --> 29:34.120]  whole narrative, the whole debate becomes around cops versus black people when violence
[29:34.120 --> 29:39.320]  itself within the black community is rife for a number of different factors which we
[29:39.320 --> 29:44.120]  can get into. It stops any chance that we have. That's right. It stops any chance that
[29:44.120 --> 29:50.280]  we have of trying to get reform. Call us with your comments at 800-259-9231. The Empires

[33:28.720 --> 33:34.840]  the UK is Paul Joseph Watson. We've been talking about the shooting in Ferguson. What's behind
[33:34.840 --> 33:41.840]  that of course is to try to create division, racial division, not to address police brutality.
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.440]  As a matter of fact, discredits, the protests against police brutality. We're going to
[33:45.440 --> 33:48.840]  go to your calls. We've had a couple of people already call in. Primarily I'd like to get
[33:48.840 --> 33:52.920]  your comments on Ferguson. We can take some other calls on some other issues. That number
[33:52.920 --> 34:00.640]  is 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231. Before I go back to Paul, I just want to let you
[34:00.640 --> 34:07.960]  know that we have a sale at infowarslife.com, an unprecedented discount of 30% off of DNA
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.240]  force. Normally competitors price this at two to three times the price that we charge,
[34:12.240 --> 34:18.440]  some charging up to $600 for similar formulas. Right now you can get DNA force 30% off. That's
[34:18.440 --> 34:23.680]  under $100 for the first time ever. You can find that at infowarslife.com. That supports
[34:23.680 --> 34:28.920]  our operation and it supports your body. It's a win-win situation.
[34:28.920 --> 34:34.160]  Let's go to Joe in Arkansas. Joe, you wanted to talk about the Ferguson shooting. Go ahead.
[34:34.160 --> 34:37.960]  Yes, okay. I distinctly remember around the beginning of the year, I was listening to
[34:37.960 --> 34:44.000]  a radio station in San Antonio, Texas, W-O-A-I. I heard a news reporter say, a news announcer,
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.080]  he said, there's a new civil war in America. It's the people against the police. I think
[34:48.080 --> 34:52.320]  there's no doubt that it's on the agenda of the establishment, of the White House. They
[34:52.320 --> 34:56.800]  want a civil war between the people and the police and they kind of kept it quiet, kept
[34:56.800 --> 35:00.520]  it kind of low key during the winter when everybody was busy trying to survive the cold
[35:00.520 --> 35:04.720]  and now they're getting warmer and people are, you know, able to go out in the streets
[35:04.720 --> 35:08.160]  more. I think they're trying to ramp it up and get it going again.
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.920]  I would agree with you. I think you would too, wouldn't you Paul?
[35:10.920 --> 35:15.960]  Yeah, this is the point I've made over and over again. The elite know that that unrest
[35:15.960 --> 35:20.080]  is coming. About six months ago, the CFO came out with an article called, The American
[35:20.080 --> 35:25.280]  Distemper. No, we've had Brzezinski saying for years there's this huge uprising coming.
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.760]  We've got the elite, the wealthy buying property in remote locations in New Zealand because
[35:29.760 --> 35:35.280]  they're afraid of civil unrest and Ferguson style riots. So they know all that's coming,
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.400]  which is why they're trying to get ahead of it with these Soros groups and hijack it and
[35:39.400 --> 35:45.280]  steer it, which is why Obama labeled these grievances against the Wilson case quote,
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.480]  legitimate and understandable, even after the grand jury case had found the claims of
[35:50.480 --> 35:56.040]  the Black Lives Matter protesters to be based on completely fraudulent foundation. So they're
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.640]  aware that this general uprising is coming. You know, trusting government is at record
[36:00.640 --> 36:06.440]  lows, all the polls show. So they need to hijack that, steer and divert it. And that's part
[36:06.440 --> 36:08.000]  of what we see going on in Ferguson.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.920]  Absolutely. And as you pointed out, you were the ones that want to discover the massive
[36:11.920 --> 36:17.480]  stockpiling of ammunition, hollow point bullets, not for target practice. Hollow point bullets
[36:17.480 --> 36:21.120]  have been, they're very expensive. You don't use those for target practice. You don't use
[36:21.120 --> 36:24.560]  them in the military. They've been banned by the Geneva Convention. You only use those
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.080]  against your own citizens. And of course, also the MRAP program that is prepositioning
[36:30.080 --> 36:34.120]  military equipment throughout the police departments across the country. Let's go to Charles in
[36:34.120 --> 36:35.120]  Texas, Charles.
[36:35.120 --> 36:42.120]  Oh, yeah. Hi. I just wanted to say thank you for everything that all of you guys do. And
[36:42.120 --> 36:49.760]  as well as everybody, as well as all the listeners, I just want to, I just want to make a couple
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.440]  of points about Ferguson. You know, it's obvious to me that it's just falling under the same
[36:56.440 --> 37:04.960]  divide and conquer kind of plan. Especially when you look at it from the standpoint, you
[37:04.960 --> 37:12.440]  know, like from the AR-15 rounds, recently trying to get banned. And as well as the overall
[37:12.440 --> 37:19.960]  fight that they're trying to, like, do the gun control by taking our ammunition away.
[37:19.960 --> 37:29.280]  I think that they are just falling completely under the whole divide and conquer, you know,
[37:29.280 --> 37:36.040]  construct, if you want to put it that way. As well as, and if it's not a false flag, I
[37:36.040 --> 37:43.880]  truly believe that the citizens or the protesters are just falling right into the hands of the
[37:43.880 --> 37:44.880]  globalists.
[37:44.880 --> 37:48.720]  Yes. Either it's either it's a false flag or maybe as Paul said, they don't need it
[37:48.720 --> 37:55.160]  after months and months of this narrative. Thank you, Charles. Let's go to Brandon and
[37:55.160 --> 37:59.520]  Georgia. Brandon, you also want to talk about the ammo ban that we've just seen. Try to
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.520]  be imposed. Go ahead.
[38:01.520 --> 38:09.480]  Hey, David. I want to think it's your opinion on the ammo being pushed back and if it's
[38:09.480 --> 38:15.400]  just a trial run to sort of put people in a panic, like after Aurora and Sandy Hook.
[38:15.400 --> 38:20.560]  And I also wanted to ask you, do you think that this shooting in Ferguson is just a false
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.720]  flag or if it's just an attempt for the Soros groups to get people all rounded up to cause
[38:25.720 --> 38:30.200]  even more man than we saw after the grand jury decision on Michael Brown?
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.360]  Well, as far as the ammo ban goes, we have an article up on infowords.com today. The
[38:34.360 --> 38:39.800]  real reason the ATF is backing down from Green Tip ammo ban. And of course, he points out
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.960]  that the most effective way to encroach on our rights is to go big. And so he believes
[38:44.960 --> 38:47.840]  that as we've seen, and we've seen this strategy before, he believes that they're going to
[38:47.840 --> 38:55.880]  come in with some onerous, outrageous legislation that's going to inspire outrage and then
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.760]  do that in a way that they can offer a compromise. But of course, that compromise is going to
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.840]  come with further encroachments and infringements on the Second Amendment.
[39:04.840 --> 39:09.880]  And we've seen that strategy work successfully in the United States time and time again. In
[39:09.880 --> 39:14.920]  the early days of the NSA, decades ago, they were partners with the government with that.
[39:14.920 --> 39:20.000]  They were more than willing to compromise our rights. You can never compromise your fundamental
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.880]  rights. They are not negotiable. And we need to understand that. I believe the current
[39:23.880 --> 39:27.880]  leadership of the NRA understands that as well. Certainly organizations like Gun Owners
[39:27.880 --> 39:30.800]  of America understands that. But I think the NRA understands that now.
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.800]  And of course, Paul, what he was talking about in terms of the racial divide and conquer,
[39:35.800 --> 39:38.800]  that's what you've been talking about this whole segment, what we've been talking about
[39:38.800 --> 39:44.760]  since this happened in Ferguson. It was very clear they were picking ambiguous cases, perhaps
[39:44.760 --> 39:51.160]  cases where the police were justified and using that to shut down a pushback against
[39:51.160 --> 39:52.160]  police brutality.
[39:52.160 --> 39:55.680]  That's precisely what they've done here in Ferguson. Even the Justice Department didn't
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.640]  find anything wrong with the Michael Brown shooting. They came after these guys and shut
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.440]  them down because they were illegally using the police department and the court system
[40:03.440 --> 40:05.160]  for revenue collection.
[40:05.160 --> 40:11.760]  Well, David, I mean, compare the media's reaction to the Black Lives Matter protest as, you
[40:11.760 --> 40:16.720]  know, upholding and venerating them, Time Magazine, Indefensive Writing. So the media's
[40:16.720 --> 40:22.840]  reaction to the Bundy Ranch protesters completely vilified them for months. So that shows you
[40:22.840 --> 40:28.120]  right there where their interest lies. On the ammo, one of the first things that Obama
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.120]  said, and this leaked in the Washington Post when he got into office, is that he would
[40:32.120 --> 40:36.520]  try and attack the Second Amendment, quote, under the radar. So he's going to be very
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.560]  sneaky about it. If you read the ATF's actual statement, you know, falling back on this
[40:41.560 --> 40:47.040]  bullet ban, they didn't say they would relinquish it all together. They said they, for now,
[40:47.040 --> 40:49.520]  they'll leave it and they're just going to come back and try it again.
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.520]  Absolutely.
[40:50.520 --> 40:51.520]  Absolutely.
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.680]  Different kind of regulatory framework. So it's not done by any stretch of the imagination.
[40:55.680 --> 40:59.320]  But we have had a victory and we do need to celebrate that victory. And we need to take
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.680]  from that the fact that if we stand up to them, there was 80,000 people left to comment
[41:03.680 --> 41:08.120]  at the ATF. They had 200 congressmen write them. They had over 50 senators write them.
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.680]  The bottom line is there was massive opposition to it. They shut down the comment period five
[41:12.680 --> 41:15.960]  days early and said, we're going to go back and take a look at this. And of course, they
[41:15.960 --> 41:16.960]  are going to come back.
[41:16.960 --> 41:20.120]  And when they talk about doing this under the radar, Paul, they're going to come after
[41:20.120 --> 41:25.200]  the ammunition. They've tried for decades to take away our guns by banning individual
[41:25.200 --> 41:28.760]  guns. And what happens is one of two things is going to happen. People will go in and
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.960]  make minor modifications to the guns so that they're no longer illegal or they'll have
[41:32.960 --> 41:35.360]  to go door to door to confiscate these guns.
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.040]  Now they've gotten smarter. They're going after the ammunition. That's the way they're
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.080]  going to do gun control because it's not the second amendment is not about guns. It's
[41:44.080 --> 41:48.800]  not about any particular gun. It's not about muzzle loaders. It's about the right to keep
[41:48.800 --> 41:55.080]  and bear arms. That means guns, pistols, rifles. That means the bullets that you shoot out
[41:55.080 --> 41:59.840]  of them. That means swords and knives if necessary. It's a way to protect yourself, a right of
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.640]  self-defense that we get from God that's recognized in the Constitution.
[42:03.640 --> 42:09.480]  Let's go to Mike and Ferguson. I'm sorry, Mike and Michigan about Ferguson. Go ahead,
[42:09.480 --> 42:10.480]  Mike.
[42:10.480 --> 42:16.680]  Hello, David. Yeah, I just have one comment about this. It strikes me kind of funny that
[42:16.680 --> 42:22.960]  they had the shooting down there last night in Ferguson. And then, I mean, the ATF has
[42:22.960 --> 42:27.560]  shelved us about this. I was just kind of wondering what kind of ammo they're using.
[42:27.560 --> 42:32.120]  Yeah, exactly. At the same time, they're trying to push this ammunition band saying, these
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.640]  are cop killers. Now we have a couple of cops get killed. I haven't heard anything about
[42:36.640 --> 42:39.640]  that. Have you heard anything about that, Paul? I don't think they've had that kind
[42:39.640 --> 42:40.640]  of specificity.
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.440]  There's no information on the bullets used. The fact that they were injured and not killed
[42:45.440 --> 42:49.400]  probably suggests that it wasn't arm-appeasing or anything, but we don't know yet.
[42:49.400 --> 42:53.240]  Yeah. We don't even know with certainty because there's been conflicting reports whether the
[42:53.240 --> 42:57.440]  shots came from the crowd or where they came from a distance over a hill. Thank you, Mike.
[42:57.440 --> 43:00.880]  Let's go to Nick in Missouri. Nick, are you close to Ferguson?
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.120]  Yeah, I'm, uh...
[43:04.120 --> 43:06.520]  Hello, Nick.
[43:06.520 --> 43:13.120]  Okay, let's go to Christina in Colorado. Go ahead, Christina.
[43:13.120 --> 43:22.080]  Well, until we get our president, first of all, straightened out with all of his so-called
[43:22.080 --> 43:29.160]  rules, we're not going to get America to back everything that needs to be backed up. Our
[43:29.160 --> 43:34.680]  country is going to hell because we have a lousy president, and plus, he's trying to
[43:34.680 --> 43:41.840]  stop us from doing anything, anything. And that is a no-no as far as American people
[43:41.840 --> 43:49.360]  are concerned. We have rights from God Almighty. I'm sick of this president and all of his
[43:49.360 --> 43:56.760]  actions of doing what he wants to do. You know, our government, our right says when
[43:56.760 --> 44:03.920]  a government no longer rules as they should, it's time to get the hell out of it.
[44:03.920 --> 44:07.560]  Well, absolutely. That's what the Declaration of Independence says. It says that we create
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.200]  governments to protect our rights, and when those governments destroy our rights, we have
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.280]  the right and the duty to alter or abolish that government. I think it was interesting
[44:15.280 --> 44:20.480]  that when the FBI came against Barrett Brown as we interviewed him last week, one of the
[44:20.480 --> 44:24.320]  things they did was they confiscated his Declaration of Independence, and they said,
[44:24.320 --> 44:29.280]  you've got that. That shows that you're a radical. Well, what they did was they eventually
[44:29.280 --> 44:32.640]  gave that back to him. They wanted to keep that as part of the plea bargaining, and the
[44:32.640 --> 44:36.400]  judge says, no, I think you should give him back his Declaration of Independence. He said
[44:36.400 --> 44:40.480]  he didn't want to report it because most of his liberal friends in the Huffington Post
[44:40.480 --> 44:43.840]  and Slate that follow him wouldn't believe that the government would do that. Of course,
[44:43.840 --> 44:47.520]  he understood that they would, but they eventually gave that back to him. But you know what?
[44:47.520 --> 44:53.320]  They kept his rights. And when you're talking about Obama acting as an executive dictator,
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.160]  there's a story today from Lindsey Graham. And I want people to think about what Lindsey
[44:57.160 --> 45:01.700]  Graham just said about running for president and understand if you're a liberal Democrat
[45:01.700 --> 45:07.680]  who supports Obama's executive orders and his dictatorial mandates and his arrogance saying,
[45:07.680 --> 45:12.080]  I don't care what Congress wants. I don't care what the process is. I mean, 20 some-odd
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.200]  times he said he did not have authority to do the things that he's doing with amnesty.
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.280]  And then he comes back and he tells him later, I changed the law for you. No, he didn't.
[45:22.280 --> 45:26.320]  No, he didn't. It's not legal. But this is what you're going to wind up with if you support
[45:26.320 --> 45:32.160]  that because you are so into being a member of the Democrat Party or you bought into this
[45:32.160 --> 45:35.360]  political division, you're going to get a president. That's going to be like Lindsey
[45:35.360 --> 45:41.640]  Graham where he says, as president, I would deploy the military against Congress. Yeah.
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.120]  And you know what? He probably wouldn't give him a lawyer either. That's like number, reason
[45:46.120 --> 45:52.200]  number 975, why Lindsey Graham shouldn't be a senator, especially not a president. Paul,
[45:52.200 --> 45:56.880]  what do you think about Lindsey Graham? Well, David, imagine if there was a right
[45:56.880 --> 46:03.400]  winger who was stockpiling ammo, threatening to overthrow the Democratic Republic of the
[46:03.400 --> 46:09.120]  United States, threatening to overthrow the government, who had met with leaders of Al-Qaeda
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.960]  and ISIS, which is what Lindsey Graham has done. He met with Syrian rebels that went
[46:14.960 --> 46:22.080]  on to join Al-Qaeda. He met with Bel Hage in Libya, leader of the LIFG, who went on
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.800]  to become the leader of ISIS in Libya. So here's a guy who's met with terrorists, is
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.560]  threatening to overthrow the government. And he's in Congress. He should be in jail.
[46:32.560 --> 46:38.000]  Absolutely. Let's go to Anthony and Kentucky. Anthony, you want to talk about racial division?
[46:38.000 --> 46:47.000]  Yeah. Well, basically, my point that I wanted to make was this whole push for like a violent
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.760]  revolution. A lot of these folks that are pushing for this are only reading inflammatory
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.240]  headlines. A lot of times they're not even going into the article that I'm seeing, let
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.720]  alone checking the sources to see whether or not that article is just trying to play
[47:03.720 --> 47:12.480]  on your emotions. And in some cases, I'm seeing a lot of really heartfelt rhetoric
[47:12.480 --> 47:19.760]  coming from these people, but a lot of it is, it's not directed in the right spots or
[47:19.760 --> 47:26.480]  it's basically just coming off angry and foolish, seeking for blood of these cops and stuff.
[47:26.480 --> 47:31.280]  A lot of them, they don't realize that a lot of these cops are actually, they're good
[47:31.280 --> 47:38.240]  guys too. They're on our side with a lot of this stuff. And basically, if a violent revolution
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.560]  does kick off, a lot of these same people that are advocating for this are going to
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.960]  quickly realize that we're not living in a Hollywood blockbuster movie and this is going
[47:47.960 --> 47:51.160]  to be real blood spilled. This is going to be real violence. This is going to be a real
[47:51.160 --> 47:57.640]  problem. And you guys know, anybody who's listened to this show long enough knows that
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.160]  everything is in place for them to put this country on lockdown.
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.840]  Absolutely. I understand, you know, the paraphrase, Kennedy, if you make peaceful change impossible,
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.400]  you make a violent change inevitable. I understand that. I understand the frustration from people
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.400]  who have been profiled, black people who have been unfairly treated, especially in the war
[48:16.400 --> 48:21.040]  on drugs. I also understand the anger on the right about how we've got these people who
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.400]  swear to uphold the Constitution and are violating on an irregular basis. But we have to understand
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.880]  that just like we can't build a nation abroad by going in and trying to impose democracy
[48:29.880 --> 48:34.400]  on people, it's something that has to grow up organically in our hearts, in our minds.
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.960]  That's why it's primarily an information war. And if we try to start some kind of a violent
[48:38.960 --> 48:45.200]  revolution, whether it's for racism or whether it's for even supporting a return to the Constitution,
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.520]  that is going to backfire severely. That's going to set it back just as we see the efforts
[48:50.520 --> 48:55.480]  to stop police brutality being set back by these actions in Ferguson, Paul.
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.960]  Yeah. So what the call was saying originally about people not reading into these articles,
[48:59.960 --> 49:04.360]  just seeing these inflammatory headlines. There was another police shooting in Wisconsin
[49:04.360 --> 49:10.400]  recently, and all the headlines, you know, CBS, ABC, CNN, white police officer shoots
[49:10.400 --> 49:17.480]  black teen, unarmed black teen, you actually read into the article. He was beating the
[49:17.480 --> 49:24.240]  cop around the head repeatedly. So they remove the context, they remove the justification
[49:24.240 --> 49:29.240]  to push this race war narrative. We see it again and again, and it's being funded by
[49:29.240 --> 49:36.440]  George Soros to the tune of $33 million over the past year. All of that context is stripped
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.360]  out, which is why people are being misled in this whole movement.
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.160]  Absolutely. Thank you, Paul, for providing us with the context. And of course, we're
[49:45.160 --> 49:53.080]  going to continue with your calls here. Let's go to Denise in FEMA 6. Go ahead, Denise.
[49:53.080 --> 50:00.040]  Hey, thanks to Infowars. I appreciate all you and the staff. And I just want to say
[50:00.040 --> 50:06.480]  I am so disgusted that people are cheering about the police being killed. That is so
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.200]  wrong. You know, Martin Luther King would be turning in his grave. He was a peaceful
[50:12.200 --> 50:17.800]  man. And I think that's why they got rid of him. Yes. Yes, they don't want peaceful
[50:17.800 --> 50:26.120]  change. I mean, people are more worried about a criminal. A criminal. This man was a criminal.
[50:26.120 --> 50:34.760]  Yes. He was not some innocent person bystander getting shot by police. No, he was a criminal.
[50:34.760 --> 50:41.440]  Why do these people in Ferguson do not understand this? And I understand there is some police
[50:41.440 --> 50:49.440]  brutality. But get to the real police brutality where police are shooting kids with plight
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.560]  guns. Now, that's why... I agree. We're out of time. Thank you for calling us, Denise.
[50:53.560 --> 50:58.040]  And thank you, Paul, for your perspective on this, putting this all in context. Stay
[50:58.040 --> 51:03.400]  with us. We'll be right back. Why use dial-up when you can use broadband? Why travel with
[51:03.400 --> 51:10.040]  this? When you can use this? And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when

[51:58.600 --> 52:02.800]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell you about Matt
[52:02.800 --> 52:07.800]  Redhog and his team of patriots over at My Patriots Supply. Several years ago, Matt
[52:07.800 --> 52:11.240]  was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country
[52:11.240 --> 52:15.320]  was headed, and the Charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to
[52:15.320 --> 52:20.720]  take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born. My Patriots Supply has
[52:20.720 --> 52:25.880]  never taken a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities
[52:25.880 --> 52:30.800]  and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women. It is rare to find companies who
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.720]  practice what they preach, and that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable
[52:35.720 --> 52:41.800]  foods from My Patriots Supply. Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today for special

[53:02.880 --> 53:07.360]  water. Good thing we have the Berkey system. It's the cleanest, best water ever. Mom says
[53:07.360 --> 53:11.640]  it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only pure,
[53:11.640 --> 53:16.880]  delicious water. I know, right? You love it too! Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get

[54:09.200 --> 54:13.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in Austin. We're going to be joined
[54:13.360 --> 54:19.520]  in the next hour by a representative from the National Motorist Association. And it's important
[54:19.520 --> 54:24.640]  for us to remember that what took down the Ferguson Sheriff, what took down the corrupt
[54:24.640 --> 54:30.640]  judge that was running the court there, was them using the courts and the police department
[54:31.280 --> 54:37.280]  unconstitutionally, violating also the state laws, using them as revenue collection,
[54:37.280 --> 54:41.200]  and basically running a kangaroo court. That's what they took them down for. In the same way
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.880]  that Al Capone didn't get taken down for violating alcohol prohibition, he got taken down because
[54:46.880 --> 54:54.640]  of the tax issues. We need to understand that you can reform the system by addressing some
[54:54.640 --> 55:00.000]  fundamental injustices. And the way we have been treated for my entire life in this country
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.480]  on the highways is an outrage, and it's illegal. And so we're going to talk to the
[55:04.480 --> 55:10.480]  National Motorist Association. What can you do to make driving not only just a better experience
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.160]  the way that taxes are allocated, but we have some real issues that are coming down the road
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.760]  with police surveillance. It's going to really ramp up. It's going to be much worse even after
[55:21.760 --> 55:28.000]  they get rid of the police on the road once they make your car the snitch. It's going to get very
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.880]  difficult. So we're going to talk to them in the next segment. But of course, using a quota system
[55:32.880 --> 55:37.520]  is something that is going on rampantly throughout police departments all over this country,
[55:37.520 --> 55:41.280]  not just in Ferguson. We're going to talk about some of that with them. But I want to play this
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.400]  clip and then I'll get back to your calls here. In Michigan, we have a Michigan sheriff officer
[55:47.440 --> 55:53.280]  admitting to breaking federal state law as he's addressing the commissioners, the county commissioners,
[55:53.280 --> 55:58.960]  and then they pass a resolution that endorses him breaking state and federal laws. Let's play that
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.600]  clip real quickly. He is not responsible for taking any complaints. His responsibility is strictly
[56:03.600 --> 56:09.280]  traffic. Okay. And I clear that with me. I'm a numbers guy. So I know you're not allowed to do
[56:09.280 --> 56:13.120]  it by federal law and state law, but I do put stipulations on the numbers I want to see by
[56:13.120 --> 56:17.040]  the end of their shift. And we have in the past, the guys can't perform numbers that have been
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.960]  removed from all over time for that particular grant for the remainder of the year. So good.
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.760]  That clears that up. Thank you. So he's standing there talking to the county commissioners.
[56:27.760 --> 56:33.600]  Officers on their past days can sign up for these extra overtime patrols. So that does make a nice
[56:33.600 --> 56:38.880]  does tie up the normal roll control. The commissioner door was a chief in Fremont when we had the last
[56:38.880 --> 56:44.880]  two grants there and he can tell you how how they work and how they are. Yeah, but I'd rather you
[56:44.880 --> 56:59.440]  did it. So yeah. Rather you did it. Okay, that's enough for that. That's that's an article that's
[56:59.440 --> 57:02.320]  from the Free Thought Project. And of course, they point out that not only does he admit to
[57:02.320 --> 57:06.560]  breaking the law, but after he does so, they laugh and say we'd rather you do it. The commissioners
[57:06.560 --> 57:12.080]  vote to an act as measure to break the law. And here's the Michigan vehicle code. It says a police
[57:12.080 --> 57:19.360]  officer shall not be required to issue a predetermined or specified number of citations or ordinances,
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.600]  substantially corresponding provisions of the site. In other words, you're not going to have quotas.
[57:24.240 --> 57:28.720]  They know what the law is. They break the law anyway. And we need to stand together and fight
[57:28.720 --> 57:32.320]  them. And that's what the National Motorist Association is encouraging people to do. Let's go
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.480]  back to your calls. We have a little bit of time to take them before we get to our guests.
[57:36.480 --> 57:44.320]  Let's go to Jeff in Tennessee. Jeff. Hey, David. Hey, go ahead. Good talk to you. Thank you. David.
[57:45.360 --> 57:50.880]  User area yesterday, I was trying to make a point on the Green Tip ammo and I cut myself off. Oh,
[57:50.880 --> 57:58.480]  yeah. It doesn't seem like it's set up. It's almost like fast and furious on a domestic
[57:58.480 --> 58:05.680]  level. You may know this better than I do, but I don't know of any 308 or 300 mag or 30 out
[58:05.680 --> 58:12.320]  six Green Tip ammo on the market. It may be, but I haven't seen it. How come it's just 223? And how
[58:12.320 --> 58:17.200]  come, you know, it's almost like put out there so that if somebody does take it and shoot up a bunch
[58:17.200 --> 58:22.800]  of cops, then we're going to come after the ammo and the gun. And if nobody does it, then we'll ban
[58:22.800 --> 58:26.640]  it because they shouldn't have had it to begin with. Well, they're trying to set up a framework,
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.000]  Jeff, and they're trying to pretend that they've got some objective standards saying that it's a
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.520]  cop killing bullet that pierces soft armor. Using that, they will banned pretty much most of the
[58:35.520 --> 58:39.040]  rifle ammunition. Stay with us. We'll be right back with your calls and then with our guests.

[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.200]  he's going to talk to us about how you can stand up for your rights in court we need to understand
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:43.040]  that across this country we have police departments enforcing quotas has been admitted many times the
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.720]  new york police department came after adrian schoolcraft when he made audio recordings exposing
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:55.520]  their quotas for minor offenses not just traffic tickets but all kinds of minor offenses in new
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.280]  york and of course they denied that that happened they even arrested him and put him in an asylum
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.280]  disappeared him and the he made a second audio tape when they came to his apartment it took him
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.520]  away of the second in command of the new york police department at the time threatening to
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.000]  take him away unless he gave up his tapes and they found the tape that he had on him but they
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.360]  didn't find the tape that he had up on the shelf behind the books and so we know exactly what was
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.400]  said in that room his father had to track him down his father was also a police officer but they
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:34.480]  said we don't have any quotas but we saw what happened after the eric garner murder we saw that
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:43.760]  he was killed over a minor violation taxes on tobacco and in response to the to the city hall
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:49.280]  criticism from mayor de blasio they said we're going to stop arresting and ticketing people
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.960]  unless it's absolutely necessary and guess what it went down by 95 percent and they lost millions
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.960]  in the city of new york for several weeks uh i think a little bit more than a month
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.760]  illustrating the fact that most of what they do is revenue collection and we've got numerous
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.520]  examples of this all across the country that are happening so we're going to talk to the
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:12.000]  national motorist association about what you can do and what you need to do to stand up for your

[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.280]  you know you know people wake up from a lot of different ways and i'm glad people are waking up
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:52.720]  as they watch opama but you know this uh system that we live under has been operating unconstitutionally
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:58.640]  and in a predatory and criminal way since long before any of us ever heard of obama now i'm uh
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.840]  i've always voted republican and all that until ten years ago when i woke up and you know people
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.640]  think that this is this started and is going to end with obama and i keep hearing people say well
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.400]  obama's not going to leave office he's going to declare martial law i've been hearing that for
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.840]  every president ever since i can remember i think it's a bunch of bullshit well they've been operating
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.760]  under an emergency declaration since fdr but yeah it's uh people need to wake up and they need to
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.360]  understand this isn't a republican it isn't a democrat thing as i pointed out earlier we got
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.000]  lindsay graham saying as president i would deploy the military against congress well maybe he's
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.160]  exaggerating there for a point but he's the guy who said shut up you don't get a lawyer when they're
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.920]  talking about indefinite detention without trial this guy is ruthless and the people who want to
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.000]  excuse it for obama are going to find it under republican and the people who are republicans
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.640]  thinking it's only obama are going to wake up too so i don't have time for more of your calls uh

[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:23.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we're going to be talking to the vice
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.560]  president of the national motor association john bowman in just a moment but i think we need to
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:35.120]  remember that before this police shooting happened yesterday we had the police chief as well as a
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:42.400]  corrupt judge and his court both taken out and the basis for it had nothing to do with michael
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.360]  brown the basis for them being taken out was that they were violating state and federal laws
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:56.240]  in terms of quotas in terms of using their police and their court system to generate revenue not to
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.760]  protect people not to enforce law but to generate revenue that is strictly prohibited under Missouri
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.800]  law as it is in most states and it is prohibited by the constitution as the justice department
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.080]  pointed out we have ample evidence of this let me just read you some of the cases going back to
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:20.320]  2011 we have a police chief in league city texas accused of threatening to punish officers if they
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:25.200]  didn't write a certain amount of tickets and of course tickets are ticket quotas are legal
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:34.400]  according to the texas transportation code then we have another one may 20th 2013 this is in
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:41.440]  fort worth a north texas officer says that ticket quotas do exist and it may be a ticket to getting
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.440]  a trophy so he blew the whistle on the fort worth police and he spoke to the local news writers
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.440]  there now what they were telling them there was they weren't saying we need a certain number of
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.480]  tickets no they were very clever about it they called them we have to have a certain number of
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:02.800]  contacts with the public each day we need four contacts with the public each day oh we don't
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.960]  mean that's tickets let me tell you what they're not pulling people over and having them roll down
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.880]  the window and say i just want to tell you how awesome you are i would you get this car i just
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.880]  love this car now they're giving them tickets that's what they mean by contacts now the police in
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:21.120]  houston got even more ridiculous about this this is a story going back to 2006 they had a
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.800]  quota system but they called it getting two quote unquote ducks a day two ducks a day
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:34.400]  and i reported this in the houston chronicle they said well they ran afoul of the law yeah
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.320]  you know what if it doesn't look like a duck if it looks like a traffic ticket it acts like a
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.640]  traffic ticket and it's things like a traffic ticket it's a traffic ticket and then just this
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.120]  month uh just march 9th just a couple of days ago we see cops across the country being disciplined
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:53.360]  not for brutality but for not writing enough tickets they're talking about cops in wittier
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.200]  california of course we got the entire highway patrol involved in this in tennessee we've got
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:05.920]  another cop that was fired this is an article from july 25th 2013 info wars cop fired for
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.560]  speaking out against ticket and arrest quotas so there's a lot of law breaking going on by the
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.440]  police when they're writing these tickets and the national motorists association wants to
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.640]  help you stand up for your rights and they will offer you they'll back you up they'll offer you
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.280]  help to fight these tickets in court they want you to go to court they want you to stand up for
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.600]  your rights individually if you lose they've got a program a traffic justice program they call it
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.600]  well they will pay for your ticket your court costs and so we want to talk to them about that
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.280]  as well as the many issues joining us now is john bowman of the national motorists association
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:49.360]  welcome john hi david it's great to be with you thank you for coming on now we started out talking
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:56.960]  about these uh traffic quotas and uh talk to us about that that that's a widespread national issue
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.880]  of course it is and it's getting a lot of attention lately as you pointed out we we see instances
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.680]  from all over the country very similar to what you're talking about where a cop will sort of
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.600]  blow the whistle on what is the the worst kept secret in law enforcement in terms of ticket
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:20.080]  quotas and the way a lot of the departments sort of spin this is they say well we don't have ticket
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:27.600]  ticket quotas per se but we do use the ticket volume that an officer writes in terms of measuring
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.400]  their overall performance for promotions and for hr purposes so they say we these are nothing more
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.920]  than performance measures and that's how they get around this but um they're for all practical
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:47.520]  purposes they are quotas and quotas really take away what we think is is one of the police officers
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.800]  most valuable tools and that's discretion and judgment and there are certain cases where
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.480]  normally an officer would not write a ticket but they're under the gun so to speak for their quota
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:04.720]  and they'll they'll write up a a lousy ticket and um move on so motorists and people on the
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.520]  street are the other ones who really suffer over this let me talk about uh you've got I think it's
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.480]  about 10 points on your website program things that you guys are standing for here that I think
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.000]  are very interesting kind of gives people a feel for uh what the problems are on our roads you say
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.040]  uh number one taxes related driving or vehicle ownership should only be used for road construction
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.600]  maintenance two drivers already pay taxes to construct and maintain roads so they shouldn't
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.920]  be forced to pay them again in the form of toll roads and of course uh john we're going to see
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.720]  that these toll roads are going to take a completely different form in terms of charging us by the
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.920]  mile once we get the black box recorders in our cars and that was the way that I found you was by
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.600]  an article that was written by your president about the black box recorders that have been finding
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.960]  their ways into our cars since 1994 going back to 1994 there was only a couple of models of
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:01.440]  GM cars that had the black box recorders in it that's been building and as of 2015 models
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.080]  all manufacturers are now required to have these black box recorders in there and we know how
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.480]  this is going to break down the very company that's making these black box recorders Harris
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.920]  semiconductor has also been making stingray devices that the police have been using illegally
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:23.040]  without search warrants to search our phones as we move around mostly moving around in cars
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.440]  so we know that with the combination of the capability of collecting and storing this
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.360]  information we know from what we've seen we just had a report yesterday how the CIA is doing the
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.200]  same thing probably using the same uh they didn't mention this is a wall street journal article
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.280]  they didn't mention that it was Harris semiconductor but we know that the CIA has been working with the
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:48.960]  US Marshals also spying on people in a drag net manner illegally we know what they're going to do
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.440]  with these vehicle to vehicle communications with these talking cars with these black boxes
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.440]  they're going to be recording the number of miles that you drive so they can tax you they're
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:02.320]  going to be instantly giving you speeding tickets so that you can no longer be able to
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.760]  really drive your car they're going to push people out of the cars into these self-driving cars
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:13.120]  um i'll boy you've really uh set a multiple there and yeah eventually it will come down to that
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.440]  be uh all of the technology that's available now and you mentioned some of that through through
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.800]  black boxes through vehicle to vehicle communications and any number of other surveillance and and
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:30.240]  communications uh technologies yeah you are going to be tracked pretty much everywhere you go uh
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.200]  they'll know how you're driving whether you're driving recklessly or exceeding the speed limit
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:44.160]  and what's more is um they'll be able to charge you accordingly um based on uh congestion fees
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:50.080]  and things like that so there's a social engineering aspect to this which we find very troubling
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.200]  you know we believe that people should be able to to drive where they want to when they want to
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.240]  and how they want to you know in an unencumbered way but when you start putting incentives in
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:06.640]  place like well you can't drive into the to the downtown area between four and six p.m. unless you
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.280]  pay double for the mileage um this this gets into some very uncomfortable areas for a lot of people
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:19.680]  and and we see this coming up ultimately though who knows we probably will have driverless cars
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.160]  maybe not as soon as a lot of people think we will but ultimately yeah i think we will see
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.920]  that and probably uh you know widespread in 15 to 20 years and then who knows what happens
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.440]  after that it's there's still a lot of questions i think it's going to happen much
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.280]  sooner than that that's the only thing i would disagree with you on i know that we both agree
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.680]  that moving about in the country moving about anywhere that should be a basic fundamental
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.720]  right and it is a very dangerous uh situation that we're put into when the government takes
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.760]  control of transportation i think john that's been what's behind the war on cars for a very
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.080]  long time the government wants to control our movement they want us to be dependent on them
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.920]  to move around and they will be able to do that with these driverless cars the head of uber has
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.240]  all already gone on record saying you know what makes taxis what makes our service expensive
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.120]  is that dude in the car and once that dude goes away we get very cheap and you know what else goes
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:16.160]  away he says is private ownership of cars i think it's very important for us to come together
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.400]  with organizations like yours just like people have come together to defend second amendment
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.280]  rights we need to come together to defend our ability to travel we need to stand collectively
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.040]  to defend our individual rights i want to read a couple of other things get your comments about this
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.840]  program that you have in terms of the traffic justice program some of the other things that
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.440]  you point out on your website the 10 points you say drivers should not be stopped or detained
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.840]  without probable cause that's what we're seeing happening in ferguson money should not be corrupting
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.480]  our traffic enforcement system corporations should have no influence on traffic laws or public
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.760]  referendums and drivers have a right to a fair trial that's what you're trying to get people to
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:58.560]  stand up that's the way we shut down this kind of quota system isn't it it is you know we believe
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.600]  that people should fight every single traffic ticket they get we know it's a hassle but
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.520]  really the only way to reform a corrupt traffic justice system that that is geared towards
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:16.960]  generating revenue above all else is to get people to exercise that system and to point out its laws
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:23.760]  to take advantage of it and ultimately just to break it down unfortunately it's very hard to do
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:30.160]  we estimate that about only five percent of people who get traffic tickets ever bother to fight them
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:37.120]  and of course you know that that um if you don't fight your traffic ticket you've lost already
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.520]  i mean you're throwing up your hands you're making that payment you're getting points on your license
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.160]  and you'll never know what you could have done had you gone to court and stood up for yourself
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.280]  and that's the only way that a system like this is going to change well they make it very enticing
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.800]  for you to compromise on your rights because they'll try they'll they'll raise the uh level of the
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.640]  ticket to a higher than that when you come to them they'll say well i'll tell you what we'll
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.600]  knock a couple of miles off of it we'll make it so that you don't get points on your insurance
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:12.080]  etc etc so they'll try to get you to compromise your fundamental rights you have to hang tough
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.520]  because this is about something that is far more important than just your ticket it's about rolling
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.680]  back this illegal uh system that compromises our due process and it's about standing up
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.000]  to a government that says that you're not going to have due process i don't know how many states
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.400]  there are maybe you can speak to this here in texas you can check a box and say that you want a
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.640]  jury trial yeah some states will allow you to have a jury trial for a traffic ticket many do not
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:45.520]  um we would encourage everyone if they have that option to to take it through a jury trial um
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.520]  you know fighting a traffic ticket sometimes is a little bit we gotta go to a break hang on
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.560]  we'll be right back and i want you to tell people what you do to help people fight this
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.680]  in court stay with us we'll be right back with the national motorist association
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.720]  i'm mike huckabee i was the governor of arkansas and rent for president in 2008
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.280]  and i used to be a diabetic one of the coolest campaigns i ever took on and one was the crusade
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.080]  that reversed my type 2 diabetes naturally i was able to get off the medications i'd taken and i

[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:12.000]  general show i'm david night and we're talking to john bowman of the national motorist association
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.320]  their website is motorists dot org this is an organization that was started in 1982 to commit
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.280]  to combat the 55 mile an hour national maximum speed limit they were successful in getting that
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.560]  returned i want to talk to him in this last segment we have him for about the assistance that they
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.920]  offer people to fight traffic tickets in court and the incentives that they offer for people to do
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.360]  that you know we have a right to travel we have a right to move about freely it's one of the worst
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.080]  ways that government can control you if they can restrict your movement we should be very concerned
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.400]  about the efforts to do this but of course the way they typically enact these kind of controls
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.400]  is to do it illegally so we're going to talk to him about that i want you to remember too
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.840]  that you know george washington once said the british move about freely but it's between high
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:03.280]  walls in other words they were very constricted even though they had some leeway and what they
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.720]  could do and that's the situation we're in today we feel like we're free in some respect but boy
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.960]  we hit those walls pretty quickly because they are much higher they're much closer to us than
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.640]  ever before and they've got surveillance cameras all over them and now they're putting those
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:22.000]  surveillance cameras in our cars and they're going to be monitoring everything we do right
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.480]  now we need to stand up that we need to remember that this is the way they got the corrupt sheriff
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.040]  in Ferguson as well as the corrupt court to stand down was because they were setting up a traffic
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.920]  quota system you need to fight this you don't need to compromise with us we just had one of the
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.040]  fellows in the staff area saying that he just got a ticket and there's a discount on the back
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.320]  for paying it off early they do everything to try to incentivize you to compromise your rights
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.680]  but tell us uh john bowman tell us what you do to help people to fight this in court because you
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.600]  want people to stand up and fight for their rights individually absolutely we do and to help people
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.840]  do that first of all uh we're a membership-based organization so you have to join us um anyone
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:10.000]  is eligible to do so it's a $35 a year membership dues and along with that you get you get benefits
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.480]  that include um one-on-one consultations via phone and email with our staff here if you do have a
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.400]  ticket and you want some assistance fighting that um we also have a lot of printed information on our
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:28.800]  website as well as an ebook that members are eligible to download that goes through the whole
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.080]  process of fighting a ticket you also have access to our experts around the country who've been
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.760]  through this process and know the lay of the land locally so you can you can consult with them as well
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.720]  but i think the thing that you're leading up to is what we call our traffic justice program
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:51.120]  which if you meet the requirements for it if you go to court and fight your this is specific to
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:57.680]  speeding tickets you fight your speeding ticket um and still get a guilty verdict we will reimburse
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:06.000]  you for the cost of the ticket as well as court fees up to a maximum amount um per year and that
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.520]  there really aren't many requirements for this but the big one is that people have to be an existing
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.680]  active member of the association at the time they get their ticket in order to be eligible for this
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.880]  so if you've got a traffic ticket pending right now and you join us and try to take advantage
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.600]  of the program you won't be eligible for it right but of course you can still as a member you can
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.800]  still get help to understand how to fight this in court and that's one of the key things because
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.880]  it really can be fought in court one of the things that you point out on your on your uh
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:41.280]  blog one of the 10 points that you're talking about as you say speed limits should be consistent
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.960]  with typical speeds of normal responsible drivers and you also have a lot of information there about
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.720]  speed traps throughout the country as well don't you we do it's one of our primary issues and uh
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:00.480]  speed limits that are set artificially too low meaning below the prevailing speed of traffic on
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.800]  a given stretch of road um those tend to breed speed traps because there there is a natural
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:12.160]  speed that that people reach on a on a highway and they tend to travel at that speed no matter
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.120]  what the the posted speed limit is and as it turns out that's actually the safest speed
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.960]  at which to travel when you lower the speed limit below that you're you're making violators out of
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:28.560]  a high percentage of drivers who are in fact driving responsibly and and that's what breeds
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.160]  speed traps for revenue purposes or the other thing that they do which is what they do around
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.800]  here in austin is they will change the speed uh quite a bit over a very short period of time
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.360]  that's another tactic one of the things that you talk about of course who is uh red light
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.640]  tickets as well as speed cameras and of course this is something that is in the very very early
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:52.880]  stages we're going to see this on steroids as we have this electronic uh uh these listening
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.440]  devices move their way into our cars with not only the black boxes but the vehicle to vehicle
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:03.040]  communication even before we get to driverless cars we are going to have that kind of situation
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.320]  coming in on steroids and so we need to get together and fight collectively against this
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.280]  and i think organizations like yours are going to be very important for us to stand up for our
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:18.800]  rights to be able to travel otherwise they're going to have us in corporately owned cars owned
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.680]  by a couple of companies like uber and we're going to have all of our movements controlled and watched
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:31.920]  aren't we john we are and a couple of that with uh things like national ids the real i i d act that
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:37.120]  is going to be coming full force next year and certainly there are going to be more and more

[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:39.440]  you may remember him from a couple of years ago when he introduced a bill to stop the
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:46.560]  tsa from sexually molesting american citizens especially children he was outraged by it as
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.760]  we all should be i really like david simpson he's a christian libertarian he's somebody
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:58.400]  who can speak to a very important group of people and that is the christians who reflexively support
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:04.240]  prohibition prohibition was supported alcohol prohibition was was foisted upon us by a lot of
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:11.440]  well-meaning people who didn't understand that government is force george washington the founders
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.960]  of this country understood that they lectured us about that they said it's not persuasion
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.400]  it's not a compassion it's force it's like a fire you have to keep control of it it is a
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:27.680]  fearful servant and a dreadful master but we've lost that lesson we use the government as a hammer
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:34.880]  because it's only one tool government is force and if you've got only one tool force you see
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:40.240]  everything as if it if it's a hammer you see everything as a nail and so we go around hammering
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:47.360]  everybody trying to change people using force and unfortunately in the war on drugs christians
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.000]  are perhaps the worst about this i'm ashamed to say this as a christian
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.560]  and so i wanted to get david simpson on because he talks to christians and if you're not a christian
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:02.000]  if you're an atheist listen to him because you if you're a libertarian you need to understand
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.960]  how to talk to christians how to explain to them that they shouldn't use this this hammer
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.640]  to nail people on this this is a medical issue it's a psychological issue it's a spiritual issue
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.600]  if you're a christian you should understand this david simpson has introduced a bill that would
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.520]  essentially remove marijuana from all the texas criminal code very different from what's been done
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.880]  in states where they've legalized recreational use and colorado washington alaska and in the
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:36.640]  district of columbia in those areas they want to still regulate and tax it very heavily no david
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:43.520]  simpson says it is something that god did not make a mistake when he made it god made marijuana
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:50.720]  think about that and it has some real beneficial uses there's a story up on info wars dot com today
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:57.200]  father faces 20 years in prison for treating daughters cancer with cannabis oil and when
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.520]  i heard david simpson talk about this that's what he was talking about he was talking about
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:07.280]  medical marijuana he was talking about two children in particular in his constituency
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:13.840]  both of them suffering from severe medical conditions and they could get no relief whatsoever
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.320]  from conventional medical pharmaceutical treatments the only thing that helped them
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.680]  was cannabis oil one family had the money that they could go to colorado and do it legally
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:28.560]  the only thing that stopped their child's convulsions over a period of time was cannabis oil but of
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:37.200]  course the cannabis oil has thc in it and so it's not legal it's actually a schedule one drug under
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:44.240]  our drug laws which says that it has no medical value whatsoever that's clearly a lie and i want
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.720]  to talk to conservatives and the christians and get them to understand that this is something that
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:55.520]  began at the united nations 10 years 10 years before nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:04.000]  in 1961 the united nations set up a framework an agenda just like agenda 21 just like they're
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.440]  setting up the un arms trade treaty they always set these things up in the un governments sign up
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:16.400]  as a treaty and say we'll enact this into law 10 years later our government set up a narcotics law
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:23.920]  with the same drug scheduling that the un had proposed in 1961 we set that up in 1971 and of
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.760]  course it's been the un that has come back and said we have to lecturing the american government
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.840]  saying you've got to shut this down in colorado in washington you can't have them allowing people
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.720]  to have marijuana lock these people up and of course we have more people in prison in america
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:48.640]  than any other country per capita far more than maus china or stolons russia per capita
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.400]  it's an outrage what we have done in this country and it's time we stop it it's time we understand
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.520]  that just like alcohol prohibition it corrupts our government and it destroys private property
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:05.440]  we've seen under ronald reagan they move the emphasis to the individual rather than to the alcapones
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.960]  and in doing so creating mandatory minimums creating civil asset forfeiture what they did
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:16.320]  was they have destroyed our rights our property rights if you will why don't conservative republicans
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.800]  care about that well some do and david simpson does we're going to talk to him in the next hour
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.720]  and to give you a sample of what he says i want to play this clip this short clip of him talking
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:33.600]  about this bill that he introduced last week you know this uh the present war
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:42.400]  war on drug policies have completely failed and so you know god made marijuana he didn't
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:49.280]  make a mistake when he made it and uh i think it like all things he made should never be abused
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:55.920]  and we should people should be responsible for their actions but we shouldn't ban a plant that
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:06.640]  god made we should use hemp for rope and uh for fiber and paper we should use the marijuana with
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:14.080]  the thc in it to help people with epilepsy i've got people in the district that i served that
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:20.720]  have one of them has a daughter that they've taken to md anderson mayo's cleveland clinic
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:27.440]  taken all the pharmaceutical drugs and has not been able to help but only harm their daughter
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:36.000]  who has 15 to 20 seizures a day uh they in desperation went to colorada she went 20 uh
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.400]  she went two weeks without any seizures and not everybody has that luxury they're very
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:49.840]  wealthy and they can afford that there's a 31 year old uh that took a vaccine that killed
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:56.000]  everybody else in the lot that caused him lots of problems but his parents if lovingly cared
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:03.920]  for he's 31 years old now uh receives food through a tube but has seizures all the time they can't
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.200]  take him to colorada and they would be a felon if they if they brought the cbd oil back here
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.920]  but i don't believe we need a big government solution to this problem um we don't need a
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.720]  registries or more bureaucracy we just need to hold people accountable for their action
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.720]  absolutely and that's uh representative david simpson david simpson of lubeck texas he's
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.320]  going to be joining us in the next hour we're going to be talking to him live i couldn't agree
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.960]  with him more he has a wonderful way to tackle this as i point out we have an article up on
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.560]  info wars dot com today father faces 20 years in prison 20 years in prison because he treated
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:49.280]  his daughter's cancer with cannabis oil and we have a lot of cases where cancer has been treated
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.000]  effectively with cannabis oil i have one in my folder here that i'm going to talk to david about
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:59.680]  about a man an elderly man who went through the standard chemotherapy it looked like it was in
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:03.440]  remission but before five years was up it came back with a vengeance nothing helped him they
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.560]  put him in hospice to die he started taking cannabis oil and he walked out of the hospice
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:14.000]  place now that doesn't happen with everybody but there's clearly a medical value to this there's
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.720]  a medical value to it in terms of controlling seizures there's medical value in terms of
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.520]  controlling if people want to go through the standard chemotherapy controlling the uncontrollable
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.960]  nausea that you go through with that if you're being treated you have cancer or if you have aids
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.680]  it's absolutely criminal to take that away from people and ran paul was right when he called jeb
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:44.000]  bush out on it jeb bush in his young preppy days admitted to smoking it recreationally but jeb bush
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.480]  as governor as a former governor came out last year to try to shut down the medical use of marijuana
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:55.760]  to criminalize it to do things like sending a father to jail for 20 years because he treats his
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:01.920]  daughter who has cancer who's dying of cancer with cannabis oil jeb bush wants fathers like that
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.880]  in prison i don't know where this is coming out of i don't know what state this is and i don't see
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.040]  it on the article but that's what jeb bush wants in florida and of course 58 percent of the people
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.960]  in florida said no we're not going to do that but they needed 60 to change the law so it is still
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.480]  illegal there but ran paul made the case and he was absolutely right when he said how dare you
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:29.440]  jeb bush say that you're going to lock somebody up for using something medicinally when you used
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:34.080]  it recreationally of course there's a different standard for the jeb bushes there's a different
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.360]  standard for the hillary clinton's of this world isn't there they just walk it doesn't matter what
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:46.080]  laws they break they can violate all these laws just like a hsbc they can violate the money laundering
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.160]  laws they can month launder money for billions of dollars worth tens of billions of dollars worth
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:57.680]  for drug cartels and terrorists and yet nothing happens to them but a fine that's a very small
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.160]  percentage of their profits there's one standard for the big guys another standard for everybody
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.000]  else in of course in florida jeb bush's daughter was hooked on prescription drugs the reporter who
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.840]  reported that the fact that she got off with nothing happening to her just coincidentally
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.560]  after the bush family gave i think it was half a million dollars to the charity that was supported
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.200]  and worked with by the judge that was presiding over her case after a reporter pointed that out
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:28.240]  the reporter got attacked because that's what happens in modern america if you attack the powerful
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:34.000]  if you point out the laws that they break they come after you they come after the whistleblower
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.440]  they come after the journalist they never put the criminals who are breaking the laws in jail
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:47.360]  there's an article up on world net daily came out a couple of days ago the feds plans to force
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.960]  vaccines on adults not only are they going to prohibit us making decisions to use things that
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.720]  are safe and effective like cannabis oil they're going to force us to buy the pharmaceutical
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.080]  companies products and let me say this to all the people out there all the liberal democrats
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:10.000]  who are clamoring and there's 29 bills there's there's bills in 29 different states to take away
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:17.520]  your informed consent they get around it partially by calling it your personal belief exemption so
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.440]  you're not informed you have a personal belief if you disagree with them you're not informed you just
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:27.040]  have you have faith in something that's not scientific no there's a lot of evidence about
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:31.520]  vaccine harm and of course to say that they're going to give you an exemption says that everything
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:37.760]  is mandated unless they give you an exemption no you need our consent and we need the information
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:42.160]  but they don't want to give it to you they're not just coming after the kids and say we're
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:47.760]  going to vaccinate them in the schools if they go to school they're going to come after the adults
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:54.720]  and so this is an article by an md and she writes that there was a department of health and human
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.720]  services national adult immunization plan that was published february 5th of this year this is one
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:06.160]  that got away from me i didn't see this until just now march the 9th was the last day for public
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.360]  comment about the national adult immunization plan it's a proposal by the orchestrators of
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:17.200]  obama care she says to forcibly vaccinate all adult americans it sounds benign on the surface
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.360]  but it's not it's a five-year national plan how about that you know the communists and
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.440]  socialists love these five-year plans don't they she points that out in the article it'll
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.560]  require engagement from a wide range of stakeholders to achieve its full vision
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:37.520]  why do they always refer to these people as stakeholders because you don't have a stake in
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:44.480]  this you don't have any chips in this game you don't get to make a decision and you know what
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:49.840]  when they damage you with these vaccines you don't get to sue them either because ronald reagan
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.520]  removed the liability of the pharmaceutical companies when it comes to vaccines did you
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.440]  know that did that back in the 1980s i didn't know that until this whole thing started with
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:08.000]  the measles most people don't know that we've talked earlier this week about a case in charlotte
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.680]  north carolina this young girl two million dollars she was rewarded by the vaccine court
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:22.720]  and 250 000 a year for life and let me tell you something that is not to reward to compensate her
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.960]  for her pain and suffering or to compensate her parents for their pain and suffering that
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:31.680]  they're going through i'm sure that 250 000 they set that up just for medical bills because you
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:38.160]  know what when you go to the vaccine court the vaccine court you don't have a judge you don't
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:43.360]  have a jury you just have a judge that's sitting there allocating this stuff out and they do not
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:50.560]  compensate you for pain and suffering so i got to ask these people why would we have our informed
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.440]  consent removed when the vaccine manufacturers and there's that picture of people watching it
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.480]  that's an amazing picture that's the little girl who is suffering i think she's now 13 or 14 years
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.280]  old this happened to her when she was three months old this is the charlotte paper and they ran this
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:11.040]  article because they too were amazed maybe you don't know about the vaccine court if you don't
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:14.640]  know about it look at dr sherry tenpenny we've talked to her on the radio we've interviewed her
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.400]  many times here at info wars and she knows all about it and there's you need to educate yourself
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.720]  and others about the fact that they have absolutely no liability going back to this article at world
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:34.640]  net daily i want to read what this md said she says i have made the point that forced pro forced
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.840]  vaccination crowd is generally also the pro roe v wade crowd and you can't have both you can't
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.560]  scream for a woman's right to choose when it applies to an abortion but give her no right to choose
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:54.000]  what gets shot into her through a syringe and she said well people will come back and say
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.560]  you don't know what you're talking about abortion is a private issue vaccination is an issue of
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:04.880]  public health she says this let me be clear public health does not trump individual liberty
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.800]  end of story end of story you cannot trump individual liberty and let me tell you something
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.960]  all this nonsense about herd immunity we've said this many times it's nothing but a herd
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:21.200]  mentality if it doesn't work for an individual if you're not protected when you get your vaccine
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.600]  if it's not effective to protect you against whatever you're being vaccinated for it isn't
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.720]  going to protect you collectively either and when you give up your rights as an individual
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:36.160]  the herd doesn't have any rights either you just become a bunch of sheep who are going to be ruled
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:42.080]  by wolves but there is an amazing inconsistency in this when you look at the people who are
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.760]  reflexively so so angry at people and that's what the lady in charlotte was talking to them about
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.960]  is the picture that we just showed you the child who got a two million dollar award and a quarter
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.320]  of a million dollars each year for life one of the things they were saying is like you know there's
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.920]  there's been a lot of these cases done there's like three billion dollars have been handed out by
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:07.840]  the vaccine court but most people don't even know it exists that's why there haven't been more people
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:12.560]  going to it because they are just told that they don't have any rights to sue the pharmaceutical
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:19.360]  company that's been removed by our government under ronald reagan of course i gotta say
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:25.200]  i just cannot understand why conservatives still worship this man i think he was the biggest
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.840]  shill i've ever seen in my life he's a guy who comes in i loved his speeches i still love to
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.920]  hear ronald reagan's speeches but if you look at what he did if you look at the way he tried to
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.880]  gut the second amendment to please one of his friends who was shot if you look at what he did
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.720]  on the war on drugs if you look at what he did with a vaccine company if you look what he did
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:49.280]  with iran contra with shipping weapons and and weaponizing cocaine and crack cocaine and shipping
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:55.040]  that into la so many things there i'm sorry he makes a great speech he's a great actor he played
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:50:02.160]  the role of president really well but you know this guy was his legacy is horrific horrific he
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:08.080]  presided over civil asset forfeiture as well as mandatory minimums now the senate is coming back
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.080]  again with syspa this is going to be syspa three to make it look a little bit different they remove
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:20.560]  the p this is going to be c i s a the c represented protection it's called the cyber information
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:26.000]  sharing act that used to be called the cyber information protection sharing act uh no the
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.880]  cyber security information sharing protection act you know who they were protecting they were
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.640]  protecting the companies who share your private information with the government they were protecting
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:42.160]  them from lawsuits and here it is coming back the third time erin schwarz beat him twice and

[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.600]  welcome back to the alex journal show i'm david night and as i point out the last
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.960]  segment joining us in the next hour is representative david sentin we're going to talk to him about the
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:23.280]  law that he has just proposed last week that would basically remove marijuana from the
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:29.600]  texas legal code treat it as he points out like tomatoes or jalapenos in other words
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:36.000]  not regulate it not tax it just treat it for what it is and that is something that god created
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.640]  and that's the important thing is he approaches this from a christian perspective and we need to
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.320]  reach out to christians because they are the biggest cheerleaders unfortunately
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:50.000]  for the war on drugs and we need to reach out to the gop because even though it contradicts
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.240]  their principles of private property with things like civil asset forfeiture they're
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:55:00.960]  nevertheless reflexively supporting this policy that has failed now for 40 years and we saw it
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:07.040]  fail with alcohol prohibition now of course hillary clinton and her emails are still in the story i
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:11.520]  tweeted out earlier today you know she's telling us that uh as rand paul pointed out her convenience
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.040]  trump's national security but you know what it seems like national security always trumps our
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.640]  convenience it trumps our privacy it trumps our rights it trumps the rule of law it trumps
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:28.160]  everything it's the thing that we always appeal to to take away everything that we have as individuals
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.880]  i mean even when you look at these mandatory vaccine laws they're really saying well we
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.040]  have to have uh uh you know we've got to protect the national security of the public because so
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:43.520]  you have no rights as individuals no if you give up your rights so that you get security so that
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:49.520]  you get safety you will have neither as benjamin franklin pointed out you deserve neither but
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:53.120]  we've seen throughout history that when you give up your rights you know what you become a slave
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:59.840]  and slaves have no security you wind up in a maximum security prison i'd like to uh play this
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:06.400]  guys let's get this uh this clip set up with josh earnest squirming trying to defend hillary's
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:13.600]  clinton's deletion of emails i think that's that's a great clip but uh going back to the marijuana
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.240]  thing one of the things that is really outrageous and again look at this article look at this video
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:22.160]  that is up on info wars dot com where a father is facing 20 years in prison because
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:28.880]  he was treating his daughter who's dying of cancer with cannabis oil this is just amazing
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:32.800]  we need to have jury nullification to shut that kind of thing down and we need to have
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:36.080]  nullification at the state level which is what david simpson's going to be doing but let's go
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.280]  to that clip from hillary clinton josh did the white house know that hillary clinton
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:48.320]  was deleting 30 000 emails that she sent to secretary of state john i can tell you that
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.960]  i was not aware of the personal email habits of the secretary when painted maintaining her
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.360]  personal email inbox well i'm i'm not talking about her habits while she was secretary talking
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:03.920]  about what she did just a few months ago which was deleting 30 000 emails that she sent to secretary
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:08.720]  of state without anybody determining except for her and her team and her and her team alone
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:14.160]  but those emails didn't need to be part of the public record because they determined they were
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.000]  strictly personal well again john these were this is a decision that was made by secretary clinton
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:26.560]  and her team uh and what we're talking about are emails that she described as personal uh that relate
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.120]  to uh you know what she described as a variety of of own personal arrangements whether it's her
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:37.760]  daughter's wedding or um all these even more personal things of that nature so um again i i'd
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:41.680]  refer you to secretary clinton's team about the decision that they made on that but again we're
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:47.040]  talking about the uh a decision that she has made related to her own personal email and that falls
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:54.240]  outside the purview her personal email can can the white house assure the public her own personal
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.640]  server yeah that's that's what came out she did this let's come back she did this she says for
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:04.160]  her convenience but you know how many of you think that it's more convenient to set up your own
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:09.760]  personal server in your house than it is just to use the email that they want you to use at work
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.320]  because you want to hide what you're doing i mean that's really the issue and i think the amazing
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:19.840]  thing was how she got caught in the lie as she's standing before the un giving her prepared speech
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:26.080]  of a blow over an hour the wall street journal interviewed someone who said bill clinton never
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.480]  emails he's had two emails his entire life both of them is president and here's the two times he
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:36.000]  did he doesn't use email whatsoever and she was telling people she had this because she was emailing
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:44.880]  her husband stay with us we'll be right back thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:38.880]  which is what josh earnes keeps saying as he's squirming in front of the reporters asking
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:44.640]  why would did you know that she uh deleted 30 000 emails did you know she had a private
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:48.880]  server this guy is squirming and of course i don't even know what a personal email is but
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:54.560]  he's gonna i guess a bit of a lisp but uh rob do is kind of upset i'm upset about a lot of aspects
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:59.680]  of this and the most thing the thing i'm most upset about is the fact that just as we've seen
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:05.200]  over and over again throughout one administration republican and democrat as the other but especially
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:11.760]  in this administration i don't think anything is going to happen to her whatsoever now i want to
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.600]  take your phone calls on the issue of medical marijuana i might take some of your phone calls
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  i want to cover some news before we go to our interview it's going to be coming up in the
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.840]  second not this next segment but the uh the one just before the bottom of the hour we're
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.160]  going to be talking to david simpson we'll have him for a short period of time i want to take
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.880]  your calls on the subject of medical marijuana and i want to cover some news before we do that
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.640]  that number is 800 259 9231 again we're going to limit that to that subject of medical marijuana
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.480]  but before we get to that subject there's some other news and of course there's been a lot of news
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:51.120]  about this letter that was put together uh sent to iran by republican senators and as the new york
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:57.920]  times points out this was put together by a new senator a senator tom cotton from arkansas he is
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:03.120]  the youngest member of the senate he's only 37 years old he's been a senator for exactly 65 days
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:09.120]  the new york times points out and uh he's a veteran uh he served in iraq in 2006 they say
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:16.000]  while mr paul and mr cruz influenced the tea party and the libertarian wing of their party
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:22.400]  mr cotton personifies a wave of republican newcomers to the senate to back a hawkish
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:28.800]  interventionist form policy and then of course you've got mr neocon himself bill crystal of the
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:33.200]  weekly standard saying that he's ahead of the mainstream republicans on foreign policy thinking
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:40.160]  no he's not he is decades behind republicans on foreign policy thinking republicans are waking
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.200]  up to the nonsense of perpetual warfare and he's trying to bring us back there of course
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:51.200]  bill crystal is the editor of weekly standard and the way you spell that is w e a k l y weekly
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.920]  standard now tom cotton who put that letter together and got the senators to sign it
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:05.040]  is someone who basically saying uh look you know iran once uh obama leaves uh we're gonna rule as
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.920]  dictators as well and so we're not gonna need treaties or anything that we're signed uh so
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.640]  you just forget about this well whether or not you agree with the content of this the interesting
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:19.600]  thing about it was immediately after launching this effort according to uh first look diagram
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.120]  where this is their headline immediately after launching effort to scuttle iran deal
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:31.040]  senator tom cotton goes to meet with defense contractors yes within 24 hours he went to
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:37.760]  an off the record and strictly non attribution event with a national defense industrial association
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:45.200]  that's the lobbyist for the military industrial complex it's composed of the executives from
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:52.320]  the largest military contractors and of course cotton is auditioning for being the leader of
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:59.360]  the neocon the neoconservative warmongering wing of the republican party strongly advocating
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.800]  higher defense spending and a more aggressive foreign policy yes that's exactly what we need
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:10.640]  and if you want to know what's behind all of this uh kerfuffle about iran and this treaty
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:16.720]  it's because they're trying to get a war going no matter what now as i pointed out in the last
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:23.280]  hour i was very happy to see ran paul call out jeb bush on his hypocrisy about medical marijuana
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:30.560]  i'm not happy to see what ran paul is doing in terms of trying to court the neocon left reason
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:37.280]  points out that he wants to draw up new lines for kyrtstan and promise them a country this is
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.200]  something he's not saying if they get their independence we will recognize them no he's
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.680]  saying we need to literally remap the middle east and they point out at reason that didn't work too
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:51.200]  well for the british and we're not going to be any better at it say with us we'll be right back

[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.800]  that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire this winter season
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:50.240]  it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano now available in our limited
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:57.360]  first run at info wars life dot com that's info wars life dot com or call 888 253 3139
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:07.360]  you
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:24.800]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:28.800]  jones
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:34.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this thursday march 12 2015 i'm david night studio
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:40.400]  here in austin we're going to be talking to david simpson a texas legislator who has put
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:47.120]  forth a novel bill uh to legalize medical marijuana or legalized marijuana period not
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:51.520]  just medical marijuana we're going to take your calls on medical marijuana but david simpson's
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:57.200]  approach is novel in the sense that it doesn't impose restrictive regulations or taxes it doesn't
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:03.920]  create some kind of a spider web of regulations to entrap people no he takes the approach that
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.960]  it's something that god made and god did not make a mistake and we need to address the behavior
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:14.240]  of people separately from these particular things and of course there's a constitutional
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:18.800]  argument to be made as well we needed to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.200]  everybody agreed that with that when they passed the 18th amendment when they passed the 21st
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:31.040]  amendment to repeal that everybody understood that the power to ban us owning possessing or
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.880]  using anything was never given to the federal government and of course on the 9th and 10th
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:42.960]  amendment if we don't give them under the 10th amendment the expressed power to do something
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:47.040]  they don't have it but of course they don't operate under that premise anymore they now
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:53.520]  operate on the premise that they have all power all of our rights belong to them and we are periodically
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:10:00.160]  granted privileges and exemptions but that's not the way that it was and we have two of about 10%
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:05.760]  of the amendments practically pointing out that they don't have the authority to ban anything like
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:10.000]  alcohol or marijuana or any of the other drugs they simply don't have the constitutional authority
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.720]  to do it but we need to walk this back however we can i really applaud him on his effort and it's
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:21.520]  very important because he makes a statement an argument from a conservative christian standpoint
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:26.560]  and so that's something we all need to understand so we can talk to that group of people who are
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:31.920]  the biggest cheerleaders the biggest supporters of this failed war on drugs before i go to your
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:37.200]  calls though i want to let you know that we have a dna force on special for the first time
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.160]  as a big discount 30 off unprecedented our competitors are already two to three times
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:47.440]  the price that we charge some are charging up to $600 for similar formulas but right now at
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:55.600]  info wars life dot com you can get dna force at 30 off under $100 for the first time ever that's
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.920]  30 off on dna force at info wars life dot com i want to take your calls he's going to be joining
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.800]  us just before the bottom of the hour david simpson is to talk about his bill and i want to get your
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.560]  phone calls before and after on the topic of medical marijuana again that number is 800 259
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:18.960]  9231 let's go first to uh dr kelly in california go ahead dr hey david night it's great to talk
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.120]  to you thank you for fighting a good fight and i just wanted to talk about um the uh it's neuro
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:32.000]  protective it's cardio protective it is meaning protects the heart and the mind it is anti cancer
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.680]  the united states government has known this since 1942 they have the ability to isolate it
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:44.400]  to concentrate it to purify it and to create um what they call in their own words hashish
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:53.840]  and they knew that it was anti cancer in 1942 that's dr adams and in the trends for
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:58.960]  pharmacological sciences there's a beautiful pie chart that shows the differences between
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:06.800]  the cbd the cannabidiol the non-psychotropic properties and the thc and um i'd love to
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:13.680]  either be on the show or have you get somebody there from uh as americans for safe access
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:19.040]  oh absolutely uh make sure you give the uh your phone number to uh john harman hang on
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:22.640]  after we're finished talking because you sound very informed yeah people need to understand
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:27.120]  that there is a corporate agenda behind this you just talked about the pharmaceutical competition
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.960]  uh the fact that we've got pharmaceutical companies that don't like the competition from
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:36.320]  something that is safe effective and that they don't own but of course there was a lot of competition
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:43.920]  also in the uh with hemp uh against the cotton and textile industry uh in many different industries
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:49.760]  and so they shut that down to a large degree to protect entrenched big business but there's
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:56.480]  also a un agenda to try to control the population with this war on drugs as i point out that started
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:03.040]  in 1961 so there's a lot of different aspects to this war on drugs especially to marijuana marijuana
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:09.280]  is is the one that is is very easy for people to understand because it is so powerful medicinally
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:12.800]  thank you was there anything else you want to say dr kelly you're very informed yeah i just
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:17.760]  wanted to briefly touch on that fortunately i will be getting to volunteer at the truth tour
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:24.240]  where uh dr billy demoss is going to be hosting alex will be there anthony will be there uh
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:30.080]  dr group will be there and so it will be a fascinating amazing time to be alive in this world
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:36.960]  as uncle ronnie used to say when i thought he was a good guy yeah you're me both i'm really i'm so
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:44.240]  stoked to to hear that you guys are discussing this and that it's on a national and a worldwide level
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:50.880]  and europe didn't come along and get their patent until 1991 but the reason that the pharmaceutical
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:56.160]  industry is so against this and thank you for this little bit of forum here is that you can't have
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:05.120]  diabetes you can't have psoriasis you can't have pain you can't have bacteria you can't have uh
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:11.360]  anxiety you can't have psychosis you can't have any of these horrible awful conditions
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:19.280]  in the in the body that has adequate levels of the cbd's in it and again it's non-psychotropic
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:26.960]  it's from the industrial hemp and so that has an amazing two-fold um you know set of properties
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:36.320]  to it to where it is a food it is a fuel it is a textile it is a paint it is paper it is you know
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:43.920]  it's really incredible and then going back to genesis uh god created the the sprouting green
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:51.120]  grass three days before the cow came onto the planet and then he created man and of course woman
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:56.640]  well she came last because she talks the most and um thank you so much for everything that you're
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:03.600]  doing i'm super stoked to um have gotten to talk with you today and thank you yeah give the give
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.360]  the screeners your contact information and and we'll talk to you further about that thank you
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:12.800]  so much for giving us that information and of course people ought to ask uh what's going on
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:17.840]  with us when we have something that there's so much evidence that it's safe and it's effective but
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:24.080]  of course nobody can make money off of it unless there's a black market because it's very easy to
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:30.080]  grow it grows like a weed as they say so the pharmaceutical companies can't patent this and
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:34.640]  charge exorbitant prices on this and when you look at something like hemp you understand that
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:42.800]  hemp doesn't have thc in it doesn't have any uh psychoactive properties in it so why would they
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:48.080]  ban hemp well clearly it is to try to protect industry so when you start to see it there's
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:54.880]  an economic aspect to it and then you look at this how effective it is medically and then
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:16:00.000]  look at what the pharmaceutical companies are doing they want to take away our informed consent
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:06.160]  and violate the nuremberg code saying that they can inject us with whatever they deem to be necessary
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:11.440]  at any given time we should be very very concerned about this this isn't something that they're just
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.680]  doing if you want to go into school i could deal with that easily enough but that's not the way
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:19.840]  that this rolls out i could take my kids out of school as a matter of fact i never put my kids in
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:24.640]  school i always home school them my wife was a teacher we knew what that was about she and i had
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:30.160]  gone through the schools i would do anything to keep my kids out of the schools and of course
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.680]  if i've got to have a vaccine to put them in that doesn't really affect me but they're not going to
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:38.240]  leave it there they're going to come to your home they're going to come into your home they're going
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:44.640]  to force you as an adult to take these vaccines because it's in the financial interest of the
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:50.640]  pharmaceutical companies who are granted immunity from vaccines why do you think they're showing
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.200]  up why do you think vaccines are showing up for everything everything is going to be treated now
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.680]  with a quote unquote vaccine well it's because they have absolutely no product liability for it if
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:06.480]  they call it a vaccine that was set up by ronald reagan in 1986 he took away their liability and
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:10.400]  that's why you see vaccines everywhere let's go quickly to uh jason in west virginia jason
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.200]  uh yeah dave i just want to say uh thanks a lot for sitting in for alex man you guys are awesome
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:23.680]  um i also want to say that um where i am awake and i am waking others out here in west virginia
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:30.000]  to what was going on um up until two years ago i was in the trance that alex talks about sitting
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:37.920]  on the couch watching tv all day listening pro government yes alex opened my eyes and i am running
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:44.080]  around like a madman on fire for christ out here telling everybody exposing this crap that they're
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:49.840]  trying to give us vaccine for kids and it's just it just makes no sense they they need to go down
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:54.800]  they need to be exposed and this needs to come out and i think this is the work of god putting
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:18:00.240]  you guys together to get the voice out to wake america well thank you and it's and that's what
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.800]  is needed we try to give you ammunition we try to give you talking points we try to educate you
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:10.880]  about where the studies are that show that florida is harmful that show that uh that cannabis can be
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:16.880]  effective that talk about the dangers to not only our health but to our civil liberties to allow them
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:22.320]  to mandate any kind of medical uh treatment and that's one of the big issues i have with florida
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:27.520]  the fact that you would dump it into the water supply i mean we look at the dosages that are
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:35.200]  allowed the uh municipalities are doing it at uh two to four times the level that they've seen
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.960]  that they've seen in the uk just a couple of weeks ago will affect dramatically affect the thyroid and
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:44.960]  of course the epa allows it at ten times the level that will affect the thyroid but it's not just
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:50.240]  a thyroid we see that it affects people's iq children's iq especially we see that it also
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:54.400]  affects adhd that was a study that just came out a couple of days ago that we talked about in depth
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:19:00.160]  yesterday and so we have to understand that when you're even talking about these levels that's not
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.560]  the level that you're getting necessarily when you drink the water are we going to have what kind
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.000]  of dosage are we going to have for adults versus a young child you can't control for dosage if you
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.200]  dump it in the water if fluoride were safe and effective you still wouldn't want to dump it in
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.680]  the water some people are going to get too little if it's effective and necessary some people are
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:25.680]  going to get way too much one dose does not fit all with any medication so that right there
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:31.680]  should set off alarms and flags that something is wrong about this fluoridation program stay
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:36.720]  with us when we come back we're going to be talking to uh to david simpson who introduced the bill
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.640]  to take marijuana out of the legal code here in texas and then right after we're going to go back

[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:22.400]  david night your host bloomberg politics had this headline texas republican mounts pro marijuana
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:28.960]  campaign bible in hand who is this texas republican well it's david simpson we've talked to him before
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:34.640]  with his bills to try to stop the tsa from sexually molesting us especially our children
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:41.360]  especially our children unfortunately that didn't pass so he gave it a valid try twice it was shut
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:47.440]  down by the lieutenant governor before it got through the senate uh david simpson got elected
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:54.880]  to the state house in texas in 2010 defeating a seven term incumbent by running on a platform of
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:25:00.240]  defending the constitution this is from his biography on his website in his first session he was
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:05.680]  earned the taxpayer champion award from texas for fiscal responsibility freshman of the year award
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:11.680]  from young conservatives of texas he has deep roots in texas he's a seventh generation texan
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.800]  and he's been married for 28 years with seven children and two grandchildren he comes at this
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:21.760]  with a christian perspective and that's why i really wanted to have him on also the approach
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:26.800]  that he takes in the bill that he uh just put before the texas legislature is different from
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:32.480]  the approaches that we've seen in the states that have legalized it but i want him to come on and
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:38.240]  talk about his perspective because the biggest cheerleaders unfortunately for drug prohibition
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.360]  are the christians and they need to hear david simpson's perspective on this joining us now
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.800]  as david simpson texas representative thank you for joining us mr simpson well it's a delight to
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:53.600]  be with you thank you for having me well thank you and thank you for putting this thank you for
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.800]  your work i tell you what if people want to know who the heir to ron paul is it's this guy this guy
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.720]  is my hero i tell you talk to us about the about what you would do with uh with medical marijuana
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:09.360]  what's your approach what would you say to christians who want to use a the hammer of government
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:17.360]  who see everything as a nail that needs to be hit down with force well i i mean first of all i like
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:24.880]  to focus on the proper role of government and and you can just go right to roman's 13 and it talks
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:31.440]  about how god gave the civil magistrate the sword and sword is a you know an image of force that
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:39.680]  can prod it can punish uh it's it's it's duty is to punish the wrongdoer but it's interesting it's
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:47.760]  not every wrongdoing uh the the commandments that the apostle paul focuses on it in the middle of
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:55.040]  the chapter after talking about the magistrate's role are the second table of the law not murdering
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:04.080]  not stealing not the bearing false witness or even planning to do so those that's the role of the
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:11.440]  civil magistrate is to punish the wrongdoer who harms his neighbor taking away his life liberty
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:17.840]  or property and it's it doesn't touch the first table of the law that's the first thing we don't
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:25.760]  want the civil government telling us how and when to worship and who to worship that's something that
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:32.160]  must be uh we must follow as individuals according to our conscience and let captive hopefully by
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:38.640]  the word of god the other thing i'd focus on with respect to marijuana is that you know we
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:45.360]  you start with a world that god created good including all its plants and some people misinterpreted
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:54.000]  my statement about that but i you have to start there um certainly good things that god made
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:01.360]  can be abused but in first Timothy 4 4 it says that everything is to be received if it can be
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:09.840]  done so with thanksgiving and that would assume faith and so what led me to repeal uh all the
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:15.760]  prohibitions for punishing people for possessing or cultivating or selling most marijuana is it
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:22.400]  didn't it we shouldn't ban a plant god may we should focus on irresponsible actions that harm
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:28.800]  our neighbor if you haven't harmed your neighbor then the punishment there the government shouldn't
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:34.880]  be involved now those two our neighbors need help if they abuse something perhaps but i don't think
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:40.960]  it's a sword i think it's a loving faithful approach but those are some of the things we
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:46.560]  just don't really make things i just talked to a former prosecutor last week we talked to
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:51.440]  jim gearock with law enforcement against prohibition that's an organization of former
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:57.680]  prosecutors former police officers some of them still active but most of them are retired
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:02.480]  they don't want to see prohibition they understand how it's counterproductive they understand how
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:07.520]  it destroys our liberties it corrupts government they've seen that happen and
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:13.680]  jim gearock is that the united nations uh this week trying to get them to change their focus
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:18.000]  attacking this at the top level trying to get them to change their focus from law enforcement
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.320]  to recognizing that it's a medical issue and as christians we ought to recognize that it's a
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:26.160]  spiritual issue but we're going to come back and i want to talk to right after the break i want to
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:33.680]  talk to uh uh david simpson about how differently he would unregulate marijuana as opposed to the
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:38.160]  way they've done it out west in the states where they've passed initiatives heavily regulating it
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:43.920]  heavily taxing it creating a web of entrapment for people david simpson's bill would not do that
[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:53.840]  stay with us we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:30:02.400]  radio network sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process

[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:26.160]  valley low and oh my god we're talking to david simpson a texas representative who has just
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:31.120]  introduced some legislation that would remove marijuana from the texas legal code completely
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:36.080]  or talk to him about the implications of that i wanted to have him on especially because he
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:41.280]  addresses christian issues and as david simpson was pointing out in the last segment and as he
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:46.800]  wrote in an op-ed piece for the dallas morning news he said the bible warns about excessive
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:51.960]  drinking, eating, and sleeping, but it doesn't ban eating, drinking, and sleeping.
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:56.360]  Or the substances or conditions associated with eating, drinking, and
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:00.640]  sleeping. So you can do that excessively, but it doesn't ban those things. He said
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:03.560]  there is a place for prohibition. There is a place for prohibition that's
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:08.840]  prohibiting aggression. And he was just talking about Romans 13. Certainly as
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:12.920]  conservative Republicans, conservative Christian Republicans, the main
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:18.120]  supporters of the war on drugs need to understand they ought to instantly be
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:21.360]  revolts by this because of just what happens with private property. Look at
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:25.720]  civil asset forfeiture where you're not charged with a crime, you're not convicted
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.840]  of a crime, they charge your property with the crime, and they confiscate your
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:34.880]  property. See that's the kind of destruction of due process that happens
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:39.960]  under prohibition. And of course the mandatory minimums locking people up for
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:44.840]  nonviolent crimes for very long periods of time where there's no discretion for
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:48.200]  the fact that they were nonviolent, that this is their first offense. No, just lock
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:53.360]  them up. We have a story that's breaking today. Mr. Simpson on a father who is
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:58.480]  facing 20 years in prison for treating his daughter's cancer with cannabis oil.
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.320]  Can you speak to that? You have some constituents in your area that are
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:05.520]  struggling with health issues that they find cannabis helping them with. It's an
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:10.040]  issue of compassion. Can't we as Christians have compassion on other people?
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:15.080]  Well we should, and especially our closest neighbor that is that got
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:20.080]  temporarily entrusted to us, our children. And that's really what led them to
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:26.160]  file the bill at this time because I know from their numerous families that
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:32.400]  have sought to help their children, some have means, some that don't. The ones that
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.920]  have have tried Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, all the pharmaceuticals
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:42.880]  which have tremendous side effects without any help to their precious
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:49.040]  daughter who has 15 to 20 seizures a day. The desperation this one family went
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:54.080]  to Colorado and she went two weeks after taking the cannabis oil without any
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:36:02.040]  seizures. So they're faced with uprooting their family, taking a new job, or becoming
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:06.480]  criminals and smuggling the product here in Texas. And that shouldn't be faced
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:10.920]  with that kind of choice. As long as you're not harming your neighbor, the
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:17.080]  government shouldn't be getting in the way. Absolutely. I know of a case that goes
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:21.160]  back to California, one of the things that first woke me up, was a case of a
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:25.320]  libertarian Peter McWilliams and he was struggling with AIDS. He was on
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:28.920]  chemotherapy like cancer patients. He could not control his nausea and he was
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:32.720]  very public. He was a writer. He's very public about how helpful cannabis was for
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:37.080]  controlling that and they came after him to make him an example and the judge
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:40.200]  ordered him not to use it but he continued to use it and he talked about
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:43.480]  the fact that he was going to use it because he was not going to, you know,
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:47.680]  that was the only thing that would help him. And the judge locked him up in jail
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:53.000]  where he so that he couldn't get access to it and Mr. Simpson he choked to death
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.760]  on his own vomit in jail. That's the kind, that's the results of these kind of
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:06.280]  laws. Well, they're unnecessary. They are not compassionate and it's time that we
[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:11.320]  recognize as conservatives that we need to get the government out of health care
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:17.080]  and if there's a natural plant that God made that can be used responsibly, we
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:21.880]  ought to have access to it and you shouldn't be a criminal or a fear being
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:27.240]  a criminal for using it and that is just wrong. This is supposed to be Texas. This
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:33.120]  is supposed to be the land of the free. Yes. And we need to move and I think
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:37.640]  most people recognize that this is what we should do but they're just fearful
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:43.840]  and I think we need to move forward with it and my colleagues and hopeful that
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:48.360]  they'll recognize that as well. And we see this being pushed back, you know, this
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:51.440]  is something and this is something else that ought to speak to the
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.360]  conservative Republicans who tend to support the war on drugs. They need to
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:38:00.960]  understand that this has its roots as a UN agenda in 1961, 10 years before Nixon
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:04.280]  declared a war on drugs. They laid out the blueprint for how they were going to
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:07.720]  do this even coming up with the four different schedules and that's why the
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.480]  UN has weighed in on these states out west that have legalized recreational
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:16.680]  use of marijuana. Mr. Simpson, we have bills now that have been introduced in
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:20.240]  the Senate as well as in the House on marijuana. The Senate has just introduced
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:25.240]  a medical marijuana bill. It has Rand Paul on the Republican side and on the
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:30.720]  Democrat side we have Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand who have sponsored a
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.500]  bill on medical marijuana. People are waking up to the absurdity of drug
[02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:43.000]  prohibition especially when it comes to marijuana. I'm thankful for that and we
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.160]  need that because one of the concerns about the other bills that are other
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:54.280]  bill that's in the Texas House now for medical marijuana, it not only creates
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:39:01.720]  a bureaucracy similar to the ATF in a sense but it also creates a registry and
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:07.360]  unless we move the federal prohibition it would if you're on that registry and
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:11.560]  we have a change in policies and they start prosecuting those who use
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:17.600]  marijuana medicinally that'll be evidence of it and that's what makes the
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:22.200]  bill that I have different is that it basically just says this is the limited
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:27.840]  government personal responsibility approach to marijuana. It doesn't mean
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:32.240]  that if you do something irresponsible you're still responsible for that
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:37.760]  whether it be on the road because of marijuana or cough syrup or alcohol or
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.120]  just not sleeping enough and just staying awake for 30 hours on caffeine.
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:49.640]  You're still responsible. It wouldn't change those offenses but as far as
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:55.120]  marijuana we just need to repeal it and start with a clean slate. Absolutely and
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:01.040]  you know as I pointed out earlier in the show we had alcohol prohibition.
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:05.360]  They had to pass the Volstead Act. They had to give us the 18th
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.520]  amendment to the Constitution because the federal government doesn't have any
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:13.480]  authority to prevent anything that we use or put in our bodies. So they had to
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:16.400]  have a constitutional amendment for alcohol. They had another one to take it
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:21.360]  out. How do they how do we get to the point where no one in Washington pays
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:24.480]  any attention to the Constitution? That's what people need to start asking
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:28.280]  themselves. It's evidence that they feel that they're not bound to the
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:32.360]  Constitution that they take oath to that they say gives them their authority. But
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:36.360]  I want to go to the medical aspect of it now. Your bill does not just address the
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.840]  medical aspect of it. Tell us how before we get to that tell us how your bill
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:44.640]  would address this. You said something that it would address it essentially the
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:50.320]  same as tomatoes and jalapenos. You'd regulate it in the same way. Well we
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.480]  just you know it would be able to be taxed but just like any other
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:01.320]  agricultural product or fruit from it and they wouldn't be a sin tax. It can be
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:07.680]  used responsibly. I wouldn't want to tax it like we've done to tobacco. I just
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:13.000]  will allow people to grow it to sell it and there's cannabis that makes other
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.080]  products that have low THC. It's called hemp and that's been banned along with
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:24.040]  the higher forms of cannabis marijuana for about a hundred years. One of the
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:30.240]  most strongest fibers it produces about four times as much fiber as pine trees
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:35.840]  per acre. It could be used for rope our founding documents were printed on
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:44.600]  hemp and so as far as marijuana used medicinally it would just be allowed
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:51.080]  people to grow themselves. They could and wouldn't be have to go to big
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:57.120]  pharma and say mother may I and suffer with tremendous side effects that so
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:01.640]  many of these other drugs that are intended to help with seizures and
[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:06.000]  relieve pain. I think that's what people need to understand is that when they
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.600]  see something like hemp that doesn't have any psychoactive properties and when
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.680]  they see that band they start they need to understand that there is an economic
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:19.000]  competition aspect of this. This isn't simply about drug addiction. This is not
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.400]  reefer madness. This is one big industry that has political clout trying to shut
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:31.120]  down another industry that basically has a product that grows freely and is not
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:35.920]  owned by anybody and that's that's a large part of the of the origin of these
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:42.200]  prohibition laws against marijuana. I think that is correct and we just need
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:48.640]  to return to the basics. We always look to government be our savior. What we
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:52.000]  need to do is focus on self-government, family government, church
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:58.360]  government and just recognize this good plan that God has made and let's use it
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:03.360]  responsibly to help our neighbor to help ourselves and to make good products
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:09.280]  with it. Absolutely. I want to go to the I want to go to some of the medical
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:12.400]  issues too. I want to address this and I understand that you know it's important
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:17.080]  for people to know that your bill is not simply legalizing medical marijuana but
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:21.240]  I think it helps people to understand that it is should not first of all be a
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.920]  schedule one drug if we even if we're gonna try to maintain this unconstitutional
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:30.800]  illegal UN framework for drug prohibition, marijuana doesn't belong
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:33.720]  as a schedule one drug and of course 80% of the people who are locked up are
[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:37.760]  locked up because of marijuana under the war on drugs but of course I've got a
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:41.520]  story here and there's many of these an elderly man with terminal cancer walks
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:46.120]  out of hospice his cancer came back a second time the pharmaceuticals are not
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:50.040]  giving him any any help he started treating it with cannabis oil he walks
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:53.360]  out as I mentioned earlier we've got now a father who's trying to do the same
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:57.320]  thing for his daughter facing 20 years in prison because he tried to treat
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:01.360]  treat his daughter with cannabis oil when you were talking about the people
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.480]  in your jurisdiction the the ones who are the children who are having these
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:10.040]  uncontrolled seizures you mentioned something about one of the children had
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:14.920]  been damaged by vaccines is that correct that's right the first person I
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:20.200]  alluded to in the earlier segment comes from a wealthy family and was flown all
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:24.720]  around the country and has tried all the pharmaceuticals this other family that
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:29.160]  often refer to and they're not the only ones but they come to mind because they
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:34.280]  show the other end of the spectrum this is a 31 year old who's fed with the two
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:42.800]  and he has had epilepsy all his life and he had an identical twin brother he
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:50.920]  who had a vaccine from another lot everybody in his lot died him and he
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.120]  suffered with these seizures ever since then and his parents were lovingly
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:01.880]  taking care of them and they don't have the ability to just fly him everywhere
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:06.400]  and you know the only way they can try this cannabis oil that's been so
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:11.080]  effective for the other constituents will be to just basically don't know
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:17.160]  they'll be very extraordinary for them to take their son there so the other
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:24.920]  usefulness of it is our veteran suffering from PTSD we have 22 that we know
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:31.680]  of veterans per day committing suicide because of the difficulties of living
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.880]  with what they've gone through and this is one a natural plant that they can use
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:42.360]  to help calm them and treat some of these symptoms and that doesn't cost a lot
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:47.840]  and we shouldn't have to just resort to government approved medicine we should
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:52.120]  have the right and we have a conscience that would demand that we have the least
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:57.640]  side effects and if you compare marijuana side effects to the pharmaceutical
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:02.960]  products but they don't even compare there's very limited side effects
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:08.680]  compared I had a relative and they were tested for a glaucoma and they said
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:11.920]  well you don't have it yet but you're trending high and so I went back and I
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:17.080]  researched well what would they do if they had glaucoma and when you look at
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:21.120]  the American Ophthalmology Society's website they talk about the different
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:25.440]  medications and you look at the side effects they were horrific but they had
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:31.160]  one section there mr. Simpson about treating it with cannabis and you know
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:36.040]  what the side effects were euphoria and increased appetite those are the side
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:40.640]  effects and they said the problem with it is that we haven't run the test why
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:43.800]  don't they run the test well because nobody's going to make any money off of
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:47.600]  running the test we haven't run the test so we don't know how much you should
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:51.640]  medicate so the biggest risk is that you may under medicate with this that was
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.000]  it you may under medicate and the symptoms are euphoria and increased
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:00.720]  appetite but I want to go back to this case of this child who's suffering from
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:05.560]  seizures because we just had a report that came out of Charlotte the news
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:11.440]  media picked that up of a of a child who has been compensated by the federal
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:15.960]  vaccine court and her case was very much like the one that you were talking
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:19.920]  about this is a child who is damaged by vaccines at three months and she went
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:24.360]  before because pharmaceutical companies have no liability for vaccines that was
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:27.040]  removed from them and so now I don't know if you're familiar with this many
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:30.840]  people don't know about the vaccine court the fact that we have a federal
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:35.160]  vaccine court because you can't sue for damages but they will give you some
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:39.680]  benefits for this she got $2 million and a quarter of a million dollars a year
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:44.560]  for life and of course none of that gives her any compensation for pain and
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:48.440]  suffering that is just for her health care she could be medicated probably
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:52.560]  perhaps I don't know sounds like a similar situation but it certainly would
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:56.440]  be worth a try to medicaid her on medical marijuana maybe you wouldn't
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:58.800]  cost a quarter of a million dollars a year
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:03.040]  well that's right and they want to do that they want to try that they actually
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:08.640]  could have pursued that remedy and the mother of the son did share with me that
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:17.400]  they just chose not to pursue that and anyways just unfortunate and a tragedy
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:22.160]  that government is standing in the way of loving caring parents taking care of
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.960]  their children that are can bang their head on a desk or the floor a wall at
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:35.280]  any time and we need to really be consistent in our conservative principles
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:40.120]  and we don't need not only the Affordable Care Act which is not
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:47.760]  affordable we just need to be left alone unless we're not harming our
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:51.400]  neighbors be able to use the plant like this for good to help our neighbors and
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:54.920]  ourselves absolutely you talk about the affordable health care act where they
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:58.760]  mandated insurance to help the insurance companies they're going to be mandating
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:02.440]  vaccines we see bills throughout the country between nine different states I
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:06.520]  know we have it here in Texas so really quickly before we have to let you go
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:10.840]  what's your response to the bills in Texas that would come after the people
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.920]  who were concerned about vaccines essentially removing our ability to have
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:22.000]  informed consent well I oppose those and there is a great movement towards that
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:26.720]  we need to have the option the conscientious objection or just we don't
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.200]  want to do it and the people's you know say well that's gonna harm the rest of
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:36.840]  the population well I said well it may harm someone who doesn't take it but
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:40.720]  housing if yours is so effective it shouldn't affect you so why not let us
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:45.800]  opt out absolutely the government shouldn't be telling us what to put in
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:52.840]  our bodies especially our children I oppose the mandated vaccines and the
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:57.560]  list created problem yes yes tracking people again like you're talking about
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:01.440]  possibly tracking people with this other bill that would legalize medical
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.080]  marijuana setting up a registry to track people that is something we should all
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:09.000]  be very concerned about and of course mr. Simpson when we look at these bills
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.600]  that would take away our informed consent that was one of the cornerstones
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:16.120]  that came out of the Nuremberg trials that was the Nuremberg code saying the
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:21.120]  way you stop these kind of abuses that we saw under the Nazis is to make informed
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:25.160]  consent paramount and yet that's precisely what they want to take away from
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:28.360]  us now and I find it amazing that the people who want to take away our
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:34.640]  informed consent are many people from the left who are pro-abortion and say that
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:38.840]  they support abortion because of its privacy I hear the music I'm sorry we're
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:42.800]  out of time thank you so much for joining us what can people do to help well
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:48.080]  they can pray for me and for the cause I use their freedom responsibly and
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:53.240]  contact their representative senator and the leadership of the state in favor of
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:59.120]  House bill 2165 2165 thank you so much David Simpson and as David Simpson

[02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:42.760]  heart attack and stroke one day I heard an ad for heart and body extract and I
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:48.160]  was skeptical but I decided to give it a try man the numbers don't lie learn the

[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:13.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we were just talking in the
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:16.960]  last segment to David Simpson Texas representative who was introduced to
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:23.520]  Bill that would not bring a massive regulation and taxation to marijuana it
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:28.040]  would decriminalize marijuana in all respects he would treat it for what it
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:33.160]  is a very effective plant that God has given us and I think he has taken this
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:37.840]  appeal he said he normally doesn't talk about his faith but in this particular
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:41.760]  instance because so many people who support the war on drugs and of course
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:46.160]  marijuana is 80% of that the people who support the war on drugs are typically
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.440]  conservative Christians and so he wanted to speak to them in a way and I
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:55.520]  hope that even if you're not a Christian that you understand a way that you can
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:58.640]  talk to Christians talk to them about compassion talk to them about the fact
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:03.920]  that government is simply force it is a hammer and it sees everything as a nail
[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:08.680]  and this is not a problem that can be fixed by force this has corrupted our
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:13.120]  government it has destroyed our due process and it is withholding from people
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:16.840]  medicine that is very effective and we need to stop it we need a roll

[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:08.800]  I just can't stand how you know these people who believe that they're Christians
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:12.520]  and they take the Bible seriously but they missed the very first page of the
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:17.480]  Bible in Genesis where it says God gives us all seed-bearing fruits and herbs for
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:22.120]  man to use yes yes that's it that's one of the points that David Simpson made
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:26.640]  in his editorial that went into the Dallas Morning News yes good point and

[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:44.120]  what does he think about people who clamor for nonviolent persons to be
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:50.840]  locked up in a box locked up in prison simply trying to treat their child who

[02:59:55.280 --> 03:00:15.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're taking your calls on medical marijuana let's go to
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:22.000]  Lauren in Ohio thank you for holding Lauren go ahead hey David how you doing doing good good
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.880]  I've got a couple of points but I just want to let you know I was a drug rep and
[03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:28.920]  I sold for the sister company of Roxanne Labs which makes Marinal so again here
[03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:35.120]  are men trying to copy what God already made but the first point the gentleman
[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:39.240]  that was on was exactly right about the decriminalization of
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:43.960]  marijuana not legalizing it it's like decriminalizing a tomato God made the
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:48.280]  men he made him with cannabinoid receptors CD1 and CB2 God made the plant
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:53.520]  for our youth God gave free will and 10 commandments to all men he didn't make
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:57.760]  one man superior to another man and that one man could lawfully make decisions
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:01.600]  for another man so to attempt to rule another man is to make him your slave
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:05.640]  that's not okay first thing federal government through the health and human
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:10.560]  services holds a patent on cannabis right now the title of the patent is
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:17.400]  cannabinoids as anti-acted act accidents and neuroprotectants so they know it's
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:21.240]  good for any accident and they know it's good for neuroprotectants they hold the
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:26.200]  patent they just don't want you to be able to access that plant the plant that
[03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:30.440]  could be used for food clothing shelter fuel nutrition if you you'd have perfect
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:35.120]  health relaxation with no murder no suicide and they know it so again
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:39.040]  they're keeping us away from what works to give us what doesn't work that
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:44.360]  gentleman was from Texas and Al Addis had you remember Al Addis Alex
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:49.000]  interviewed him he was the guy in the utopia silver case that case was thrown
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:53.640]  out of Texas court because is Al read through the statute he realized they
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:58.640]  were charging him and they were applying a statute that applied to man or other
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:03.400]  animals he made the case to the judge he wasn't a beast man he was a child of a
[03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:08.160]  living god and superior any rules created by men so they threw the case out
[03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:12.320]  so it really does matter Alex is getting into this the other day the war
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:15.960]  between state and God people need to remember God made the men the men made
[03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:19.800]  a club the club made rules codes regulations and statutes to limit the
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:24.000]  maids and the butlers of the club not to rule us as the free kings of this
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:28.200]  nation and then finally the solution it's the same solution for marijuana as
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:33.160]  it is for the vaccines they're using parents Patriot which is that's what
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:39.120]  they're using for the federal adult the national adult immunization plan
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:43.040]  they're saying if you're not smart enough to figure out how we're doing this to
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:46.720]  you we're going to keep doing it if you look at the back of the u.s. passport
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:51.000]  application actually it's the front second paragraph who gets the u.s.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:56.480]  passport two types of citizens a u.s. citizen and a non-citizen national that
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:03.200]  non-citizen national is not a corporate u.s. slave that's the free king and he
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:07.840]  does he is not under the rules codes regulations and statutes of the
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:12.400]  corporation the little C and I know you guys talk about this but it makes a
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:16.360]  difference there and it's right on the passport application so I hope people
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:20.000]  will really take this into account and understand that the first commandment is
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.280]  have no other gods before me you can make all the excuses you want for why
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:27.280]  you're not obeying God and why you're obeying men because I'm scared because
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:31.360]  they'll put me in jail because whatever but in the end you have to answer for it
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:36.120]  so the right to be free is yours do a little investigation I would love to
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:39.800]  talk to you if I could leave my number and give you the hard evidence for what
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:43.840]  I'm telling you I've tried to get a hold yes go ahead and give your
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:47.600]  information excellent call excellent points and as you point out they have a
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:52.120]  patent on marijuana they know that it is effective but of course the war on
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:56.160]  drugs serves the interest of government it serves the interest of the globalist
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:01.640]  UN that's why they operate both sides of it we're growing the heroin at record
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:05.400]  number record amounts in Afghanistan record crops that the American
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:09.040]  government is overseeing and of course we all know about the crack cocaine that
[03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:13.440]  was being brought into the United States to support their illegal operations
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:18.240]  it's a very effective program for them they're running both sides of it really
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:23.920]  quickly we don't have but just about 20 seconds let's go to Damien in Canada Damien
