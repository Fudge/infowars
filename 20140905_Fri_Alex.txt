[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:34.280]  Texas Alex Jones yesterday evening one mile from the center of downtown El Paso
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.720]  Texas our reporter Joe Biggs dressed up as a ISIS terrorist with an ISIS flag a
[00:40.720 --> 00:49.240]  sword and a severed head crossed near a park full of people into the United
[00:49.240 --> 00:54.680]  States now the reason we're doing this is to show the war on terror is a hoax
[00:54.680 --> 00:58.920]  and a fraud our borders are wide open criminal elements of our government are
[00:58.920 --> 01:05.320]  openly funding and supporting ISIS IS al Qaeda and Iraq and this is being done
[01:05.320 --> 01:09.480]  to show that if there are terror attacks in this country the government let it
[01:09.480 --> 01:17.560]  happen while letting illegal aliens fly without IDs while harassing citizens
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.800]  and using the terror attacks of 9-11 as we approach the 13th anniversary to take
[01:23.800 --> 01:28.320]  our basic freedoms this report is extremely powerful you can see the
[01:28.320 --> 01:45.640]  video at info wars.com here it is for the radio audience
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.600]  the feds have issued a terror alert and believe an attack by the terrorist group
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.440]  ISIS is imminent on or before September 11 the 13th anniversary of the worst
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.320]  attack on American soil info wars investigates just miles from the
[02:06.320 --> 02:11.440]  center of El Paso Texas where we were able to cross the river from Mexico into
[02:11.440 --> 02:16.360]  America thousands of other than Mexicans cross our borders from over 75
[02:16.360 --> 02:21.080]  different countries info wars has shown you time and time again that our
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.320]  borders are intentionally left unsecured and now these ISIS psychopaths are
[02:26.320 --> 02:31.800]  ready to strike it targets on American soil we know our government has created
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.600]  and funded ISIS so whether or not this is a real threat or a false flag the
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.520]  globalists are now one step closer to their end game stripping us of all our
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.560]  liberties so we dressed up like an ISIS jihadi to be as obvious as possible to
[02:46.560 --> 02:52.920]  show and to illustrate just how wide open the border really is
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.400]  I'll narrate for radio listeners Joe Biggs dressed up like some have been
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.480]  lying basically like James O'Keeffe did chops off a head simulated and with the
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.560]  bloody head the ISIS official flag we recreated in our art department in a
[03:12.560 --> 03:19.360]  jihadi outfit and head turbine walks right out of Juarez Mexico across the
[03:19.360 --> 03:26.440]  one foot deep Rio Grande and makes this announcement by the way the Fed say
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.120]  ISIS is operating over the border they expect an attack is imminent but that's
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.840]  true or not we're illustrating why isn't it secure there are less cops more
[03:34.840 --> 03:44.960]  patrol there but there are an Austin Texas downtown thank you Obama for
[03:44.960 --> 03:51.720]  leaving your southern borders open so ISIS can terrorize America ISIS thanks
[03:51.720 --> 03:59.640]  you President Obama we claim this land for surreal law if ISIS can enter
[03:59.640 --> 04:05.720]  America then anyone can so why are they setting up internal checkpoints and
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.680]  airports and highways and turning schools into prisons but not securing the
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.280]  border where thousands of other than Mexican or Latin Americans pour across
[04:14.280 --> 04:18.260]  from the Middle East and other areas and we're not here demonizing Arabs or
[04:18.260 --> 04:21.880]  Muslims we're pointing out the globalists have funded the most radical
[04:21.880 --> 04:29.600]  vicious sectarian murderous cannibals who sexually mutilate children who
[04:29.600 --> 04:33.960]  cut children's heads off who are doing all these horrible things they're being
[04:33.960 --> 04:40.240]  turned loose 11 aircraft are missing in Libya you can just feel they're getting
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.080]  ready to stage something big so we're here documenting it's wide open they let
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.160]  it happen bare minimum so hopefully we shame the government into protecting
[04:48.160 --> 04:53.000]  our southern border that's the goal we got three big guests including a top

[09:56.120 --> 09:59.360]  show about a month ago he's gonna be joining us in the day to analyze the
[09:59.360 --> 10:05.720]  latest information wow let's go over the headlines here first NATO approves
[10:05.720 --> 10:14.960]  troops on Russian border both sides and conflict degree to cease fire former U.S.
[10:14.960 --> 10:19.520]  ambassador to the Soviet Union the U.S. and NATO are provoking the Ukrainian
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.000]  crisis that's the former U.S. ambassador to Russia that's what basically
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  everybody that was formerly an ambassador or worked to basically bring down
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  the Soviet Union is saying this is really dangerous and circling Russia and
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.520]  arming Ukraine or what's provoking the bear Jack Metlock U.S. ambassador to the
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.800]  Soviet Union from 87 to 91 says the U.S. and NATO are to blame for the Ukraine
[10:45.800 --> 10:54.720]  crisis yeah I just tell it like I see it I've never been for any of these wars
[10:54.720 --> 11:00.840]  against Serbia against Iraq I was against attacking Libya to put Al Qaeda
[11:00.840 --> 11:04.880]  in charge who's now basically taken the whole country three years later I am
[11:04.880 --> 11:10.200]  now supporting Senator Rand Paul and his call for Obama to really bomb Isis
[11:10.200 --> 11:15.000]  because if they don't it will engulf the entire Middle East and triple gas prices
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.880]  which is part of the globalist plan is to create such a worldwide crisis that
[11:20.880 --> 11:25.320]  then they'll bait and switch and go attack Syria Egypt Iran you name it and
[11:25.320 --> 11:29.280]  start World War three and then Isis and Saudi Arabia will laugh all the way to
[11:29.280 --> 11:35.280]  the bank remember Saudi Arabia supposedly attacked us on 9-11 so we
[11:35.280 --> 11:40.000]  attacked Iraq now our government for four years has been funding Al Qaeda to
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.840]  attack Syria Libya and other areas and so now the answer is bomb Assad again
[11:46.840 --> 11:57.000]  that's how dumb they think everybody is they just play stupid with everybody so
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.120]  I'm just telling like it is it's not that Russia's some angel over there it's
[12:01.120 --> 12:04.920]  that they're not offensively in our backyard Russia didn't take on our
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.080]  liberties they're not passing Obamacare they didn't open our borders they
[12:09.080 --> 12:13.160]  haven't gotten 92 million people not working now a hundred to something
[12:13.160 --> 12:18.320]  million on welfare latest numbers out of Congressional Budget Office and a bunch
[12:18.320 --> 12:25.400]  of other sources as well that's in the CNS news all of this is going on so
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.240]  NATO approves troops on Russian border former U.S. ambassador of the Soviet
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.640]  Union the U.S. and NATO are provoking the Ukraine crisis yeah that's like saying
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.680]  that fish women the ocean the West overthrew Ukraine when they didn't join
[12:39.680 --> 12:45.280]  the EU Russian general demands preemptive nuclear strike doctrine against NATO so
[12:45.280 --> 12:51.640]  what happens next zero hedge up on info wars.com that's in the Russian news now
[12:51.640 --> 12:57.480]  now that our media is saying that means they want to nuke us no six years ago in
[12:57.480 --> 13:02.920]  2008 NATO changed the doctrine and the United States changed the doctrine and
[13:02.920 --> 13:09.560]  said they may preemptively nuke Russia first that broke MAD that have been
[13:09.560 --> 13:16.240]  around since the mid 50s mutually assured destruction or mad where if you
[13:16.240 --> 13:22.320]  launch a nuclear attack we launch and then we didn't have a nuclear war here
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.640]  comes the neocons of the neo-libs none I've never been in the military they're
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.440]  just all a bunch of delusional crazy warmongers I mean Napoleon was the top
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.640]  general genius he attacked Russia thought he could win and lost Hitler was
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.440]  pretty smart guy overall though he was obviously mentally ill but it was a
[13:40.440 --> 13:44.680]  military he had iron cross first and second class that's the Congressional
[13:44.680 --> 13:49.340]  Medal of Honor iron cross first class was a corporal in the German military and
[13:49.340 --> 13:54.800]  had all these top generals and he lost so even generals end up miscalculating we
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.920]  got a bunch of globalists and a bunch of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan bankers
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.600]  that run the EU that want to eat up all these countries like Greece and Poland
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.320]  and Ukraine and Russia says no you can't have our oil fields on our oil
[14:06.320 --> 14:09.520]  infrastructure we built in the last hundred years it's ours you can't have
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.680]  our military base we've had for 500 years on the black sea and so they've
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.240]  just sent in NATO back mercenaries to attack them I mean that's what's going
[14:17.240 --> 14:24.480]  on here it's crazy
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.320]  Russian general demands preemptive nuclear strike doctrine against NATO so
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.160]  they're saying okay six years ago you change your doctrine saying you can
[14:35.160 --> 14:38.880]  nuke us first we're what the doctrine changed and change our war plan to nuke
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.920]  you first and as the former top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George
[14:43.920 --> 14:49.040]  Bush said here just last week that means some kind of missile gets launched or
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.040]  they get a blip that's wrong they will have a doctrine with the generals to go
[14:53.040 --> 15:00.560]  ahead and pull the trigger and launch a full-out nuclear war and where are your
[15:00.560 --> 15:08.800]  glitter bug preachers teaching faith-based initiative state-run media clergy response
[15:08.800 --> 15:15.760]  team state-run biblical doctrine unbiblical doctrine where all you

[15:40.440 --> 15:43.540]  aren't protesting all the tyranny and corruption you just go hide in your
[15:43.540 --> 15:48.280]  churches and then secretly get government walking orders marching orders
[15:48.280 --> 15:56.080]  and spew garbage at your mindless flocks you are literal devils red devils in the

[16:10.000 --> 16:14.440]  just want to say that it's obvious look at the fruits of what you do look at how
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.520]  the churches have turned this country over and instead they'll just have
[16:19.520 --> 16:23.600]  street preachers obnoxiously screaming at people downtown I was down on South
[16:23.600 --> 16:27.360]  Congress last night eating dinner and there were these super obnoxious street
[16:27.360 --> 16:30.800]  preachers just screaming at people walking out of restaurants at 8 o'clock
[16:30.800 --> 16:34.960]  at night like we were devil worshipers just totally turning everybody off I
[16:34.960 --> 16:38.440]  mean you can just see how the devil wrote this script I'm sorry let me move
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.440]  on here Russian general demands preemptive nuclear strike doctrine

[16:49.920 --> 16:56.360]  just can't believe it meanwhile ISIS to the rescue this is up on info wars.com
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.040]  a Tony cartelucci article from land destroyer amid NATO's failures in
[17:00.040 --> 17:04.640]  Ukraine America's terrorist mercenaries threatened war with Russia I would say
[17:04.640 --> 17:08.240]  the globalist mercenaries but sure I mean the globals run our countries you
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.640]  can say I guess America and now they've put out press releases and
[17:12.640 --> 17:16.760]  announcements that they're gonna be attacking Russia now isn't that
[17:16.760 --> 17:25.280]  interesting. ISIS is gonna attack Russia now they're not attacking the US or
[17:25.280 --> 17:32.240]  Israel yet though they've said they will hit America when they're done and it had
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.280]  ISIS flags posted outside the White House and at public events and clearly
[17:37.280 --> 17:45.040]  folks there are ISIS sympathizers in this country Shia Islam is 80% and a good
[17:45.040 --> 17:50.560]  15% of that so we're talking around 10% of total Islam is Wahhabist absolute
[17:50.560 --> 17:56.440]  demon preachers who are murdering Muslims everywhere that dare let their
[17:56.440 --> 18:00.880]  girls go to school or don't make them wear bags over their heads or don't make
[18:00.880 --> 18:05.200]  them you know be sexually mutilated and this is Saudi Arabia's group taking
[18:05.200 --> 18:16.280]  over the world and now they've announced they're gonna attack Russia you can go
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.520]  read the quotes so there you go I mean look at who we're aligned with on every
[18:20.520 --> 18:28.800]  front ISIS attacking Syria ISIS attacking Russia truly disgusting and

[24:16.240 --> 24:21.440]  news coming up in the next segment I want to be very clear concerning the
[24:21.440 --> 24:27.440]  stunt we've pulled down on the Texas Mexico border in the most populous city
[24:27.440 --> 24:33.040]  on the border El Paso in between war as in Mexico is being done to draw
[24:33.040 --> 24:39.360]  attention to the fact the border is wide open and last Friday Homeland Security
[24:39.360 --> 24:43.320]  issued what they said is the most credible threat since 9-11 of an
[24:43.320 --> 24:52.040]  imminent ISIS terror attack on the Texas border targeting El Paso on or
[24:52.040 --> 24:59.000]  before 9-11 now six days away now that's newsworthy to go cover and we're
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.480]  there getting people to pay attention by showing that someone even dressed up
[25:03.480 --> 25:08.920]  like an ISIS jihadi with a severed head and a three-foot sword can walk right
[25:08.920 --> 25:13.600]  across in the United States while 11 passenger jets have been seized by
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.240]  al-Qaeda that's that's what they're called is is al-Qaeda our government
[25:18.240 --> 25:22.040]  got embarrassed funding them and creating them and pushing them and so they
[25:22.040 --> 25:27.400]  changed the name to is they're now attacking Russia as well and so Joe
[25:27.400 --> 25:32.280]  Biggs and Josh Owens went down there Josh put this piece together last night
[25:32.280 --> 25:35.840]  they both did a great job to bring attention or open border so that there
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.400]  is an attack the government gets the blame Obama gets the blame whether it's
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.800]  false flag or real or they let it happen the point is we're drawing
[25:43.800 --> 25:49.040]  attention to this here is the report see the video at info wars comm police
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.840]  and that on Facebook Twitter get it to your friends and family if the mainstream
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.360]  media picks this up alternative media picks this up it could really draw some
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.840]  attention to what's happening and stop a false flag or real attack here it is and
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.920]  again Texas Sheriff's of ISIS cells are operating and war has Mexico and he's
[26:05.920 --> 26:12.080]  ready for him you got that real briefing that's confirmed understand that's that's
[26:12.080 --> 26:21.960]  big to know what is that in BC the feds have issued a terror alert and believe
[26:21.960 --> 26:27.560]  an attack by the terrorist group ISIS is imminent on or before September 11 the
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.960]  13th anniversary of the worst attack on American soil info wars investigates
[26:32.960 --> 26:37.680]  just miles from the center of El Paso Texas where we were able to cross the
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.560]  river from Mexico into America thousands of other than Mexicans cross our
[26:42.560 --> 26:48.280]  borders from over 75 different countries info wars is showing you time and time
[26:48.280 --> 26:52.360]  again that our borders are intentionally left unsecured and now
[26:52.360 --> 26:58.180]  these ISIS psychopaths are ready to strike it targets on American soil we
[26:58.180 --> 27:02.440]  know our government has created and funded ISIS so whether or not this is a
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.120]  real threat or a false flag the globalists are now one step closer to
[27:07.120 --> 27:11.920]  their endgame stripping us of all our liberties so we dress up like an ISIS
[27:11.920 --> 27:17.000]  jihadi to be as obvious as possible to show and to illustrate just how wide
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.960]  open the border really is all right narrating the video we show the Rio
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.920]  Grande near a city park in El Paso or as right across the border Joe Big
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.760]  simulates murdering someone chopping their head off the three-foot sword you
[27:35.760 --> 27:41.560]  lift the ISIS flag in the severed head loiter's and then begins walking across
[27:41.560 --> 27:47.440]  the Rio Grande that's only about a foot deep at that point right into the
[27:47.440 --> 27:52.160]  United States in all day there are people milling back and forth there on
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.760]  that area of the border we have video of the border sign right there the
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.720]  Mexican flag flies right across the water there it's a landmark right there
[28:02.720 --> 28:09.080]  by the border crossing we're patrolling a mile away or less and no one stops
[28:09.080 --> 28:16.600]  him thank you Obama for leaving your southern borders open so ISIS can
[28:16.600 --> 28:23.680]  terrorize America ISIS thanks you President Obama we claim this land for
[28:23.680 --> 28:30.880]  surreal law if ISIS can enter the United States then anyone can so why are
[28:30.880 --> 28:35.280]  their checkpoints on the highlands why are their checkpoints checking babies
[28:35.280 --> 28:40.960]  diapers of the TSA while the legals are allowed to fly without having ID because
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.360]  my friends it's all a giant hoax whether they're real ISIS attacks or the
[28:45.360 --> 28:50.360]  globalist agent attack it'll all be used to take all of our freedoms in this
[28:50.360 --> 28:55.360]  country and grow the military-industrial complex takeover domestically which

[37:58.000 --> 38:06.920]  attack is imminent. Meanwhile Minneapolis city council demands
[38:06.920 --> 38:11.360]  answers on black helicopter military drills close quote I thought the black
[38:11.360 --> 38:17.600]  helicopters didn't exist. It's all part of a desensitization program for martial
[38:17.600 --> 38:25.080]  law that's declassified. When can the FBI's use national security letters to
[38:25.080 --> 38:29.280]  go out for journalists that's classified that's from the freedom of the press
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.880]  foundation the targeting of the press. Soros signals Argentina's shale is
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.440]  biggest place to be Soros double the stake and stayed owned oil company in
[38:39.440 --> 38:43.600]  Argentina while for the last seven years spending tens of millions of dollars
[38:43.600 --> 38:50.120]  the lobby to shut down shale production in the US by Wildcat small companies and
[38:50.120 --> 38:55.520]  I'm not saying shale fracking is good overall I'm not saying there aren't
[38:55.520 --> 39:00.320]  problems but most of its financed by Soros and Saudi Arabia who don't want
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.440]  us to have our own oil. So a coal plant in Mexico that's totally dirty is okay
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.240]  but a coal plant in Texas that's clean is not okay. It's not owned by General
[39:11.240 --> 39:17.000]  Electric so a cleaner fracking system say in East Texas I got a family that a
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.240]  petroleum geologist as long as it's done right there's literally no problems
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.320]  that's not okay but a dirty one in Argentina is okay because see that's how
[39:25.320 --> 39:28.160]  you make money if you're George Soros and Warren Buffett. You don't let the
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.680]  Keystone Pipeline come in and then the oil of Canada has to be shipped out to
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.840]  the West Coast and to China on record. See that's how big fortunes are made in
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.640]  the mafia system is gaming everything. Just thought I'll tell you how things
[39:41.640 --> 39:48.040]  usually work just in case everybody wanted to know. That's all George Soros and
[39:48.040 --> 39:53.720]  Warren Buffett the two work together do they just run around continually they'll
[39:53.720 --> 39:58.880]  lobby to get laws passed that you can't have arsenic at you know one part per
[39:58.880 --> 40:01.800]  billion in the water which doesn't even hurt you but then all those other
[40:01.800 --> 40:05.400]  toxins can be added just so then they have a patented system and then make
[40:05.400 --> 40:08.880]  peep and make cities buy their multi-billion dollar water cleaning thing
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.120]  to cut out the arsenic. It's just it's all a big game to them and on the other
[40:14.120 --> 40:17.680]  end of it dump fluoride with hundreds of other chemicals over the water after
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.080]  it's been purified. It's all part of sick jokes to them. I mean there's no end to
[40:22.080 --> 40:27.280]  what they do to us no end of the scams they pull they absolutely love it.
[40:29.720 --> 40:37.080]  Look at this headline. Do you receive free lunch at work? The IRS wants to tax
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.200]  it that's right a couple times a month I end up buying the whole office food. We
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.600]  get Mexican food we get barbecue we get vegetarian stuff sometimes runs the
[40:47.600 --> 40:54.520]  gamut and even though I pay taxes on that as a company and even though pay all
[40:54.520 --> 40:58.560]  these regulatory fines and fees on every level and we pay to drive it with
[40:58.560 --> 41:06.040]  the gas we use in sales tax the IRS wants to surveil everything you do there
[41:06.040 --> 41:11.200]  are few agencies more hated corrupt and degraded in the entire nation and that's
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.840]  not saying a lot and it's a Michael Krieger article up on info wars.com and
[41:16.840 --> 41:23.800]  it goes into how they want to tax your lunch now at work if it's given to you.
[41:23.800 --> 41:28.360]  Another article up on info wars.com from yesterday's interview in the video from
[41:28.360 --> 41:31.800]  yesterday's interview with rapid port is posted there very important to get this
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.600]  out to people and break the blockade and dinosaur media state run media that a
[41:36.600 --> 41:44.800]  top recently retired CDC scientist who co-authored a big study says it's a
[41:44.800 --> 41:48.880]  fraud that they know vaccines are linked directly to massive increases in
[41:48.880 --> 41:54.560]  autism a triple fold in their study in boys because the blood brain barrier is
[41:54.560 --> 42:00.240]  not as strong on boys as it is on girls now that they were ordered to put out a
[42:00.240 --> 42:07.480]  fake study and we even have the 2000 document that came out in 2004 when it
[42:07.480 --> 42:10.760]  was the roundtable meeting a board meeting of the CDC with all the
[42:10.760 --> 42:16.680]  scientists this is on ABC news you look it up and they said oh my god about this
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.080]  was leaked and this actually made it mainstream news was devastating for the
[42:20.080 --> 42:25.000]  globalist and they literally were in there saying oh my gosh you know don't
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.520]  give this to your grandkids I'm gonna tell my daughter don't give it to my
[42:27.520 --> 42:34.120]  grandson millions have been harmed by this the whole government will fall if
[42:34.120 --> 42:41.560]  this is no fact I'm gonna do a report I want to have my research crew repull the
[42:41.560 --> 42:49.400]  2004 ABC news CDC new fit the exact headline of something like you guys
[42:49.400 --> 42:52.160]  probably pull it up right now let me get the exact headline I'm gonna do this
[42:52.160 --> 42:58.360]  yesterday I'm just going to my archive here my own little brain was exact
[42:58.360 --> 43:00.720]  headline
[43:01.760 --> 43:12.160]  CDC new vaccines were causing autism CDC board new vaccine autism link ordered
[43:12.160 --> 43:18.800]  cover-up and you read the transcript that was released of the meeting that the
[43:18.800 --> 43:27.600]  you know secretary was there copying down taking dictation and then you
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.720]  understand that was 10 years ago well actually 14 years ago but 10 years ago
[43:32.720 --> 43:37.560]  it came out no one's gotten in trouble they haven't stopped they've added more
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.040]  vaccines they claim are compulsory which aren't another lie another hoax other
[43:41.040 --> 43:48.400]  fraud and they're now trying to make a mandatory and now they push them on
[43:48.400 --> 43:52.120]  pregnant women the inserts still say don't give any vaccines to a pregnant
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.920]  woman but then instead of admitting they're killing everybody or maiming
[43:55.920 --> 43:59.440]  people they just go oh there's no side effects save and effective give it to
[43:59.440 --> 44:08.160]  pregnant women in fact in 2009 with the whole h1n1 hoax I remember on the news
[44:08.160 --> 44:15.800]  saying you know pregnant women ought to take two flu shots yeah cuz you need one
[44:15.800 --> 44:20.280]  of those like a hole in the head you have any idea what that does to a
[44:20.280 --> 44:24.400]  pregnant woman we've had medical doctors on the nightmares that it causes they
[44:24.400 --> 44:30.320]  know any nurse any doctor listening who graduated you know 10 15 years ago 20
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.320]  years ago and not five years ago knows yes you never give pregnant women
[44:34.320 --> 44:41.600]  shots but all the new ones go no you give extra I mean what a cult man state

[46:45.880 --> 46:50.440]  because that's a no and then I've been a minute or two they ended up thanking me
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.720]  but I'm not in people's business folks it's my business and your business that
[46:54.720 --> 47:00.520]  they don't get to hurt these kids it's normal to be informed it's normal to be
[47:00.520 --> 47:16.520]  involved in a free society I don't know how people don't have an absolute total
[47:16.520 --> 47:24.080]  drive to want to warn everybody they know about what's happening we're all
[47:24.080 --> 47:28.160]  in this together folks in society is degenerating by design every major
[47:28.160 --> 47:32.440]  defense department the British the US says total collapse is coming we've
[47:32.440 --> 47:35.280]  shown you the Ministry of Defense reports the Pentagon reports the Rand
[47:35.280 --> 47:38.960]  Corporation reports Secretary defense Hagel said the quote whole world is
[47:38.960 --> 47:46.080]  blowing up and here's the deal under agenda 21 Cloward and Piven type mindset
[47:46.080 --> 47:52.040]  that's the plan because the globalists have exempted themselves from
[47:52.040 --> 47:56.960]  everything indemnified themselves with diplomatic and corporate immunity and
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.320]  administrative law courts transferred the power to international unelected
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.960]  boards we're already in a global government right now in their own words
[48:04.960 --> 48:10.960]  and the global government is basically run by people that are archetypal Carl
[48:10.960 --> 48:22.400]  Young totem poles of evil and by that they are a hierarchical system that has
[48:22.400 --> 48:31.640]  sold out to the dark side for temporal power on terra firma on this flying rock
[48:31.640 --> 48:39.720]  that has a thin skin of life on its surface we live on a planet with flying
[48:39.720 --> 48:46.880]  fish hundreds of species of parrots an atmosphere mountains stars all around us
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.120]  and meanwhile we have evil globalists running things to the ground trying to
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.080]  shutter our consciousness shutter our perception so they can play God and
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.320]  dominates you people aren't even one one trillionth of even understanding the
[49:00.320 --> 49:04.920]  face of God if you don't want to empower humanity and if you want to butcher
[49:04.920 --> 49:13.240]  creation and engage in wild mad scientist experiments on your lustful
[49:13.240 --> 49:20.400]  power trip this came out last week there's more info this week confirming
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.800]  brain-to-brain telepathic communication achieved for first time team of us led
[49:25.800 --> 49:34.040]  how about documented for the first time oh yeah oh yeah yes science did it you
[49:34.040 --> 49:37.680]  know right team of us led researchers successfully achieve brain-to-brain
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.520]  communication between humans from India to France with brains controlling the
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.600]  instruments ladies and gentlemen it's been scientifically proven major university
[49:46.600 --> 49:53.200]  studies you look them up that you can tell when somebody's looking at you how
[49:53.200 --> 49:55.680]  many times you've been walking through the woods on your own property if you
[49:55.680 --> 49:59.080]  got property and somebody's poaching you feel I'm looking at you you walk 200
[49:59.080 --> 50:02.240]  yards of the woods and find a military stand staring right at you or how many
[50:02.240 --> 50:04.240]  times you've been sitting there in a restaurant feel somebody looking at you
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.640]  and you turn around they're looking at you and their eyes are right on you
[50:06.640 --> 50:10.920]  everybody knows that there is some type of electromagnetic whatever you want to
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.520]  call it it's been proven that birds and bats and insects don't have fly
[50:14.520 --> 50:21.960]  thousands of miles monarch butterflies off of magnetic cells in their brains
[50:21.960 --> 50:27.480]  humans have these as well that's what we navigate off of it's what again ducks
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.160]  navigate off of it has something to do with that at the science level but it's
[50:32.160 --> 50:37.440]  even deeper but I love how science so-called science acts like they've
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.880]  done it for the first time no just because you did brain-to-brain
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.000]  communication and believe you've proven it for the first time does not mean it's
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.600]  been done for the first time there are a lot of things going on and having an
[50:51.600 --> 50:57.680]  earth that aren't in your books Shakespeare wrote we all know it it's

[55:03.960 --> 55:09.000]  later explaining how the new Shea Guevara is Isis patches Isis flags is the
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.640]  new Vogue and this is a real this is the majority Islam group a subsection of
[55:16.640 --> 55:22.080]  that that is just seen as incredibly cool in many areas the Middle East and
[55:22.080 --> 55:25.200]  here in the United States and so if you want to know who's radical that's who
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.560]  they're letting Isis members fly back to the US that's mainstream news yesterday
[55:28.560 --> 55:34.200]  England quote reeducates them in a two week long course a few nights a week oh

[55:52.680 --> 55:57.120]  that's taken over in Syria in other areas this is the group Rand Paul last
[55:57.120 --> 56:01.080]  year said don't arm them and don't bomb Assad for these people now he says we
[56:01.080 --> 56:04.480]  gotta bomb Isis because they're taken over and I agree with it the problem is
[56:04.480 --> 56:08.200]  it won't be real bombing or they'll end up bombing you know Egypt or something
[56:08.200 --> 56:15.720]  Isis attacks America will probably attack Egypt I'm not kidding so here is the

[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:51.680]  how things really work our job is decompartmentalize and show everybody the
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:57.000]  overall rabbit trick more Senate Democrats urge Obama to delay immigration
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.440]  order top Democrats are in fact more top Democrats are pressing president
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:07.600]  Barack Obama to slow down immigration reform you mean totally wide open
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:11.680]  borders further diminishing the chances that he will take sweeping
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:16.000]  administrative action before election day senator Bill Nelson Democrat Florida
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.360]  wants Obama to wait until November senator Al Franken what a joke of
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:23.800]  Minnesota said he has concerns about executive action well it's totally
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:28.720]  illegal it should be because of that senator Angus King independent of Maine
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:34.480]  who caucus with Democrats said it would be a mistake they say wait until they've
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:40.800]  won the Senate election coming up the Republican leadership wants this as well

[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:50.560]  into Canadian and Mexican sovereignty and it's the poorest people coming up
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:54.440]  here getting on welfare and further bankrupting things and I don't dislike

[1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:18.440]  constitutionalist who listens to this broadcast when I was critical of Bush
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:22.280]  and the police states the Democrats for part of with the Patriot Act I said it
[1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:25.960]  would be targeted on the American people I said it would be targeted on the
[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:31.360]  libertarian movement and now they admit homeland security under Obama its main
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:37.000]  focus is domestic returning veterans gun owners you name it I've not been an
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.240]  Islamophobe I don't hate people that are Muslims I went to college in high
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:45.480]  school Muslim folks were friends nice people I was against both Iraq wars you
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:52.000]  don't have Saudi Arabia involved in 9-11 and then we attack Iraq that said
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.960]  ISIS is a real threat ISIS has been funded by NATO and Obama in Libya in
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:01.480]  Syria in Iraq that's all admitted now they've been given stinger missiles that
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:05.160]  was but Benghazi was about Colonel Schaffer's on next week we said that
[1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:08.600]  days after it happened it's now been admitted top generals have gone on Fox
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:13.800]  Tuesday said no we gave the missiles to him but they're a real terror group just
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:16.720]  because the West and criminal elements of our government are working with them
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.920]  doesn't mean they control them and they are now in war as across from El Paso
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:26.320]  inside Homeland Security memos these were not publicly put out in fake terror
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:31.320]  alerts for election time we've we've got people in the general's office at Fort

[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:43.000]  info before the system doesn't line saying there are ISIS groups forming
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.960]  inside Mexico right now and that's in the news today ABC News reports NBC News

[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:03.080]  now whether it's real or not they're getting us ready for a terror attack
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:06.960]  that will be used to take our liberties that's why we sent Joe Biggs down to the

[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:39.120]  bucket challenge that video is up on the site going viral to try to hijack that
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:42.640]  meme to point out our borders wide open this is the collapse of the country the
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:47.240]  end of our sovereignty and they've got domestic police state going on against
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:51.800]  a tea party the IRS going after the veterans groups libertarian groups
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:56.160]  conservative groups Christian groups pro-life groups so we're down there
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:59.760]  pointing out that they have no security where we need it and then meanwhile the
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:03.960]  TSA is literally checking babies diapers and putting us in naked body scanners to
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:08.080]  train us how to be prisoners to train us to be under state control to end our
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:10.880]  free society
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.960]  but I see a minority of the commenters going Alex here with the feds promote
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:19.440]  the terror threat you know there's no such thing as Islamic extremism blah
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:23.280]  blah blah no there are real Muslim terrorists out there okay that's a
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:27.880]  fact the government lets them attack funds them sometimes totally stages it
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:31.880]  to be able to take our freedoms we're pointing the whole thing out preemptively
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:35.720]  show that if there is an attack everybody knows they left the border wide
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:41.920]  open that's what we're doing and it's got the trolls hopping man I've never
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:45.200]  supported military action against Serbia or any of these countries I
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:49.560]  support Rand Paul saying we got a bomb ISIS right now because they are killing
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:53.000]  Christians and innocents everywhere they're taking over the problem is our
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.120]  government helps set them up to begin with that's why Obama won't really bomb
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:00.640]  them he'll have two or three flights sorties a day that that bomb an old
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:04.920]  truck or something because it's such a PR disaster for them they're trying to
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:09.320]  change the name from al-qaeda in Iraq to ISIS now I'm done Joel Gilbert joins
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:14.720]  us he's got there's no place like utopia the trailers up on info wars.com and
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:18.040]  we're going to show some of the trailer while he's talking and then when he
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:22.040]  leaves us will also show it I have no stake in this trailer in this film I
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.800]  intend to sell it on DVD when it comes out he's an excellent filmmaker he
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:31.760]  exposed the origins the true origins of Obama like nobody else he's an original
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:38.840]  researcher Dr. Jerome Corsi and others are in the film and it needs to get
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:42.760]  sold out in the cities it opens in so that other theaters will then pick it up
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:47.400]  so that we can expose what collectivism does that's why I have activists and
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:51.720]  filmmakers on and don't just promote ourselves I didn't sell or plug one
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:56.240]  thing last hour even though that's how we fund ourselves info or store.com
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:59.880]  prisonplot.tv memberships but I'm having somebody on I'm not saying I'm
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:04.240]  some great guy we do this because we're all in this together they're scared of
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:07.600]  these films they arrested Dinesh D'Souza because they were scared of his
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:11.560]  films they've been died in an arrested Rick Perry because they're scared of him
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:15.200]  not that he's perfect but at least he's trying to secure the border I've been a
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:19.120]  big critic of Perry the point is they're coming after everybody folks because we
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:23.960]  do have a shot there is a purge going on there is an attempt to end talk radios
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:28.480]  freedom there is an attempt to come in with internet censorship now let's go
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.080]  to Joel Gilbert joining us the filmmaker with there's no place like
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:36.520]  utopia Joel so much is going on right now tell us about where the film's
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:40.160]  opening what's going on with that but then your take on our government openly
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:45.800]  funding on ISIS the craziness that's going on I mean it's just getting so
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:50.680]  bizarre right now well unfortunately it's all quite predictable I'll tell you
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:55.080]  first there's no place like utopia we opened in Denver a month ago sold out
[1:13:55.080 --> 1:13:59.840]  everything now we're in three theaters in the Houston area anybody can please
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:04.400]  come out this weekend on Fandango you can get tickets in advance what we're
[1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:10.400]  seeing playing out is the socialist Marxist ideology that has permeated and
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:15.960]  taken over the Democrat Party over the past 20 30 years and this is covered and
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:20.080]  there's no place like utopia and most people don't realize that the Democrat
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:24.560]  Party even well-meaning liberals don't accept or understand it's been taken over
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:30.000]  by these radicals and today it is a radical socialist party now the Marxist
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.320]  and Islamists have been natural allies for the past 60 70 absolutely I have
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:39.160]  Democrats and ISIS people constantly threatening us now saying how dare you
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:42.080]  not love ISIS I mean this is crazy well let me tell you what they have in
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:47.080]  common both of them are universalist movements both Islam and Marxism believe
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:52.800]  that one day the entire world will be Marxist or Islamist Marxists believe
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.160]  that they can create a utopia here on earth paradise on earth with the leader
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:02.000]  of the socialist paradise the God on earth the only difference is that
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Islamists are a little more patient they want to create and go to paradise in the
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.960]  next world but in the meantime their allies because they both view Western
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:16.760]  capitalism Western free market system free speech as the number one obstacle
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:22.680]  to their taking power and therefore they are together in targeting free speech
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:27.000]  free markets because they know if they can defeat it it'll be their path to
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.560]  taking power well I'll say this I'm all for free speech and I'm not what they
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:34.020]  call it an Islamophobe but our government's working with the radical
[1:15:34.020 --> 1:15:38.360]  Muslims that are bullying and killing the non radical Muslims you're not
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:42.680]  allowed to criticize Islam in England you get arrested or you get banned from
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:49.480]  flying in they are now banning mainline people from England who just mildly
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:54.680]  criticized radical Islam while they let radical Islamists be on TV calling for
[1:15:54.680 --> 1:15:58.800]  blowing up government buildings show clearly the socialist government in
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:03.200]  England has totally teamed up with the Islamists it really has happened right
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:10.640]  what they've done essentially is they use Soviet era censorship to sometimes
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:14.720]  we call it political correctness but it really is getting to a level of Soviet
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:19.280]  censorship to prevent people from opposing them this is the vision of
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:23.440]  utopia on earth where everyone thinks the same looks the same lives the same
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:28.120]  essentially we're all animals in a cage and they have a police force which
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:32.280]  forces people to go to work because otherwise no one will work and they use
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:36.920]  Soviet style disinformation there's no question that all we get out of the
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:42.680]  White House is disinformation from the Soviet era and unemployment six percent
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:46.840]  anybody believe that you know unaccompanied minors coming over the
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:51.800]  border all a big lie everything coming out of the White House is a lie and what
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:56.240]  we defeated in the Soviet system unfortunately today in America it
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:16:58.600]  exists
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:08.520]  continue breaking that down well Obama took power in the classical socialist
[1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:12.600]  Marxist methodology he said that he was going to cut the deficit in half he's
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:16.560]  going to bring people together most transparent government in history he
[1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:21.560]  took power with the big lie he also lied about who he was I've chronicled that
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:25.880]  his real father of course was the Soviet agent and communist propagandist Frank
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:30.760]  Marshall Davis the man who indoctrinated him and he admits raised him into this
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:36.040]  Marxist ideology I mean he stayed with him on the summers there's photos of his
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:40.400]  mother on the couch with him I mean it's it really is looks just it is his dad it
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:44.080]  look at that he lied about the biology that's bad enough but he did so to hide
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:49.600]  the fact that he was indoctrinated by Davis into this radical Marxist anti-
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:54.120]  white ideology everything Obama has done is to hide his connection to Davis
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:59.320]  because it would reveal an agenda that is unacceptable to the American people so
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:04.960]  just like Fidel Castro said we've got castor on tape I believe in representative
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:10.400]  democracy even Adolf Hitler he became a big Democrat once these guys take power
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:16.440]  they pursue the original agenda to and then they use the tools of state like
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:22.720]  the IRS there is no IRS targeting scandal it's the White House Democrat
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:27.200]  Party targeting scandal they use the tools of state to disenfranchise and
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:31.600]  suppress any opposition to keep a permanent hold on power and notice they
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:35.480]  never get in trouble now they just get away with everything oh yeah because they
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:38.880]  got away with fast and furious they just try the next thing they get away with
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:45.320]  Benghazi they get away with the IRS targeting there's been no real force to
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:49.520]  push back and stop them there's no reason for them not to do the next outrage
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:53.800]  because there's no opposition unfortunately run into censorship with
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:56.960]  your film because usually when a film starts selling out in theaters it gets
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:01.920]  picked up more places how do we get your film everywhere well the censorship I
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:06.040]  run into is of course I've had the IRS sends me a letter about once a week for
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:09.840]  the past two years demanding something and I've just been beating them back I
[1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:13.680]  take it almost as a comedy routine I haven't paid them a dime but they're
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:18.960]  always after me of course we've been denied advertising time in Denver and
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:23.760]  in places in Houston mostly NBC affiliates won't take our money wow and
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:28.600]  that's been chronicled in Walnut Daily and you know we're just gonna keep
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:31.680]  pushing forward the way to get people out on the website there's no place like
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:37.440]  utopia.com you can hit the theaters link and if you click on the link bring

[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:21.520]  stations refusing the advertising for a documentary film when the ad I've seen
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:30.200]  the ad it's it's it's very tame now most TV stations radio stations a print
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:35.880]  especially banks won't take your business or let you operate if you have a gun
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:40.840]  shop even big sporting goods stores are having their their accounts cancelled

[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:52.280]  people is that they start economically doing this and censoring you and so a
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:58.080]  microcosm of this film the Joel Gilbert's produced there's no place like
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:05.200]  utopia comms the website shows how far down this totalitarian utopian and the
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:10.560]  hellhole we've gotten Joel Joel other points about the film and where you see
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:15.480]  the world right now Obama has like a 37% gallop one of the lowest ever for a
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:20.400]  president but still he just doesn't care he moves forward in an authoritarian way
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:24.320]  says he'll sign executive orders that have never been done on military on
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:29.800]  borders on energy he is setting the precedent that that that presidents
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:35.920]  are elected dictators well Obama is a professional agitator he was brought in
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:40.600]  Chicago by Bill Ayers father to become a community agitator the word organizer
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:45.160]  was just a nice way to put it it's to rub salt on the ones of minorities and
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.320]  then use their discontent to take power that's the written ideology that's what
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.520]  he's doing in the White House everything he's done is meant to agitate and divide
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:59.040]  the country economically and by race so they can promise people give us the power
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:04.400]  and we'll make it right for you I did experience going to in the film I went
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:08.680]  to Detroit Southside Chicago Newark all these progressive cities that have been
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:14.920]  controlled by Democrats for 50 60 years and they've got 60% unemployment drug
[1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:20.840]  culture taxation no jobs these people have been regressing all these years not
[1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:24.880]  progressing but I did find some inspiration you'll see that in the film
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:28.400]  when you talk to these people they're like they want nothing to do with this
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:32.800]  progressive agenda no amnesty for illegals no marijuana the most
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:38.440]  conservative people today in America believe it or not are black women living
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:43.600]  in these cities they're very tough they just need the Republicans to communicate
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:47.720]  to them and let them know that there's a choice well Joel did you see how in
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:51.160]  California now is going to give free marijuana to the homeless to basically
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:55.240]  suppress them again I'm for decriminalization but it doesn't mean that
[1:26:55.240 --> 1:27:01.560]  I then endorse the doper head mentality and and clearly George Soros once
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:06.440]  everybody's smoking super high-powered weed so they're all zombies and when
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:14.400]  you look how do you fix this problem well a drug culture is much easier to
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:21.040]  control and enslave the idea of I was in Colorado in Denver we went to some of
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:24.840]  these marijuana clinics and these people are smoking dope on the street
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:28.920]  driving smoking dope and they don't care about politics they don't even remember
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:32.880]  what day is election day and these people are very easy to control so
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.240]  California is running a muck with our you know governor Moonbeam from the
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:42.120]  70s he's back with more of this nonsense and it's going to take a grassroots
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:46.320]  movement in America and a Republican opposition to really draw a line in the
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:49.240]  saying I want to explain why we got to take the Republicans over here briefly
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.320]  after they implode Michigan implode California implode New York implode
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:58.320]  Florida the Democrats then move to constitutional states that are wealthy
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:02.120]  and successful like Texas and they don't change they then wreck that state
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:07.320]  I'm living under this now and so so they've got to be stopped or they will
[1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:11.840]  destroy the whole country they move like locusts from field to field I think
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:15.120]  they can be defeated if the Republicans make the argument even in the inner
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:20.480]  cities that you can choose American values free markets free speech
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:24.920]  opportunity and prosperity or you're on the progressive road to hell if they
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:27.960]  make that argument they win what do you do though about the Republican
[1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:31.560]  leadership being just as bad as the Democrats that's the big challenge right
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:36.160]  now the Democrats are so bankrupt of ideas and there's such failures and such
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:40.800]  liars that it really doesn't take much to turn it around and we don't have
[1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:45.440]  unfortunately on the other side a leader has not yet come forward who has the
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:50.880]  courage to tell the truth and tell it like it is to the American people well
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:54.760]  there's no doubt that socialism has collapsed Latin America and now it's
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:59.880]  here and I hope everyone will go see the film I can't wait till the DVDs out I
[1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:04.040]  want to sell it how long until we're gonna get a DVD relation DVD releases

[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:11.760]  to sell some out you'll even see in the film I talked to some illegals from
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:16.720]  Guatemala El Salvador we said why are you here and they said because socialism
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.800]  destroyed our country so they're here to get away from socialism they don't know
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:24.600]  what's in store for them apparently yeah well that I mean I know a lot of folks I
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:27.480]  told you from Latin America hate socialism but then to get the free
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:32.040]  goodies they'll vote for the most hardcore Democrat it's just crazy all

[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:34.920]  Bilderberg did a great job over there in Copenhagen this year so much is
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:39.480]  happening before we get into Bitcoin you're traveling the world right now
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:45.760]  give us your take on what's happening with Russia and Ukraine ISIS Obama
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:51.320]  acting as a dictator the Federal Reserve I mean just it's it's such a crazy time
[1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:56.440]  to be alive and you believe things like Bitcoin or our financial revolutions
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:01.200]  that could unseat the new world order and make it as obsolete as a buggy whip
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:07.480]  when automobiles came in thanks for joining us thanks for having me how
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:12.480]  are you good thanks for coming on well I guess a point that I'd like to make is
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:18.960]  something I recently realized is that economics and technology is very far
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:24.080]  advanced generationally more advanced than political thought so what we have
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:29.080]  is we're playing this game of it within the current systems of politics which
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:34.440]  haven't changed that much since politics existed but the way that we are
[1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:38.960]  interacting on you know the internet revolution with the information mode
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:44.880]  revolution it's really thrown us into a completely new age and we've left
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:51.000]  politics behind the thought has been left behind in some ways so this is
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:56.280]  where governments become nervous about things like Bitcoin and dark web and
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:05.640]  anonymity networks and to me this whole geopolitical cluster of violence it's
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:12.160]  hopefully the only way we can battle it is through means of transcending the
[1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:16.680]  actual framework and not participating in it and that's why I really support
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:23.360]  Bitcoin I agree with you elaborate on that so okay you always and a lot of
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.400]  people who are quite into gold they refer to Bitcoin as being fiat so it's not
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:31.080]  backed by anything right and I just want to kind of talk to talk about this
[1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:35.520]  because what's gold backed by well well gold has inherent value right that's
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:39.400]  what we say what's inherent value that's a very subjective thing right no I
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.520]  mean I get it that technically it's its encryption it's the limited amount of
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:48.440]  it it's that people choose to use it as a medium of exchange that you can
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:54.360]  claim Bitcoin is not truly fiat I'm just saying that it is competing on the fiat
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:41:01.520]  plane with the fiat systems of the globalist I don't think so at all so let
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.720]  me let me just say what why I sure sure go ahead and elaborate yeah so the best
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:11.120]  thing about Bitcoin which is an application on the blockchain so I'm
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:17.240]  just talking about the money aspect of Bitcoin right is it allows us to
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:23.480]  completely separate our financial interaction from the abusive systems of
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:28.040]  banking cartels and the state so you know we have we're supposed to have a
[1:41:28.040 --> 1:41:32.320]  separation of the church and the state and now it's actually very plausible
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:40.400]  first of the separation of money and the state now wow that means that humans
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:45.960]  for the you know humans worldwide for the first time in history have the
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:50.480]  ability to be their own bank and with anonymity applications we have the
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:56.160]  ability to be our own Swiss bank so that's I agree and now our government is
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:00.000]  actually is mega banks who want to charge us to use our own money and have
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.840]  bail ins this is the true revolution to create our own financial systems period
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:10.240]  regardless whether they be gold silver Bitcoin or local currencies state
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:16.360]  currencies the answer is diversify how we transact whether it be barter yeah
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:19.880]  competition is good because the best thing will run out and it doesn't mean
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:23.200]  it'll make everything else obsolete there's definitely always going to be a
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:27.160]  place for precious metals there's definitely going to be a place for cash
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:31.640]  because it's the only true fully anonymous system of exchange but cash can
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:35.680]  be anything cash doesn't have to be cash you could be seeds or tokens it's just
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:40.000]  the interpersonal exchange now that's what's beautiful about Bitcoin as well
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:46.720]  it's peer-to-beer it's decentralized it's again empowers us on an individual
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:51.880]  basis and another cool thing that I've been exploring lately is what what is
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:58.240]  Bitcoin Bitcoin is it's a protocol which is just language and language is
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:05.360]  speech and speech is protected under the First Amendment getting interesting
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:11.840]  right well the Supreme Court and others and federal regulators have basically
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:16.400]  from what I've seen shed both that it is money but then that it's not that it's
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:20.600]  property or there's like a collectible yeah they're trying to put it into their
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:27.360]  framework of control of this that they're trying to make laws for problems that
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:33.600]  don't exist because the state is obsessed with overreaching almost the
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:37.880]  dogmatic religious preventative action sure because they want to prevent
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:42.720]  events from occurring that how egotistical is that and we can just
[1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:46.440]  circumnavigate them with using things like Bitcoin and even if Bitcoin doesn't
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:50.360]  end up being you know one of the dominant global systems it's on the road to
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:54.240]  that thought process and the road of breaking the monopoly of the mega banks
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:44:01.160]  and the state government way out it's a way out and with anonymous applications
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:05.520]  to Bitcoin like this I'm actually staying at a squat with them you're talking
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:11.600]  one of the leaders in the dark wallet project which is a wallet that makes
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:17.160]  your transactions anonymous so the whole that you know there is some problems
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:23.800]  of transparency with the with the exchanging Bitcoin but dark wallet
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:29.360]  allows a new tool to make it much more safe to exchange Bitcoin between people
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:36.920]  so and actually the G7 released the document listing dark wallet as one of
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:41.760]  the number one concerns for money laundering so the government you know
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:47.120]  is very worried they're very worried about these new systems and applications
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:52.920]  that they can't even comprehend because like I said economics and technology is
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:56.960]  superseding political thought and political structure and an exponential
[1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:03.480]  basis now expanding on Bitcoin I know it's hard for you to believe because
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:06.680]  you're informed on it but we have a lot of AM and FM affiliates and millions of
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:11.160]  listeners out there who might have heard the name Bitcoin but it's very alien to
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:15.760]  them or Greek why don't you spend a few minutes about its basic history and what
[1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:19.480]  it is for people that don't know and where you believe it's going and some of
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:23.480]  the history of the attempts to suppress it or control it and where Bitcoin is
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:29.480]  right now sure so I like to make the comparison that Bitcoin is almost like
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:36.560]  an online online gold it's deflationary it's in my opinion non fiat it's limited
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:43.160]  and it's mind which is kind of a funny thing right it's so very similar to gold
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:50.360]  and its history you know the the creator of Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto and
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:57.480]  nobody knows who he or she or they are and this was a very very smart move
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:02.600]  because what I'm just gonna say he by default what Satoshi did was stay
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:06.800]  anonymous and he did it because he knew he was breaking the law by even creating
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:10.800]  a competing currency to the American government right that's illegal and
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:16.720]  also I think it was very clever because if he did a pronounce himself he would
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:21.440]  be very famous but instead he's infamous in history and only a few people
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:26.080]  have had interaction with him and one of these people recently died Mr. Finney
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:34.120]  and interestingly enough Satoshi was libertarian this I mean this is assumed
[1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:39.640]  but there are certain things that he did that give away what I think to be as a
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:47.000]  fact so one of the things is in the first in the Genesis block which is the first
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:56.520]  hashed in the block chain Satoshi put in can you still hear me yes I'm
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:00.560]  right here okay good good good my screen just went dark I know it's so rare for me
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:08.240]  to shut up but I'm listening I know but so what he did is in the in the in the
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:14.720]  Genesis block he included in the code the headline of when the banks in
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:19.840]  England had their second bailout interesting right so that's almost he's
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:25.880]  criticizing the current banking system by including that into the very spirit
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:30.880]  of Bitcoin so to people when people say it's not political Bitcoin is
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.880]  incredibly political and it's naive and silly to say that and people who say
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:40.240]  that Bitcoin isn't political they're being intellectually dishonest and the
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.280]  mere fact that they say Bitcoin isn't political is a political statement
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:51.000]  because they want to keep it neutral but it's not so anyways went off there
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.840]  because this is a big debate in the community but I guess it's it's biggest
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:01.240]  claim to fame some of the biggest things to fame and when it became acknowledged
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.480]  by the mainstream is when it's you know Silk Road I first heard about it on Silk
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:10.640]  Road I went on this I threw the tour network I accessed this dark trading
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:15.400]  place of drugs etc just because I was curious and I saw Bitcoin and God I
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:20.200]  wish I bought some but I didn't then so you're already seeing this undermining
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:26.200]  of law and law that kills people because right now we're prosecuting Ross
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:30.520]  Obrick whose mother was on your show and she's a good friend of mine shout out
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:36.800]  to Lynch you're wonderful keep up the good fight what we should be revering
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:41.040]  this man we should be and Ross Obrick may not be Dred Pirate Roberts but
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:44.440]  whoever he was whoever starts Silk Road we should be thanking him for saving
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:50.640]  lives because when you make exchange peer-to-peer especially in a very violent
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:55.600]  market like the drug market you take away the third violent party so all that
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.640]  happens is voluntary people are exchanging goods and value without
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:07.560]  somebody with a gun or without you know banks laundering money for all this
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:14.480]  he that is he's a freaking hero another thing that Bitcoin got famous for is
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:20.400]  when WikiLeaks was censored by PayPal and Visa and Mastercard and all of those
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:26.280]  fantastic payment systems so that they couldn't take donations Bitcoin stepped
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:32.480]  up and WikiLeaks was able to continue to have funding and exist providing a very
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:39.000]  very important service for globally I would say and even your store Alex
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:42.800]  imagine if you know I'm sure the government's not a big fan of yours
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:47.840]  imagine if they crack down on you and they deny a payment gateways like PayPal
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:50.760]  and the credit card oh they've already they've already tried it before and I've
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:55.080]  had to threaten to sue people sue people I've been denied to sell Obama deception
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:59.280]  on on Google shopping cart and we're just constantly censored it's just what
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.720]  they do because because you know we're I mean but but ISIS is allowed to use
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:07.800]  Twitter and Facebook but we get censored right but now you don't have to worry
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.160]  about it because if they ever succeed in that who cares because you can accept
[1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:14.560]  payment through Bitcoin like who cares this is what I'm talking about no that's
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:18.360]  why we now accept Bitcoin the last three weeks or whatever at info or store
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:23.720]  com because we understand that yes so this is about like the fight we the age
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:28.280]  of barricades physical barricades is dead we're not gonna be fighting in the
[1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:33.840]  streets you know it's just not gonna happen it's not efficient it's violence
[1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:38.880]  and it just does on work look at history doesn't usually revolutions physical
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:43.080]  revolutions don't turn out to provide us with there are alternatives to physical
[1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:47.480]  revolutions and we would rather we would rather keep it nonviolent we will
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:51.700]  defend ourselves and have the moral high ground of being defensive but we
[1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:56.200]  should aggressively pull out of the system farmers markets shop local

[1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:41.000]  Fox News Philadelphia reports F-15s escorted plane with unresponsive pilot
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.920]  officials say two US fighter jets are escorting unresponsive small aircraft
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.240]  over the Atlantic Ocean Defense officials say the US Northern Command
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:55.600]  tweeted at 1246 p.m. today that the unresponsive aircraft took off this
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:59.320]  morning from Rochester New York with a flight pan to Naples Florida
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:05.120]  officials from NORAD said they suspect hypoxia or no oxygen or deprivation of
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:11.480]  oxygen may be the possible cause it's a TMB 700 like business and utility
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:15.560]  aircraft so it's not one of the 11 missing planes over in the Middle East
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:22.160]  that ISIS grabbed thanks to NATO putting them in charge of Libya also NASA's as
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:25.880]  an asteroid will pass very close to Earth on Sunday well it's government's
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:29.920]  job to keep it safe so they some TSA agents out there to grope the asteroid
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:35.120]  NASA announced that a small asteroid will safely pass very close to Earth on
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:40.680]  September 7th why are they calling it small at 60 feet in size but actually
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:48.080]  hit the earth it would blow up all city but interesting on that front okay let's
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:55.800]  go back to our guest Julia with brave of the world.com a Bitcoin activist who
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:59.880]  does a lot of interesting pro-second amendment reports you name it and she's
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:05.520]  getting into you know really a revolution against tyranny by simply
[1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:09.920]  going around it with our choices 20 years ago you couldn't find organic food
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:14.040]  on store shelves now it's the planting all the GMO and they're taking corn
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:18.760]  syrup out of everything so and oh corn syrup safe eat it eat it GMO safe okay
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:23.880]  well we we're not gonna eat it and see now we're destroying them that way this
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:28.880]  is the answer I agree with her other points that are important to make well
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:34.680]  I with Bitcoin and the technology behind Bitcoin I think the term I wouldn't use
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:39.840]  revolution because to me revolution means that you're you're trying to change
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:44.200]  I agree it's transcending it's simply circumnavigating it's transcending the
[1:56:44.200 --> 1:56:49.520]  system it's leaving the system far behind in the dust while we're up here and to
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:52.400]  the point of where we just don't really care what the state does because it
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:56.520]  becomes obsolete and irrelevant that's where I want to take it but I forgot to
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:00.000]  mention a fun point for your viewers because I know a lot of people are
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:05.160]  varying to gold that listen to you regarding Satoshi the creator of Bitcoin
[1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:13.000]  his symbolic birthday is actually the day that Roosevelt passed the executive
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:18.520]  order 6102 which forbade the hoarding of gold so I think maybe Satoshi is giving
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:24.480]  you know the gold bug is a shout out and the importance of having a gold backed
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:30.840]  system well I think it's good to have a diverse system and I haven't sold any
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:35.280]  of the gold or silver I bought 15 16 years ago as it went up or as it went
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:39.840]  down it's a it's a backup but again diversification is the answer and I
[1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:44.760]  know the elites themselves are investing heavily in new cryptocurrencies and
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:54.600]  things decentralized and disengage that's right do you think bitcoins gonna end up
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:58.760]  supplanting the Federal Reserve system like that Federal Reserve whistleblower
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:06.120]  said again I just think it's gonna be a relevant I and you know if it's
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:09.920]  interesting people people say all Bitcoin is an anonymous it transparent or
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:13.560]  blah blah but that has its own application so imagine if politicians
[1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:18.960]  started to use Bitcoin and governments and banks to use Bitcoin interesting you
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:23.840]  know everything's recorded on a public ledger so it's the transparency is there
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:29.360]  so it would we could see what the like the politician would give us an address
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:33.600]  to send our donations to and we would see exactly what those nations are going
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:37.160]  to well I want to hear how you think the feds or the globalists might stride back
[1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:42.040]  against Bitcoin stay with us coming up five more minutes with our guests

[1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:29.600]  upon info wars.com the ISIS bucket Obama challenge and we have another video
[2:00:29.600 --> 2:00:34.960]  man dressed as ISIS jihadi crosses borders simulates the heading in a major
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:41.240]  city just to illustrate of the borders wide open but then they've got the TSA
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:45.000]  groping everybody the war on terror is a hoax and a fraud this has meant to
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:50.440]  expose the hoax not bolster it I'm like the progenitor of exposing the war on
[2:00:50.440 --> 2:00:54.520]  terror is a hoax day one not bragging the granddaddy of it so fools out there
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:57.960]  going hey Al Qaeda works for the globalist yeah I know but it's like
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:02.680]  turning starving pit bulls loose on a bloody child that just cuz you run the
[2:01:02.680 --> 2:01:06.920]  dogs doesn't mean they're not real trying to explain that it's a globalist
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:10.800]  destabilization force so people can't live on their own so they beg for
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:15.560]  centralized government problem reaction solution they try to create anarchy so
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:20.080]  you beg for the state instead of letting natural anarchy through free association
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:24.720]  grow now Julia other points that are important to make here where do you how
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:28.520]  do you see them striking back and and and how do you see Bitcoin making the
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:32.080]  old system obsolete because some could argue that they know the old systems
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:37.000]  going down SDR is gonna be fiat that there actually might be behind Bitcoin
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:41.720]  because they want it to be the new system yeah I just don't buy it because you
[2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:44.880]  know it's incredibly difficult you can't control it can't really set it's
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:50.760]  difficult to censor and just like imagine doing an audit on on Bitcoin it's
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:54.200]  very very difficult much more difficult than the systems we have in place right
[2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:58.160]  now but they would like is just a pure cashless society where we use credit
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:01.960]  cards for everything and government issued cards Bitcoin is outside of that
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:05.760]  system so I don't think it's favorable for that kind of I don't think it fits
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:10.520]  into that conspiracy theory at all but regarding the regular I agree with you I
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:13.640]  don't think they're behind it and the fact that its first message was against
[2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:17.840]  the banker bailout when it showed up four or five years ago I think it's some
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:22.520]  type of super smart insider who's protesting the whole system yeah it's
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:27.040]  um I mean to say that it's the government conspiracy I think it's
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.920]  giving governments way too much credibility I just don't believe it I
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:35.600]  think it's an individual or small group of individuals that are innovative and
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:42.000]  have had a freedom in their intention and so what let's talk about the
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:46.160]  regulation because this is a big deal right now the New York State Department
[2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:51.640]  of Financial Services and Superintendent Ben Lasky they've proposed a bit
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:55.120]  licensed for the state of New York and it's incredibly overreaching and it's
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:03:00.840]  stifles innovation and I like to call it the the ban on human interaction because
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:08.440]  it's it's very it's it defines cryptocurrency very broadly and it it
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:12.720]  states things like all the companies have to have fingerprints of all of their
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:20.440]  employees, background checks of people who are using their services,
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:28.720]  you have to be like you're free just be submitted if you make a transaction
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:34.840]  that's more than $3,000 it's just it's really really really insane and all the
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:39.960]  companies are actually leaving the state because they don't want to they can't
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:44.560]  afford you have to hire like three different regulation officers, compliance
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:48.400]  officers, so little companies are actually being going to be destroyed if
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:53.800]  they do choose to stay in New York and this is what happened in England with
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:59.400]  the automobile regulations guess what America won the automobile race easily
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:03.680]  because they were so heavily regulated that nobody could do anything and it's
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:08.520]  so overreaching that now if anybody wants to transact with a company that is
[2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:13.280]  located in New York they have to fall under those regulations too so companies
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:17.320]  are going to have to deny companies outside of New York are going to
[2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:20.920]  actually deny customers that live in and then people will flee California in
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:26.240]  New York come to Texas and act just the same way and ruin it again not smart
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:30.680]  enough to know that they shouldn't crap in their own house exactly Alex and the
[2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:34.160]  actual I have a good friend who was who's been in the headline saw in the
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:38.120]  Bitcoin community quite a bit and he had a business and he's going to be moving

[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.320]  Sunday live in studio of the Sunday edition 4 to 6 p.m. central standard
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:06.400]  time as well info wars nightly news is the night 7 o'clock central well a few
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:11.560]  months ago I made big news across the world here was the headline the ultimate
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:18.680]  goal of the nsa is total population control that's William Edward Benny
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:23.360]  he's the former technical leader for intelligence with the nsa is at the
[2:09:23.360 --> 2:09:28.560]  very top of it before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001 after more than
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:32.760]  30 years with the agency Benny has been described as one of the best analysts
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:38.120]  and codebreakers in nsa history many continues to speak out about the nsa's
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:44.200]  data collection policies then continues interviews in the media and again it's
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:49.440]  amazing that he's so high-level and has the courage to speak out despite their
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:54.800]  attempts to silence them expose fax.org has some of his information there I
[2:09:54.800 --> 2:10:00.680]  wanted to get him on the last few weeks we're able to get him today because of
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:07.760]  headlines like this Snowden there's a holy s-word smoking gun revelation
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:12.120]  coming whistleblowers as government believes his information that would be
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:16.520]  the death of them all politically well then please release it because we're got
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:22.720]  a bunch of totalitarians running things and he told wired magazine that William
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:30.680]  Benny just came out with a group that I know is associated with people high up
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:37.720]  in the government and top analysts like Ray McGovern Xnsa director US
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:42.640]  intelligence veterans write open letter to Merkel to avoid all-out
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:48.840]  Ukraine war now the former ambassador to Russia has gone public saying the West
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:54.720]  is starting the war and has destabilized Ukraine that's just the truth so I want
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:58.320]  to get William Benny's breakdown on that also want to talk to him about
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:04.400]  parallel construction where other agencies like the DEA are using nsa
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:08.880]  data totally illegally and then creating fake court cases so the courts
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:15.480]  don't know where they got the data this is just beyond 1984 so that's some of
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:18.560]  what we'll talk about in the next hour coming up at the bottom of the hour
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:23.760]  we've got your questions that you're tweeting to real Alex Jones we put a
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:28.360]  hashtag out there as you can tweet your questions to William Benny will also take
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:41.720]  a few phone calls specific questions for him 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 specific
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:46.920]  questions for William Benny mr. Benny you heard me throw out that that grouping
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:53.320]  of questions would you like to answer one of those first or what do you think is
[2:11:53.320 --> 2:12:00.280]  most important that's currently happening right now well to me the what
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:04.440]  what nsa all the data nsa is collecting and being used by the police forces is
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:12.120]  really the most threatening situation to our constitutional republic since the
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:17.120]  Civil War so to me that's the most important thing because it affects
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:21.760]  everything we do it involves everything that everybody in the country is doing
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:26.760]  so I mean that's that's contrary to the founding documents of this of this
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:33.600]  nation well you're absolutely right last year we were given secret documents
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:37.600]  from Homeland Security sources in Seattle they were putting up their own
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:42.040]  cell towers letting the local police even have access to it grabbing everyone's
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:47.800]  data now I see headlines and CBS news you name it going no one knows what the
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:52.200]  mystery cell towers are but it's not the government because it's illegal to do
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:58.400]  that I mean we know what's going on can you speak to that well I think that's
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.200]  that's part of that is gathering information on our movement of
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:08.640]  individuals I mean that's how you can track people moving around by acting is
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:12.640]  basically putting up false towers and getting everybody to ping off your
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:16.520]  tower that way you know they're in the area and you can monitor who they are
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:22.240]  and map them over time by the by the the machine access codes that they have and
[2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:26.960]  the and that the phone numbers and things so it's not a matter of you know
[2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:29.680]  it's not a matter of them guessing anymore they just track everybody and
[2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:34.760]  they could be a simple problem to align them you know with a program compile
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:37.940]  them and track everybody individually and all you have to do is point to them
[2:13:37.940 --> 2:13:41.560]  say where have you been for the last month or two and you can see what you've
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:46.320]  been doing that's right it's so good to talk to somebody that knows all of this
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:49.840]  and it knows more than I even know because I I mean I look at what's open
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:54.200]  source public every day a decade ago the British put these up in London as a
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:58.440]  beta test as you know they also did it in Berlin they tracked everybody in real
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:02.920]  time for years it's totally illegal now they're building this grid at billions
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:06.920]  of dollars of expense for their own internal communication system as well
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:11.720]  cameras microphones lifetime tracking of the cell phones and then when the public
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:20.000]  says what are these they go gee we don't know yeah right yeah if you believe
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:27.480]  that I have a bridge to tell you exactly phrasey wow tell folks what
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:31.280]  parallel construction is and why did you I mean obviously you can't talk about a
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:35.440]  lot of it but why did you leave the NSA when you were one of the top people one
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:42.280]  of the directors of it well I I left in October 2001 because they started spying
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:45.720]  on everybody and assembling information on everyone in the United States and it
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:49.960]  went first with phone numbers and then went went into the internet later on and
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:53.920]  very shortly thereafter so it was very clear to me that they were they were
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:59.040]  pulling the other all this knowledge is like a super Stasi state basically so
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:05.640]  NSA was becoming the new Stasi agency you know that was it that's their new term I
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:10.320]  guess never say anything is now the new Stasi agency because even though their
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:14.200]  people are not necessarily using their assembling and making possible all this
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:18.720]  information and making available to all the all the police state policing
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:22.080]  agencies of the federal government that they in turn make it local to the local
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:26.880]  accessible to the local and state police so it's really becoming a police state
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:31.320]  that's exactly what these Germany was with the Stasi and it was there was the
[2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:36.160]  primary reason why they did that that's why I left so I mean that was the main
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:41.120]  the main reason I left because I could see this coming and parallel construction
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:48.360]  is the use of is how the police forces federal state and local use the NSA
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:51.680]  collected information which which fundamentally is not acquired with the
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:57.440]  warrant and so therefore it is all it is all inadmissible directly and
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:02.080]  inadmissible in the in a court of law and so therefore what they do is they
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:07.080]  have to whenever they find something through the NSA data they direct local
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:11.000]  police force to arrest them and say now you do a parallel construction by using
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:15.760]  what you would consider normal policing techniques and and like requesting
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:19.440]  things with warrants and things like that and you get the symbol that data and
[2:16:19.440 --> 2:16:24.160]  you use that data to substitute for the NSA data that was originally used to
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:28.520]  arrest them and you substitute the parallel constructed data in the
[2:16:28.520 --> 2:16:32.800]  courtroom which which I've called perjury they're they're lying to the
[2:16:32.800 --> 2:16:36.440]  courts and they're subverting our entire judicial process and that's what
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:39.720]  happens when you allow this kind of assembly of information that so much
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:45.360]  power it's like J Edgar Hoover on super steroids so you know this is the this
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:51.480]  is not compatible with any any form of democracy at all and whether it's
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:56.160]  Republican or Democratic administrations Nixon or Obama they all end up using the
[2:16:56.160 --> 2:17:01.080]  IRS you name it to persecute political enemies imagine what Hitler would have
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:05.160]  done with systems like this these systems historically always end up getting
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:10.960]  abused if you're just joining us the former director of technical
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:15.080]  intelligence with the NSA I've heard it described as one of the top four jobs
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:19.640]  there so one of the heads of the NSA William Edward Benny is on with us
[2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:23.480]  right now and I mean my much bigger whistleblower you could say even though
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:28.680]  he hasn't released a lot of secret info then Snowden and so the media is to
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.720]  somewhat has tried to ignore him but he's so big they can't without getting into
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:37.480]  anything that was classified but we are dealing with open to Talitarianism so
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:41.520]  it's almost treason for any of us even if something's classified to not talk
[2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:46.720]  about it I mean what was it like to be in there I mean do they come in and say
[2:17:46.720 --> 2:17:49.920]  okay we're gonna flip on all the switches and spy on everything now and
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:55.200]  focus on US citizens and politicians I mean can you tell us was there a moment
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:18:01.760]  or was it a process when you're there heading up you know the NSA and who
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:06.240]  comes in to you was the director of national intelligence who was it was
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:10.320]  it the president okay we're now gonna totally break the law and spy on
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:16.760]  everyone and then you say I'm out of here how did that happen actually I was
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:21.880]  not supposed to know about this program at all because I was I was I told them
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:27.660]  that I was gonna leave in early 2002 so I was not supposed to know about what
[2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:30.960]  they were doing but the problem with that was that they had to use the
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:36.680]  programs that we had developed there under that I had helped form in within
[2:18:36.680 --> 2:18:40.280]  the Stig and Automation Research Center which is my laboratory at the time so
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:44.000]  they had to use those programs which meant they had to use the computer
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:49.320]  programmers that it developed it for me to install it in another place and get
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:52.160]  it up and running because they were the only ones who knew how to make the code
[2:18:52.160 --> 2:18:57.920]  set it up make it running and and get data flowing in and working so when they
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:02.440]  when they did that they I mean they did they kept it all very secret even started
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:06.800]  NSA and the reasonable course was because it was an impeachable act I mean
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:10.360]  after all they're spying on the US citizens with a violation of the FISA
[2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:14.280]  laws the way they were keeping the courts out of it they only informed four
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:18.480]  people in Congress you know the right chair and ranking members the House of
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:21.600]  Senate intelligence committee one of which was Nancy Pelosi and that's why
[2:19:21.600 --> 2:19:25.440]  she later on said that they impeaching George Bush is off the table because she
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:29.880]  had agreed to these programs from the beginning so they were keeping it very
[2:19:29.880 --> 2:19:34.120]  secret even from Congress they didn't want any opposition because when when
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:37.800]  that basically was the total information awareness program that was
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:43.120]  started in 2001 Admiral Poindexter and if you remember Admiral Poindexter came
[2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:48.760]  out in I think was 2003 advocating a TIA program total information awareness
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:52.520]  program and that's when everybody came down on it and terminated and that's
[2:19:52.520 --> 2:19:56.480]  why and that's what Congress's reaction so when they saw their reaction they
[2:19:56.480 --> 2:20:00.000]  continued to see that they were kicked from their perspective they were making
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:04.200]  the right decision by keeping it secret it's just like their secret agreement
[2:20:04.200 --> 2:20:08.400]  to their secret interpretation of section 215 of the Patriot Act the
[2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:12.200]  fellow who wrote the Patriot Act representative Sensenbrenner has already
[2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:16.360]  gone publicly instead that he never he never intended them to be able to do
[2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:20.080]  what they are doing that this bulk acquisition of information by using that
[2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:24.240]  Patriot Act well that's violating the intent of Congress and yet they're
[2:20:24.240 --> 2:20:28.520]  still they're still doing that and and they're not spelling out they're afraid
[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:32.160]  to spell out to the American people exactly what they're doing and what
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:36.040]  they what their interpretation is of these laws that allows them to do it
[2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:40.240]  they simply are assuming that if the Congress keeps passing these laws then
[2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:45.080]  then that's pasted agreement with what they their secret interpretation is and
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:48.320]  they're never really they don't have the guts to come out and tell the American
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:52.520]  people out in the open what they're doing so that's the real problem well
[2:20:52.520 --> 2:20:56.280]  you're right that was a major as I was on air at the time when point extra wrote
[2:20:56.280 --> 2:21:01.240]  the op-ed for the New York Times called total information awareness he said
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:06.280]  your credit card what you eat where you go everything you do when you go to
[2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:11.480]  school everything will be tracked in live time or the terrorists will kill you
[2:21:11.480 --> 2:21:16.680]  people went whoa this is 1984 and you want private companies around this no
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:23.240]  way so there was a backlash so they tried to openly sell that when when it
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:27.200]  blew up in their face you know as you said they just went forward with it but
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:31.280]  the biggest thing for me here is it's come out in England as you know that
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:36.720]  they've got the same system and they use it against the Parliament the
[2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:41.160]  bureaucracy does I mean this is being used this is not to stop al-Qaeda or
[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:45.720]  ISIS this is pointed directly to American people and now we've gone from it
[2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:50.600]  being secret to it being public and then nothing's being done where do you see
[2:21:50.600 --> 2:21:55.400]  this going yeah well I see this is a very sad state of affairs this is not
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:59.560]  the America I grew up and I tell you I could never understand why people would
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:03.400]  tolerate this kind of stuff I've been advocating if these both those keep
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:07.320]  reinforcing but by passing the same laws over and over again that we the people
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:11.120]  should hire them get them out of office because they're incompetent and they're
[2:22:11.120 --> 2:22:15.320]  not they're not living up to the office we need to get rid of them I mean
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:19.680]  it doesn't matter Democrat or Republican I'm not in the party is nothing to do
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:23.360]  with it has to do with whether or not you subscribe to the foundations of this
[2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:31.440]  country well I remember a listener sent me the the link to Thomas.loc.gov in
[2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:35.840]  1998 and said look at this he was an engineer engineers would feed me info I
[2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:39.480]  mean I had engineers that told me they had big hubs and all the telecoms
[2:22:39.480 --> 2:22:43.200]  listening to everything they would bring me diagrams I had no idea what it meant
[2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:47.080]  stick it in shredder machines because I'm no engineer but I've been exposing
[2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:54.800]  this since day one having having other whistleblowers on but I remember you know
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:23:00.880]  seeing this information and finding it's so hard to believe but reporting on it
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:05.240]  and now it's just out in the open and I remember being sent documents that they
[2:23:05.240 --> 2:23:11.280]  had done a grant for Austin to put up a thousand plus hidden microphones to
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:16.240]  listen to people and they even had an algorithm program running locally that
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:19.640]  the feds had paid for that was NSA technology that you and others developed
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:24.760]  I'm sure that was keyword and it was all there in the federal grant just
[2:23:24.760 --> 2:23:31.440]  admission of microphones key logging or word logging whatever you call it and I
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:35.320]  went on air and covered it and and people couldn't believe it then a week
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:39.560]  later the local paper ran a big story whitewashing it going no it's gunshot
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:44.200]  detector microphones but the grant said it was microphones to listen to people
[2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:49.160]  and then now this year they announced nationwide they're putting microphones
[2:23:49.160 --> 2:23:55.040]  in hidden in street sculptures and it's in the Chicago Tribune but they don't
[2:23:55.040 --> 2:24:00.520]  call it microphones they go the the the data clusters pick up wireless
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:06.640]  environmental hazards and listen to audio for signs of trouble so so it's just
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:13.440]  this main lining of a 1984 Mr. Benny is a former director of one of the major
[2:24:13.440 --> 2:24:22.760]  areas of the NSA I mean microphones hidden is 1984 is it not yes I mean and
[2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:29.160]  of course it's not just the microphones with the audio and and and and the and
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:33.320]  the and looking at video for example that those things but it's also all the
[2:24:33.320 --> 2:24:37.280]  electronic backgrounds that goes with it anything you're carrying with you like
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:41.520]  a cell phone or any kind of transaction used with any kind of document like
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:47.080]  your your credit card transactions and all all those kinds things are all
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:51.360]  assembled and that all becomes a profile basically of you and by the way they
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:54.880]  keep saying well we don't build profiles of people no they don't the
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:59.280]  software does that I mean once you put the data in the base it builds
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:03.200]  relationships and that in fact is the profile so anytime they want to look at
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:06.960]  you all they have to do is point at you and say give me his profile and you get
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:12.200]  it so it's not a matter of them not having it they have the profile on
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:16.920]  everybody and it's not done by people that's another word game they play they
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:21.080]  play all kinds of word games with people you know it's like if we don't
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:25.040]  consider anything collected unless the person looks at it well that doesn't
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:28.360]  stop them from collecting everything about everybody in the country and
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:31.600]  there that's what they're doing and they're doing it through a program called
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:35.440]  Fairview which is the main input program they have if you go on the web and do a
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:41.200]  a Google on Fairview you know and NSA you'll you'll get the slides that will
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:45.400]  show you all that there's like eighty to a hundred tap points inside the
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:50.360]  continental United States the four lower forty eight that show where they're
[2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:55.920]  tapping and collecting information off the fiber optic network and that was
[2:25:55.920 --> 2:25:59.160]  being put in for when I was told and shown by engineers and later confirmed
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:05.920]  at the telecom hubs all over the country at taxpayer expense whole floors and whole
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:13.160]  rooms of cable companies of AT&T you name it with all the data passing through
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:20.840]  it just outrageous and then Bush walking around on TV in 2006 saying oh we
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:25.320]  don't listen to anybody in America and playing the word game that the computers
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:30.680]  do when they can go open your profile up and see the whole menu of everything you
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:35.680]  do laid out what movies you see what books you read all your emails Google
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:40.120]  admits they open your emails and read it sir what do you make of Amazon and
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:46.120]  Google and Microsoft and Apple and all of their admissions that that they are
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:52.680]  data mining and using and selling the data I mean it's not just the NSA I mean
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:26:57.120]  I look at that also is the same as the it's not as bad as the government because
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:01.880]  they can't come arrest you or do violent things sure but but I mean still is it's
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:06.200]  still a fundamental violation of privacy rights of individual I mean and
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:10.320]  that's against I believe the electronic privacy acts electronic security acts all
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:14.280]  that stuff that that that all were existing most try to get privacy to
[2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:21.760]  people and in their electronic age so I mean it's it's the fundamental I don't
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:25.600]  think they should be allowed or permitted to do that either I totally agree
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:30.280]  with you and expanding on that what do you make of Kate Upton all these stars
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:35.200]  with sex tapes and naked photos that that they thought it was safe to send
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:41.320]  sex videos around or naked photos on an Apple cloud what do you make of this
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:46.320]  whole cloud revolution well it just acts as the more it's just another means of
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:50.480]  accessing more data about individuals I mean anybody puts information out there
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:55.760]  should assume it's being sparked up by the NSA and and then made available to
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:01.880]  the FBI and DEA and other other government agencies are our courts
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:07.360]  fundamentally now completely bankrupt if for a decade they've been or more
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:12.480]  creating fake cases with data they stole and then they lie and perjure to the
[2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:18.200]  court I mean that sounds like most these convictions should be overturned yeah
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:23.040]  that's that's right I mean and even the solicitor general had the lie to the
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:27.920]  Supreme Court to get the case the you know Amnesty International versus
[2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:33.480]  Clapper thrown out and that was again challenging the the issue of NSA
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:37.840]  collecting all this data without a warrant and they the solicitor general
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:41.040]  lied to the court saying that anybody that where this data was used against
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.760]  them either in a court or wherever they would be told and that was simply a lie
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:49.080]  and so now they're trying to scramble to figure out what to do about that all the
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:53.640]  past thousands of cases that they've done this way I think they're going to
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:57.240]  write those off and say well that's just collateral damage you know well that
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:00.800]  shouldn't be I mean it's a violation of the Constitution the foundation of this
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:05.680]  of this country if our government wants to do that they want to violate our
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:09.160]  Constitution or change it there's a process to do that and they should follow
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:13.440]  that process create an amendment get it passed Congress send it around to the
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:17.440]  state to ratify I mean that's the procedure we're supposed to do but our
[2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:22.240]  government is taking a totally different very very ugly path a
[2:29:22.240 --> 2:29:27.280]  totalitarian revolution is really what it is William Edward Benny is our guest
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:30.960]  I'm gonna come back and ask him about that famous statement of Clapper the
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:33.920]  director of intelligence to Congress saying we don't spy on Americans we
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:36.960]  don't collect any data that's like saying the Sun didn't come up I mean it
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:41.560]  it's just they're bad guys I mean that's what they are they're villains it's not
[2:29:41.560 --> 2:29:46.800]  being done to protect us expose facts org William Benny straight ahead your
[2:29:46.800 --> 2:29:54.160]  calls and more we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[2:29:54.160 --> 2:30:03.440]  GCN radio network from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:07.680]  world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the
[2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:11.600]  air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:15.440]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:19.240]  spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:23.480]  homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over
[2:30:23.480 --> 2:30:27.400]  a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't
[2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:30.280]  forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're
[2:30:30.280 --> 2:30:33.800]  allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics it was clear
[2:30:33.800 --> 2:30:38.480]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic
[2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:42.040]  environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back against made with

[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:24.360]  I've been on air 20 years it'll be 20 years in about a month and by 1996 as a
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:28.400]  libertarian promoting liberty I was at police chiefs contacting me a major
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:35.840]  studies emergency managers engineers who were aware of all this stuff going into
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:41.040]  place behind the scenes and I would go on there and talk about it so I would get
[2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:46.080]  sent more data than I got syndicated that's the reason I realized how much
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:52.440]  trouble we were in before a lot of other folks was because a lot of people out
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:57.480]  there in the system who knew more than I did were basically using me as a conduit
[2:33:57.480 --> 2:34:03.680]  to get stuff out of the public so I can't take credit for being light years
[2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:09.160]  ahead of everybody else but now we don't have an excuse this stuff is out in the
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:13.000]  open thanks to heroes like William Edward Benny who could make a lot of money
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.720]  working for the private contractors and the big companies that are making tens
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:22.320]  of billions of dollars a year milking this 800,000 people the Washington
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:28.280]  Post reported last year 840 something thousand have access to all this spy
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:33.920]  data and I'm no engineer but I am a geopolitical researcher it just sounds
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:39.080]  like insider trading people harassing friends and family it sounds like a way
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:43.360]  to corner markets it sounds like a way for real terrorists or criminals to know
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:49.240]  if the good guys are after them it just sounds like a devil's workshop on
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:56.200]  steroids with a helping of PCP to have 800,000 contractors in this and now we
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:00.120]  know the NSA has used this stuff in other agencies because remember this is
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:05.520]  given to dozens of other agencies federal and state to then just go out and
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:10.440]  harass their wives their husbands their neighbors their competition to plant
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:14.440]  stuff under sneak and peek and the Patriot Act on computers I mean it's
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:21.040]  just a Pandora's box of making us insecure and destroying our free market
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:26.720]  again I'm not some 200 IQ super brain like William Benny who headed up their
[2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:31.560]  you know major technical department and director of technical intelligence I mean
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:37.920]  that's the actual use a Starship Trooper analogy brain bug okay but but just
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:43.240]  at my gut level just stult sir did I hit on anything that is important when I
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:49.040]  just said oh absolutely I mean that's the the whole point is that this is
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:53.840]  drifting toward a gate and a government a central government that's like Jay
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:58.040]  Edgar Hoover on super steroids they have they have the knowledge and background
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:01.440]  of virtually everybody in the country and that gives them the basis for black
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:06.440]  mail and influence peddling so that's the way they can get things done you know
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:10.800]  leverage against individuals and make sure that like for example when when
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:14.920]  Nancy Pelosi said impeaching George Bush is off the table the leverage he had was
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:18.040]  she was a part of these programs so she'd have to impeach her so they get
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:22.320]  everybody to be part of it including local police and now they're all part of
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:28.360]  the cult exactly now they ought to defend themselves otherwise they all fall
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:33.320]  that's how Julius Caesar took over Rome I mean this has been a dot sir is this
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:40.080]  not an orchestrated diabolical plan then it sure seems that way if at least it's
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:45.400]  being done and and the administrations as they come in keep perpetuating it
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:51.440]  well I mean I mean from Russ Tice who was a former also an NSA whistleblower he
[2:36:51.440 --> 2:36:55.800]  has been saying that for a long time that they've been they've been transcribing
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:59.760]  phone calls and conversations and emails of the US representatives and
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:04.840]  senators and and judges in the federal courts as well as Supreme Court that's
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:09.080]  now come out the CIA is spying on the Senate yep and this is just that's just
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:14.320]  CIA NSA is much more powerful of that so that that just means that they're
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:18.880]  they're assembling all that blackmail information for leverage gosh and
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:24.520]  correct me if I'm wrong doesn't having 800,000 contractors just contractors
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:28.560]  hooked into this that I mean if I wanted to bring down a government or a
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:34.720]  country I would let 800,000 people have access to this Panopticon type system
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:38.920]  because it would then leak everywhere and then the country would be insecure I
[2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:43.200]  mean this this sounds like the opposite of what I would want to do if I wanted
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:49.280]  to have a secure safe country yeah that's exactly correct I mean I objected
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:52.520]  to this in the late 90s when they first started doing this outsourcing the
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:57.040]  contractors I I was objecting to it then because I didn't think it was a smart
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:01.720]  idea to do that just under the principle of out exporting that you know giving
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:06.800]  away your trade secrets as a business to to other to companies and that's
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:09.920]  fundamentally what it is that you're giving away the trade seeks how you
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.080]  acquire data how you look at data that kind of thing and that's exposed to all
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:21.960]  these contractors and imagine how easy it is for foreign states and foreign
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:27.320]  corporations to then penetrate and compromise the contractors yeah that's
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:29.920]  right that's happened any number of times down through history I mean they
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:34.280]  that is a kind of a weakness that I mean they could even hire the contractors
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:38.000]  to you know like on after their contracts were done within a day they could
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:42.400]  hire them as the contractors over their way to although you know they do they do
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:46.320]  have a non-disclosure agreement that says they won't disclose anything they've
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:50.480]  discussed I mean they take with them the knowledge of how what they experienced
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:53.360]  while they were there and they can apply that knowledge and techniques to other
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:58.280]  things without actually compromising what they were doing in NFA and
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:01.720]  effectively it means the same thing I mean you're still giving that expertise
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:09.200]  away it's amazing to get your insight here on air William Benny is our guest I
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:15.880]  want to go to some phone calls 800-259-9231 specifically questions for
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:21.400]  the highest level NSA whistleblower of all time he was in the top four position
[2:39:21.400 --> 2:39:25.960]  there some say even the number three position the director the technical
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:30.120]  leader for intelligence with the NSA I have a whole bunch of Twitter questions
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:35.920]  from real Alex Jones here for you sir but first off anything else you'd like
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:42.760]  to add before we go to these calls I just think we we as a country and we as
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:46.000]  a people need to decide whether or not we're going to continue to tolerate this
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.720]  I don't think we should I mean this is the this is not consistent with our
[2:39:49.720 --> 2:39:54.480]  foundationing our founding principles we we need to make this a major issue in
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:59.320]  the upcoming election in November and when the politicians come around to
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:03.680]  solicit your votes and so in talk to you and all you should raise these issues
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:06.960]  with them and say look if you don't start facing up and starting to live and
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:12.080]  protect and defend the Constitution we are going to fire you and we need to
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:16.000]  pass that message to them very strongly otherwise they're going to sit there and
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:19.360]  and drift along and do whatever they want to do you have to threaten them with
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:24.440]  their job that's the only thing that'll make them do anything that's that's what
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:29.560]  I think we need to do I mean I don't see any other way out of this sure I totally
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:36.760]  agree with your statement there RC Patterson asked on Twitter he says Mr.
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:42.560]  Benny any advice on how to mess or scramble the profile data with NSA is
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:47.640]  doing on us ie web credit purchase etc I would just say everyone always thinks
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:52.200]  about how to get around it how about we politically change it and stop the whole
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:58.520]  thing that's wrong but until we get there what would you do to protect your
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:05.040]  private information actually I I do absolutely nothing and the reason is
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:08.960]  because there's virtually I'm a target and so there's virtually nothing I could
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:14.040]  do anyway so anything they they wanted to get for me they could actively attack
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:19.240]  my computer to get it or or you know doing and others sneak and peek kind of
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:23.800]  invasions of my house like the FBI normally that does they do sneak and
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:28.320]  peeks to implant things in the house to listen to you and all that kind of stuff
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:32.800]  so I know I'm a target so therefore I don't really try to do anything at all
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:36.040]  and that in fact I don't want to because I want them to know everything I'm
[2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:42.760]  saying about them I'm the same way I have the exact same policy well it so I
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:48.240]  I really don't know what anybody could individually do I mean I wouldn't as long
[2:41:48.240 --> 2:41:52.240]  as you don't make a yeah as long as you don't become come visible to them for
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:55.120]  some reason or other they won't target you I don't think they'll look at your
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:59.320]  profile but if you do something that they irritate them why they'll call up
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:05.440]  your profile start looking at you though so I don't and I'm not sure really I mean
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:09.800]  you could try to use tour tours and annoyance to them that's a helps and
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:14.960]  anonymize what you're doing on the web that that is some impediment it causes
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:20.680]  them some difficulty and if they target you of course they can go around that so
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:26.760]  one way to do it is jamming it with disinformation garbage just creating
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:31.160]  totally random profiles is doing weird things that'll create kind of plaques of
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:37.840]  clouds that that will I think alter the profile but I'd say let it it gets
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:43.600]  criminal it's illegal and have the profile full of stuff exposing them so
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:47.480]  they're aware with their sample rate just how many people are awake to them
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:52.200]  yeah that's that's what I try to do I make sure I anything I say if I refer
[2:42:52.200 --> 2:42:55.680]  to them I refer to them in a way that makes it perfectly clear what I think
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:00.760]  of them well it's organized crime in a revolution against our civilization
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:03.840]  then we do agree with that statement they have organized in a racketeering
[2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:08.960]  operation to openly violate everyone's rights and mass lie about it get caught
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:15.960]  and keep lying well it certainly is a is an analogy that would work I mean I I
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:19.580]  don't think they've taken the final step like they haven't done what the
[2:43:19.580 --> 2:43:24.280]  stars he does like incarcerate you they but they discredit you and kind of them
[2:43:24.280 --> 2:43:28.800]  try to embarrass you and get you out of the way they just don't put you in a in
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:33.360]  the gulag or something you know that step has not been taken yet well I mean
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:38.680]  they're starting to try yeah that doesn't mean it can't be absolutely look
[2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:42.720]  at the next to Susan in his film let's go to a phone call again William Benny
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:48.160]  who is a real hero is our guest Catherine has a question go ahead yeah
[2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:52.880]  actually do I have a question for mr. Benny I'm just okay I'm I'm from
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:58.400]  Canada which is not from USA but like feel to politically speaking I'm scared
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:02.280]  that Russia is gonna like trench over the border there's no oceans there's no
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.320]  nothing to stop them what are we like should be we should we be worried in
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:11.920]  Canada about Russia like marching over the Arctic mr. Benny you have had some
[2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:15.840]  things to say recently about the Russia situation Russia is saying that they may
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:19.440]  take part of the Arctic that borders them I don't see Russia in an offensive
[2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:24.240]  mode right now but maybe you can correct me no I don't but this is see this is
[2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:30.120]  also one of my very I'm actually an NSA advocate okay but but I'm an advocate in
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:34.200]  the in the form of doing the right thing now what's happened is when they went to
[2:44:34.200 --> 2:44:38.720]  this bulk acquisition of data that's diverted the effort and tension intensity
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:42.640]  and investigation into areas that aren't relevant to anything that's important
[2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:47.040]  and that takes away from other areas like be able to watch the militaries that
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:52.680]  are about those Russians or any other country and and it reduces the capacity
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:59.680]  to do intelligence and and to acquire and and smartly assemble intelligence
[2:44:59.680 --> 2:45:04.800]  about those targets so that's hurting our ability to understand what they're
[2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:08.520]  doing or what they're intending to do and that's what I was saying earlier just
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:13.440]  as a layperson when you're spying on 320 million Americans how on earth could
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:17.840]  you be watching the Russians that's the point but actually it's even worse than
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:22.600]  that though it's all it's probably on the order of four point up somewhere
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:25.920]  between three and four point five billion people around the world sure
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:29.240]  three hundred and plus million US citizens but the rest of the people in
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:33.760]  the world too that's that's really that's really the thing that's destroying the
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:37.760]  capacity I mean you need to you need to have a rich environment of information
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:42.520]  that's relevant to assess something that's ongoing or that's impending and
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:48.880]  if you don't have that it becomes very difficult to succeed which is what the
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:53.320]  globalists want this is a sabotage plan against this country in my view let's
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:58.160]  talk to David from Florida go ahead you're on the air question for William
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:04.040]  Benny hey mr. Benny mr. Jones I really appreciate you immensely for your
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:08.800]  your contributions to our society I just wanted to mention that we've got Russia
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:13.160]  on the West you know it really intensifying in Archangelus where they
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:18.160]  put together a large part of their revenue to develop the largest world
[2:46:18.160 --> 2:46:22.840]  oil platform to go into the Bering Sea and the Antarctic and let's face it the
[2:46:22.840 --> 2:46:30.160]  Antarctic has the largest troves of oil and gas you know on the planet and we've
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:33.680]  got to back up a little bit because we know that Hitler in the whole World
[2:46:33.680 --> 2:46:40.000]  War two was put together in a deal because it was all CIA based and we put
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:44.760]  all understand but specifically what is your question for the guest my question
[2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:50.320]  is this we put together all those Nazis into a place called Little America for
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:56.600]  an Antarctic and I just want to know what you think the outcome is going to be
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:01.480]  because the end game I think is actually that the Russians when the Indian
[2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:04.960]  coms they're going for an order because well they said they're getting ready to
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:08.120]  go for it look I gotta go because we have limited time these are specific
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:13.560]  questions for mr. Benny you did join the intelligence professionals earlier
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:17.880]  last week I know I'm looking for the article and basically came out and said
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.800]  that ex-NSA director US intelligence veterans write open letter to Merkel to
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:28.440]  avoid all out Ukraine war what is your take on Ukraine and Russia sir it looks
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:33.760]  like that the Russians are playing a saber-rattling game it's not really an
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:39.440]  invasion I mean if you had an invasion like I was involved in analyzing all
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:43.800]  the invasion of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan if you if you're preparing
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:46.720]  to have an invasion you're gonna have something then then you've got to be
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:50.200]  there with a lot in the case of Ukraine anyway with a lot more in terms of
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:55.160]  capabilities in terms of personnel and equipment I mean you can't just do it
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:47:59.960]  with the few tens of thousands they have so the point is it's not really an
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:03.520]  invasion what they're doing is playing games along the along the border and
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:08.400]  saber-rattling the point is I I tend to agree with the president here that he
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:12.800]  needs to this needs to be solved diplomatically and I believe that that's
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:16.480]  the correct route rather than try to go to confrontation I mean I don't think
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:20.600]  the Russians the Russians feel very threatened by the expansion of NATO no
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:26.040]  kidding and and I would say well okay fine if they if you look at it from
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:30.360]  their perspective they they have some concerns well okay why don't we invite
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:36.320]  them into NATO why don't we get all of us together in a mutual defense treaty
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:39.680]  instead of always fighting with each other will sit up instead of fighting
[2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:43.840]  with each other and looking and acting like they are really a threat why don't
[2:48:43.840 --> 2:48:48.840]  we include them instead of excluding them here's another question from Mike
[2:48:48.840 --> 2:48:54.000]  heads room on Twitter he wants to ask you mr. Benny has the NSA managed to
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:49:02.080]  break SSL what is your preferred encryption algorithm I don't believe
[2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:09.240]  any any commercially available encryption system is necessarily safe of
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:16.120]  course simply because of the back doors and the and the and the weakening that
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:20.280]  NSA has done through bull run program that's been part of this nose and
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:24.280]  exposure they have that the bull run program to weaken all the encryption
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:27.880]  systems that simply meant to give them weakening weaknesses in the keys or in
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:31.080]  the way keys are generated I guess pressure the developers to give them
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:35.760]  back doors yeah that's right yeah that's right and that's how they get it and my
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:40.440]  point is that you can take some very simple you could use whatever is
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:45.800]  commercially available as a kind of a community cipher that you could use but
[2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:50.600]  underneath that you have to come up with some variation of your own so that when
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:53.640]  they go through assuming that they have the right keys and everything with their
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:57.920]  when they're breaking all these things they end up with a mess wow so that it's
[2:49:57.920 --> 2:50:02.640]  basically layers of complexity is what I'm and one of those layers can be a
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:07.000]  very simple thing like you simply take the binary stream of a text that you're
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:13.040]  trying to encrypt and just transpose the bits in a pattern and that destroys the
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:17.120]  integrity of the text so that even if they have the correct key coming through
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:21.360]  the different layers of encryption for it for you they still end up with that
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:27.840]  transposed mess and they can't recognize it so that's one way of that that I had
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:34.360]  to propose the defeating bulk for the brute force attack on a system just
[2:50:34.360 --> 2:50:38.080]  assuming a whole trillions of keys and going through keys and trying them to see
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:43.800]  if you get any partial text well in that case if you do that bit transposition
[2:50:43.800 --> 2:50:48.040]  that that destroys the integrity so that any partial text you would get under
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:52.200]  any key assumption under that brute force attack would be absolutely wrong
[2:50:52.200 --> 2:50:56.440]  amazing stay there this is incredible you have more questions straight ahead

[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:14.320]  Melissa C Lee and others that are holding I got a bunch of questions that
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:18.440]  have come in at real Alex Jones on Twitter but look at this CNET news
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:24.080]  headline robot couch can drive you to the fridge and back as if this country
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:28.600]  isn't already obese enough next they're gonna have toilets in the couch like
[2:54:28.600 --> 2:54:33.000]  idiocracy people need to really wake up and stop just going along to get along
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:36.840]  and just because the majority of folks want to be decking at slobs doesn't
[2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:40.800]  mean the rest of us have to be slaves to this William Benning top NSA whistle
[2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:47.200]  blower is our guest truth justice liberty on Twitter handle occupy earth
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:52.840]  now says do you know anything about Israel having direct access to NSA data
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:59.760]  I know some of the phone company caller ID systems are do go back to Israel and
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:03.720]  then when that goes back to the infiltration via contractors by other
[2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:10.880]  governments William Benny the there are of course the international relationships
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.320]  with and of course that's been published again by the Stoden material that
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:21.560]  they have they have relationships with with Israel but in general the any
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:28.560]  exchange of information between any of those parties is done separately it's
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:33.080]  not that's not no one has free access to one another database but those things
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:36.960]  are held kind of privately if they want to share something they put it off on a
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:42.680]  separate data set so that they can access that so it's not they don't have
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:48.880]  direct access sure we we just saw the hack of the Apple cloud I wonder if
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:54.320]  there's been hacks of the CIA or NSA that we don't know about well supposedly
[2:55:54.320 --> 2:55:59.800]  they had a a closed network you know that's that's what NSA claims they have
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:04.920]  and I think for the most part they they they do but you know it's really I mean
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:09.440]  how many things are certain in this life you know that's the problem they have
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:14.440]  very bad documentation of their network in other words that one of the main
[2:56:14.440 --> 2:56:19.680]  things you have to do to ensure cybersecurity is you've got to have
[2:56:19.680 --> 2:56:24.520]  good documentation of your network and and that will tell you how people could
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:29.480]  access any of your components inside your system and then you need to define
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:33.200]  what you want to protect and then you surround and build within your system a
[2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:39.000]  protection system you know covering that but those are two things that most
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:42.640]  than if the agencies in the US government do not have they don't have a good
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:48.480]  set of documentation on their network sure plus a lot of the chips no sorry
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:53.680]  go ahead but I mean the they had designed it that they wanted it closed
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:57:01.240]  now whether it's actively is another question okay absolutely yeah I can't
[2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:06.200]  really say for sure what what is what isn't there Tyler in California you're
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:11.520]  on the air go ahead hey there gentlemen I had a question for a mr. Benny and
[2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:14.880]  obviously I have probably a million questions like it's all just fine go
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:18.400]  ahead and throw your question out most important thing but the anniversary
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:24.720]  coming up of 9-11 I think that we need to look into what's going on with the
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:30.840]  possibility of government and I'd like to know mr. Benny's opinion sure what
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:36.360]  about coup d'etat by COG kind of a reverse valkyrie we know that FEMA and
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:40.640]  others have basically set up their own governing system in the name of COG but
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:45.200]  then that can be used to have a coup against the people well I of course
[2:57:45.200 --> 2:57:51.360]  would certainly not hope to hope that that would never happen I mean I do you
[2:57:51.360 --> 2:57:54.760]  have to do of course you have to have ways and means of protecting yourself
[2:57:54.760 --> 2:58:01.400]  that's for sure I mean and I believe that the for example the the Congress has
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:06.320]  a police force that guards them as then which in case of CIA if they really
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:11.080]  wanted to do something that I don't think would be effectively an effective
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:17.280]  deterrent but most most of the most of the people I know in CIA or any of these
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:20.600]  other organizations at least the people at the working level would never
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:24.560]  tolerate any kind of moves like that I mean these people are really most of
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:28.280]  them are very dedicated honest patriotic people they would never do that
[2:58:28.280 --> 2:58:33.000]  exactly they're compartmentalized though yeah it's the management of these
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:37.080]  agencies is a real problem absolutely when it's what how do we deal with that
[2:58:37.080 --> 2:58:41.440]  we're gonna come back in one minute and overdrive William Benny you are exposed
[2:58:41.440 --> 2:58:46.960]  facts.org is the whistleblower website with the other whistleblowers William
[2:58:46.960 --> 2:58:52.640]  Benny exposed facts.org I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it
[2:58:52.640 --> 2:58:57.320]  was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know
[2:58:57.320 --> 2:59:03.080]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so
[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:07.480]  many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a product being
[2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:12.880]  developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine
[2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:16.720]  that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you
[2:59:16.720 --> 2:59:21.320]  think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals
[2:59:21.320 --> 2:59:26.640]  and the results that I personally have had have been life-changing nobody else
[2:59:26.640 --> 2:59:31.440]  has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen this is
[2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:36.120]  innovating and the best part is it helps fund info wars.com the radio show the
[2:59:36.120 --> 2:59:39.840]  TV show the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas for
[2:59:39.840 --> 2:59:44.120]  a limited time experience the ancient power of survival shield X to take
[2:59:44.120 --> 2:59:48.720]  advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at info wars
[2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:55.960]  live.com coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex
[2:59:55.960 --> 3:00:09.440]  Jones broadcasting network network big brother mainstream media government
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:17.040]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[3:00:17.040 --> 3:00:34.560]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones very exciting talking to
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:38.200]  Mr. Benny he might be able to write a book soon and can't wait to have him on
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:42.400]  about that William Benny's our guest we're taking phone calls Lance in
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:48.080]  Washington as a question go ahead very quickly please yes mr. Benny thank you
[3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:52.840]  for being there for warrior for this planet your true patriot I was just
[3:00:52.840 --> 3:00:57.240]  wondering if the Obamacare and all the other agencies do they actually know
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:00.960]  what their right hand is doing you know the left and the right hand oh that's a
[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:04.840]  good question I mean Obamacare admittedly surveils all your medical records and
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:10.920]  it just seems like everything is some new data snoop yes I don't I don't believe
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:14.640]  they have it's not really it's such a mess I don't think they're really that
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:21.760]  coordinated but you know I think I think they they they've certainly they
[3:01:21.760 --> 3:01:25.480]  certainly are trying to do something but I think it's again a matter of
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:29.160]  collecting information on individuals that's really what their whole objective
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:35.240]  is so I you know it's a I just think they're they're they're not very
[3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:40.560]  confident individuals that doing this kind of activity I really don't I don't
[3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:46.160]  think they have the confidence to do it end prism on Twitter ask you this
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:50.000]  question he says is prism a weapon against the people in the United States
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:55.400]  how is it a weapon I would expand that question simply say is the NSA now
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:02:01.320]  basically operating as an enemy of freedom in this country in a corporate
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:07.760]  government management coup of the nation I would say they are they
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:11.160]  fundamentally if you look at it from a constitutional point that that's
[3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:17.480]  exactly what's happening all right there's your answer let's go to Woody in
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:22.560]  Washington one of the last college for William Benny go ahead yes sir Mr.
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:27.760]  Benny what's the extent of spying on our foreign leaders like Merkel I know some
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:31.680]  news came out about that when Merkel was being spied on and secondly are you
[3:02:31.680 --> 3:02:35.880]  familiar with the program main core that was instituted under the Reagan
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:40.320]  administration the I'm sorry could you say that he wants to know about main
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:47.920]  core main core no no I'm not familiar with that but but as an agenda as a
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:56.200]  general rule leadership is always a target so the leadership of basically
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:02:59.320]  any country in the world is always a target I think that's there their
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:04.160]  security will tell them that they are a target and and warn them to inch to
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:08.560]  ensure that sure they're they're covered and also provide the means to help
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:12.880]  them help them secure their communications I mean they even sure
[3:03:12.880 --> 3:03:16.160]  they even had Bush take his own toilet around with him because foreign
[3:03:16.160 --> 3:03:19.280]  governments wanted to get that yeah sure they want to know everything they
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:23.280]  possibly can't I mean it's not that's not unique to the United States every
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:27.600]  country every every every government every every every leader of the
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:32.040]  world is targeted all right one last caller sorry to Melissa we're going to
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:37.240]  see in Texas you're on the air with William Benning hey Alex hey William
[3:03:37.240 --> 3:03:41.160]  thanks for being there Alex by the way I'm a really good friend of Pat's hey
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:45.760]  mr. Benny do you feel it will ever get to a point where the fact that it's so
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:53.880]  easy for people to go in and manipulate data and possibly change up all sorts of
[3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:58.360]  facts on people's Facebook pages and social network sites where it just
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:04:02.720]  becomes so obvious to everybody that there could be plausible deniability by
[3:04:02.720 --> 3:04:06.120]  those people that they're actually spying on to come forward and say things
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:10.240]  so they're not blackmailed anymore it just seems to me that they're reaching a
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:14.560]  point of you know a critical mass and where they're hubris is almost sure
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:17.960]  that is really an excellent question we know they're using these systems to
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:21.920]  plant things won't that call into question the entire court system you
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:26.440]  name it absolutely I mean that's what they did against us they they fabricated
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:31.960]  evidence from factual evidence that they had assembled about us they fabricated
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:36.640]  a charge against us and that's that's basically what the unfortunate part for
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:40.760]  them is that I caught them at it that's the only reason I'm not in jail now by
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:44.320]  the way you're just a hero I just keep saying that you've got so much courage
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:48.400]  I want to get you back up as soon as you can to tell your story sir you just
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:52.000]  tirelessly are out there working for all of us traveling the country at your own
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:56.600]  expense I just can't wait till you get a book out God bless you William Benny
[3:04:56.600 --> 3:05:22.400]  I'll say bye to you during the break just amazing
