[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.000 --> 00:23.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.000 --> 00:36.000]  it is Patriots Day April 19th 2010 15 years after the federal black-hop bombing of the Oklahoma City building
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  the Alford P. Murrow building in Oklahoma City and fever pitch brainwashing is being engaged in
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  by the mainstream media by Bill Clinton and others saying gee I hope we don't have to have
[00:50.000 --> 00:58.000]  a terror attack to shut down these tea parties gee I hope they shut up gee I hope they stop criticizing
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  the banking takeover and the health care takeover because their criticism of the government is
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  going to cause terrorists to attack and when the terrorist attack it's going to be your fault
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  your fault America for thinking that you have a right to stand up for the Bill of Rights and
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  Constitution the last year and a half since Barack Obama got into office we've seen them beating
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  the drum that anyone that criticizes any policies as a racist a terrorist a white supremacist
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  that anybody that criticizes the government or even says 9-11 was an inside job wants to kill
[01:34.000 --> 01:43.000]  Obama with no evidence but what is that evidence of the prep phase preparing for staged terror
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  they have to prepare everyone's minds so when they stage it the people won't really remember
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  where they heard it was the fault of the tea parties but they will buy into it as if it's a
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  self-fulfilling prophecy so we know from all of the concerted propaganda intensifying the last
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  week to a crescendo that they are getting ready to stage terror events in this country and by
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  only getting the word out about this can we stop them they're preparing to blame Iran for a
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  nuke attack whether real or just fear mongering it's still psychological terrorism and they're
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  preparing for attacks on federal buildings police stations you name it and they've been having
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  drills the last few years even under Bush of police stations being attacked by disgruntled
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  veterans libertarians Ron Paul supporters gun owners anti-abortion activists again prepping
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  the police with this false narrative the people that criticize the government want to kill you
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  they're bad get ready for them to attack and they're having all this IED training the last
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  eight years and police departments around the country telling them the American people are
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  going to bomb them and they have drills at public schools and and of course in colleges where
[03:00.000 --> 03:08.000]  the militias attack the gun owners attack the homeschoolers attack the gun owners attack
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  creating this perception this artificial perception drilling the public that this imaginary
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  enemy is out there and is going to be violent another facet of this is infiltrating the T
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  parties with Nazi signs that's on one end of that then you have the government creating fake
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  Nazi groups to show up and demonize the patriot movement and attack other patriots that don't
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.000]  take the racial bait all of this is a clear concerted effort from saying that I don't
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  want government health care is racist to I don't want open borders is racist to saying
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  I don't want a bankrupt economy is racist you sit down and shut up and get palm palms out
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  and cheer lead the government or you are a terrorist racist this has been the message
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  and now they're all over the news saying my act report homeland security report they were
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  good the vets are terrorist the gun owners are terrorist domestic terrorists are as big
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  a threat or even bigger than LCI ADA they're going to hit any minute get ready oh my gosh
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  we tried to stop them but they wouldn't quit protesting their protesting caused it all of
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  you tea party people it's your fault you did it it's all your fault get ready get ready
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  I mean it's a hundred percent clear this is a huge operation going on and we're going to
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  cover it all today we've got Max Kaiser joining us coming up and Luke Radowski in the last
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  hour he had a nice discussion with Stephen Colbert of the Colbert report Colbert talked

[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  we're gonna have wide open phones today but first I want to discuss pulse flag nuke attacks
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  and other attacks they're planning to stage to blame the American people with 1-800-259-9231

[08:14.000 --> 08:24.000]  5 ladies and gentlemen, monday, april 19th 2010, bill clinton's been giving speeches and been on CNN saying
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.000]  gee he hopes there doesn't have to be a big terror attack to make the tea party shut up
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  and so they're framing anyone who criticizes any government policies as an un-american, violent, terrorist
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  and it's all over the news, they're saying 15 years after oklahoma city are the right wing terrorists going to head again
[08:46.000 --> 08:56.000]  and then quietly in the last really eight years they've been brainwashing police, brainwashing military, training them for conflict with the American people
[08:56.000 --> 09:04.000]  creating this false ledger, this false history, this pipe dream, this hallucination, this mirage
[09:04.000 --> 09:15.000]  and of course in the center of that demonizing talk radio, not just alex jones but rush limbaugh, michael savage, glenn beck and others
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  saying that it's going to be their fault when the terrorists strike
[09:20.000 --> 09:32.000]  and so rush limbaugh on friday really savaged bill clinton saying why are you hyping a non-existent threat
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  what are you planning and we have the democrats and their operatives caught dressing up as racist
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  red-handed it's even in the associated press and other major publications finally broke nationally last week
[09:45.000 --> 09:58.000]  that's only one little tributary, one little arm, one little capillary stream of the larger amazon river of false flag provocateur staged events
[09:58.000 --> 10:09.000]  it is an entire spectrum of this, this is what they do from saying anybody that has an opinion about government being too big you are a racist
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  anybody who goes out and protests big government you are a racist
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  that's meant to demonize, to create a chilling effect so the average yuppie won't get involved politically
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  but it's also meant to keep blacks and hispanics who are americans and who stand to lose underneath the new world order
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  and whose children are being enslaved to hear over and over again they're not welcome in protest or demonstrations
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  they're not welcome to be involved and of course it's not the tea party saying this
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  no, it's the mainstream media but there's another level of this
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  by fox news and sarah palin coming in and taking over the tea parties
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  it does make it a republican event
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  and so then that limits this being a more than bipartisan, a transpartisan
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  or a left right paradigm shattering populist constitutionalist movement against our real enemies
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  jp morgan chase, gulman sacks and the private shareholders of the new world order, private banking cartel system
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  and so this is what we're facing
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  they are dividing it seven ways to sunday
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  up one side and down the other from the top to the bottom from pillar to post
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.000]  and then they're preparing to demonize all demonstration, all criticism, all redress of grievance, all petitions
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  as invoking terror, they're saying everywhere
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  you criticize healthcare, government healthcare, you criticize banker bailouts, you criticize anything
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  you are a terrorist and when the terrorists blow up some more federal buildings
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  it is your fault, shame on you
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  now we have a history of government sponsored terror
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  we have our government and every other major government caught over and over again on record staging terror
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  then we look at who benefits from this
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  who would benefit from a federal building or two getting their facades blown off by a truck bomb
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  who would benefit from a police station being attacked
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  who would benefit from a school being attacked
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  who would benefit from a government building being attacked
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  who would benefit from a state capital being attacked
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  who would benefit the military industrial complex that is the control arm of the private offshore central banks
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  now conquering the united states criminally
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  this is the issue that we face as a society
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  we are here
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  there is a hostile criminal takeover taking place against our society
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  our entire way of life is being overturned
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  our entire bill of rights and constitution is being dismantled openly and publicly
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  they're openly coming in saying they're going to shut down freedom on the internet as we know it
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  they're openly saying they're going to go after talk radio and free speech and internet talk radio
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  the government is openly saying it's going to launch new wars against Iran
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  the government is openly saying they're going to take the pension funds
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  they're openly saying they're going to have a new banking re-regulation system
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  that gives more power to the federal regulators that are basically all Goldman Sachs alumni
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  to use regulators to shut down small regional local banks credit unions
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  and feed them into the large central banks
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  to erect taxes on local banks that are then paid in bailout money
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  to the large private megabanks
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  they're moving on every front
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  they've got their new carbon tax bill
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  introduced in the senate with taxes on every gallon of gas
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  taxes on refineries, taxes on everything you do
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  they're moving ahead with the EPA
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  announcing they're going to tax all greenhouse gas emissions
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  they don't even care if they don't have a bill
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  they're moving forward with the federalization of local police
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  they're moving forward with a giant drug war to shut down the cartels
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  that aren't laundering their money and paying their cut to the central banks in Mexico
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  they're letting the war spell over into the United States
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  they're making their move on every front right now
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  internationally and nationally
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  and they need to shut down and chill political speech
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  because our political speech is true
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  it is devastating the new world order
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  global government, they're at their critical point
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  they've announced their world government
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  they've announced it's the G20 global banking constitution over every nation
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  they've announced it's a planetary global governance
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  the denial is over and they're coming out openly
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  and saying that they're basically going to stage terror attacks
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  and blame them on us
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  it's just like Gary Hart
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  and it's in truth rising
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  three years ago was questioned by We Are Change in New York
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  he'd written a letter to Ahmed Denizide
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  they had posted it in the Huffington Post
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  and he said, look, our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  it staged the Maine
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  it has staged other events
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  don't think that our government won't stage something to invade you
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  you better do as you're told
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  I mean, he came right out and said, we staged terror attacks
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  and We Are Change talked to him and he basically admitted it on video
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  see, when the globalists speak
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  they're very intelligent and very sophisticated
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  there's multi-messages
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  to their own people there's a message
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  to those that are awake there's a message
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  and to the dumb down mass there's another message
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and so when Bill Clinton gives speeches
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  and goes on Wolf Blitzer and says twice
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  I hope there doesn't have to be a major terror attack in America
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  to make people stop criticizing the government
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  and he says, your criticism of government is going to cause this
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  that's the frame up
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  they're openly framing us ahead of time
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  they're getting ready
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  and a mainline talk show host
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  like Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck will come out
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  and tell the truth we can turn the tide against this
[16:13.000 --> 16:21.000]  Limbaugh is starting to get completely into the water
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  Michael Savage is up to his neck telling the truth now
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  openly saying Obama is going to stage massive terror attacks
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  Limbaugh is saying it looks like they're going to stage something
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  we don't know what
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  and then he ties it into the racist provocateurs
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  but doesn't go all the way
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  Hannity and Beck to my knowledge
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  you can call me and tell me if they have been saying it
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  but I haven't heard it
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  and I would hear about it if they did generally
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  they haven't
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  okay yes they work for the establishment
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  but there's different fissures in the establishment
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  there's a lot of people who are wealthy
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  who see themselves as right wing
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  who don't mind if the government stages a terror attack
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  to blame it on Muslims who invade the Middle East
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  but they are starting to realize that they're going to be targeted
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  in this new world order
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  and they can openly see the moves towards shutting down their free speech
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  and their little kingdoms
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  and so they're starting to tell the truth
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  and if we can get the listeners of this very important radio show
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  because our listeners are the most active out there
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  if you can call in to talk radio
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  local, national, syndicated, foreign
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  if you can post on your blogs
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  if you can get news articles out
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  if you can ring the alarm bell
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  and sound the alarm blow the trumpet now
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  I mean I've been telling you this for several years
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  they're building towards it
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  I can see the preparation
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  now in the last year it's been fever pitch
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  and it's just getting wilder and wilder
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  and coming to a head
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  where are we April 19th
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  now they're going to reintroduce McVeigh
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  reintroduce the domestic terrorists
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  and it could happen anytime in the next few weeks
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  they may wait a few months
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  I think this is the crescendo right now
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  of this orchestra piece but it may get even higher
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  I don't know
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  but this is about as big a crescendo
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  as I have ever seen
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  they're pulling out all of the stops
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  and you'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  and have no historical understanding
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  to not see how much danger we're in
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  as a society
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  now listen
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  there are two articles by Kurt Nemo
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  and Paul Watson that are absolutely vital
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  it is vital that both of these
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  get out to everyone you know
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  number one this just went up in the last 15 minutes
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  at prisonplanet.com
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  prisonplanet.com right now
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  establishment exploits OKC bombing victims
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  to push extremist threat propaganda
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  and this goes to the whole history government sponsored terror
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  and how they're setting it up in the demonization program
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  you read this one article
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  you send this to somebody
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  and they read this five page article full of links
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  with all the proof they will have a clear understanding
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  another article by Kurt Nemo
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  that came out Saturday
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  false flag prelude
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  Clinton launches demonization campaign
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  on OKC bombing anniversary
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  I'm going to read it again
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  false flag prelude
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  Clinton launches demonization campaign
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  on OKC bombing anniversary
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  this is a maximum red alert
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  maximum red alert
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  maximum red alert
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  maximum red alert
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  mayday
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  mayday
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  there is absolutely no
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  doubt that they have their finger
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  on the trigger of multiple false flags
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  including atomic weapons
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  in the west
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  they need to take over the society
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  they're moving on every front
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  they're not pulling punches this is a full on
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  globalist offensive against free humanity
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  and they are going to fail
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  if they don't stage a terror attack
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  I'm telling you they are launching the operation

[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  we all know when a company acts irresponsibly
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  is prudent
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  when the market becomes volatile
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  US Treasuries are a safe haven
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  but what do you do
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  when the US government over extends itself
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  and spends beyond its means
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  many investors are turning toward gold
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  as a common sense alternative

[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  of the globalist through their own words and documents
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  the new world order really is a tool
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  for addressing a new world of possibilities
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  it means all the world under their control
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  the United Nations would take over America
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  the trilateral commission would control the world
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  how men of power and influence
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  to establish an oppressive world government
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  I believe first of all
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  for the global financial system
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  global governance with the establishment of the G20

[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  in the united states
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  atomic
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  nuclear
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  thermonuclear
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  they are saying domestic groups are going to kill
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  the police and the military
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  while quietly demonizing police
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  and military to the feds
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  this is a setup
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  and I hope the police and military out there
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  are not weak minded
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  as I tell you over the last eight and a half years
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  since 9-11
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  that the entire grid of homeland security
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  was being developed for
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  the American people to suppress us
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  and then Fox News
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  and others
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  began to introduce white al-Qaeda
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  CNN
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  MSNBC
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  that oh yes there's all these American people
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  militia groups they are working with al-Qaeda
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  not only is al-Qaeda
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  fake
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  the militias are working with them
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  is even more asinine
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  but this is the move
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  and what did I say back in 1996-97-98
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  what did I put in my first film
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  about Oklahoma City
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  we know the federal government brought
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  under Bush 3000
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  2000 plus under clinton
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  5000 plus iraqi republican
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  guard who had been trained by the CIA
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  in the 80s when Saddam was our ally
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  after the Gulf War they brought him in
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  and they have been involved
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  in other events
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  that's in the LA Times the FBI's reported that
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  in the first few days
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  I've interviewed the local police
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  there's video they were staking them out
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  the week before it happened they were with
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  McVeigh
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  but they didn't go with that story
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  they like to have different stories
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  they were seriously thinking about saying
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  Muslim extremist working with the American people
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  so they've been
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  fashioning this idea
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  and preparing it as a story
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  to use to turn the military
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  and police loose
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  against anyone criticizing government
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  and now you've seen them do it
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  now you've seen them move this
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  from the back burner to the front
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  burner and they've got the flame
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  up on high
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  separately domestic terrorists
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  as big a threat as al-qaeda
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  says FBI head Robert Mueller
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  15 years after the Oklahoma City bombing
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  the specter of domestic terrorism
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  has returned
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  to haunt the Obama administration
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  oh but it's going to help them
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  their approval rating will go up if there's a big attack
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  Clinton told USA Today
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  on Air Force One in 96 that he
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  got his reelection
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  because of the bombing
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  so 15 years after the
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Oklahoma City bombing the specter of domestic
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  terrorism has returned to haunt
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  the Obama administration with a warning
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  from the FBI that homegrown
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  and lone wolf extremist now
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  represent a serious threat
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  as al-qaeda and its affiliates
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  so now you
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  are al-qaeda America
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  the American people you are now
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  al-qaeda now what
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  they've been teaching the cops for 8 years secretly
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  is out in the open
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  because they're getting ready to go operational
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  with this demonization program
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  the warning from the FBI
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  director Robert Mueller came as the
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  former president
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  Clinton drew parallels between
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  Oklahoma City tragedy and a recent upsurge
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  in anti-government rhetoric
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  you see it's our fault
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  we're not just racist folks
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  we're terrorists
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  while American
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  television audiences heard Tim
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  McVay the Oklahoma City bomber described
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  the absolute rage that drove
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  him to plan an attack that killed
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  168 men women and children
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  these supposed audio tapes
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  then we've got all these
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  separate affidavits from McVay and Terry
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Nichols saying they were US government agents
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  and McVay's quote it's going to come out
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  the US government did this
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  they don't want you to read that
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  an FBI spokesman told the Times
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  yesterday that Mr. Mueller was referring
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  to right wing extremist groups and anti-government
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  militias as well as American Islamists
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  and his testimony to the Senate committee
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  that must
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  approve an 8.3 billion
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  budget for the FBI
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  last month federal agents arrested
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  nine members the Christian militia based in Michigan
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  I called that out in August of last year
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  they were going to set them up
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  calling itself a hitari
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  and now it's come out they had an audio tape
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  saying yeah we may have to fight the government someday
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  it's out of control
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  and again they bust them to create this cut out
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  of oh look
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  they're terrorists see gun owners
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  they have been charged with plotting to murder
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  local police with a stash of guns
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  knives and grenades and see that whole story
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  is again meant to scare cops
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  get them against the American people
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  since the passage of President Obama's health reforms
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  the FBI has also made the arrest in Seattle
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  and San Francisco after death threats
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  were sent to Democratic senators
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  and see they use that probably real
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  threats by idiots
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  to again create this
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  backdrop of oh my gosh the terrorists
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  are about to strike we've met the terrorists
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  and it's the American people
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  and they go on to say expressing
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  dissatisfaction with the government
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  creates terrorism you don't criticize
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  anything you sit down and you
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  shut up and you let Goldman Sachs take
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  your pension fund and they're going to
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  have this fake investigation the civil
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  investigation and slap a five million
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  dollar fine or something on Goldman Sachs
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  you can keep the trillions one of your
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  employees will go on probation
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  and we'll get five million
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  there you've been punished
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  we're on the march

[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  terror attack
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  and i'm repeating that because
[35:35.000 --> 35:18.000]  we have seen the openley
[35:25.000 --> 35:37.640]  sci-op for anyone tuned in
[35:37.640 --> 35:39.640]  anyone aware anyone informed
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.920]  This is ridiculously obvious.
[35:43.920 --> 35:51.560]  We've seen all the preparation, psychological, military, physical, economic.
[35:51.560 --> 35:55.460]  They want to use Homeland Security and the Patriot Act against the American people.
[35:55.460 --> 35:56.960]  It was written for that.
[35:56.960 --> 35:59.380]  Read Section 802 of the Patriot Act.
[35:59.380 --> 36:01.860]  Read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[36:01.860 --> 36:06.440]  Read the Federal Governors Association, the Governor's Council.
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.680]  Read the Belligerent Act in the Senate, saying that the military can direct the arrest of
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.440]  any U.S. citizens for any reason for intelligence purposes or for any reason designated by the
[36:16.440 --> 36:22.920]  President or his designates, and it says you can be arrested, give an enhanced interrogation,
[36:22.920 --> 36:30.360]  that's terrorism, that's torture, that's torture.
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.160]  And an act of Congress is the only thing that can release you from prison.
[36:34.160 --> 36:37.280]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[36:37.280 --> 36:44.520]  I mean, do you understand the magnitude of what is openly going on here?
[36:44.520 --> 36:46.440]  They're taking over on every front.
[36:46.440 --> 36:53.600]  We are being criminally consolidated.
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.280]  We are being completely overtaken right now.
[36:58.280 --> 37:02.560]  They know you're angry, they knew you would get upset, they knew when they did this, you
[37:02.560 --> 37:08.160]  would speak out and try to take the states back peacefully, lawfully, legally, constitutional
[37:08.160 --> 37:12.040]  system.
[37:12.040 --> 37:19.040]  And so they've been quietly building and preparing terror attacks and bust to make it look like
[37:19.040 --> 37:23.960]  the American people are terrorists, and now they're openly saying you criticize the government,
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.200]  you are seditious, you are a traitor, you are a criminal, you're going to bomb federal
[37:28.200 --> 37:29.200]  buildings.
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.120]  I mean, you think it's bad to have Democrats dressed up like Nazis and have the Congressional
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.400]  Black Caucus lying about being spit on and called the n-word in that staged event.
[37:39.400 --> 37:44.280]  That's a microcosm of the mindset of government, the Black Caucus going out in the middle of
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.440]  the Tea Party trying to start a fight.
[37:48.440 --> 37:52.160]  Trying to keep black people from joining the rest of the American people, trying to keep
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.480]  us against each other, instead of going up against the New World Order in the Info War.
[37:56.480 --> 37:57.480]  How despicable is that?
[37:57.480 --> 37:59.680]  Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[37:59.680 --> 38:02.880]  The globalists will kill a million Iraqis, they'll blow a federal building up, you better
[38:02.880 --> 38:05.440]  believe it.
[38:05.440 --> 38:10.040]  This government will inject black men with syphilis in the Tuskegee experiment, you better
[38:10.040 --> 38:14.040]  believe they'll shoot some black people and blame it on the Tea Parties.
[38:14.040 --> 38:18.200]  This government in thousands of tests, many of which killed our own troops, would spray
[38:18.200 --> 38:26.200]  uranium, plutonium, and nerve gas on our own troops, killing them just in drills.
[38:26.200 --> 38:32.760]  When you think anybody's safe, all the lies, all the criminality, look how bold they are.
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.520]  All these grassroots conservatives and libertarians are going, man, it's over for them in November.
[38:37.520 --> 38:39.560]  What do they think they're doing?
[38:39.560 --> 38:42.120]  Well, they've got all the bases covered.
[38:42.120 --> 38:47.800]  They've got the Republican leadership, who's now posing as patriots, set to go in, they've
[38:47.800 --> 38:53.360]  got that covered, but they are worried about real statesmen and leaders taking over the
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.280]  states peaceably, so they're going to blow stuff up and blame that on you, blame that
[38:57.280 --> 38:58.280]  on me.
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.520]  They're going to launch some new wars so politically you'll shut up and do what the
[39:02.520 --> 39:08.520]  government says, circle the wagons because the country's at war.
[39:08.520 --> 39:14.000]  Only by understanding their game plan can we stop them, only by growing up and admitting
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  to ourselves how dire our straits are and by getting, I mean, banner hangs on highways,
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.560]  calling it a talk radio, starting your own websites today, doing your own YouTube videos.
[39:24.560 --> 39:26.760]  You don't know how to get somebody at work to show you.
[39:26.760 --> 39:29.160]  You need to be ranting about this.
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.200]  In fact, get me Rob Jacobson in here.
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.480]  He was sick over the weekend and he just got back and he was asking what I wanted him to
[39:37.480 --> 39:38.480]  do.
[39:38.480 --> 39:42.360]  We're going to shoot a YouTube video that I'm going to post at the end of the show where
[39:42.360 --> 39:47.400]  I put out a call to arms in the info war to expose the false flag attack before they
[39:47.400 --> 39:48.400]  carry it out.
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.360]  And we may have hours, we may have days, we may have weeks, and if we get the word out,
[39:54.360 --> 39:58.920]  we can stop them from doing this.
[39:58.920 --> 40:03.080]  But all of you out there that think, boy, Obama screwed up, boy, he's arrogant up there
[40:03.080 --> 40:07.000]  saying we should thank him for all the tax increases, man, it's over for him.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.200]  He's a puppet.
[40:09.200 --> 40:11.720]  And no, it's not over for him.
[40:11.720 --> 40:14.800]  Michael Savage, love him or hating, is politically astute.
[40:14.800 --> 40:21.960]  And what did he say, what, back in last April, pull up the date of that Reichstag speech
[40:21.960 --> 40:22.960]  for me.
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.000]  You can just pull it up on YouTube to get the data and we have it saved.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.440]  Where he said, mark my words, the government is going to stage a terror attack or Reichstag
[40:30.440 --> 40:31.440]  then.
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.440]  He's not stupid.
[40:32.440 --> 40:33.880]  He knows what they're going to do.
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.200]  He knows that when government does things that are unpopular and illegal and have got
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.960]  foreign banks robbing everybody, we're in a real depression, 22% unemployment, it's only
[40:42.960 --> 40:43.960]  getting worse.
[40:43.960 --> 40:46.920]  Now they're saying the stimulus didn't work, like we told you a year and a half ago, it
[40:46.920 --> 40:48.080]  wasn't designed to work.
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.120]  It was designed to mask cash in the bank's hands, the big banks, so they could consolidate
[40:52.120 --> 40:56.560]  the smaller banks and shut down Main Street and then come in again and say, there will
[40:56.560 --> 40:59.960]  be no economic recovery if you don't do this.
[40:59.960 --> 41:01.360]  And that's in the news.
[41:01.360 --> 41:03.040]  That's another talking point.
[41:03.040 --> 41:08.160]  You better give us trillions more or we're going to have a depression.
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.240]  When we've been in a depression the last two years.
[41:11.240 --> 41:16.760]  That's their one trick, terrorism, psychological terrorism.
[41:16.760 --> 41:20.200]  How did they get the banker take over bill known as the banker bailout passed saying
[41:20.200 --> 41:24.640]  there'd be blood in the streets, war in the streets, total collapse, total depression
[41:24.640 --> 41:29.920]  if you didn't give the banks all that power.
[41:29.920 --> 41:32.920]  And for three or four days, Congress refused to do it because they were having thousand
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.800]  to one phone calls or more, polls showed 99% against it.
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.480]  And so they came out and said, we're going to have a complete and total depression.
[41:42.480 --> 41:45.440]  It's from March 17, 2009.
[41:45.440 --> 41:52.320]  They said we're going to have a complete depression and the stock market fell by a record rate
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.720]  and then the Congress panicked and did what they said.
[41:54.720 --> 41:56.880]  That's terrorism.
[41:56.880 --> 42:01.200]  Now they're saying, don't protest us or we're going to say you're white supremacist.
[42:01.200 --> 42:02.280]  What does that have to do with anything?
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.760]  It's clearly fake and false and staged and they've got their operatives everywhere doing
[42:06.760 --> 42:07.760]  it.
[42:07.760 --> 42:11.400]  They're saying, I sure hope we don't need a terror attack to make these tea parties
[42:11.400 --> 42:12.760]  shut up.
[42:12.760 --> 42:17.560]  I sure hope you don't cause this tea parties by doing what Americans are supposed to do,
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.800]  get out and protest and demonstrate and take their state legislatures back to say no to
[42:21.800 --> 42:24.840]  the feds that have been hijacked by criminals.
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.400]  We don't have a country.
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.800]  You know, they tell you, I'll be patriotic.
[42:28.800 --> 42:29.800]  Do what the federal government says.
[42:29.800 --> 42:32.880]  Well, number one, that's not patriotic, but this isn't even a federal government.
[42:32.880 --> 42:38.480]  It's a bunch of whores bought and paid for by foreign interest.
[42:38.480 --> 42:40.000]  This is the big assault, okay?
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.560]  You think 9-11 was a big assault.
[42:41.560 --> 42:43.160]  You think Oklahoma City was a big assault.
[42:43.160 --> 42:48.360]  I'm telling you that every major mega attack gets bigger by an order of magnitude.
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.200]  What's bigger than skyscrapers blowing up in front of you?
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.800]  Three skyscrapers blowing up in the middle of Lower Manhattan.
[42:57.800 --> 42:59.800]  What's bigger than that?
[42:59.800 --> 43:02.880]  A big fat dirty bomb, but that may not be big enough for these people.
[43:02.880 --> 43:04.800]  They want a hardcore revolution.
[43:04.800 --> 43:09.120]  They want to get the police and military so scared they'll go out and arrest Alex Jones
[43:09.120 --> 43:13.160]  and arrest other people and Rush Limbaugh have a heart attack.
[43:13.160 --> 43:19.080]  And Michael Savage will get a one week brain tumor.
[43:19.080 --> 43:20.240]  They will wipe us out.
[43:20.240 --> 43:25.440]  They will kill us, ladies and gentlemen, they'll pull me over, shoot me up with heroin and
[43:25.440 --> 43:27.760]  kill a hooker and throw me in a hotel room.
[43:27.760 --> 43:29.760]  That's the kind of stuff these people do.
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.800]  They don't play games.
[43:31.800 --> 43:36.920]  They've dominated the world because they're ruthless and cunning and smart and powerful.
[43:36.920 --> 43:41.000]  They've taken over the planet because they're the most duplicitous, bloodthirsty killers
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.680]  the world has ever seen.
[43:44.680 --> 43:48.240]  They're taking over America like they took over Russia, like they took over China.
[43:48.240 --> 43:49.840]  They plan to do that here.
[43:49.840 --> 43:51.520]  There's no doubt about it.
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.960]  I'm going to stop ranting and go to your phone calls here.
[43:56.960 --> 44:01.000]  It's just this article, Government Prepared to Stage, Domestic Terror Attack.
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  It's up on infowars.com, Government Preparing to Stage, Domestic Terror Attack.
[44:05.000 --> 44:12.800]  It is so important to get this article out to everyone you know now, now.
[44:12.800 --> 44:15.920]  I mean, what's stopping you nationwide?
[44:15.920 --> 44:17.760]  You own a pool business.
[44:17.760 --> 44:19.520]  You own a construction business.
[44:19.520 --> 44:22.040]  You own a chain of restaurants.
[44:22.040 --> 44:23.320]  You are a doctor.
[44:23.320 --> 44:24.400]  You're a lawyer.
[44:24.400 --> 44:25.400]  You're a teacher.
[44:25.400 --> 44:29.960]  But I'm talking about folks who aren't just, you know, an auto mechanic going home to three
[44:29.960 --> 44:34.800]  kids working 14 hours a day and too exhausted, but you should do it too.
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.160]  But all of you yuppies that have got time to take 25-mile bike rides on the weekend
[44:39.160 --> 44:43.480]  and got time to go rock climbing and got time to take your kids camping every weekend or
[44:43.480 --> 44:47.160]  take your kids fly fishing, hey, that's wonderful, and I wish I was doing that too.
[44:47.160 --> 44:50.240]  Believe me, I wish I was taking 25-mile bike rides.
[44:50.240 --> 44:51.440]  I wish I was mountain climbing.
[44:51.440 --> 44:52.760]  I wish I was camping.
[44:52.760 --> 44:54.920]  I wish I was driving around the country in RV.
[44:54.920 --> 44:56.760]  Okay, I understand that.
[44:56.760 --> 45:02.560]  But there's no future and there's no time left if you don't go to a local sign store
[45:02.560 --> 45:08.520]  and have a 20-foot banner made, 9-Eleven was an inside job, infowars.com, or Obama's gonna
[45:08.520 --> 45:13.520]  stage a terror attack.
[45:13.520 --> 45:17.840]  You know, whatever you come up with, we don't have time to screw around.
[45:17.840 --> 45:22.640]  You better take Fall of the Republic, an invisible empire, and police state the rise of FEMA,
[45:22.640 --> 45:26.720]  and you better buy 1,000 blank DVDs and a big duplicator, and you better make copies
[45:26.720 --> 45:29.320]  and you better get it out to everybody.
[45:29.320 --> 45:30.960]  We got a chance to beat these people.
[45:30.960 --> 45:33.720]  We're kicking their butts in and they're gonna blow some stuff up.
[45:33.720 --> 45:34.720]  You understand?
[45:34.720 --> 45:35.720]  That's what they do.
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.760]  You've seen all the preparation.
[45:40.760 --> 45:47.280]  It's 100% now, 100% and the sky's the limit for these people that they're gonna start
[45:47.280 --> 45:48.720]  pulling a bunch of stuff.
[45:48.720 --> 45:54.440]  Everything you've seen the last few months is the buildup, the Pentagon, Joe Stack, Atari,
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.720]  the underwear bomber, every one of them staged up one side and down the other.
[45:58.720 --> 46:00.840]  That's just to get it in your mind, get it in your head.
[46:00.840 --> 46:04.920]  They've been introduced in White Al Qaeda for five years.
[46:04.920 --> 46:05.920]  They're gonna make their move.
[46:05.920 --> 46:06.920]  They're gonna kill cops.
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.200]  They're gonna blow up federal buildings.
[46:08.200 --> 46:09.880]  They're gonna do all sorts of stuff.
[46:09.880 --> 46:11.480]  And we're in a red level emergency.
[46:11.480 --> 46:15.200]  Now here's the good news.
[46:15.200 --> 46:21.480]  Burt Haskell and his wife, both prominent, well-to-do lawyers, are 9-11 truthers.
[46:21.480 --> 46:24.200]  And they know what to look for and we've got at least half the public that questions
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.160]  the official story and our people are in the federal government, they're in the military,
[46:28.160 --> 46:31.960]  they're in airports, they're in government facilities, they're in private sector.
[46:31.960 --> 46:35.440]  Our people are everywhere.
[46:35.440 --> 46:40.200]  And we need our people to keep your eyes open for events.
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.680]  And if you see suspicious looking guys with a truck, you don't let them see you.
[46:44.680 --> 46:47.480]  You videotape them, you videotape their car.
[46:47.480 --> 46:50.640]  Because the next time the feds blow something up, they're not gonna be able to confiscate
[46:50.640 --> 46:51.640]  all the videos.
[46:51.640 --> 46:52.640]  You're gonna be able to upload it.
[46:52.640 --> 46:55.880]  That's why Obama's got cybersecurity to shut down the web when he wants, but that won't
[46:55.880 --> 46:57.840]  stop us.
[46:57.840 --> 47:01.800]  And Kurt Haskell was on that plane and saw the feds get the underwear bomber on the plane
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.400]  and protecting him and they tried to lie about it and it came out a month later, it was all
[47:05.400 --> 47:06.640]  true.
[47:06.640 --> 47:07.640]  So remember that.
[47:07.640 --> 47:10.200]  That's the one reason the globalists may not pull the trigger.
[47:10.200 --> 47:15.040]  If they get enough of an NSA buzz going, and enough buzz going in the government about
[47:15.040 --> 47:20.240]  false flag, and police officers, look, you better be looking not for a militia person
[47:20.240 --> 47:23.960]  and not for an Arab, or they may be using people dressed up like that.
[47:23.960 --> 47:27.360]  You better be watching the feds.
[47:27.360 --> 47:31.320]  And the feds, you better be watching yourself and private intelligence agencies and private
[47:31.320 --> 47:34.400]  corporate mercs.
[47:34.400 --> 47:35.400]  Everybody.
[47:35.400 --> 47:38.480]  I mean, when I was driving to work today, I was watching everything.
[47:38.480 --> 47:44.920]  It doesn't mean that there's one chance at a million that I'm going to catch something,
[47:44.920 --> 47:51.880]  but I'm scanning, I'm looking.
[47:51.880 --> 47:56.000]  I saw a truck pulled up beside a gas station, had a bunch of pallets on it, looked like
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.360]  fertilizer, I pulled up and looked at it and it wasn't fertilizer, it was concrete.
[48:00.360 --> 48:02.000]  Doesn't matter.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.920]  I am scanning, I am looking, I am watching, and I know who to watch.
[48:07.920 --> 48:13.240]  And everybody else needs to be doing this right now, because the minute they blow a federal
[48:13.240 --> 48:17.280]  building up, you have got to burn rubber to the scene.
[48:17.280 --> 48:20.160]  You've got to record all the local news.
[48:20.160 --> 48:23.760]  You have got to have video cameras on you at all times.
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.760]  You have got to be watching everywhere.
[48:28.760 --> 48:31.280]  It's a life and death situation.
[48:31.280 --> 48:36.360]  And you've got to all make YouTube and other videos where you go out and do your own rant
[48:36.360 --> 48:39.320]  about the government preparing to stage a false flag terror attack.
[48:39.320 --> 48:43.400]  So there's thousands of these videos, and so it's on record that we knew what they
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.840]  were doing, that we may be able to back them off, but right now it looks like they're
[48:47.840 --> 48:48.840]  committed.
[48:48.840 --> 48:53.920]  Bill Clinton, I just hope there doesn't have to be a terror attack to stop these tea parties.
[48:53.920 --> 48:54.920]  They're creating the hate.
[48:54.920 --> 48:55.920]  They're going to do it.
[48:55.920 --> 48:56.920]  It's their fault.
[48:56.920 --> 48:58.880]  They're criticizing the government.
[48:58.880 --> 48:59.880]  It's causing a big...
[48:59.880 --> 49:01.760]  And they've got the internet now, Wolf.
[49:01.760 --> 49:05.480]  They've got the internet now, Wolf, and they're all communicating with each other, and it's
[49:05.480 --> 49:06.480]  bad, Wolf.
[49:06.480 --> 49:12.440]  I hope we don't have to do this, and Wolf, far and operative that he is, just, you know,
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.160]  just a massage agent, just openly working for the Israeli government, just nods, and
[49:17.160 --> 49:18.160]  I know, Clinton.
[49:18.160 --> 49:19.160]  I know.
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.640]  It's what we have to do.
[49:20.640 --> 49:23.080]  There's a little message for all those in the know.
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.600]  They're just out there in the open talking about it like we're a bunch of idiots, and
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.120]  we don't see exactly what they're talking about.
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.640]  I'm real sad about it.
[49:32.640 --> 49:38.520]  I hope it doesn't have to happen, Wolf, before these people stop what they're doing.
[49:38.520 --> 49:45.040]  I didn't have sex with that woman, either, but let me bite my bottom lip.
[49:45.040 --> 49:47.200]  I'm so concerned right now.
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.640]  It's making me nauseated just thinking about him.
[49:51.640 --> 49:53.200]  So there's the telegraphed message.
[49:53.200 --> 49:54.200]  They're getting ready.
[49:54.200 --> 49:55.760]  They're getting ready right now.
[49:55.760 --> 49:57.960]  They probably got their hands on the plungers.
[49:57.960 --> 50:01.520]  They're getting ready right now.
[50:01.520 --> 50:04.400]  Because they got to shut up the American people.
[50:04.400 --> 50:05.400]  I got news for you, globalists.
[50:05.400 --> 50:08.400]  I know you've got your psych warfare chiefs and experts looking over it.
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.200]  A lot of your insiders are telling you that this isn't going to go the way you think.
[50:12.200 --> 50:16.520]  That's why they've been demonizing 9-11-Truth so hard the last two years, more than before,
[50:16.520 --> 50:22.120]  because they've got to demonize anybody who talks about terror being government nine
[50:22.120 --> 50:25.040]  times out of 10.
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.400]  And they've also been linking 9-11-Truth to terrorism, which is asinine.
[50:30.400 --> 50:33.680]  They're exposing that it is the government, or elements of the government, or private
[50:33.680 --> 50:39.520]  intelligence groups, corporate merc groups.
[50:39.520 --> 50:46.760]  And so we've got a chance to stop them if we get the word out.
[50:46.760 --> 50:47.760]  But you can see them.
[50:47.760 --> 50:54.040]  They're doing everything they can, 24-7 on all fronts, getting ready, getting ready,
[50:54.040 --> 50:55.320]  getting ready.
[50:55.320 --> 50:56.320]  Are you ready?
[50:56.320 --> 50:58.480]  And what are you doing to stop them?
[50:58.480 --> 51:01.480]  What are you doing to get the word out?
[51:01.480 --> 51:03.800]  Oh, my sinuses.
[51:03.800 --> 51:05.960]  They feel like they'll explode.
[51:05.960 --> 51:06.960]  Sinus pressure.
[51:06.960 --> 51:08.360]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.

[51:09.360 --> 51:13.120]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back
[51:13.120 --> 51:15.560]  and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.

[51:16.560 --> 51:17.560]  Well, you're not alone.
[51:17.560 --> 51:20.760]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[51:20.760 --> 51:25.920]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.

[52:19.280 --> 52:21.760]  That means all the world under their control.
[52:21.760 --> 52:24.520]  The United Nations would take over America.
[52:24.520 --> 52:27.840]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:27.840 --> 52:32.760]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:32.760 --> 52:35.280]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:35.280 --> 52:39.760]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[52:39.760 --> 52:40.760]  financial system.
[52:40.760 --> 52:43.640]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:43.640 --> 52:47.320]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.

[54:36.320 --> 54:37.320]  White House today.
[54:37.320 --> 54:43.320]  The globalists can't stand to see the people standing up and saying we're not slaves.
[54:43.320 --> 54:49.000]  Their anti-gun movement is in trouble, their carbon tax movement is in trouble, their wars
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.400]  are in trouble, the banks robbing the people are in deep trouble, so they've got a staged
[54:55.400 --> 55:00.080]  terror attacks to play the part of victims and scare the more timid souls out there into
[55:00.080 --> 55:05.320]  serving their new world order and crouching down and licking the hand that feeds them,
[55:05.320 --> 55:07.400]  that binds them and chains.
[55:07.400 --> 55:09.560]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[55:09.560 --> 55:12.280]  I'm going to take a ton of calls all the way to the bottom of the next hour, then I got
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.640]  a bunch of other news on Goldman Sachs, the banking takeover, the environmental, all of
[55:16.640 --> 55:19.560]  it, it's all coming up, and then Max Kaiser.
[55:19.560 --> 55:21.600]  Robert in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[55:21.600 --> 55:22.600]  Thanks for holding.
[55:22.600 --> 55:24.400]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[55:24.400 --> 55:31.120]  The idea that I came up with was compiling a Facebook of the New World Order.
[55:31.120 --> 55:34.920]  They've been so busy with all that they're doing, they've forgotten to let us know who
[55:34.920 --> 55:38.160]  they are and exactly what they're doing.
[55:38.160 --> 55:45.400]  I think it would be helpful to be able to express our concern with all of that.
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.040]  Well we know who the globalist are, it's the top banking heads, it's the Rockefellers,
[55:49.040 --> 55:55.960]  the Rothschilds, it's less than 50 big families at the top of the capstones, Microsoft companies
[55:55.960 --> 55:56.960]  like IBM.
[55:56.960 --> 56:04.440]  I understand that, but I mean specifically who they are and what their phone number
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.600]  would be, what their address is, what vehicle they drive, all that different type of thing
[56:09.600 --> 56:16.360]  because they live in ivory towers somewhat insulated from normal everyday people, but
[56:16.360 --> 56:20.800]  they mix with us and they come in and out and people are unaware that the person they
[56:20.800 --> 56:28.440]  may be on the soccer field with is actually in cahoots to help eliminate them, their children
[56:28.440 --> 56:29.440]  and so forth.
[56:29.440 --> 56:32.960]  Well they are afraid of that and I think what we are changing, others have done, the
[56:32.960 --> 56:38.320]  tea parties have done, the real tea parties that have been around for almost four years,
[56:38.320 --> 56:42.080]  the new Sarah Palin party that they say has been around for one year and the news gives
[56:42.080 --> 56:45.760]  the birth date every day on every channel to tell you that the Republicans founded it
[56:45.760 --> 56:47.280]  and run it.
[56:47.280 --> 56:51.040]  Everywhere Al Gore goes he's being hounded, everywhere Bill Clinton goes, Carl Rove is
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.640]  going to be at UT tonight, in fact can I have that article and I know a lot of people are
[56:54.640 --> 56:58.120]  going to be there to ask him serious questions, I hope it's civil, I hope people get up to
[56:58.120 --> 57:03.720]  the microphone, I hope they take questions, so everywhere they go they're being hounded
[57:03.720 --> 57:11.280]  and their minions are being hounded but the globalists are being identified and we are
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.200]  documenting who they are, I mean in Obama deception and in end game, we show Bilderberg
[57:16.200 --> 57:20.040]  group members arriving and their names and we've published Bilderberg group list, it
[57:20.040 --> 57:24.640]  doesn't get any more elite than that, Carl Rove to speak at UT, Austin Monday evening,
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.120]  former White House deputy chief of staff, Carl Rove will give a lecture at the University
[57:28.120 --> 57:33.240]  of Texas tonight, Rove is expected to talk about his time at the White House as former
[57:33.240 --> 57:38.240]  President George W. Bush's top political advisor, Rove will also share his analysis of issues
[57:38.240 --> 57:41.920]  in the nation currently facing including health care, the economy and protection of individual
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.320]  liberties, see now that they're out of power, here's another one, George W. Bush Institute
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.920]  and Freedom House to convene freedom activist, human rights and internet experts to assess
[57:51.920 --> 57:57.040]  global cyber dissonant movement, so Bush helps set up cyber security, Obama's continuing
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.360]  it, Carl Rove helped push the big police state and now they're posing as the protectors
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.520]  of our liberty, that way when they get back in power, they can continue to butcher it,
[58:05.520 --> 58:09.400]  just like Obama stood up as the protector of liberty against torture, the Patriot Act
[58:09.400 --> 58:13.960]  and all this, when he was out of power, when he got into power, it's just totally sick
[58:13.960 --> 58:17.160]  how they double team us, but I appreciate your call Robert, we're going to come back
[58:17.160 --> 58:23.160]  in 70 seconds and talk to Ron, Kevin, Curtis, Joe and others, but I certainly hope everybody
[58:23.160 --> 58:30.200]  gets down there tonight, the UT, we need to look up, it says the event is free and open
[58:30.200 --> 58:36.000]  to the public, so we need all the Patriots to get there early, all the Patriots need
[58:36.000 --> 58:44.000]  to show up at 5.30, 6 o'clock and get the best seats on the front row.

[59:14.800 --> 59:18.880]  will there be any food, will it make your children sick, if there's a quarantine and

[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:20.160]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:28.160]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.040]  We are now into hour number two, thank you so much for joining us, open phones right
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.200]  now, the government clearly is preparing to frame the American people for terror attacks,
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.920]  that's 100% clear, they're saying the biggest threat now is domestic groups, this is how
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.560]  they want to shut down political dissent in this country, we're taking your calls, I'm
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.960]  going to get into the banking takeover part two and a lot more in this hour, but right
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.600]  now let's talk to Ron in Texas, Ron you're on the air.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.560]  Alex, thank you, I want to call attention to all the people in Nevada to be very vigilant
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:05.120]  in what's going on within the next three months, because it's going to happen, it may be a
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.400]  new, it may not, but it's going to happen in Nevada.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.600]  I'm going to get into that, I mean, the, the feds were going to have a secret unannounced
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:22.720]  nuke attack in multiple areas of Nevada, especially Las Vegas, and then that got out out of a
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.080]  city website, now FEMA's ordering websites to take it down.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:33.360]  And the publicintelligence.net is the website where those documents were leaked, there's
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.040]  also the NLE 10 training manual, which I sent to you on your showtips.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:46.680]  Yes, we posted it last week and again yesterday with articles up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.040]  Yeah, but it's going to break everything down.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.160]  The possibility that I see it's not going to be probably in a highly populated area,
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.240]  it's going to be more toward the, what they consider the Shoshone, Western Shoshone area,
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.200]  where there was actually, historically, nuclear testing done there.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.920]  But they're going to try and relate that possibly to some sort of in south of the border insurgency
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.440]  of a improvised nuclear device, that's what IND is in those documents.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:25.320]  That's right, they have been hyping that nukes are being brought across in Nevada and Arizona
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:31.040]  for a long time, and now we learn secret FEMA documents of a drill of improvised nuclear
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:37.760]  device going off there, and now FEMA's freaking out saying get these NLE-010 off everybody's
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.880]  websites and even trying to tell Christian Science Monitor and others not to talk about
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]  it.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.320]  So they're definitely upset for a reason, and this fits into, right on time, Obama's
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.640]  fear mongering about the number one threat being a nuke attack by a terror group inside
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.480]  the U.S., and the FBI says that could be a domestic group.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.280]  I mean, how much more cut and dried does this have to get?
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:06.960]  I don't know, Alex, it's so obvious, because what happened today 15 years ago was my 9-11.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:13.200]  I was there on the ground, and I helped pull those 19 children out, so seeing this is just
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.080]  too obvious for people to miss.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.440]  We can't get sidetracked, we need to respond to the red alert and let everybody know what's
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440]  going on.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.040]  Tell folks what you were doing 15 years ago in Oklahoma City.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:31.760]  I was working as clearing out the rubble and doing search and rescue.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.680]  And of course, you know, they killed some police officers and others that exposed it
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.920]  was an inside job who were there that day like Terence Yeke, and of course the BATF
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.760]  showed up seconds after in their full bomb gear telling medics to put bandages on them
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.840]  for non-existent wounds that they'd been on the 9th floor.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.640]  Did you hear any of that buzz at the time?
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.040]  Yes, I did, actually.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.520]  What about the bombs being removed on the local news?
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.160]  Those were not diffused.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.720]  They were still fused, but what happened was when the initial blast that was set off, you
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.920]  had the truck and then that second one right after it, they were almost consecutive.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.960]  It basically rendered the other two devices useless.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.280]  They didn't do it right.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:18.680]  This was a lesson learned for them to go on into what happened in 9-11, and now what's
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:24.960]  happening in 9-11 is also being AR'd into what's going to happen probably within the
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960]  next three months.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.680]  I mean, did you work in law enforcement or were you a medical person?
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.840]  No, I was actually a member of the Oklahoma National Guard at that time.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.040]  My job was demolition and explosion.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.760]  Well, you know, I've interviewed police officers, I've interviewed the foreman of the grand
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.760]  jury.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760]  I mean, all this is on record.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.600]  It's on the local news, the unexploded bombs, columns further back blown out.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.040]  Ron, when we come back, tell folks as a member of the Oklahoma Guard at the time what you
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.040]  witnessed inside the building, okay?
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.040]  Stay there, Ron.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.800]  I'm going to go to Kevin, Curtis, Joe, Rocco.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]  What's your home worth?

[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.200]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200]  documents.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.640]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.120]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.880]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.200]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.160]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.640]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.120]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120]  financial system.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.000]  The global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.680]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.840]  And I got news for you.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.520]  You're everyone else.

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:18.680]  Well, the Revolutionary War against the British got kicked off on April 19th.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:26.200]  And the feds torched the Waco.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.080]  Women and children and men on April 19th.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.960]  A couple of years later, they blew up the Oklahoma City building on April 19th.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.080]  And it's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, 1997, 13 years ago.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.520]  It's in road to tyranny.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.760]  It has the most detailed 45 minutes of that three-hour film.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.160]  The eyewitnesses, I've interviewed the grand jurors, the foremen of the grand jury, police
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:56.040]  officers, FBI agents, lawyers involved, federal affidavits, McVeigh being U.S. government,
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.800]  Cherry Nichols being U.S. government, sworn affidavits, it's even been in mainstream newspapers.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.560]  Iraqi Republican Guard brought in by U.S. intelligence who'd been trained in the 80s
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.520]  by the CIA were involved.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.480]  That way they had a fallback group of patsies.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:19.760]  They didn't go with that story of domestic extremists supposedly working with Iraqis.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.040]  Now they're pushing it all again, saying not a question of if, but when.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.920]  Here's the tea parties are criticizing the government.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:31.200]  We are racist who hate black people and we're going to blow things up.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200]  Total setup.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.800]  They've been caught dressed up like Nazis and it goes a lot further than that.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.880]  And so everything Ron was saying, he was saying that he was a caller, Ron from Texas was saying
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.600]  he was Oklahoma National Guard at the time and was in there and they were dismantling
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.320]  the bombs that didn't detonate and pulling out the survivors.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.640]  But that's all in the local news.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.280]  The governor before he'd been tipped to shut up, you know, there they are removing other
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.000]  bombs and columns in the back were blown out the furthest away from the rider truck.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.560]  Columns right in front of the rider truck weren't blown.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.560]  They had blast points.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.520]  The former head of Air Force weapons development went there, gave press conferences, said look
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.880]  at these video stills, these photos.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.040]  These are blast points blown off at an angle.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.640]  Then they use control demolition incorporated to blow up the rest of the building and then
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:23.560]  take it to a landfill, they mixed concrete in with it and have armed guards there guarding
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.920]  it to this day, but no, it's 10 feet under the ground.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.880]  And that was done to blame the American people and say, you're not going to have stage rights.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.800]  You're not going to have a move to nullify what the feds are doing.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.360]  You're not going to say no to the UN taking over our national parks and the assault weapons
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]  ban.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.480]  No, you criticize us, you're terrorists.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.040]  So Ron from Texas, everything you were saying checked out from all the witnesses that we've
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:53.040]  interviewed by name and of course we cover that in the films, but that's why history
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040]  is important folks.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.360]  That's why road to tyranny is so important.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.680]  But Ron, tell folks what you saw when you got there, what you witnessed.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:08.440]  What I witnessed was that side of the landfill of a federal building was completely blown
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.960]  out.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:18.080]  There was no possible way that was a, a rider truck caused by itself.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.680]  You could anybody with my experience with demolitions from the army,
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.240]  Well, pieces of the building were blown the opposite direction through the rider truck
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.600]  onto the roof of another building across the street.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  Exactly.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.440]  And the way the rebel went across the street, the rider truck had gone off and pushed everything
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.400]  forward into the building.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.680]  But everything was outside, into the street, covered up exactly where the rider truck was
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.180]  at.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.160]  Some of the pieces of the rider truck were covered into that rubble.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.240]  They ended up, if I remember right, the news report said they got a bin number off of the
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.840]  rear axle of the truck.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.840]  The bin number could have been pulled off of any body piece that they'd gotten off that
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.840]  truck.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.840]  It necessarily couldn't have been a rear axle.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.400]  The rear axle would have been demolished if that, when that truck went off.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.840]  Just because of where the explosives in the truck were placed.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.160]  And of course, the seismographs picked up the two explosions.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.480]  The eyewitnesses saw the ATF show up seconds after in full gear, saying they'd been on
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.920]  the ninth floor.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.920]  The ninth floor was gone.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.400]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:30.400]  And the reaction, the reaction of the bomb tanks that were coming out there were quick.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.280]  I mean, it was almost as if, like when the Joe Stackinson happened, you know, you had
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.160]  an emergency response because it was already right there for some odd reason.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.560]  You know, and so what were people saying on the ground that day?
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.840]  Because we know police officers and others went public and said this was an inside job
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.240]  and then they got murdered.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:56.040]  Well, I can tell you that some of the survivors we talked to, they were just totally disoriented.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.360]  They had no idea what it was, but what happened.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.960]  And there was a few of them that said they seen a truck pull up, stop, and some guys
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]  got out.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:12.920]  There were others that were further into the office that really didn't see anything were
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.000]  just there and just had to be caught in an explosion.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.280]  But at that point in time, nobody really came out and said anything that I talked to that
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:30.520]  they thought it was an inside job that I talked in person.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.560]  They didn't mention anything about that.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.640]  They were more concerned about other people were saying after the fact, when you're going
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.040]  to the rebel, you, you talked about other devices in the buildings.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.760]  Now, going through the rubble, they were concerned.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:48.800]  They didn't want us to go in right away because, um, one of the, uh, I want to say he was a
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.680]  federal law enforcement.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.920]  It's been a while since, since it happened.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.960]  So it's got our room here and, but, uh, they didn't want us to go in right away because
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.960]  they were telling us that there was a possible secondary device.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]  Yeah.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]  That was on the news.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.040]  They said no one's allowed to go in because of secondary devices.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.760]  Then it shows the bomb squad pull in and the, and the governor says they've removed at least
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.760]  three other devices.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.320]  I mean, that's all on television, uh, when it happened.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:22.360]  Then of course you have all the, what was it, 16 video cameras from the YMCA and from
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.920]  a credit union and from a, uh, other facilities, the feds all sees those and FBI agents told
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.040]  the LA times about a year later that yes, it showed John Doe number two, but they were
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.640]  told to shut up and they declared national security on all those videos.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:45.480]  Now they claim all the cameras malfunctioned or having their tapes changed, uh, that day.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.240]  So just another incredible example of coverups.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.520]  Exactly.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.800]  But I really wanted to bring this out because what is starting to come up within the next
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:08.480]  three months is going to end up being the same way because 9 11 and what happened 15
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.320]  years ago were very obvious to those of us that have been awoken and seen everything
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.000]  and know what's going on, know how to read between the lines of everything that's being
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.840]  told.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:28.200]  With my experience from being in the military as a demolition expert, if, and I'm just saying
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:35.520]  if, if this was to go into a nuclear false flag, it's going to be within a Keto, no more
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:43.440]  than probably a 10 Keto ton blast, anything larger than that would not constitute an improvised
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.200]  nuclear device.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.480]  We actually had in our arsenal at one time, a W 54 warhead, which was nicknamed the Davy
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:16:00.640]  Crockett and it yielded between one and 10 Keto tons, which compared to a megaton blast
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:06.880]  that's, you know, specifically small, which could be a right size blast for something
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880]  of this type.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.880]  Yeah.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:14.080]  The Davy Crockett looks like a rocket launcher and it's mounted on a tripod and two guys,
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.000]  a two man team can move it and use it and it was supposedly designed in case the Russians
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.880]  poured across from Eastern Europe into Western Europe, it's something that overwhelmed ground
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:35.000]  forces would use to stop major armor divisions from overrunning their positions.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.120]  We know there's a lot of other suitcase nuke type devices that have been developed and
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.840]  I'm going to cover this after we take some more calls later in the hour before Max Kaiser
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.960]  joins us.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:54.880]  But we have up on info wars.com and prison planet.com and it's in Paul Watson's article
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.920]  establishment exploits OKC bombing victims to push extremist threat propaganda.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:08.560]  Why are you so concerned about NLEO 10, the secret FEMA drill that the documents have
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.360]  now leaked mainstream news has it FEMA admits that these are real documents where they're
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:20.840]  planning in Nevada, multiple unannounced improvised nuclear device detonations.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.200]  We know they use drills to cover their operations in case other groups of government that are
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.520]  surveilling them, thinking they're terrorists, catch them, they say it's only part of a drill.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.880]  Why are you so concerned about this?
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.800]  Basically because what happened at Oklahoma City, there were FEMA agents there and they
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:45.320]  were photographing and taking notes and my understanding too, if you look back at what
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:51.440]  was going on at the time with the states wanting to bring up their state sovereignty and everything
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:57.680]  in 95 when Clinton was president and now with the movement that's going on now, everything
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:03.200]  is just coinciding with each other and it's almost in the exact duplicate of what happened
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200]  15 years ago.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:11.280]  As far as the political ground and remember 15 years ago, 16 years ago, they had the same
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.640]  lead up almost identical propaganda.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:20.880]  They're following a blueprint and there's no doubt they are strongly considering setting
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.280]  off a nuke, blaming it on Iran or domestic groups or bombing federal buildings, blaming
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:30.440]  it on domestics, setting off a nuke and blaming it on Iran.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:37.160]  Yep, and what you reported yesterday about what was going on in West Texas, that even
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:44.160]  more as the fact that, okay, this could be the scenario for this to go off on, where
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.720]  they came up through Mexico, they didn't get everybody, the nuke got through somehow and
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.400]  it went off.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:59.440]  And that's what the CIA has been promoting through alternative news websites and different
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.120]  private intelligence groups that this is going to happen.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:08.720]  Can you imagine the power that this fear-mongering and this event will give the globalist to
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.440]  come after the American people if they do set a nuke off?
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.080]  Oh, it's my boggling, Alex, what this is going to end up.
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:23.440]  I mean, we've got presidential director 51, which will allow him to declare national disaster
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:30.200]  and implement the arm of FEMA and from there, it'll just go downhill.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.480]  And in the last two years, they've gotten the grid in to take down the web, either entirely
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.240]  or selectively, they've got their full system in place right now for the first time ever
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.400]  and it appears that they are moving right now.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.440]  In fact, it's crystal clear this is what's happening.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.040]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.000]  We're going to come back with Kevin, Curtis, Joe, Rocco and others.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:02.440]  We'll get into NLEO 10 and the false flying nuke attack after we take some more calls.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.120]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water

[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.120]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.560]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.440]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  You heard the last caller.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.080]  He put it very succinctly.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.240]  It's an almost exact replay of 93, 94, 95.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:25.240]  The pre-programming, the demonization of the American people, the demonization of gun owners,
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.160]  ahead of a terror attack.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:31.880]  And going back and looking over what happened, the Patriots were warning at the time they
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:32.880]  were being set up.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.400]  And McVeigh went all over the country.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400]  He went to Waco.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.640]  He went to militia groups.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.920]  He went to gun shows so they could tie him into that at the time.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.320]  They're going to do the exact same thing again.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320]  This is guaranteed.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.280]  I hope listeners understand how real this is and we've got to get the word out.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.640]  As Bill Clinton said on, well, Blitzer, oh, these conspiracies didn't work this powerful
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640]  in 95, though.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.600]  See, they're very concerned that we now are challenging them and the people listen to
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.840]  us and not to them.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.000]  And so they're probably going to go ahead and launch their attack.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.680]  I would tell the globalists not to do it, but this is what they do.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.840]  They hate the American people.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]  They hate our rights.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]  They hate our freedom.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  Why did Al Qaeda attack us?
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.680]  Because they're CIA and they hate our freedom.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.680]  It's true.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.400]  Let's talk to Kevin and Marilyn.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.880]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.640]  Alex, you asked a question about what are we doing to fulfill our part and spread in
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.880]  the message.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  And I used to work for a defense contractor here in Baltimore when I woke up about two
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:34.360]  years ago, I quit my job and I started playing music and I drive around city to city handing
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.160]  out your DVDs and in your information and speaking to people.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.560]  This last weekend we had two shows in New Jersey.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.720]  I wasn't able to hand out one DVD on Friday night because everybody in the audience either
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.640]  owned your DVD or they're already seen it.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.120]  The next day we drove to Philadelphia to promote for their next show on Saturday.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.800]  When we got there, there was a tea party at Independence Hall.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800]  We walked around.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.760]  We talked to young black guys, old grandmas.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:10.600]  They, a lot, most of the people there had heard of Info Wars, had seen the DVDs or
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.440]  were very receptive to it.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:18.360]  That night we went and played our show in New Jersey, sure enough the lead singer of
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.600]  the first band that was on stage had to end the Fed T-shirt InfoWars.com.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.440]  They were handing out stickers and I just want to tell the people, give them some insight
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.240]  of how many people are truly awake out there, gave me a lot of hope and I think everybody
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.240]  that's listening to you, it doesn't stop there.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.040]  They need to go out and they need to talk about it.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.520]  They need to do exactly what we're doing, spread the DVDs because now the responsibility
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.480]  is on us to get the word out in the underground.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.720]  And now the people are ready to be awakened.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.200]  And now the people don't trust the government, you know, that headline last week that the
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.640]  news covered, you know, it's popular now to hate the government.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.760]  Ron Paul now is in a dead heat with Obama in multiple national polls.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:03.160]  He's winning or coming in second place in all the big Republican straw polls.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.480]  The system is scared so they're going to stage something to try to blame it on us.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.680]  And so now is the time to get the word out like never before.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:19.400]  And yes, we've had a giant impact, but we have to now leverage that impact and accelerate
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.760]  that impact because the controllers know we're turning the tide.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.520]  They know that if things continue peacefully, we're going to be able to fix things and take
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.960]  our country back at the state level.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.880]  And every day that passes, true Americans get in a better position.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:35.880]  God bless you.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.880]  I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.880]  Very exciting.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.040]  You know, I also hear the media keep saying there's not a lot of black people at these
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.840]  tea parties, not a lot of black people.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:49.680]  Well, I go watch the videos and you might see 5% of the crowd is black.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:55.680]  Maybe maybe 6% on average and maybe another 5, 6% Hispanic.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.480]  And that's only about half, you know, demographically half of the Hispanics, half of the blacks
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.480]  that should be there.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.480]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.760]  I've been to city councils all over the country giving speeches.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:11.920]  I've been at state houses in Texas and several other states giving speeches on other issues.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.760]  Over the last 14 years.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:20.640]  And it's almost always mainly white people.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.480]  And predominantly you'll see more Hispanics there than you see black people per their
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.520]  population level.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520]  What are Hispanics?
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:35.000]  15%, 16% of the population growing, blacks are 12%.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.960]  White people for whatever reason, maybe because statistically they're more middle class, at
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.080]  least in the past they were.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.680]  That's not the case anymore, I've seen the national numbers.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]  Everybody's becoming poor.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.760]  You know, that's this new world order, that's NAFTA and GATT.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.640]  So basically everyone's being lowered, not raised.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:56.640]  But that's another reason you do see mainly white people is because historically for whatever
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.840]  reason, a lot of times blacks and Hispanics are intimidated by police because they've
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:05.840]  been beaten going back to the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.240]  For whatever reason, statistically, police for whatever reason feel like it's open season
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:16.240]  on blacks or Hispanics in some cases, even more than whites, cops sometimes think I guess
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.480]  whites are more middle class, might be able to sue them.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.920]  But that's another reason, but the biggest reason you're not seeing the numbers of blacks
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.600]  we should be seeing at these events is the media for over a year has been saying it's
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:32.320]  a bunch of Ku Klux Klan members at key parties trying to scare blacks from coming.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.520]  And that's the divide and conquer.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:41.800]  And it is just absolutely, totally, and completely despicable as they try to keep us away from
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800]  each other.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.800]  But it's not going to work any longer.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.840]  That's why the feds have created all these Klan groups and white supremacist groups to
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.240]  try to own the anti-establishment movement.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:59.800]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:02.800]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.760]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.400]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.440]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440]  or gold?
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:16.800]  It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.960]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.520]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:24.520]  seeds.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:29.440]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.320]  food for you and your family.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.200]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:39.120]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.360]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:49.160]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:58.160]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.560]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.640]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.360]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:15.040]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.520]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.

[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.680]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.360]  Thanks, Max.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.480]  Wow, they have my original remote.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.760]  And an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:35.720]  All right, I'm going to go back to your calls here in a moment, but I want to just give
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:41.480]  you an overview here, instead of just desperately sitting up here screaming and yelling and
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.480]  warning people.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.840]  We know it's coming, we've seen it before, we know their blueprint, we know their MO,
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.600]  we know how they operate.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.840]  I'm here knowing that offshore banks that run our country are going to stage terror attacks
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.720]  and blame it on the American people.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.720]  I'm an American.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.720]  I love the Republic.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:58.720]  I love this country.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.680]  And I'm so sick of the propagandist up there saying, oh, if you say the government stage
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.080]  is terror, you're not a patriot.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.320]  Look at all the criminal things the government's done.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.880]  It's been caught staging terror.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.560]  It's been caught planning terror.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.280]  It's in Army manuals how to stage terror.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.280]  This is what they do.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.320]  And they're doing it here domestically.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.360]  And it's bigger than Obama.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.680]  It's the people that control him.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:29.760]  And they're playing the exact same script that they ran in the early 1990s, leading
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.160]  up to 1995, 15 years ago today.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:45.600]  Now, separately, uponinfowars.com, we have this article from Public Intelligence.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.240]  Why is FEMA trying to cover up NLE 10?
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.920]  Now what was NLE 09?
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.600]  We covered this yesterday.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:59.120]  You just type NLE, NLE 09, and the first links FEMA.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.680]  This was not secret.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.680]  It was with troops and governments from 14 nations, including Australia, Mexico, Canada,
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.520]  the United Kingdom.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.960]  And they did drills working with local police, the feds, and foreign merc groups to take
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.040]  on the American people.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.280]  And they have a lot of these drills that are secret, summer, and plain view to condition
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:24.160]  the public, to train the public to accept total federalization.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:31.520]  Now along comes NLE 010.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:40.000]  And FEMA, a local county out in Nevada, as well as a city, posted NLE 010 on their website
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.960]  thinking it wasn't secret.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.640]  And FEMA came to them and said, remove it.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:54.120]  Now they're contacting the media saying you need to remove this information.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.440]  What does the information say?
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.720]  You can go read it right now.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:07.360]  The FEMA document, 10 pages, it says they're going to stage unannounced simulated improvised
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:15.120]  nuclear device attacks in Nevada.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.040]  And the issue here is they are all over the place trying to shut this up.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.080]  They do not want this in the news.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.040]  There's just one news outfit that was contacted.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.400]  Public intelligence has received a request from FEMA to remove for official use only
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:36.320]  document regarding the national level exercise 2010 in NLE 010, which was scheduled for this
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.480]  coming May.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.960]  The exercise was to be based on national planning scenario one, which simulates a nuclear detonation
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.960]  in the U.S. city.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.280]  However, recent political pressure has led to the exercise being scaled back.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.280]  Yeah.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280]  They were going to...
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280]  This was a secret operation.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.720]  They should have been just a drill or they may have staged the nuke attack.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:58.760]  And then if anybody tried to investigate federal involvement, they just said, oh, yeah, we
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.120]  used to happen to be running a drill at the exact same place, exact same time.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.320]  They were running drills in Mumbai, India when they ran the attack.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:09.000]  They were running drills in 777 in London in 2005.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  They were running drills on 9-11.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.320]  They were running drills in Oklahoma City.
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.320]  That had come out at the time.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.320]  They denied it.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320]  Now it's been declassified.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.440]  The FBI counterterrorism chiefs were there in Oklahoma City for a full week.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.360]  That's mainstream news.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.480]  That's all in Watson's new article that's out today.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:32.920]  So in fact, just get Tarpley back on tomorrow.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:38.840]  He's one of the best at explaining how they use dupes, how they use patsies, and why they
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840]  use drills.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:44.520]  They also use the drill funding many times to fund the actual terror attack.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:47.240]  You understand how that works?
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.400]  So they do the same thing.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.720]  They have handbooks.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.600]  They drill this over and over again.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.720]  And they also run the drill.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:38:00.120]  So again, the NSA, Army Intelligence, Naval Intelligence, InfoPoll9, Echelon, all these
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.960]  systems pick up the chatter.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.120]  And so not only are they bust operatives getting ready to launch the attack, they can say it's
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.360]  part of a drill stand down.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:13.320]  But also it creates so much chatter that when they're running the real attack, they can
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.680]  just tell the NSA, oh no, stand down, that's just part of a drill.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.080]  Make NORAD on 9-11.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:23.120]  The tapes have been released by the FAA being told stand down at NORAD, it's just part of
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120]  a drill.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.640]  And the FAA air traffic controllers are on the line with NORAD going, but there's real
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:28.920]  attacks going on.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.480]  I've got simulations overlaid with the real attack.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.000]  What is going on here?
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.960]  I've never seen drills like this during real life.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.480]  I mean, we know, so you get a secret FEMA drill of nukes going off, and notice you've
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.360]  got Obama at the same time the last two weeks saying the number one threat is nukes going
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:54.880]  off in the U.S., domestic groups are now as big a threat as al-Qaeda, they're working
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.800]  with al-Qaeda, they're the evil Tea Parties, they want a nuke us.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.560]  Yeah, the Tea Parties now want to nuke America.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.240]  I mean, and we're all wearing Nazi underwear, okay?
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:10.440]  I mean, how asinine and clear does this have to get for people?
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.240]  I mean, I told you a month ago, they had people dressed up like Nazis.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.800]  Now it's in the AP.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.520]  You think they just stop with having people dressed up like Nazis to go to our rallies?
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.960]  You think they're just going to stop there?
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.120]  No, they don't stop there.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.280]  They run the white supremacist groups.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.680]  They run the black supremacist groups.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.400]  They run the Muslim extremist groups.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.480]  Makes me sick.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.840]  Public intelligence has received a request from FEMA to remove for official use only
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:39.640]  document regarding the national level exercise 2010 NLE-10, which was scheduled for this
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.640]  coming May.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.760]  The exercise was to be based on a national planning scenario I, which simulates a nuclear
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.760]  detonation in the U.S.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]  City.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.520]  However, recent political pressure has led to the exercise being scaled back according
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.800]  to the Washington Post-Christian Science Monitor, there's links to those, and a variety of
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.560]  other publications.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:04.480]  At the behest of Senator Harry Reid, the exercise in Nevada's events have reportedly been canceled
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.240]  and the FEMA website now shows no mention of NLE-10.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.920]  On top of this, the Obama administration has recently been emphasizing the threat of a
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.200]  domestic nuclear attack.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:19.600]  President Obama's remarks at the Nuclear Security Summit on April 13, 2010 emphasize
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.560]  that the threat of terrorists using nuclear weapons inside major metropolitan cities is
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.320]  one of the greatest threats that the world faces.
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.560]  So see, the Cold War is over for them, folks, so they've decided a new enemy.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:33.800]  It's called gun-owning Americans.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.800]  You like that?
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.680]  The whole Pentagon now aimed at you.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:41.560]  And as soon as you get out of the military, they're now putting codes on driver's license
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:47.800]  nationwide under the Real ID Act that tell them that you're a veteran or a gun owner.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:53.480]  And I got an email about this, in fact, it's here in my stack, I'm trying to dig it out.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.920]  I got an email about this a few days ago, and I went and looked it up and confirmed
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:05.320]  most states, it's secret, but in Ohio, they put it right on the driver's license.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.960]  And it was supposedly where troops would opt in or veterans, but now they already know
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.400]  you're a vet and people are asking vets or call-ups saying, why is it saying I'm a vet
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.120]  on my driver's license?
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.160]  That's like wearing a yellow star, but they tell you it's a benefit, oh, no, it's marking
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.160]  people.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:32.160]  Don't dig it out, it's in one of my stacks here, I can't keep track of it all anymore.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:43.320]  And it just gets more and more insane, you can just Google military logo on Ohio driver's
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.960]  license and you'll pull it up.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:52.840]  And they're going to the Veterans of Foreign Wars outfits and making them register 100-year-old
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:58.840]  rifles and handguns, 150-year-old cannons.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:06.800]  They're putting a list of gun owners on federal lists, it's just unbelievable.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:14.840]  So you've got FEMA trying to cover up NLE-10.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:23.720]  And you read the FEMA document, Nathan Rogers, National Exercise Division, DHS FEMA headquarters,
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:32.480]  National Level Exercise 10, NLE-10, Exercise Overview for Official Use Only, and it says
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.320]  Reflective of Past Exercise Lessons Learned, pertaining to Nuclear Scenarios, that's on
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:55.520]  Page 2, Campaign of Events, talks about Two, No Notice, Near Simultaneous IND Detonations.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:03.320]  So it doesn't even say simulated, it says Two, No Notice, Near Simultaneous IND Detonations,
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:15.040]  Improvised Nuclear Device, credible threat to the NCR leading to Eagle Horizon Component.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.760]  Man we're in trouble.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:25.440]  And then it gives the dates, they're going to run all these.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:38.760]  May 1st through May 9th is the first wave, then late June, around the 20th, then September
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:47.760]  11th, they have a drill September 11th, and they have another drill on November 3rd, and
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:54.040]  they have more drills in the middle of November, it just has marks on the calendar, doesn't
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:44:01.920]  give specific dates.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.680]  That was on 9, excuse me, let me give you the drill dates this year.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:21.320]  They've got them in April 22nd, May 8th through May 9th, it was 2010, and then late May, around
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:31.840]  the 22nd, and then another one around June 20th, June 18th, and then another one around
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:48.520]  June 27th, and then another in late July, and it runs out at August, so sick of living
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:52.560]  in a country run by psychoterrorists who've stolen trillions of dollars, do whatever they
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.920]  want, and think of us as their slaves, and just commit all these crimes, and then we're
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:04.160]  the bad guys because we know what they're doing, we understand their game plan.
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.160]  Let's talk to Curtis and Montana, Curtis here on the air.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.160]  Hello Alex.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.160]  Hi.
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:17.120]  I live over here in a small town in eastern Montana, probably about 5,000 people, and
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.800]  then there's town to ours is about 70 miles away in any direction, and about 10,000 people.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.200]  If you have a small airport here, you can't land jets on the airplanes, you know.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.160]  Well, anyway, about two weeks ago, we started seeing, you know, you see about one jet trail
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:41.640]  a week here, but about two weeks ago, I get up and it's sunny out in blue skies, I start
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.640]  seeing all these jet trails, or jet trails going back and forth in the sky, and there
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.200]  you're getting real wide, and kind of going together.
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.800]  Yeah, yeah, weather modification, Kim Trailer.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.640]  Yeah, so I get on the internet.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.840]  It's been declassified, it's been declassified, the White House admits they're doing it, but
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.200]  no one ever goes and looks at all the admissions, they only pass around theories.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:06.720]  Yeah, well, it's definitely strange, like I said, for this area, and I couldn't, so
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:13.080]  anyway, I get up Saturday this week, the blue, holy blue sky, I get up, I see the same thing,
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:17.560]  and I mean, there's so many jet trails across the sky, I couldn't count them, so I get
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.360]  my wife up, you know, because I thought maybe I was being paranoid, get my wife up, and
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.480]  she looks at it, you know, she doesn't know about any of this, and she was, you know,
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:32.240]  she thought that was extremely strange, but then, you know, it's cloudy for half a day,
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.880]  and then, you know, they go away, but I mean, then they stuck around for five hours.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.680]  I hear you, Curtis, I appreciate your call, you know, I'm really trying to take calls
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.760]  on the nuke attack, and on them demonizing the Patriot movement, and Clinton's saying
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:55.480]  he sure hopes another Oklahoma City doesn't happen to shut us up, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.680]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:46:59.680]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:05.760]  I think we've lost the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Civil War, because
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.760]  I see no difference between 1775 and now, I mean, we've got a central bank, central
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:16.920]  owns our tollways, we have secret king courts, we've made government sovereign instead of
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:24.960]  us, but I have a July 4th contest idea, a what 1776 really means.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.480]  I think we really have to take back Independence Day as what it really means.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:33.000]  Yeah, it doesn't mean getting drunk and eating hot dogs and shooting fireworks, no matter
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.480]  how much fun that is.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.160]  Right, exactly.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.280]  We have to take this series because I'm serious, the British are here.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.960]  I mean, it's almost like we fast forwarded 200 years and nothing changed.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:52.040]  I mean, we've got Brits running the place, we have this economic system going to hell.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.400]  I mean, what did we fight the Revolutionary War for?
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.400]  What are we going to have for?
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:00.800]  Well, for the modicum of private property rights we got that's now being eroded, Joe,
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:01.800]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.400]  By the way, I forgot to cover this, but this was in, I think the statesman last week, well,
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.440]  you guys Google it, stimulus money going to toll roads.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:17.480]  And so you pay stimulus money, they then come in to existing roads and turn them into toll
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:24.360]  roads and pay the toll road company to repay the roads.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.760]  So again, you're paying to have your toll roads, to have your roads turn into toll roads.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:32.400]  It's just, I mean, I can't even keep track of the illegalness of this and the article
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.840]  went on to admit there's a federal law against that, but they don't care.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.280]  It's just criminals at every level robbing and looting everything and they're all getting
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.280]  away with it.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.520]  So why not go 10 times more crazy?
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.640]  Why not just take everybody's pension funds?
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.000]  Why not just blow some stuff up and blame it on the people when they complain?
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.680]  It's very elementary.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.200]  Rocco in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:58.200]  Hey, I had a question about 9-11 relevant to the current situation.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:02.640]  The plane that was shot down in Shanksville, that was supposed to hit the Capitol, right?
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.080]  Well, it was going for that or building seven, it could have gone either place.
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.760]  If it hit the Capitol, were they planning coast-to-coast martial law?
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  Absolutely.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:18.600]  Well, that's why two days before AP reported that Jeb Bush had prematurely declared for
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.880]  the first time martial law in Florida ahead of a national disaster.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:30.720]  Okay, in this scenario, it seems like if they go with 5 or 10 kiloton nukes, it hits three
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.720]  or four cities.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:37.120]  It seems to me they'd have to lock down the country region by region, because even the
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.960]  people that are asleep, if let's say there's an attack in Illinois, only why would the
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.920]  people in Texas accept martial law?
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:46.920]  So what's your thoughts?
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.400]  I don't think they could do coast-to-coast.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.160]  Well, no, no, no, they'll start shutting down internet freedom.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:53.880]  They'll start arresting some of the people they want to.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.280]  They'll launch a new war against Iran, and it will just be a further process.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.480]  We're already under martial law when they secretly arrest citizens, when they have FEMA
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.960]  camps, when they have cameras everywhere, federalized police.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.760]  When foreign troops are in here doing drills at the G20, the banker owners come in and
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.440]  they attack old ladies with police dogs for no reason.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.760]  We're under martial law now.
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.920]  It's what increment of martial law, and this will take us to the next level.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:19.920]  Go hot.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.960]  In other words, okay, everybody has to hand the guns in.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:26.520]  It seems like they'd have to do that region by region to get compliance.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:33.600]  Well, it's going to be, again, they're going to phase that in with more police being attacked,
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.960]  blaming it on the American people, provocaturing some real events.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.960]  It's a process, but imagine, they could go completely hot overnight with nukes going
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:47.480]  off, and they've been drilling for it and preparing for it, and then they just shut
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.160]  off the economy for a few months.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:53.240]  People start starving in the streets, there's a total economic depression, the banks take
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:58.200]  over the economy even more, and then play the part of the saviors, but yes, they're
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:50:59.200]  looking at it right now.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.520]  They've probably already got their nukes in place, we'll be right back.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.680]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:07.640]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.280]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.320]  or gold?
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:17.680]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.840]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.000]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  seeds.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.320]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.600]  food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:40.000]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden,
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.240]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:50.040]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.200]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:59.040]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.000]  Great news for pure water lovers.

[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:07.480]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480]  Listen.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:12.680]  My name is Ellis, and I am 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.920]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:19.160]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.040]  They wanted me to go on plivics, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:27.120]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.520]  head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:33.880]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:38.440]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:42.800]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is heart and body extract.

[01:53:53.640 --> 01:54:23.200]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade, and though the news
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:39.340]  is
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:44.820]  Goldman Sachs, running all the regulatory positions, robbing you, you're a terrorist.
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:50.580]  And Bill Clinton sure hopes there didn't need to be an attack to make you shut up.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:52.700]  Who stands to gain from that attack?
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:55.420]  Who's been propagandizing about this attack?
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.300]  Right on time for April.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:04.780]  I told you that I learned that all five cable networks have been 24-7 the last year producing
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:05.780]  for April.
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:12.060]  They told me April, the two I talked to, then I discovered the others, we're doing it,
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:17.060]  for late April into May.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.420]  And now you see it.
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:20.580]  They've been producing this for a year.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:24.460]  They've been given the word to get ready for this propaganda operation.
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:25.740]  This is staged.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:28.780]  We know this is staged, period.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:32.620]  That's why it's more important than ever that we educate people.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:36.540]  When we talk about the films, your purchase of the videos also funds our operation here.
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.300]  We can continue our work and hopefully expand.
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.340]  I want to thank all those that have become PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:45.620]  I want to thank all those that have ordered the documentary films.
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:50.420]  We've now been shipping out for a week-plus invisible empire, a new order to find.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:54.660]  It's getting great reviews, shows people who the real government is, the criminal and legitimate
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:56.340]  government, how they operate.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:01.260]  And coming out Wednesday at PrisonPlanet.tv and start shipping tomorrow, Police State
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:06.540]  4 of the Rise of FEMA, the camps, the shadow government, how it operates, how they stage
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:09.980]  terror, what happened at the G20?
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:19.340]  It's all covered in Police State 4, the Rise of FEMA, Police State 4, the Rise of FEMA.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:24.580]  It hits in 48 hours at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:56.020]  Or write to me, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60, again, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas,
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:04.020]  787-60, get Invisible Empire, get Police State 4, the Rise of FEMA, get them out to everyone,
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.740]  get Fall of the Republic.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:09.180]  It gives people the full spectrum analysis of what we're dealing with here.
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.700]  I mean, this isn't even a radio show, folks.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.820]  I joke around and have some fun in the past, because I do this four hours a day, but it's
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:19.340]  not fun, it's not a joke, it's not a game, it's the real world.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.900]  We are in so much trouble, we have such an illegitimate criminal out of control, supposed
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:29.740]  federal government, openly run and hijacked by private roundtable groups, offshore banks.
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:31.700]  I mean, it is so horrible.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.740]  They are just looting the daylights out of us.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.580]  We're in a depression.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:39.020]  They're stalling that news going out while they get their new wars going and their police
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:42.420]  state grid in place, and it's just all coming together.
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:45.940]  The takeover of the environment, the takeover of industry, the takeover of the internet,
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:50.780]  the takeover of the auto industry, the takeover of the states, the takeover of the local police,
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:53.740]  the takeover of everything, and we're standing up and saying it's illegitimate.
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:54.740]  It's illegal.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:55.740]  It's wrong.
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:56.740]  It's bad.
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:58.140]  Prosecute the bankers.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:02.860]  Get America back, and they're saying, oh, you're racists that are going to blow up buildings.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:07.420]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get of how much trouble we're in?
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:12.580]  That's the only card they can play is false flag terrorism.
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:16.420]  I've been warning you about this because I know their game plan, and now you're living
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.420]  it.
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:18.420]  You're seeing it.
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:23.020]  You have to be gummered in a box of rocks to not realize what is happening right now.
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:30.260]  You'd have to be living on Pluto to not see what's going on and how disgusting Bill Clinton
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:32.660]  and Barack Obama and the neocons are.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:37.380]  They're all in it together, ladies and gentlemen, and it's disgusting.
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.860]  This is serious.
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:42.580]  Max Kaiser, your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:47.820]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:52.260]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:53.260]  Hello.
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:55.260]  This is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.620]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:00.620]  do you want?
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:06.140]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:07.660]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:08.860]  How much do you want?
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.900]  When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:13.020]  When will you need it?
[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:15.140]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:16.500]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:20.540]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.260]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:27.020]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:30.620]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:31.860]  How much will you need?
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:32.860]  We don't know.
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:33.860]  How much do you want?
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:34.860]  All you can get.
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:35.860]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:39.060]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:46.580]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:53.580]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:29.580]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:32.580]  Max Kaiser is our guest.
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:42.180]  He has two different international television programs on RT and Press TV.
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:46.140]  He is a TV presenter, radio host, entrepreneur, broadcaster, and journalist.
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:49.740]  He is the inventor of the virtual specialist technology, prediction markets, Hollywood
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.120]  stock exchange, and much more.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:01:01.900]  He is the presenter of Oracle, VBC, Al Jazeera, Huffington Post, you name it.
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:05.980]  And we appreciate him joining us, former Wall Street broker.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:10.780]  He's been saying for years that Goldman Sachs' engineering financial collapse to consolidate
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:13.540]  and destroy their competition.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:15.380]  Now that is mainstream news.
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.660]  Here's the one in Guardian.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:17.660]  Now we know the truth.
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:20.420]  The financial meltdown wasn't a mistake.
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:23.260]  It was a con.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:29.620]  And we have record bonuses now to be paid to Goldman Sachs, just in England, 3.5 billion
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:30.620]  pounds.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:36.380]  And of course, you notice the inner group, JPMorgan Chase and other groups that own the
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:40.700]  private Federal Reserve holding company, they're all making record profits while hoarding all
[02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:42.620]  the bailout money.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:47.900]  And why is the SEC indicted Goldman Sachs, some of their members, civilly?
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:51.420]  Well, they'll probably give them a $5 million fine and slap them on the wrist and give
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:54.740]  somebody probation for the trillions that have been stolen.
[02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:56.940]  But joining us is Max Kaiser to discuss this.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:01.700]  We'll also get into the FBI saying our number one threat is us, the American people.
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:05.980]  Bill Clinton says, you know, if the Tea Parties don't shut up, people don't criticize Wall
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:09.180]  Street, that a terror attack is going to happen and it's our fault.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:13.420]  I mean, they're out in the open, folks, getting ready to stage terror attacks here.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:15.060]  And we'll take your calls on that subject.
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:17.260]  Max Kaiser, good to have you here with us.
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:20.300]  Yeah, Alex Jones, it's always a pleasure.
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:23.020]  Well, I tell you, things are getting crazy.
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:26.740]  Let's get into Goldman Sachs and financial terrorism.
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:27.740]  Right.
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:32.900]  Well, as you point out, I've been talking about this for a number of years.
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:42.100]  Basically, they have been involved, have other Wall Street banks, and setting up banks to
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:46.460]  fail because they can profit on the failure.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:52.700]  So just like we've talked about before about Building 7, during the 9-11 incident, there
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:56.980]  were many options traders that made a lot of money because the Building 7 collapsed.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:59.740]  Now, here's Goldman Sachs, same thing.
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:01.340]  They create a fund.
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:07.820]  They create bonds that they build to collapse, that they rig with financial dynamite so that
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:10.860]  it collapses, and they make money on the collapse.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:12.420]  It's financial terrorism.
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.660]  It's a controlled demolition.
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:16.660]  That's how they make a lot of their money.
[02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:21.540]  That's how they make most of their money.
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:26.460]  Well, there's no doubt that the stimulus has run out, and now they're saying, okay, maybe
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.540]  it is a depression.
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.940]  We need more money.
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:34.860]  Obama's new regulation package allows the top banks and brokerage firms through their
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:40.380]  regulators that they control to basically feed other smaller regional healthy banks into
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:45.540]  their maw and attacks on smaller institutions that's paid through bailout money to them.
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:49.980]  I mean, this is, we've got Gordon Brown calling for a world government oven for and buy the
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:50.980]  banks.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:52.540]  I mean, it's just getting crazy.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:58.460]  Well, you know, it's interesting because Lloyd Blank find the CEO of Goldman Sachs,
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:05.540]  of course, famously said that he was doing God's work when he and his cohorts are creating
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:12.900]  all of these problems for everybody and creating blackmail situations and extortion to get their
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:18.540]  buddy Hank Paulson to extort $700 billion, if you recall, back there at the end of 2008
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.540]  in front of Congress.
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:25.860]  But apparently he's angered the gods because now in Iceland, the volcano is blowing up.
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:30.460]  And it's what's remarkable, Alex, is that this is similar and almost exactly what happened
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:32.900]  during the pre, the French Revolution.
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:37.300]  Actually, the French Revolution started when a volcano in Iceland blew up.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:40.740]  It caused the global problems of agriculture.
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:44.900]  And this was the, the, the, what, you know what, you know what, I mean, it's like a comment
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:47.100]  being a portend of doom.
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:51.900]  It's like God was showing people the earth freezing solid, basically, right as they tried
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:54.380]  to pass their global warming takeover.
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:55.380]  Now you're right.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:05:00.300]  You've forgotten that historically, mega volcano shrouding, uh, Europe in dust.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.300]  Stay there.
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:03.580]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:07.540]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:09.180]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:13.220]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:14.220]  or gold?
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:15.220]  It's true.
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:18.140]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:19.740]  that could even happen again.
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:24.140]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:25.140]  seeds.
[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:29.980]  You can call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:32.100]  dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:33.220]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:37.420]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:39.900]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:43.140]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:49.980]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:54.100]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:58.940]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:01.260]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:07.780]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:12.460]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:16.620]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:21.260]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:26.500]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:32.780]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:37.100]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:42.420]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:47.700]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:30.140]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:31.940]  powerful shadow state.
[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:36.020]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has formed.
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:40.420]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:45.540]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:46.540]  corner.
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:49.780]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:51.780]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:52.780]  It's here.

[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:11.980]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:12.980]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:15.100]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:23.620]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:30.860]  Well, the first two hours were dedicated to the fact that it's 100 percent the military
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:35.420]  industrial complex that controls both parties is going to stage a terror attack, the blame
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:39.580]  it on people that want to end the Fed, people that want to audit the Fed, that want to arrest
[02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:43.700]  the people that run Goldman Sachs that controlled all the regulatory positions and aren't just
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:50.700]  ripping our country off, they're ripping off countries from Chile to New Zealand to Greece
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:52.780]  to Iceland.
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.820]  And they've been building this propaganda up.
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:56.740]  They claim the Tea Parties are right-wing.
[02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:59.820]  It becomes a self-fulfilling Republican prophecy.
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:04.740]  Then they began demonizing those when polls show 40 percent of the Tea Parties are Democrats
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:06.180]  and independents.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.180]  It's divide and conquer.
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:09.740]  Oh, you want a populist movement against what we're doing?
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:15.780]  They'll tell black people not to go because you hate them invoking that instead of talking
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:16.780]  about the real issues.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:20.860]  Now, the Democrats have been caught sending people in Nazi outfits with Nazi signs, this
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:25.380]  is even in the AP, to events all over the country and it blew up in their face.
[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:30.500]  And now, Clinton's on television saying there will be a terror attack if the Tea Parties
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:32.620]  don't shut up, they're going to cause it.
[02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:34.620]  Now, I've seen this before.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.920]  I'm telling you again, this is what's happening.
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:37.920]  This is what's going on.
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.260]  We're in grave danger.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:40.260]  This is a scythe.
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:46.220]  Now, looking at the real enemy, the criminals, the top groups on Wall Street, not your local
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:52.300]  bank, not your local broker, but the people that run it, Max Kaiser for years, top broker,
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:10:03.220]  stock market inventor, TV shows on BBC, Al Jazeera, Press TV, RT, you name it, is a top
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:04.820]  expert on this.
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:08.900]  And he's been talking about how they destroyed the economy by design to consolidate it.
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:14.980]  Clatsy sued last year, newspapers got the documents, Greg Gordon, proving that it was
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:20.940]  premeditated just in one area, that they got the documents on, that they were betting against
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:24.420]  the housing market while telling people it was good and paying for insurance to have
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:27.940]  a AAA rated than the looting of AIG.
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:31.620]  That was the big payout kitty they used to pay the criminals.
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:32.740]  Now they want more.
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:37.300]  They're calling it banking reform, but it gives the same group power over other financial
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:40.620]  institutions that they want to wreck their competition.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:45.260]  Max Kaiser, you've got the floor, tell us about financial terrorism and how it works
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.740]  and what we're facing.
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:52.900]  Well, I have been doing many reports about this and films for a number of years.
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:59.020]  I mean, you mentioned that the tax are coming, but they've already, they're here now and
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:01.460]  they're happening now and they've been happening for the past two years.
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.620]  These are financial attacks.
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:10.900]  In the crisis in 2008, people were saying, wow, this is a 100-year phenomenon, nobody
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:11.900]  stopped coming.
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:16.500]  Now we know that Lehman Brothers had a bank right down the street where they had this
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:22.340]  huge flush fund that they parked $50 billion worth of cash and debt so that at the end
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:26.060]  of the quarter when they needed to report to the SEC what their cash holding was, they
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:30.180]  could play counting games with their little fake bank down the street.
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:35.460]  We know that Goldman Sachs now, according to the SEC, allegedly involved in fraud in
[02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:40.580]  terms of selling tainted bonds to investors all over the world, including in Europe where
[02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:45.140]  now you see problems with the Greek economy blowing up and other countries' economies
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:46.140]  are blowing up.
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.820]  And of course, Iceland went through this already two years ago as I made that film about it
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:12:00.020]  in 2007, 2008, Icelandic Chronic collapsed, Icelandic economy collapsed, and now in an
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:07.380]  ironic fitting fit of poetic justice, the volcanoes are erupting in Iceland, and they're
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:14.020]  sending out this toxic cloud of ash to the UK who wanted to extract even another $5 billion
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:20.580]  from Iceland to appease the financial terrorists, but the gods, the volcanoes in Iceland are
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:28.100]  taking on the fake handy work of the fake servant of God, Lloyd Blankfein, and they
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:34.660]  are doing the true work of God by putting these bankers on notice that there are forces
[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:39.940]  out there that are bigger than even their corruption, and it goes back to right before
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:40.940]  the French Revolution.
[02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:43.180]  There was a huge volcano in Iceland.
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:45.140]  It blanketed the globe in dust and ash.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:52.020]  The agriculture failed, which led to the government of France failing on its financial obligations
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:54.180]  which gave rise to the French Revolution.
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:55.980]  It started with a volcano in Iceland.
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:59.100]  There's a direct power out.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:01.540]  History only repeats itself in these cycles.
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:06.060]  There's a lot of things going on that aren't in our books.
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:07.060]  There's a lot of things going on.
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:12.740]  Look, Alex, look, obviously, the volcano is demanding that we sacrifice some bankers
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.740]  to the volcano.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:18.100]  I say, let's get Blankfein, let's get Jamie Dimon, let's get Dick Ford and throw them
[02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:19.100]  into the volcano.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:24.220]  That's the only way we can stop the nightmare, sacrifice bankers to the volcano.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:29.940]  Well, let's get serious here for a moment, but that isn't an intriguing idea there, Dr.,
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:30.940]  but expanding on that.
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:39.060]  Well, we're back to pre-Industrial Revolution days of feudalism, because what they want
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:43.020]  to do is they want to pursue an economy of lords and serfs.
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:49.360]  They want us to be free-range slaves tied into our... The reason you don't see bread
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:54.140]  lines in America is because they throw on these swipe cards or getting food stamps.
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:14:02.580]  What is a 30-something million now on food stamps?
[02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:03.980]  Let's go back to volcanoes.
[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:07.780]  Later in the next hour, after you leave us, I will get into the AP, top volcanologists
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:12.580]  are warning that the Super Caldera that's four states in size centered in and around
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:15.660]  Yellowstone could blow.
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.060]  This is becoming beblicable.
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:22.260]  All these earthquakes hitting major cities and volcanoes blowing up and tsunamis, and
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:28.060]  now they're saying that the Super Volcano, thousands of times bigger than what Iceland
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:29.460]  has, could blow up.
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:32.260]  I mean, hell, it could be the end of the world, Kaiser.
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:36.820]  Well, I mean, everyone understands the crisis happening now.
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:42.020]  Finally, the FCC, they finally have charged Goldman with fraud, and now it's going to
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:46.580]  unleash a wave of lawsuits for all the activity that's been going on for the past five to
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:54.660]  10 years, ever since the passage of the Features, Commodity Features Modernization Act back
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:58.420]  in the year 2000, which swept in a wave of all this fraud.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:01.420]  But I can tell you right now what the fraud is going to be.
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:06.020]  Two years from today, you're going to be doing a show talking about how Hollywood blew
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:10.220]  up because of derivatives, and this is just happening right now.
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:15.180]  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has just approved derivative trading for boxed
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:16.660]  office features contract.
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:17.660]  That's the next bubble.
[02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:22.540]  I want to get into that later, and I want to get into testimony two weeks ago in Congress,
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:27.780]  100-to-one leverage, world's largest fraud exposed, JPMorgan Chase caught manipulating
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:32.620]  gold and silver, and they've now got whistleblowers testifying before Congress.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:38.660]  The next big bubble being Hollywood, but going back, you've been on your TV show, British
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:45.100]  radio, Russian radio, national French TV, you're everywhere, a global force out there,
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:46.100]  Max Kaiser.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:47.100]  Play the Moscow clip.
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:48.100]  Play the Moscow clip.
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:49.100]  Tell the people.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.100]  Okay.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:54.540]  Guys, do you have that clip queued up of him on Moscow Radio and TV?
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:55.540]  Okay.
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:57.340]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from Max Kaiser.
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:58.340]  Here it is.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:03.500]  Before we leave this idea of financial terrorism, let me just elaborate on that a little bit
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:14.940]  because typically people associate terrorists with fanatics who are associated with an ideology
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:23.220]  that they're willing to kill themselves and others for that ideology, including innocent
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:24.220]  victims.
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:28.940]  Now, let's talk about Hank Paulson for a second.
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:37.980]  He believes in an ideology called market fundamentalism, which is as pernicious as any ideological
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:48.460]  theocratic fundamentalist fanaticism in the world today, so it's a kind of religion.
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:49.460]  It is.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:54.260]  Well, Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, recently said he's doing God's work.
[02:16:54.260 --> 02:17:04.660]  He's a fanatic, he's a market fanatic.
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:09.420]  And in the case of Lehman Brothers, he had bankers, suicide bankers, blowing themselves
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:13.820]  up in the name of market fundamentalism, and people in Iceland die.
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:15.380]  People in Iceland were rioting.
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:20.660]  People in around the world are starving because of these suicide bankers and financial terrorists.
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:21.660]  Okay.
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:33.660]  Now, Max, separately, it's now, now I have a video clip of Kramer on Frontline in 1996.
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:38.260]  Kramer, not Kramer, don't abuse your audience like that.
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:40.700]  No, no, Kramer, we're going to play it later.
[02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:46.260]  Kramer saying it's a religion, a social Darwinistic religion, and that it's natural and fair and
[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:47.260]  reasonable.
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:51.940]  Then we have a later clip of him two years ago admitting that he would rig markets when
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:52.940]  he shorted them.
[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:57.660]  Well, he, he is, he's talked about the way he rigs markets all the time.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:59.340]  Kramer's a market rigger.
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:04.100]  He's a market manipulator, and he's, he works for the market fundamentalists who believe
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:09.260]  that when they make money, it's the work of God, and when, and, and, and everyone else
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:12.500]  can lose money because they're not down with God like they are.
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:18.180]  This is just, as I said, it's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's as ridiculous and it's, it's,
[02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:25.140]  it's as obscene as what's happening, you know, in with these priests, you know, these
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:27.500]  pedophile priests who are procuring the church.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:32.260]  Here you've got Jim Kramer, he's supposed to be a capitalist, he's betraying capitalism
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:37.420]  by performing the, the, essentially the same thing on markets, by fiddling with markets
[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:43.060]  in a, in a most unholding manner, and, and he will be damned, and he will go to hell
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:44.060]  as a result of that.
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:48.300]  And then always telling us that no matter how much money they steal in government bailouts,
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:52.740]  that it's the free market, when it's the opposite, as Ron Paul has said, it's corporatism.
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:53.740]  It's fascism.
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:58.740]  It's rigged market capitalism, and when the next chapter in rigged market capitalism
[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:02.780]  is going to be rigged Hollywood, and they're rigging Hollywood right now in two years from
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:07.980]  today, beyond your show, and I'll say, wow, the Hollywood industry blew up because of
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:10.820]  all the derivatives trading, and nobody saw it coming.
[02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:12.820]  It was, oh, who could have seen this happen?
[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:16.980]  And I'm telling you right now exactly what's going to happen, and then because Hollywood
[02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:22.180]  does $10 billion a year in box office, the banker said, this is a way we can turn this
[02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:27.060]  into 200 or 300 billion in derivatives, we're going to run it up, we're going to mask huge
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:30.780]  fees, we're going to destabilize the entire industry, and we're going to bust it out just
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:35.260]  like the mob will bust out a pizza joint, or a dry cleaner shop, they just, they just
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:40.100]  torch it, because there's, Hollywood has never been torched by derivatives in this matter.
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:43.660]  It's about to get derivatives by Canterford's Gerald and their Canter Exchange, and another
[02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:48.740]  group called Trend Exchange, the Locusts are moving in, they're going to destroy that industry,
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:52.260]  they're going to just take all the money they possibly can, and they're going to leave it
[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:55.820]  dead carcass to be bailed out by the taxpayer.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.780]  Max Kaiser stay there, which is what the bankers like, then they'll come in with taxpayer money
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:02.340]  and take it over.
[02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:06.820]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease
[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.180]  begins in the colon?
[02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:13.340]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:16.180]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:20.420]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system
[02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:22.180]  and a strong immune system.
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:27.940]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites,
[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:31.220]  heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:36.140]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses
[02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:39.060]  and is now available from Freshwater Organics.

[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:10.180]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:14.340]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:15.340]  documents.
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:19.780]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:22.260]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:27.100]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:28.100]  world.
[02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:33.300]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:35.780]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:40.260]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:41.260]  financial system.
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:44.140]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:47.860]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:50.660]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:05.740]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources talking today about change, not the change we've
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:09.420]  been promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing
[02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:10.580]  economic times.
[02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:15.020]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion and our unfunded liabilities
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:19.980]  totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S. dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:23.860]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need

[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:37.540]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:41.460]  our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation
[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:42.700]  with precious metals.
[02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:49.060]  Call me, Jim Newcomer at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:53.700]  possession or convert your IRA into precious metals before it's too late.

[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:01.900]  worked a lifetime to establish.

[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:10.300]  broke in the process.
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:11.940]  Welcome to the Freeze Dry Guy.

[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:10.660]  Coming up in the next hour, Luke Radowski got to have a talk with Stephen Colbert about
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:13.260]  the November group threatening to kill independent journalists.
[02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:15.300]  Then Colbert talked about it on his TV show.
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:18.940]  It's been about 20, 30 minutes with Luke that I'm going to get back into government-stage
[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:19.940]  terror.
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:23.260]  This article up at infowars.com is so important.
[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:26.140]  Government preparing to stage domestic terror attack.
[02:24:26.140 --> 02:24:33.260]  Now, if you think the Iceland earth problems, earth changes are bad, the volcano, look at
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:39.380]  this French news agency report, rare Yellowstone volcano eruption would be deadly, the biggest
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:41.180]  known volcano in the world.
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:46.900]  We're going to be talking about that towards the end of the next hour.
[02:24:46.900 --> 02:24:49.820]  And look, scientists had always said that asteroids didn't hit the earth but every
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.380]  few million years.
[02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:57.540]  But Shoemaker-Levy comment that broke up in five pieces and hit Saturn proved, because
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:25:01.620]  now they can look at the solar system, that planets are being hit every few decades by
[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:03.420]  big asteroids.
[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:06.980]  And earth about every hundred years gets hit by one.
[02:25:06.980 --> 02:25:12.860]  And so we are looking right now statistically for that to happen, volcanoes they thought
[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:17.340]  didn't erupt that much, look at all the eruptions, look at all the earthquakes we're now having.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:18.780]  We live in a very volatile earth.
[02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:22.260]  And don't worry, there's another religion, not just the fake Wall Street people.
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:26.780]  There's the derivatives with the greenhouse gas taxes, where you pay an indulgence to
[02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:34.340]  the church, i.e. Al Gore, he waves a wand and Max Kaiser, if we paid taxes to Al Gore and
[02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:40.940]  Barack Obama and to George Soros and others, would they wave a wand and stop the earthquakes
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:41.940]  of volcanoes?
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:46.460]  Because they are in the news today and the UN is saying this is global warming that caused
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.020]  the volcano.
[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:54.860]  Well, carbon trading, which is an offshoot of global warming, as I pointed out on your
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:26:01.380]  show before, is just another derivative nightmare being cooked up by the folks on Wall Street.
[02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:05.380]  And once they bust out the real estate market and they bust out the dot com market or the
[02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:11.740]  savings alone or the long term capital management, they need fresh markets to blow up.
[02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:16.300]  And carbon trading and box office futures are clearly going to be those markets.
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.060]  Canterford's Gerald, by the way, is big in both of those markets.
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:23.100]  You know, Canterford's Gerald is a firm that you don't hear a lot about, as big as the
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:28.460]  other firms, except they did lose the most bankers of any firm on 9-11, that's probably
[02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:30.460]  their most notoriety.
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:35.740]  But they are involved in both of these markets and carbon trading is just another way to
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:42.300]  create derivatives upon derivatives, which are designed to blow up, they're designed
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:47.700]  to create catastrophe so that the government has to come in and bail out the cancer parties
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:48.700]  as they're called.
[02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:53.580]  And, but meanwhile, all the fees that have been generated, billions of dollars in fees,
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:54.980]  are kept by the people who...
[02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:59.220]  So they make money on the way up and then they make money on the way down with a bailout
[02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:03.700]  and then it always is a selective bailout destroying their competition, shifting gears
[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:05.180]  into another subject.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:09.260]  Your take on gold and silver, I mean, the numbers we see from mainline groups is that
[02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:15.820]  gold should be $2,500 or so, silver $50, balanced from the 1980s numbers with inflation and
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:21.460]  now there's been congressional testimony with insiders and the head of GATA, the Gold Antitrust
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:29.300]  Group, documenting that JP Morgan and others are manipulating gold and the ways they're
[02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:30.300]  doing that.
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:31.300]  What's your take on that?
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:32.300]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:33.300]  Okay.
[02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:34.300]  Well, let's get into that in a second.
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:38.340]  But first, I wanted to mention because I made a prediction on your show a couple of
[02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:43.020]  months ago, maybe three or four months ago and I laid it out in no uncertain terms and
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:50.340]  a lot of people really thought that I was making a very kind of off-the-wall prediction.
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:58.380]  But listen to this out, I said on your show a few months ago that Facebook, with their
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:04.580]  virtual currency game Farmville, was going to end up as a way to just basically push
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:09.340]  debt onto unsuspecting users using their virtual currency.
[02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:14.900]  Now, here's the, if you look this up as a headline on Guardian, Farmville user runs
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:22.820]  up a 900-pound debt, roughly $1,200, a 12-year-old boy spent 625 pounds on his mother's credit
[02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:29.060]  card and another 288 pounds of his own savings on the Facebook game Farmville.
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:35.500]  Now, this is the beginning, this is the start of virtual enslavement and virtual currencies.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:41.260]  Get these kids hooked on what looks like innocent games on the internet and through Facebook
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:44.620]  and before you know it, they own real money to these people.
[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:48.820]  They've got real credit card debts, of course, are being charged extortionary rates and now
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:53.820]  they're under the gun to pay back these debts using these so-called innocent games and you're
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:56.500]  going to see this become an explosion over the next two or three years.
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:01.860]  So the virtual currency business right now is a growing dollar industry right now.
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:05.780]  Well, what about Second Life, where people are paying thousands of dollars for a fictitious
[02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:09.740]  Ferrari and they spend all their time on it like it's the real world?
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:12.940]  But they're going to debt to pay the further fictitious Ferrari.
[02:29:12.940 --> 02:29:17.340]  So it's similar, it's like 12-year-olds doing exactly what the people in Germany did when
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:19.660]  they bought fictitious bonds from Goldman Sachs.
[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:23.060]  They wake up one day and say, wait a minute, this was a fictitious bond, but Goldman says,
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:25.060]  wait, you still owe us $10 billion.
[02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:26.620]  Yeah, we, we, Max.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:27.620]  He's a 12-year-old kid.
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:32.620]  He reaches into his mother's purse, he takes out a credit card, now he owns $1,200 to
[02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:36.740]  Facebook and he says, wait a minute, I thought it was a game, I thought it was fictitious
[02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:37.740]  money.
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:41.220]  They say, no, actually you owe us the money and of course you have to give us the money
[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:42.220]  right away.
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:44.460]  Max, we got a break, we come back, let's get into this.
[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:48.460]  We found the London Guardian article, we'll put it up on screen during the break and with
[02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:52.500]  the half-life and all these other, our Second Life, it's incredible.
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:59.580]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.580 --> 02:30:08.940]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:13.500]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:23.500]  There's a place down at Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans, they so pride
[02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:32.740]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond gusset in the
[02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:40.860]  crotch where you need it most, blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.

[02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:08.420]  country?
[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:12.060]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house,

[02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:05.060]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:09.420]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.420]  do you want?
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:12.420]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:17.460]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:18.700]  How much do you want?
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:19.780]  When do you want it?
[02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:22.820]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:24.940]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:24.940 --> 02:32:26.300]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:26.300 --> 02:32:27.780]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:31.900]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:33.060]  and be immunized?
[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:36.820]  Can you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply?
[02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:40.420]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:41.660]  How much will you need?
[02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:42.660]  We don't know.
[02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:43.660]  How much do you want?
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:44.660]  All you can get.
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:45.660]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:48.780]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:48.780 --> 02:32:56.180]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:56.180 --> 02:33:04.260]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:10.220]  We're going back to Max Kaiser.
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:12.660]  Your phone call is coming up in the next hour.
[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:18.820]  A bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet, but I want to talk about a host of issues and
[02:33:18.820 --> 02:33:20.500]  the gold situation with Max Kaiser.
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:21.500]  We went to break.
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:22.740]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:27.140]  I want to finish up with virtual currencies, scamming people that don't know they're getting
[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:30.580]  involved in virtual currencies that actually cost real currency.
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:33.420]  But before we do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made
[02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:35.180]  today's radio show possible.
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:39.660]  One of them is a cola blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:42.180]  It looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:46.340]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere and then puts it through seven to 12 filters depending
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:47.460]  on which unit you buy.
[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:49.700]  It's the best cleanest water you're going to find anywhere.
[02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:50.700]  I love a cola blue.
[02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:52.220]  I use it in my office and at home.
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:53.220]  C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[02:33:53.220 --> 02:34:03.300]  A cola blue.com or give them a call for an information packet, 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:06.740]  Or you can drink the government tap water because they care so much about you.
[02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:11.620]  Also frontsite.com, like the front of your rifle, frontsite.com.
[02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:14.260]  They've got two day, four day, five day training.
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:17.220]  It's the biggest private facility in the country for firearms training.
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:18.660]  They're great folks.
[02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:23.580]  If you act fast, the millionaire patriot, Dr. Renesius Piazza, will give you a free
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:26.860]  Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:31.260]  It's incredibly affordable and inexpensive to go take training there in handguns, rifles,
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:32.260]  or shotguns.
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:36.940]  You can get five days of world-class gun training at frontside firearms training institutes,
[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:40.300]  secure a 30-stake and seal weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar and get a free
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:41.420]  firearm.
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:44.260]  That's frontsite.com.
[02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:49.940]  And lastly, don't forget the online video bookstore at infowars.com, where you can get
[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:51.460]  Invisible Empire, a new lure to find.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:54.140]  Our newest film was released last week to rave reviews.
[02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:55.900]  Really is a powerful tool.
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:35:01.100]  And premiering in 48 hours at prisonplanet.tv, police state, the rise of FEMA.
[02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:04.380]  It's been eight years since I've made, or right at eight years since I've made a police
[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:09.100]  state film that covers the FEMA camps, the global estate cover, false flag terror, everything.
[02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:13.860]  This film will wake people up so you can order the DVD at infowars.com.
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:22.380]  Or call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or again, infowars.com.
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:25.060]  Okay, Max Kaiser, finishing up.
[02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:30.340]  We'll throw that Lennon Guardian article back up on screen, where it says that this game
[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:39.180]  Farmville, Farmville user runs up 900 pound, or basically a $1,500 debt, 12-year-old boy
[02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:42.060]  didn't know basically what he was part of.
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:44.940]  And you said this is something new that the manipulators are going to do.
[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:50.260]  I remember you probably four or five months ago talking about it here on the show.
[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:51.660]  Listeners remember it as well.
[02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:54.100]  Why is this so important?
[02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:58.060]  Because Facebook has over 400 million users, and they're going to start to roll out a new
[02:35:58.060 --> 02:35:59.060]  virtual currency.
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:04.900]  And this virtual currency is a new currency that is going to have no collateral whatsoever.
[02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:08.980]  They can just issue all the currency they want, but it does have interest bearing attached
[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:09.980]  to it.
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:13.780]  And you'll be looking here at county and say, here's 10,000 more Facebook dollars, and you'll
[02:36:13.780 --> 02:36:18.180]  start spending it, and you'll start playing with it on Farmville, or you'll start interacting
[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:19.620]  on these various virtual platforms.
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:23.380]  And at the end of the month, you'll say, well, the interest on your virtual currency is due.
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:25.860]  You owe us 20 bucks, real money.
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:30.820]  And I'm looking at a story that you post on your site on March 20 called, it says, a German
[02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:34.260]  central bank admits that credit is created out of thin air.
[02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:36.060]  This is on infowars.com.
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:42.740]  It says it talks about most people think that banks lend slowly on deposits, but in fact,
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:47.420]  the German central bank admits that they lend without any deposits at all.
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:49.340]  That's the definition of a virtual currency.
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:50.340]  They just lend.
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:51.540]  They have no deposits.
[02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:55.860]  Now, Facebook, which has 400 million users, students have 500 million users, are going
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:59.500]  to just lend virtual currency to people with an interest attached to it.
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:02.500]  They're going to be interacting with it, and at the end of the month, they'll owe real
[02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:05.820]  dollars interest, which of course, if they can't pay it, then it kicks up to the federal
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:09.700]  government, then they start to garnish your pay, then they start to try to get the cash
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:10.700]  from you.
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:14.140]  And you're right back at that casino, Gulag, that I've talked about so many times.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:15.900]  Well, let's go one further.
[02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:20.680]  I remember when I was in college and had absolutely no money, literally two, three, four credit
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:25.740]  cards a week were coming to me, and now that I have decent credit, and I'm not in debt
[02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:30.180]  that much, I don't get but a few credit cards a year sent to me in the mail.
[02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:36.340]  So they send you credit cards backed up with nothing, 20, 30% interest, and literally make
[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:37.820]  you a debt slave.
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:39.620]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:40.620]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:46.100]  You're dealing with the same thing, except it's more insidious than that, because you're
[02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:50.500]  going to be because online, it's in a game environment.
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:53.620]  And here's another story you should look at, it's on The Financial Times, it's called
[02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:57.500]  Games Pray On Your Mind by Christopher Caldwell.
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:01.780]  It talks about how these environments, like on Facebook and other places, are designed
[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:08.100]  by behavioral economists and casino operators to get you addicted, as you would in any casino.
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:15.260]  So it's not even economics at this point, it's just predatory lending by casino operators
[02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:16.740]  using these virtual currencies.
[02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:22.980]  It's a great story, it talks about in detail this new trend of applying behavioral economics
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:27.660]  and psychology to get people hooked on these virtual games and to just keep drawing down
[02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:31.740]  on virtual dollars, which means that they have to pay back in real money on the interest
[02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:32.740]  on those dollars.
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:37.780]  And let's be clear, that's what the new order is, and they define themselves this way now.
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:42.980]  It's global, private, central banks who are Ponzi scheme operators, but instead of the
[02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:48.420]  Ponzi scheme going bust and they've got a high tell with the money, now they take over
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:56.300]  your society after each bust that they create, and everything is literally like a matrix-like
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:39:01.140]  system where you take the game's second life and others with tens of millions of users,
[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:06.100]  they're spending 10, 20 hours a day in some cases, I read articles of people dying after
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:10.660]  three, four days playing these games, not even getting up from their chair, and they're
[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:11.660]  spending real money.
[02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:19.020]  A couple was raising a virtual child on an online game, they were in the video parlor
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:26.940]  for 12 hours, they collected their real child who died of starvation.
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:30.100]  And so when we talk about not being able to wake the public up that they're under mind
[02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:34.940]  control, now they admit what we already knew over a decade ago, propaganda placement, the
[02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:40.180]  corporations call it behavior placement, where the government and corporations are paying
[02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:45.700]  for ads that brainwash us inside of the television program, so when you're talking to your neighbor
[02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:49.260]  and you can't get through to them about real issues, it's because they're literally under
[02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:53.380]  mind control.
[02:39:53.380 --> 02:40:00.860]  Economically speaking, what banks know and what politicians know is that everybody will
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:07.020]  take free loans, and it goes back to the days when General Motors accept this corporation
[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:10.900]  or GMAC, figured out that they could lend money to people to buy cars, and that's how
[02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:16.420]  they became number one over Ford Motor, and that's why GMAC became much bigger to Ford
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:20.340]  Motor, the lending to buy cars than the actual car manufacturing.
[02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:24.100]  That's why they allowed cars to manufacture to go to Japan, because they made more money
[02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:29.660]  on lending and not on car manufacture, and that trend has been in place for 30 years
[02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:34.980]  where lending and financialization of the economy has taken precedence over all other
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:40.300]  aspects of the economy, and it has created a society that only looks at interest rates
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:44.300]  to determine their own self-worth and how much money they owe at the end of the month,
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:49.180]  and they're constantly willing to gamble at any given moment to try to get that debt level
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:53.180]  down, and of course they're always going to lose, because the economy is operated by
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:58.220]  casino operators whose business it is to create losing gamble.
[02:40:58.220 --> 02:41:04.100]  And so we have this false economy waging war against the real economy, another reason
[02:41:04.100 --> 02:41:08.940]  for the fake environmental movement, that allows the casino operators to go in and selectively
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:12.700]  shut down any business or corporation that doesn't play ball with them.
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:19.540]  I mean, this is a psychological warfare system run by a bunch of criminals, and the public
[02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:23.820]  is almost defenseless because they've been conditioned by the mind control that it's
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:25.460]  cool to not care.
[02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:30.420]  Well, because these technologies, because these games and currencies are attached to
[02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:36.100]  basic technologies like the use of a phone or other basic utilities like electricity,
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:39.420]  it's unavoidable, or like television.
[02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:43.980]  And so people come into contact with this, whether they like it or not, they are forced
[02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:47.220]  to come into contact with this, and they're forced to become hooked on this.
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:49.140]  So it's just like a ghetto environment.
[02:41:49.140 --> 02:41:53.060]  People in the ghetto get hooked on drugs because it's all around them.
[02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:58.060]  And this new Gulag casino ghetto of virtual currencies preys on the fact that people
[02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:04.580]  are unable to escape from this digital casino Gulag envelopment of their lives by bankers
[02:42:04.580 --> 02:42:07.500]  and technologists and virtual currency lenders.
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:13.060]  And now doctors are all over the place saying the 3D televisions literally put people into
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:17.860]  a dream state, even more than regular TV, and that it's causing seizures, it's causing
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:22.540]  people to pass out, it's causing mental illness, and all of television is about to convert
[02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:23.740]  to 3D.
[02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:26.700]  We are being inserted into this mental illness.
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:38.660]  Well, that's just part and parcel of a trend, which is to negate the reality of real world,
[02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:43.100]  the natural forces of reality, and to accept the digital reality as being real.
[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:47.220]  And that's what's so fantastic about this volcano in Iceland is that it's forcing people
[02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:52.740]  to understand that there is a real world, that there is an earth that can do things
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:54.620]  that will change people's lives.
[02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:59.260]  And for this reason, this volcano in Iceland is quite important for people to understand
[02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:01.980]  that it's not a digital event, it's not a Hollywood event.
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:07.620]  This is an actual volcano affecting the actual planet earth that we live in.
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:12.540]  And maybe this, you know, if it can shut down the grid and get people to understand
[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:19.020]  that they are human for at least a brief moment, then maybe there's a moment of sanity.
[02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:25.060]  And we see the UN coming in and saying pay us taxes and we'll stop the volcano.
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:31.860]  That's actually in the news, so you have the establishment waging war literally against
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:37.700]  reality and trying to force everyone into this matrix.
[02:43:37.700 --> 02:43:42.860]  I mean, almost every adult male I know doesn't research, isn't involved, doesn't care about
[02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:49.100]  their future, but they play fantasy football and really care believing they own sports
[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:50.100]  teams.
[02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:51.660]  Well, this is what I said is happening now.
[02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:54.860]  The fraudsters and the virtual currency and the prediction market operators are moving
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:58.940]  into this box office space with box office futures contracts.
[02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:01.540]  It's going to be a huge wave that's going to wash over.
[02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:06.180]  You got Jim Kramer talking about Scarlett Johansson moving up and down the canner exchange
[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:10.460]  and Iron Man part two and Iron Man part three, it's going to go global.
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:14.380]  People won't be able to resist it because you're mixing the fraud of Wall Street with
[02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:19.020]  the fantasy of Hollywood for a toxic cocktail that's going to blow people's accounts out
[02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:20.020]  of the...
[02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:22.460]  Once again, they're going to lose all their money and it's going to make some bankers
[02:44:22.460 --> 02:44:24.180]  very, very rich.
[02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:28.220]  Literally, we are being inserted into a matrix right now.
[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:29.340]  This is how it's happening.
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:34.020]  We're being sucked into the computers, sucked into the television, sucked into the false
[02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:36.020]  reality so fast.
[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:40.140]  Now let's get into gold because I want to get into gold and then back into the civil
[02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:44.740]  indictment of Goldman Sachs and where you think that's going and what's being charged
[02:44:44.740 --> 02:44:45.740]  there.
[02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:49.100]  Your specific view, is this a red herring, a slap on the wrist or is this the beginning
[02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:50.100]  of something new?
[02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:53.700]  Because we know Goldman Sachs literally runs the government along with JP Morgan and others.
[02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:58.700]  So what does Max Kaiser think is going on here or what's your intel?
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:03.380]  But back to the manipulation of the gold market, you have them pumping up fake things that
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:09.420]  aren't real into bubbles while suppressing a true commodity like silver or gold with
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:12.300]  more and more evidence coming out of how they're manipulating it.
[02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:13.940]  Yes, excellent point.
[02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:19.900]  Gold and silver are real and for that reason it's a threat to the Ponzi schemes, the pyramid
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:25.220]  operators and the Goldman Sachs derivative terrorist wielding psychopaths on Wall Street.
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:30.060]  It's real so it's a threat and for this reason they've kept the price down for years and
[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:33.740]  it's covered extensively by groups like Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee.
[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:38.300]  Now a couple of weeks ago there was a testimony in London that was put forward to the Commodity
[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:43.940]  Futures Trading Commission by Whistleblower who details insider trading and market manipulation
[02:45:43.940 --> 02:45:49.180]  of the London Bullying Market Association market as well as the COMEX and they laid
[02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:55.300]  out in no uncertain terms that the prices of silver in particular are just completely
[02:45:55.300 --> 02:46:02.020]  and utterly manipulated and the CFTC now has this irrefutable evidence before them.
[02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:06.580]  They haven't acted on it yet, I wouldn't expect them to act on it, but essentially the goal
[02:46:06.580 --> 02:46:12.460]  here is to keep the price of gold and silver low because if it were to rise it would be
[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:17.220]  reality rearing its ugly head and there would money would start to flow into something real
[02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:22.940]  and out of the complete fake digital synthesized airspots world of derivative trading and casino
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:28.860]  dual agism and that's why the price has been kept as low but there are people out there
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:33.980]  who have a lot of money who are forcing the exchanges like the London Bullying Market
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:41.420]  Association of COMEX who are short 100 times, they have 100 times more orders than they
[02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:47.460]  have actual gold in the vault so if these guys demand physical delivery of their silver
[02:46:47.460 --> 02:46:52.380]  and it's proven and it's shown that they don't have the silver to deliver, you have
[02:46:52.380 --> 02:46:57.700]  what's called a short squeeze so the market has to go out there and actually buy physical
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:03.020]  silver to deliver and then you have this ramp up in the price of gold and silver and
[02:47:03.020 --> 02:47:06.220]  that's kind of what people are waiting for right now is they're waiting for the other
[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:11.100]  shoe to drop, they're waiting for some major hedge fund to say look, we want physical delivery
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:13.460]  of our gold and silver, we want it this month.
[02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:16.460]  I talked about this on your show last year, I thought that this was going to happen on
[02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:20.860]  the COMEX last December but they were going to bust the COMEX and it looked like they
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:21.860]  were going to do that.
[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:26.500]  There was a guy up in Canada who was suggesting that he was going to bust the COMEX by demanding
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:31.180]  physical delivery of his gold and it never materialized at that time but the pressure
[02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:37.340]  has just been building ever since and as proffered opportunities are dwindling because now the
[02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:42.260]  FTC and other regulators are shutting down the Ponzi scheme, the guys with the big money,
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:47.780]  they realize that the last game in town, even George Soros said that gold will not be the
[02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:54.460]  last bubble, it'll be the last hurrah, the prices won't go to $2,500, prices will go
[02:47:54.460 --> 02:48:00.780]  to $10,000 to $15,000, it'll be a huge bubble, it'll be the last bubble and it's not too
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:06.420]  late, people got to own this thing now because ultimately when it's all exposed and it all
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:11.780]  comes crashing down, only those with the gold are going to be able to survive another day.
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:15.780]  And it won't matter if you bought gold at $1,000 and it goes up to $15,000, when it
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:20.460]  busts it goes back down to $6,000, it won't matter, the suckers are going to be the ones
[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:24.700]  that are buying it when it's $10,000 an ounce.
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:31.540]  The general rule of thumb is just every single month put some savings into gold going on and
[02:48:31.540 --> 02:48:37.140]  just do it religiously every month and this way you're always going to get an average
[02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:41.700]  price that's good and you're going to be protected now.
[02:48:41.700 --> 02:48:48.700]  That's just, it's not going to shoot up 300% in a week like some dot-com stock, it's not
[02:48:48.700 --> 02:48:54.460]  going to be like Goldman Sachs crashing in a day that if you're short, it's not a
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:55.460]  day trade.
[02:48:55.460 --> 02:48:58.780]  It's something you got to do and think about it intelligently and take an approach that
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:48:59.780]  works over time.
[02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:03.980]  I have been buying gold every month for eight years.
[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:06.180]  Me too.
[02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:07.340]  A little bit every month.
[02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:09.340]  Now let's get into Goldman Sachs.
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:14.020]  What does this SEC civil indictment mean?
[02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:24.340]  Well, it's really fascinating because they came out swinging last Friday with a very
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:32.660]  strong civil indictment and they laid out the case for alleged fraud and they've opened
[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:38.740]  the door now to others for criminal indictment and there's going to be a lot of lawsuits.
[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:44.940]  I'm looking for Andrew Cuomo in New York City, I think he could make a huge political gain
[02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:51.020]  if he did to Goldman what Rudy Giuliani did to Drexel Burnham back in the 1980s.
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:55.940]  If you remember, Drexel Burnham was the Goldman Sachs of his day before the stock market crash
[02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:59.340]  of 87 with Mike Milken and that crowd.
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:05.260]  Rudy Giuliani rode into town and busted up Drexel and it launched a huge political career
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:06.260]  for Rudy Giuliani.
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:12.380]  But this is much bigger and Goldman Sachs is running the looting globally.
[02:50:12.380 --> 02:50:14.900]  They're at the top, as you know, of almost every government.
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:18.300]  I don't see them allowing this to be brought down or are they getting ready to implode
[02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:21.740]  it and are they already moving their assets out into a new shell?
[02:50:21.740 --> 02:50:29.540]  Well, remember the busting of Drexel and Ivan Bosky and Dennis Levine and that whole period
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:35.140]  resulted in a 22% drop in the Dow Jones in one day on October 19th, 1987.
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:41.340]  To put that into context, you'd have to have a roughly a 2,500 point drop on the Dow in
[02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:42.340]  one day.
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:47.620]  So, it was a big news at the time and it was really a seismic, it was the biggest crash
[02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:49.020]  in history at the time.
[02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:54.340]  So, although we've seen really some pain in the last couple of years.
[02:50:54.340 --> 02:50:55.340]  Well, stay there, stay there.
[02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:56.340]  Got them right.
[02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:57.340]  Max Kaiser.
[02:50:57.340 --> 02:50:58.340]  MaxKaiser.com.

[02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:15.460]  documents.

[02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:22.300]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:27.140]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[02:52:27.140 --> 02:52:28.140]  world.
[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:33.340]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:35.820]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.820 --> 02:52:40.300]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:41.300]  financial system.
[02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:45.820]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20, so it's going to be an inner ruling

[02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:01.540]  did.
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:11.420]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:11.420 --> 02:54:16.020]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:22.180]  Max's weather is five minutes into the next hour and we got Ligredowski popping in with
[02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:26.700]  the big coup with Stephen Colbert.
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:27.900]  But this is a big deal.
[02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:33.260]  I mean, is the SEC basically run by Goldman Sachs being forced to do this because of the
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:34.260]  political pressure?
[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:36.140]  Is it just a slap on the wrist?
[02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:39.300]  Will the investigation be used to cover all this up?
[02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:41.840]  But absolutely what Max said is true.
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:43.740]  This will open up more investigations.
[02:54:43.740 --> 02:54:51.700]  Are they trying to beat states that have been filing civil charges against Goldman Sachs?
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:54.940]  That happened two weeks ago, two different states in the last two weeks.
[02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:59.060]  We're going to find out here, but if they get away with committing these crimes out
[02:54:59.060 --> 02:55:03.380]  in the open with their own documents proving this was premeditated with the housing market,
[02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:04.660]  the sky is the limit.
[02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:05.660]  Max Kaiser.
[02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:10.660]  Well, the costs are facing students in Greece, Germany, and the U.K. The number in Greece
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:16.260]  in the year 2000, Goldman engineered a swap that allowed Greece to hide debt that made
[02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:17.260]  them eligible for the Europe.
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:19.540]  Now, Greece is in deep financial trouble.
[02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:21.260]  The IMF is imposing austerity measures.
[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:25.300]  I've been on Greek radio many times and telling them that they should not even consider paying
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:29.180]  back the debt because it was fraudulently induced by Goldman back in 2000.
[02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:31.460]  So they have no obligation to pay the debt.
[02:55:31.460 --> 02:55:32.460]  Don't pay the debt.
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:33.460]  Germany is saying, wait a minute.
[02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:34.460]  Wait a minute.
[02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:37.300]  What about our banks that have to be bailed out based on these faulty bonds?
[02:55:37.300 --> 02:55:41.340]  How devastating was it that Iceland said no last month?
[02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:46.860]  Iceland said no to the $5 billion ice date bill that the U.K. and the Netherlands wanted
[02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:52.500]  to try to extract from them based on the behavior of some banking crooks.
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:54.860]  And they voted 93% and said no.
[02:55:54.860 --> 02:55:58.100]  So the Icelandic people have taken a stand and Icelandic people.
[02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:01.180]  And now I talk to the journalists in Greece and the people in Greece are going to join
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:02.420]  with the people of Iceland.
[02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:06.340]  So this is becoming a global insurrection against banker occupation.
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:07.340]  Okay.
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:08.340]  You just said it.
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:09.340]  Let me stop you.
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:12.780]  A global insurrection against banker occupation.
[02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:15.980]  So they're trying to sew it up now with a global government run by them to shut us
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:16.980]  down.
[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:22.420]  And I've seen a year long buildup to stage terror attacks and the feds now hyping nuke
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:26.900]  attacks in the U.S. and trying to tie it into Iran and domestic groups.
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:32.460]  The only card I see them being able to play to launch New Wars Max and to have a domestic
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:34.580]  clampdown is stage terror.
[02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:37.460]  What's your take on that?
[02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:42.300]  My stage is that this problem is happening all over the world in these other countries.
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:45.820]  And what we're seeing is this global insurrection against banking occupation.
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:49.420]  And through the internet and other means, people are getting together to figure out how to push
[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:55.820]  back against the occupying force, the neo-colonial, neo-imperial force of these banking oligarchs
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:57.540]  on Wall Street and around the world.
[02:56:57.540 --> 02:56:59.980]  They're coming up with strategies to do that.
[02:56:59.980 --> 02:57:04.540]  And it's going to happen in pockets of resistance in countries and communities all over the
[02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:05.540]  world.
[02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:06.540]  This is not just an American problem.
[02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:09.020]  It's not just a U.K. problem or a Greek problem.
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:12.540]  This is happening for everyone in countries all over the world.
[02:57:12.540 --> 02:57:13.540]  Have they overreached?
[02:57:13.540 --> 02:57:14.540]  Have they overreached?
[02:57:14.540 --> 02:57:15.620]  Because they look scared now.
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:16.620]  They're acting scared.
[02:57:16.620 --> 02:57:22.140]  I think the problem they have is that for 25 years, every time they made a mistake, they
[02:57:22.140 --> 02:57:26.460]  would get bailed out by a rise in bond prices.
[02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:31.500]  As long as interest rates were cheap, they could always repackage, resell, and extend
[02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:36.740]  the maturity of the bonds that they were using to perpetrate all of their insidious little
[02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:37.740]  insider games.
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:43.100]  But now that that market has reached the end of a 25-year bull market, there is no more
[02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:47.620]  opportunity to repackage these bonds anymore, and they're collapsing.
[02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:54.300]  And it's causing what the economists call a disruption in the cohesion index.
[02:57:54.300 --> 02:57:56.940]  They have identified what they call the cohesion index.
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:58:03.140]  That is the index to determine at what stage are different countries about to insurrect.
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:05.420]  The United States is relatively high.
[02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:07.620]  The U.K. is relatively high.
[02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:11.980]  But we have on the cohesion index, you've got countries like Iceland is already revolting
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:14.060]  and other countries are already revolting.
[02:58:14.060 --> 02:58:18.820]  So the Economist magazine is already setting up an index around this revolt, this global
[02:58:18.820 --> 02:58:21.540]  insurrection, and they're already putting numbers attached to it.
[02:58:21.540 --> 02:58:23.380]  They're already, you know, quantifying it.
[02:58:23.380 --> 02:58:27.060]  Well, that's what the Ministry of British Defense, the British Defense Ministry said
[02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:28.260]  three years ago.
[02:58:28.260 --> 02:58:31.460]  They predicted this in and around 2010, 11, 12.
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:36.700]  We're going to be back for five minutes as we start the fourth hour with Max Kaiser.
[02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:43.900]  My question to him is, how does he see all this unwinding?
[02:58:43.900 --> 02:58:51.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.900 --> 02:58:53.260]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.260 --> 02:58:57.220]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:58:57.220 --> 02:58:58.860]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:02.900]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:03.900]  or gold?
[02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:07.340]  These true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:09.500]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:14.060]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:59:14.060 --> 02:59:15.060]  seeds.
[02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:19.980]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[02:59:19.980 --> 02:59:21.820]  food for you and your family.
[02:59:21.820 --> 02:59:25.740]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:29.620]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:29.620 --> 02:59:32.860]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:32.860 --> 02:59:37.060]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:41.020]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:41.020 --> 02:59:48.700]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:48.700 --> 03:00:11.780]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:00:11.780 --> 03:00:40.180]  Alex, we were just saying, we know what the game is, it's no big secret anymore.
[03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:45.220]  There's a group of bankers who are seeking to reinstate feudalism.
[03:00:45.220 --> 03:00:51.220]  They were upset that they had to give any of their power away during the rise of what's
[03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:54.820]  called the Enlightenment and the last 200 years.
[03:00:54.820 --> 03:01:00.420]  Now your show reaches out to millions, and my comment to you is that you're spreading
[03:01:00.420 --> 03:01:07.700]  your best to plant, and you are attacking back in a way that diffuses your greatest strength,
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:11.660]  which is this grassroots power force.
[03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:17.420]  To that, what I say is, you need a win in your column.
[03:01:17.420 --> 03:01:19.100]  You need to take a scalp here.
[03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:23.820]  You need to have a win, and the easiest thing that your listeners can do, that you and your
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:30.100]  listeners can do, is to take down a Fortune 100 company, take down a Dow Jones company,
[03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:35.300]  and the easiest company to take down, one who's got a huge investor warm-buffet, one
[03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:36.300]  who's known to be-
[03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:40.020]  Coca-Cola, we go back to your obsession with Coca-Cola.
[03:01:40.020 --> 03:01:41.700]  It's not an obsession.
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:49.060]  It's just a practical application of the only thing you have, which is a no-cost resistance.
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:53.540]  Wait a minute, we've taken plenty of scalps, Max.
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:54.660]  Look at the Copenhagen thing.
[03:01:54.660 --> 03:01:55.820]  We all did that together.
[03:01:55.820 --> 03:01:57.620]  Look at all the other victories we're having.
[03:01:57.620 --> 03:02:01.820]  Look at how we exposed democratic operatives dressed up like Nazis at tea parties.
[03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:02.820]  What are you saying?
[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:03.820]  Take a scalp.
[03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:10.260]  I'm saying that the measure of wealth and income in America is getting wider and wider.
[03:02:10.260 --> 03:02:13.500]  The poorer are getting poorer, and the rich are getting richer.
[03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:17.300]  That's how I determine if the scalps are being taken and who's winning.
[03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:23.620]  My suggestion is to marshal your forces and boycott Coca-Cola until that stock price goes
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:24.700]  to zero.
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:29.860]  You wipe out Coke, you punch warm-buffet in the nose because he's one of the biggest shareholders
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:35.700]  of Coke, you demonstrate that you've got the power to take on a Fortune 100 company, and
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:37.660]  now suddenly you're in the driver's seat.
[03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:40.860]  You have to look at what's dear to these people.
[03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:42.100]  It's their stock price.
[03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:44.020]  They have no morals, no ethics.
[03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:49.700]  They've got no compulsion about destroying their selves and their society and their
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:50.700]  country.
[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:52.380]  They only care about their stock price.
[03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:56.060]  Therefore, the only way you can fight back is to take their stock price down, and the
[03:02:56.060 --> 03:03:00.500]  boycott is the cheapest, easiest, no-cost solution, and just look at the stock price.
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:03.860]  If it's going down, you're winning, and take it down to zero.
[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:07.380]  Okay, let me throw something in here.
[03:03:07.380 --> 03:03:10.960]  There's more than one way to skin a cat, and we're going on all fronts because that's most
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:17.540]  effective in my opinion, is just to expose the fraud, and the people will do the rest.
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:18.940]  Look at Washington.
[03:03:18.940 --> 03:03:20.100]  It's illegitimate.
[03:03:20.100 --> 03:03:22.060]  It's owned by foreign banks.
[03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:27.620]  We take the states back, then the offshore banks and brokerage firms won't have the federal
[03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:30.740]  government funding them with all our tax money.
[03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:37.260]  Yeah, but that's great if you run a multi-billion dollar hedge fund, and you have a seat at
[03:03:37.260 --> 03:03:42.060]  the table, and you can have a big swinging, you know, I don't want to say the word, but
[03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:43.060]  you don't.
[03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:48.340]  All you have are a lot of people who are angry who have not the same amount of money and
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:54.740]  who are being victimized by these consumer products, predatory lending, psychopaths,
[03:03:54.740 --> 03:04:00.380]  and you have to also be aware that a single metric, which is a stock price, can work both
[03:04:00.380 --> 03:04:01.380]  ways.
[03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:05.900]  Not only does it show how much money the bad guys are making, but it can also show how
[03:04:05.900 --> 03:04:09.060]  effective your campaign is against them.
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:13.340]  You know, when you go on the air every week and you say, Coca-Cola stock price is down
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:16.540]  another 10% this week, we have one.
[03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:20.100]  It's right there in black and white in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, and before
[03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:24.780]  you know it, they're going to be coming to you begging you to call off your forces.
[03:04:24.780 --> 03:04:26.740]  They're going to be coming to you begging you.
[03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:31.220]  But won't the bankers then just, won't the plunge protection team just quietly buy Coca-Cola
[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:33.220]  stock?
[03:04:33.220 --> 03:04:37.980]  Anything that'll cost them money, and they hate to spend money, because you're killing
[03:04:37.980 --> 03:04:41.940]  them where that word hurts, they can buy the stock, they can increase the dividend, they
[03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:45.660]  can spend money on marketing, but they don't want to spend money, they want to take the
[03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:46.660]  money.
[03:04:46.660 --> 03:04:47.660]  They hate spending money.
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:50.180]  If they start spending money to buy back their own stock, you're winning.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:54.180]  All right, look, we're going to have you back up soon, and we'll spend 30 minutes of an
[03:04:54.180 --> 03:04:55.180]  hour on that.
[03:04:55.180 --> 03:04:56.180]  Max Kaiser, MaxKaiser.com.
[03:04:56.180 --> 03:04:57.180]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[03:04:57.180 --> 03:04:58.180]  All right, buddy.
[03:04:58.180 --> 03:05:00.700]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:09.900]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[03:05:09.900 --> 03:05:14.020]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:15.020]  documents.
[03:05:15.020 --> 03:05:19.460]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:05:19.460 --> 03:05:21.940]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:05:21.940 --> 03:05:24.700]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:28.020]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:05:28.020 --> 03:05:32.980]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:05:32.980 --> 03:05:35.460]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:05:35.460 --> 03:05:39.660]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:41.260]  global financial system.
[03:05:41.260 --> 03:05:43.820]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:05:43.820 --> 03:05:47.540]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else.
[03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:48.700]  And I got news for you.
[03:05:48.700 --> 03:05:49.820]  You're everyone else.

[03:08:03.980 --> 03:08:10.540]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.540 --> 03:08:24.060]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:24.060 --> 03:08:28.620]  Okay for stations that just joined us, coming up, we've discovered a secret FEMA document
[03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:33.300]  confirmed to be real, they've been telling major newspapers to remove it, like the Christian
[03:08:33.300 --> 03:08:39.980]  Science Monitor and others, and publicintelligence.com, and you've got Obama saying we're going
[03:08:39.980 --> 03:08:40.980]  to be nuked.
[03:08:40.980 --> 03:08:47.540]  The FBI director saying domestic groups are the number one threat now, or as bad as Al-Qaeda.
[03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:52.860]  You've got this crescendo of the media saying the Tea Parties aren't just racist, which
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:57.700]  they've been caught with Democratic operatives dressed up like Nazis, red-handed now, something
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:03.340]  we broke three weeks ago that's now become mainstream news, but Bill Clinton's saying,
[03:09:03.340 --> 03:09:07.660]  gee, he hopes there's going to have to be a terror attack to make the Tea Party shut
[03:09:07.660 --> 03:09:08.660]  up.
[03:09:08.660 --> 03:09:10.100]  What happens to gain from that terror attack?
[03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:14.540]  See, he's saying, this will discredit you, and he's saying this on Wolf Blitzer.
[03:09:14.540 --> 03:09:19.060]  Oklahoma City 15 years ago today was a staged event.
[03:09:19.060 --> 03:09:23.300]  We go over the evidence in road to tyranny.
[03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:28.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, the American people are standing up against the criminality in Washington,
[03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:30.140]  and the oldest trick in the book is the stage events.
[03:09:30.140 --> 03:09:35.780]  We see all this media hype, all this prep for this in the near future.
[03:09:35.780 --> 03:09:40.420]  I'll be breaking that down coming up after Luke Radowski leaves us, but I wanted to get
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:48.340]  Luke on because last week he got into the Stephen Colbert report, and he stood up in
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:52.580]  the crowd and talked to him about the New World Order, and Colbert thought he was talking
[03:09:52.580 --> 03:09:57.180]  about Bohemian Grove, which is one of the secret societies, but more of their party
[03:09:57.180 --> 03:09:58.180]  arm.
[03:09:58.180 --> 03:10:03.420]  He said, no Bilderberg group, and then when Colbert went live, he talked about it, but
[03:10:03.420 --> 03:10:06.420]  that's just one of the reasons we have Luke on today.
[03:10:06.420 --> 03:10:08.940]  So much is happening.
[03:10:08.940 --> 03:10:12.700]  The momentum is intensifying for liberty and freedom.
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:18.740]  The awakening is accelerating, Greece, Iceland, others are saying no to the bank or takeovers,
[03:10:18.740 --> 03:10:24.420]  and that's why we know they're going to stage terror attacks, possibly even nuclear, as
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:32.820]  a pretext to bring in total police state control, and that's why this NLEO10, 2010 FEMA
[03:10:32.820 --> 03:10:34.260]  document, is so important.
[03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:38.820]  Luke, your take on false flag terrorism on the 15th anniversary of Oklahoma City.
[03:10:38.820 --> 03:10:42.540]  I mean, it's been something that governments have been doing throughout history, it wouldn't
[03:10:42.540 --> 03:10:47.660]  surprise us if they would use it against people who are demanding righteousness and truth
[03:10:47.660 --> 03:10:51.660]  from our government and accountability, so we have to keep an eye on provocateurs, we
[03:10:51.660 --> 03:10:54.740]  have to keep an eye on all these false flags that are going on.
[03:10:54.740 --> 03:11:01.500]  At the same time, we have to resend our message saying we are against violence, against provocateurs,
[03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:07.020]  and expose false flag attacks, because as soon as we expose 9-11, Oklahoma City and
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:11.660]  the 93 World Trade Center bottom, it's the less likely chances there is of another false
[03:11:11.660 --> 03:11:12.660]  flag.
[03:11:12.660 --> 03:11:16.740]  The more we expose 9-11, the more chances we have of saving this republic and stopping
[03:11:16.740 --> 03:11:18.540]  another false flag from happening.
[03:11:18.540 --> 03:11:22.700]  Well, I mean, let's talk about just we are changed, you found it two and a half years
[03:11:22.700 --> 03:11:27.340]  ago, hundreds of chapters around the world, because it is decentralized, just an idea,
[03:11:27.340 --> 03:11:29.580]  be the change you want to see in the world, be nonviolent.
[03:11:29.580 --> 03:11:37.540]  Absolutely, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you
[03:11:37.540 --> 03:11:38.540]  win.
[03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:41.260]  But Luke, look at the false flags you've been through.
[03:11:41.260 --> 03:11:48.420]  In truth rising, we have the video of New York City police when you're protesting.
[03:11:48.420 --> 03:11:54.100]  We lost audio with Luke, because everybody has to do these interviews on cell phones.
[03:11:54.100 --> 03:11:57.700]  He just came out of his college class.
[03:11:57.700 --> 03:12:02.660]  Luke is there, and the police come over, and they're protesting peacefully and legally,
[03:12:02.660 --> 03:12:07.140]  and they say, you've got a bomb in your bag.
[03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:09.420]  They say, your camera is a gun.
[03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:12.220]  We know you don't have a bomb, but we're going to frame you.
[03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:14.220]  And they do this on video.
[03:12:14.220 --> 03:12:20.260]  And then we had the German talus, this was in the New York Post, in Oliver Fox News,
[03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:26.940]  a man comes out of a dark corner, an alley, with his daughter in a wheelchair ramming
[03:12:26.940 --> 03:12:30.740]  it into Mr. Talus, saying, don't attack her, don't attack her.
[03:12:30.740 --> 03:12:32.660]  They arrest Mr. Talus.
[03:12:32.660 --> 03:12:35.820]  They throw the book at him, try to get him to plea bargain.
[03:12:35.820 --> 03:12:40.820]  But then it came out that it was all staged in court, and the New York Post had to retract.
[03:12:40.820 --> 03:12:45.540]  So if they're going into tea parties dressed up like Nazis to discredit us, or anybody
[03:12:45.540 --> 03:12:51.060]  that wants to audit the Fed, if they're provocaturing and trying to say you have bombs, I mean,
[03:12:51.060 --> 03:12:55.340]  this is what they do on the local scale, but think about the international scale, Luke
[03:12:55.340 --> 03:12:56.340]  Radowski.
[03:12:56.340 --> 03:12:59.620]  Yes, they definitely are doing false flag attacks.
[03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:01.340]  They've been doing it throughout history.
[03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:06.620]  But we have to expose not 11 Oklahoma City, the 93 world space that are bombing, to tell
[03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:08.620]  everybody that these are false flags.
[03:13:08.620 --> 03:13:12.940]  And the more we expose false flags, the less likelihood of another false flag happening
[03:13:12.940 --> 03:13:15.260]  here in America is going to happen.
[03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:21.060]  And we have to reiterate, we are peaceful, nonviolent protesters willing to fight for
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:23.020]  sovereignty, liberty, and freedom.
[03:13:23.020 --> 03:13:26.420]  There's no reason we should become what the government is, and that's violent, and we
[03:13:26.420 --> 03:13:30.660]  are here standing up for what's really right in this country, and making a stand to save
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:32.540]  this republic.
[03:13:32.540 --> 03:13:38.780]  Separately, the Southern Poverty Law Center, who was running Elohim City that McVeigh was
[03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:44.820]  at, that's come out in federal documents, they are listing you and I in their most wanted
[03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:54.020]  list, and the headline for me is, Telling Tall Tales, Alex Jones 36, he's out to save
[03:13:54.020 --> 03:13:55.020]  the world.
[03:13:55.020 --> 03:13:56.020]  I'm telling tall tales.
[03:13:56.020 --> 03:14:00.980]  I read the New York Times when they indict Goldman Sachs, and then it says, the patriot
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:06.940]  journalist, Luke Radowski, 23, and they've got us in here as these deadly dangerous demons.
[03:14:06.940 --> 03:14:10.900]  Yeah, they call us white wingers, but we're not white at all.
[03:14:10.900 --> 03:14:15.300]  I don't even understand why Glenn Beck was in there when Glenn Beck is pretty much a spokesperson
[03:14:15.300 --> 03:14:19.060]  for the establishment, only doing it for his money.
[03:14:19.060 --> 03:14:23.940]  And we're out here fighting for freedom, liberty, sovereignty, and we're doing what the founding
[03:14:23.940 --> 03:14:27.940]  fathers did in this country, and they're calling us extremists and ablers.
[03:14:27.940 --> 03:14:30.220]  I mean, we are here fighting for freedom.
[03:14:30.220 --> 03:14:35.660]  We are here standing up, and to have them attack us, it just shows how desperate they
[03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:42.980]  are to describe a real dissenters, real patriots as these terrorists.
[03:14:42.980 --> 03:14:47.460]  The next thing that's going to probably come in is a terrorist watch list, if we're not
[03:14:47.460 --> 03:14:48.460]  already on it.
[03:14:48.460 --> 03:14:51.220]  All right, let's shift gears now into Colbert.
[03:14:51.220 --> 03:14:59.820]  This is an example of how anybody can go to Bill Maher's TV show, or Colbert's show,
[03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:06.580]  or David Letterman's show, or anywhere where there's media cameras, when NBC's live on
[03:15:06.580 --> 03:15:10.140]  the streets, whatever, and reach out to millions of people.
[03:15:10.140 --> 03:15:11.780]  Tell folks what happened with Stephen Colbert.
[03:15:11.780 --> 03:15:15.580]  I mean, we moved to the show before, and he does a little question and answer, so you
[03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:17.860]  know, I had my hand up, I talked to him.
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:21.900]  And the video that you guys see on YouTube is actually half of the conversation.
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:25.620]  They wouldn't let us film, so we filmed as much as we could of a conversation.
[03:15:25.620 --> 03:15:26.620]  We talked to him.
[03:15:26.620 --> 03:15:29.740]  And I'm telling you, I talked to other people in the mainstream media.
[03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:35.100]  I mean, chief editors of The New York Times, Brian Williams, Lou Dobbs, Falls On, and so
[03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:36.340]  on, and so on.
[03:15:36.340 --> 03:15:39.540]  And whenever we bring up Bilderberg, they hide and they run away from it.
[03:15:39.540 --> 03:15:42.620]  But Stephen, you know, he said, yeah, he knows about it, and he actually even talked
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:47.300]  about the believing in growth, how billionaires, you know, run around naked and worships so
[03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:48.300]  and how.
[03:15:48.300 --> 03:15:50.060]  He even talked about that with us.
[03:15:50.060 --> 03:15:54.060]  And then he actually shouted out, he said, when's the last time somebody in mainstream
[03:15:54.060 --> 03:15:56.100]  media ever brought up the Bilderberg group?
[03:15:56.100 --> 03:16:00.380]  Well, he did it just a couple of days ago to millions and millions of viewers.
[03:16:00.380 --> 03:16:03.180]  Many people who never heard of the subject will look it up on Google.
[03:16:03.180 --> 03:16:05.620]  It's a huge success for InfoWare.
[03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:10.260]  And it's amazing seeing somebody from the mainstream actually get it and actually know
[03:16:10.260 --> 03:16:14.340]  what's going on and actually mention it on his female TV show because the issues we're
[03:16:14.340 --> 03:16:15.860]  talking about is serious.
[03:16:15.860 --> 03:16:19.820]  You get harassed, I get harassed, you know, and all these other journalists who have the
[03:16:19.820 --> 03:16:25.820]  Cajonos to actually go after and talk about these elites, we are targeted, we are harassed.
[03:16:25.820 --> 03:16:29.060]  But to have somebody like Stephen Colbert just send out that message to the millions
[03:16:29.060 --> 03:16:30.580]  of people is an amazing thing.
[03:16:30.580 --> 03:16:32.540]  Well, let's be clear.
[03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:37.380]  Just 10 years ago, the news would write headlines saying it's a conspiracy theory Bilderberg
[03:16:37.380 --> 03:16:38.380]  doesn't exist.
[03:16:38.380 --> 03:16:44.900]  Now, financial times of London, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, hundreds of publications
[03:16:44.900 --> 03:16:47.940]  a month say, yeah, world government's real.
[03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:50.660]  It needs to be authoritarian to save the planet.
[03:16:50.660 --> 03:16:52.900]  And we have been building it in secret.
[03:16:52.900 --> 03:16:54.620]  And it's a good thing.
[03:16:54.620 --> 03:17:01.180]  So they've gone from denying it existed to saying, yeah, it exists, but it's tyrannical
[03:17:01.180 --> 03:17:02.620]  for your own good.
[03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:06.540]  But then separately, the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center will write articles saying
[03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:10.740]  you're dangerous and violent when you've never said that just because you're saying, I don't
[03:17:10.740 --> 03:17:12.460]  want to be a global corporate slave.
[03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:17.980]  I mean, we're standing up for humanity right now without the solid poverty law center point
[03:17:17.980 --> 03:17:18.980]  our fingers at it.
[03:17:18.980 --> 03:17:22.740]  I mean, it shows one, that we're doing something right, two, they're getting desperate, it's
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:23.740]  not going to work.
[03:17:23.740 --> 03:17:28.260]  We just have to stand for what's right, educate people about false lies, educate the people
[03:17:28.260 --> 03:17:32.900]  about these secret societies that rule our lives in secret, that we as the people of
[03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:36.820]  this country, people of this world even deserve to know everything these people do.
[03:17:36.820 --> 03:17:41.500]  I mean, everything described in the visible empire, these people are responsible for it.
[03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:45.220]  And we have to put a stop to it if you want to save this country.
[03:17:45.220 --> 03:17:46.220]  Absolutely.
[03:17:46.220 --> 03:17:50.380]  And I say this a lot and I'll say it again, the denial is over.
[03:17:50.380 --> 03:17:54.820]  I mean, I'm here scanning over the Southern Poverty Law Center article demonizing us and
[03:17:54.820 --> 03:17:59.460]  others and they just keep saying we're kooks that believe in a world government.
[03:17:59.460 --> 03:18:03.620]  I mean, world governments being announced everywhere, the banks are robbing everyone.
[03:18:03.620 --> 03:18:08.260]  This isn't going to work when they stage a new Oklahoma City, which clearly they're
[03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:12.180]  programming the public to blame us when it happens.
[03:18:12.180 --> 03:18:15.260]  When they stage it, it's not going to go the way it went last time when the feds blew
[03:18:15.260 --> 03:18:16.260]  up OKC.
[03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:21.380]  It's definitely not because there's so many people waking up every single day because
[03:18:21.380 --> 03:18:26.260]  of your documentaries because of our work as well that we're not going to stand for.
[03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:27.260]  It's not going to work.
[03:18:27.260 --> 03:18:31.740]  And the more we expose it, the less likely it is of them doing it is going to happen.
[03:18:31.740 --> 03:18:33.340]  So we have to fight for our freedoms.
[03:18:33.340 --> 03:18:34.340]  Remember, not 11.
[03:18:34.340 --> 03:18:38.420]  We're going to be out there this year on the ninth anniversary building towards the
[03:18:38.420 --> 03:18:43.340]  10th anniversary of not 11 standing at ground zero with thousands of protesters demanding
[03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:48.340]  the truth and accountability from our government, exposing the secret societies, our rule of
[03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:50.980]  secret, and working together for a better tomorrow.
[03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:52.500]  And we all have to come together.
[03:18:52.500 --> 03:18:56.540]  We all have to hold screens in our local communities of your documentaries.
[03:18:56.540 --> 03:18:59.860]  We did one here of Invisible Empire this Saturday and it packed the house.
[03:18:59.860 --> 03:19:05.100]  And we're doing another one here in New York City with Police State 4 at 56 Walker Street
[03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:09.620]  this Saturday to educate the New York City residents and community either about the police
[03:19:09.620 --> 03:19:12.900]  state that's slowly destroying our country.
[03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:18.460]  And again, if people just take my films and if they just make copies of them and if they
[03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:22.300]  just hold public viewings, it'll pack out.
[03:19:22.300 --> 03:19:23.300]  I mean, you build it.
[03:19:23.300 --> 03:19:24.300]  They will come.
[03:19:24.300 --> 03:19:27.460]  I mean, look, look at you three, four years ago getting involved.
[03:19:27.460 --> 03:19:28.460]  Well, you found it.
[03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:30.940]  We are changed two and a half, three years ago.
[03:19:30.940 --> 03:19:33.140]  And look at the effect you've had.
[03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:36.500]  Everyone can do that if they have the truth and have the passion.
[03:19:36.500 --> 03:19:40.180]  If folks go up to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com, they can watch the Stephen
[03:19:40.180 --> 03:19:46.660]  Colbert video in full, we can also go to we are change dot or G we are change dot or G
[03:19:46.660 --> 03:19:51.340]  when we come back, we're going to play some excerpts of Luke's talk with Stephen Colbert
[03:19:51.340 --> 03:19:53.620]  and then Colbert is live response.
[03:19:53.620 --> 03:19:56.780]  Once you went on television, we'll be right back with Luke Radowski.
[03:19:56.780 --> 03:19:59.380]  Then coming up the false flag nuke attack.
[03:19:59.380 --> 03:20:00.380]  It's in the pike.
[03:20:00.380 --> 03:20:02.180]  They're going to try to blame it on the American people.
[03:20:02.180 --> 03:20:06.780]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:20:06.780 --> 03:20:11.780]  Here on is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:11.780 --> 03:20:14.300]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:14.300 --> 03:20:18.820]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[03:20:18.820 --> 03:20:20.100]  on earth.
[03:20:20.100 --> 03:20:24.900]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[03:20:24.900 --> 03:20:26.740]  expanded nationwide.
[03:20:26.740 --> 03:20:30.980]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[03:20:30.980 --> 03:20:32.820]  powerful shadow state.
[03:20:32.820 --> 03:20:37.660]  The state for chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic is formed, prepare to
[03:20:37.660 --> 03:20:44.420]  enter the secret of word of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[03:20:44.420 --> 03:20:47.140]  stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:50.620]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[03:20:50.620 --> 03:20:52.660]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:20:52.660 --> 03:20:53.660]  It's here.

[03:22:01.420 --> 03:22:05.580]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change, not the change we were
[03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:09.660]  promised by President Obama but the reality that we must face in these changing economic
[03:22:09.660 --> 03:22:10.660]  times.
[03:22:10.660 --> 03:22:14.820]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion and our unfunded liabilities
[03:22:14.820 --> 03:22:19.820]  totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the US dollar continues its slide into oblivion.

[03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:37.300]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of
[03:22:37.300 --> 03:22:41.220]  our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation
[03:22:41.220 --> 03:22:42.460]  with precious metals.

[03:24:07.900 --> 03:24:11.900]  Everybody knows, ladies and gentlemen, the dice are loaded.
[03:24:11.900 --> 03:24:23.660]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed, everybody knows, the war is over, the good
[03:24:23.660 --> 03:24:29.140]  guy's lost, but if we can identify the New World Order, we can defeat them and bring
[03:24:29.140 --> 03:24:30.140]  them down.
[03:24:30.140 --> 03:24:33.900]  Okay, so Luke's girlfriend started taping this about halfway in, this is him warming
[03:24:33.900 --> 03:24:35.580]  up the studio audience.
[03:24:35.580 --> 03:24:39.900]  He has a discussion with him, Colbert thinks he's talking about Bohemian Grove, which
[03:24:39.900 --> 03:24:44.460]  she has covered before, making fun of the Republicans, running around naked, having
[03:24:44.460 --> 03:24:46.620]  gay sex, which is what they do.
[03:24:46.620 --> 03:24:53.140]  That's how crazy our elites are, and generally the Republicans like men at the leadership
[03:24:53.140 --> 03:24:55.220]  levels and the Democrats like women.
[03:24:55.220 --> 03:25:00.500]  That's not a total rule, like with Barney Frank, but it's very strange.
[03:25:00.500 --> 03:25:01.500]  But this is separate.
[03:25:01.500 --> 03:25:04.340]  This is an elite political meeting, Bilderberg.
[03:25:04.340 --> 03:25:11.340]  Here it is.
[03:25:11.340 --> 03:25:40.900]  We actually confront Bilderberg members like Bill Clinton,
[03:25:40.900 --> 03:25:42.820]  the IMF head, the World Bank head.
[03:25:42.820 --> 03:25:46.580]  We actually confront them on video cameras and we tell them what do you do at these meetings
[03:25:46.580 --> 03:25:51.100]  and they run away, like we have everything on video, and it's just the world's elite.
[03:25:51.100 --> 03:25:55.140]  If I was a billionaire, I'd just be naked all the time.
[03:25:55.140 --> 03:25:57.140]  They were some big stone owl.
[03:25:57.140 --> 03:25:58.780]  That's the Bohemian Grove.
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:01.900]  The Bilderberg group is different than the Bohemian Grove.
[03:26:01.900 --> 03:26:03.620]  The Bilderberg group is more secret.
[03:26:03.620 --> 03:26:05.620]  It's not a little vacation.
[03:26:05.620 --> 03:26:20.340]  Now we weren't allowed to film, so I'm sorry for the video quality, but we have to clandestinely
[03:26:20.340 --> 03:26:24.180]  film in the middle of our conversation.
[03:26:24.180 --> 03:26:30.460]  But you know, after the conversation I had with Stephen, he goes and sits down and he
[03:26:30.460 --> 03:26:34.860]  does his new segment, and in the middle of his new segment, he just goes off and says,
[03:26:34.860 --> 03:26:36.180]  buddy, thank you for joining us.
[03:26:36.180 --> 03:26:40.020]  I just want to thank you for the welcome you just gave me and I just want to say that anybody
[03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:54.060]  out there watching that if you're in the secret Bilderberg group, please don't assassinate
[03:26:54.060 --> 03:26:55.060]  freelance reporters.
[03:26:55.060 --> 03:26:56.060]  It's just not nice, guys.
[03:26:56.060 --> 03:26:57.060]  It's not nice.
[03:26:57.060 --> 03:26:58.060]  And please call me.
[03:26:58.060 --> 03:26:59.060]  Call me.
[03:26:59.060 --> 03:27:00.060]  The only one, buddy.
[03:27:00.060 --> 03:27:01.060]  Okay.
[03:27:01.060 --> 03:27:09.060]  He seems like a pretty nice guy, doesn't he?
[03:27:09.060 --> 03:27:10.700]  Very good, a good guy.
[03:27:10.700 --> 03:27:14.420]  And he'd mentioned, you know, the skull and bones of the Bohemian Grove before on this
[03:27:14.420 --> 03:27:15.420]  show.
[03:27:15.420 --> 03:27:18.380]  So I think just anybody going out there, anybody could do it.
[03:27:18.380 --> 03:27:22.420]  You just have to go out there, talk to these people like they're human beings, and having
[03:27:22.420 --> 03:27:27.900]  that conversation, having that dialogue, and not being afraid to speak truth is so important.
[03:27:27.900 --> 03:27:31.780]  And it just shows that anybody can do this, the power we have to reach out to millions
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:34.980]  is within you and we can do anything and nothing is impossible.
[03:27:34.980 --> 03:27:41.180]  And importantly, we are a change and myself going back over more than a decade, I always
[03:27:41.180 --> 03:27:42.180]  am nice.
[03:27:42.180 --> 03:27:45.620]  Like when I asked George Bush a question, he had me arrested when he was governor at
[03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:46.620]  a press conference.
[03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:50.780]  I was very polite until they started grabbing me and dragging me out and I was still polite
[03:27:50.780 --> 03:27:53.220]  so they wouldn't have an excuse to beat me up.
[03:27:53.220 --> 03:27:55.420]  But like with Al Gore, when Chicago, we are a change.
[03:27:55.420 --> 03:27:59.660]  They were nice at first, and then they tried to drag them out, then they got the info out
[03:27:59.660 --> 03:28:00.660]  and were loud.
[03:28:00.660 --> 03:28:02.260]  And so it's just very important.
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:05.700]  It's like Carl Rove is going to be at UT tonight.
[03:28:05.700 --> 03:28:08.820]  In fact, I'll pull that out and read it again before the show ends.
[03:28:08.820 --> 03:28:09.820]  Here it is.
[03:28:09.820 --> 03:28:11.860]  He's going to be at UT 7 o'clock tonight.
[03:28:11.860 --> 03:28:13.380]  It's open and free to the public.
[03:28:13.380 --> 03:28:18.060]  The patriots, the listeners should all get down there about 5.30, 6 o'clock or so, have
[03:28:18.060 --> 03:28:24.300]  your little flip phones hidden, flip cameras, and then videotape it and then be near the
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:31.380]  two center aisles there in the area they're having it and get up first to the mic because
[03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:34.060]  you'll probably take questions toward the end.
[03:28:34.060 --> 03:28:38.460]  Now they may do the written questions because he's somewhat of a coward, but not too much
[03:28:38.460 --> 03:28:39.460]  of a coward.
[03:28:39.460 --> 03:28:40.740]  I mean, at least he goes to these events.
[03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:44.780]  And then you may have to shout some things out, and that's your choice as I did to Janet
[03:28:44.780 --> 03:28:50.420]  Reno in the same hall, but that's at UT tonight, Carl Rove.
[03:28:50.420 --> 03:28:54.460]  How important is it for folks to get out there and confront these people, Luke Radowski?
[03:28:54.460 --> 03:28:59.460]  It is the most single important thing somebody could do because we not only send them a message
[03:28:59.460 --> 03:29:04.660]  that we as the people are waking up, we know, and we will tolerate this, but also showing
[03:29:04.660 --> 03:29:09.140]  the world how these people are not as powerful as they seem.
[03:29:09.140 --> 03:29:12.300]  They're not as strong because when you come up to them, when you talk to them, when you
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:17.100]  look them in their eyes and you tell them about their crimes and their wrongs that they committed
[03:29:17.100 --> 03:29:19.460]  against the people they cover, they run away.
[03:29:19.460 --> 03:29:22.460]  It's like cockroaches running away when you turn on the light.
[03:29:22.460 --> 03:29:26.020]  And I'm telling you, we confront the Carl Rove before, and we were very nice to him
[03:29:26.020 --> 03:29:27.020]  in the beginning.
[03:29:27.020 --> 03:29:30.980]  But as soon as you ignore me and don't want to answer questions about how he met with
[03:29:30.980 --> 03:29:36.540]  the financier of Osama bin Laden before and after President Clinton's election, we're
[03:29:36.540 --> 03:29:37.540]  going to go after you.
[03:29:37.540 --> 03:29:42.420]  And that's what we did in our YouTube video that's got thousands and thousands of hits
[03:29:42.420 --> 03:29:43.420]  on YouTube.
[03:29:43.420 --> 03:29:46.060]  Look, look, look, stay there, stay there.
[03:29:46.060 --> 03:29:48.780]  Let's finish up on the other side.
[03:29:48.780 --> 03:29:52.740]  So up on infowars.com, we've got some key info.
[03:29:52.740 --> 03:30:00.140]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:00.140 --> 03:30:05.740]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:05.740 --> 03:30:10.100]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:30:10.100 --> 03:30:11.100]  do you want?
[03:30:11.100 --> 03:30:16.620]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:30:16.620 --> 03:30:18.100]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:18.100 --> 03:30:19.340]  How much do you want?
[03:30:19.340 --> 03:30:20.420]  When do you want it?
[03:30:20.420 --> 03:30:22.380]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:22.380 --> 03:30:23.500]  When will you need it?
[03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:25.620]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:25.620 --> 03:30:26.940]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.940 --> 03:30:28.420]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:28.420 --> 03:30:32.540]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:30:32.540 --> 03:30:33.700]  and be immunized?
[03:30:33.700 --> 03:30:37.500]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:37.500 --> 03:30:41.060]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:41.060 --> 03:30:42.340]  How much will you need?
[03:30:42.340 --> 03:30:43.340]  We don't know.
[03:30:43.340 --> 03:30:44.340]  How much do you want?
[03:30:44.340 --> 03:30:45.340]  All you can get.
[03:30:45.340 --> 03:30:46.340]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:46.340 --> 03:30:49.380]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:49.380 --> 03:30:56.860]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:30:56.860 --> 03:31:03.100]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:03.100 --> 03:31:07.660]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[03:31:07.660 --> 03:31:11.540]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[03:31:11.540 --> 03:31:17.220]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union,
[03:31:17.220 --> 03:31:22.420]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[03:31:22.420 --> 03:31:27.140]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[03:31:27.140 --> 03:31:28.140]  our families.
[03:31:28.140 --> 03:31:31.940]  Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy
[03:31:31.940 --> 03:31:33.620]  of your own home.
[03:31:33.620 --> 03:31:38.220]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[03:31:38.220 --> 03:31:42.340]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[03:31:42.340 --> 03:31:49.380]  Go to www.silvalungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[03:31:49.380 --> 03:31:52.540]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[03:31:52.540 --> 03:31:54.540]  That's www.silvalungs.com.
[03:31:54.540 --> 03:31:55.540]  Silverlungs.com.
[03:31:55.540 --> 03:32:06.300]  Oh my sinuses, they feel like they'll explode.
[03:32:06.300 --> 03:32:09.740]  Sinus pressure, sinus headaches that keep you up at night, you've struggled for years,
[03:32:09.740 --> 03:32:13.460]  you've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back
[03:32:13.460 --> 03:32:15.900]  and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[03:32:15.900 --> 03:32:16.900]  Sound familiar?
[03:32:16.900 --> 03:32:17.900]  Well, you're not alone.
[03:32:17.900 --> 03:32:21.140]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[03:32:21.140 --> 03:32:26.260]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[03:32:26.260 --> 03:32:29.260]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor recommended.
[03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:31.620]  Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal spray.
[03:32:31.620 --> 03:32:35.460]  It's the only patent protected nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes
[03:32:35.460 --> 03:32:40.500]  of your sinusitis, no alcohol, no rebound congestion, no drug interactions, and easy
[03:32:40.500 --> 03:32:41.500]  to use.
[03:32:41.500 --> 03:32:43.460]  Don't go another day just treating symptoms.
[03:32:43.460 --> 03:32:47.540]  Take control of your sinus health now and get Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal
[03:32:47.540 --> 03:32:49.660]  spray and get the relief you deserve.
[03:32:49.660 --> 03:32:57.740]  Go to www.buysinofresh.com or call 888-906-3636.
[03:32:57.740 --> 03:33:07.740]  Breathe easy, breathe free, get Sinofresh today, it works.
[03:33:07.740 --> 03:33:14.260]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:14.260 --> 03:33:18.060]  You know, I'm pretty good friends with Jesse Ventura and I never even call him.
[03:33:18.060 --> 03:33:21.340]  Generally, he ends up calling up asking how I'm doing or his crew does.
[03:33:21.340 --> 03:33:26.140]  I'm going to be a consultant on his second season of conspiracy theory and also I'm
[03:33:26.140 --> 03:33:30.740]  going to appear in more episodes and I need to reach out to these people because I get
[03:33:30.740 --> 03:33:33.820]  so busy, years just flash by, it happens to everybody.
[03:33:33.820 --> 03:33:37.420]  Willie Nelson, I haven't talked to Willie probably about a year on the phone, he called
[03:33:37.420 --> 03:33:40.500]  me about, I don't know, two and a half years ago.
[03:33:40.500 --> 03:33:43.980]  They said Willie Nelson's calling here at the office.
[03:33:43.980 --> 03:33:49.180]  He lives here in Austin and I met him once at one of my film screenings, here comes Willie
[03:33:49.180 --> 03:33:53.380]  Nelson walking up and I said I'd like to interview you sometime and he said yeah, sometime we'll
[03:33:53.380 --> 03:33:54.380]  do that.
[03:33:54.380 --> 03:33:59.940]  He gave me my number and then about six months later he called me.
[03:33:59.940 --> 03:34:04.540]  That was it an in-game screening, that's how long ago that was and then of course he came
[03:34:04.540 --> 03:34:06.420]  on the show and went public for 9-Eleven Truth.
[03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:11.860]  I didn't even intend for him to do that but I guess that's why he wanted to come on.
[03:34:11.860 --> 03:34:16.780]  Well he was on Larry King Friday night, I just learned this, it's up on prisonplanet.com
[03:34:16.780 --> 03:34:20.380]  and I want to play this after Luke leaves because Larry King says, well, the buildings
[03:34:20.380 --> 03:34:27.860]  fell because they were hit by a jet and Willie had just said building 7 wasn't hit by a jet
[03:34:27.860 --> 03:34:29.980]  and the government now admits it did fall at freefall.
[03:34:29.980 --> 03:34:36.540]  You can see the blast points, it's so incredible folks, I mean they blew up Oklahoma City.
[03:34:36.540 --> 03:34:40.060]  The former head of Air Force Weapons Development went there, there were columns further back
[03:34:40.060 --> 03:34:44.700]  in the building blown out with blast points on them and Parton went over and showed from
[03:34:44.700 --> 03:34:46.860]  the photos the perfect blast points.
[03:34:46.860 --> 03:34:52.860]  I mean it had demolition blast points on it and they used controlled demolition incorporated
[03:34:52.860 --> 03:34:57.620]  to come in and destroy the wreckage and haul it off under guard and the same thing was
[03:34:57.620 --> 03:34:59.500]  done with the wreckage of 9-Eleven.
[03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:03.300]  Going back to Luke Radowski, folks if we let them kill Kennedy and broad daylight in front
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:07.500]  of us, if we let them carry out 9-Eleven and broad daylight in front of us, this private
[03:35:07.500 --> 03:35:11.420]  global corporate group that runs our country, they're going to steal our pension funds.
[03:35:11.420 --> 03:35:13.420]  Now they're saying that's what they want to do.
[03:35:13.420 --> 03:35:16.420]  I read documents six years ago where they were getting ready to do it.
[03:35:16.420 --> 03:35:18.300]  Now they're saying they're getting ready to do it.
[03:35:18.300 --> 03:35:20.180]  They're not going to give us any quarter.
[03:35:20.180 --> 03:35:25.020]  They're not going to back off until we finally grow up and admit just how evil this elite
[03:35:25.020 --> 03:35:26.020]  is.
[03:35:26.020 --> 03:35:27.020]  Luke Radowski.
[03:35:27.020 --> 03:35:31.620]  I mean the future that we want for this country and for ourselves, for our lives, is in our
[03:35:31.620 --> 03:35:32.620]  hand.
[03:35:32.620 --> 03:35:35.860]  There's nothing stopping us but ourselves but we have to believe in ourselves, we have
[03:35:35.860 --> 03:35:37.420]  to fight for ourselves.
[03:35:37.420 --> 03:35:41.260]  Holding little community town hall meetings like we do here in New York City every Saturday
[03:35:41.260 --> 03:35:43.420]  is very critical reaching out to the community.
[03:35:43.420 --> 03:35:46.500]  We're also raising food for the homeless.
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:47.620]  We're going to be feeding the homeless.
[03:35:47.620 --> 03:35:51.700]  So anybody coming to the premiere of Police State 4 this Saturday, please bring food here
[03:35:51.700 --> 03:35:52.700]  in New York City.
[03:35:52.700 --> 03:35:56.180]  It's about being the change that you want to see in this world and actually doing it.
[03:35:56.180 --> 03:36:01.020]  Not just talking about it but doing it and playing an active role in your community and
[03:36:01.020 --> 03:36:03.020]  just going out there and living life.
[03:36:03.020 --> 03:36:05.420]  This is what life's about, doing the right thing.
[03:36:05.420 --> 03:36:09.940]  Not about being evil, not about trying to start eugenics and kill people.
[03:36:09.940 --> 03:36:14.620]  We have to literally wake up and do the right thing and there should be nothing stopping
[03:36:14.620 --> 03:36:15.620]  you.
[03:36:15.620 --> 03:36:16.620]  There is no fear.
[03:36:16.620 --> 03:36:17.620]  There is no hate.
[03:36:17.620 --> 03:36:18.620]  There is no anger.
[03:36:18.620 --> 03:36:19.620]  There is only love.
[03:36:19.620 --> 03:36:22.700]  There is only consciousness, humanity and dignity that we should look forward to and move forward
[03:36:22.700 --> 03:36:23.700]  with.
[03:36:23.700 --> 03:36:27.420]  And if there's any doubt this government stages terror attacks, it's not our government.
[03:36:27.420 --> 03:36:28.940]  It's illegitimate.
[03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:33.220]  Look at how they're framing the patriot movement saying we're calling for violence and that
[03:36:33.220 --> 03:36:39.060]  we don't like black people with no evidence and then we catch them posing as Nazis at
[03:36:39.060 --> 03:36:41.980]  our rallies to make us look bad.
[03:36:41.980 --> 03:36:44.860]  That's only a microcosm of the bigger picture.
[03:36:44.860 --> 03:36:46.140]  They're the bad guys.
[03:36:46.140 --> 03:36:48.580]  They have to frame us as the bad guys.
[03:36:48.580 --> 03:36:49.580]  Exactly.
[03:36:49.580 --> 03:36:51.100]  And that's what criminals do.
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:55.500]  They cover up their crimes and they try to point somebody else out as the evil villain
[03:36:55.500 --> 03:36:59.740]  when in all of reality the people who are falling and doing all these false lies and
[03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:03.540]  doing all these provocateur attacks, they're the ones who are covering something up.
[03:37:03.540 --> 03:37:07.780]  So we have to see for what it is, call out provocateurs and make sure people know what
[03:37:07.780 --> 03:37:12.780]  we stand for and keep telling them this is about an evolution, turning this country
[03:37:12.780 --> 03:37:16.700]  for what it should be, starting again from you, for and by the people.
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:21.020]  And we could only do that if everybody in this country takes charge of their lives and
[03:37:21.020 --> 03:37:25.380]  does something positive for themselves, for this world, for this community and it starts
[03:37:25.380 --> 03:37:26.380]  with you.
[03:37:26.380 --> 03:37:27.780]  Listen right now, I'm sitting at home.
[03:37:27.780 --> 03:37:28.780]  What can you do?
[03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:30.380]  How will you live your life that will...
[03:37:30.380 --> 03:37:33.060]  Okay, here's an example of what you can do.
[03:37:33.060 --> 03:37:34.540]  Here's an example of what you can do.
[03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:39.380]  Luke in the film Truth Rising, the DVD available at infowars.com, people need to see this.
[03:37:39.380 --> 03:37:41.860]  It's all about We Are Changed at 9-11 Truth.
[03:37:41.860 --> 03:37:50.660]  Just one example of the Hart-Rubin Commission head, Gary Hart, top globalist, and he wrote
[03:37:50.660 --> 03:37:54.740]  a letter to Iran saying, our government will stage terror attacks and blame it on you.
[03:37:54.740 --> 03:37:56.620]  You better do what we're saying.
[03:37:56.620 --> 03:38:02.220]  And then when you went to him, We Are Changed with the letter, he tried to deny that he'd
[03:38:02.220 --> 03:38:05.980]  written it till you gave it to him and he said, okay, I did write it and then admitted
[03:38:05.980 --> 03:38:06.980]  it.
[03:38:06.980 --> 03:38:10.940]  See, if you can't even address them as an adult to an adult, they won't even take you
[03:38:10.940 --> 03:38:11.940]  seriously.
[03:38:11.940 --> 03:38:15.980]  They automatically lie to you until you say, look, I know who you are, then they'll have
[03:38:15.980 --> 03:38:16.980]  a real discussion.
[03:38:16.980 --> 03:38:19.100]  I mean, that's how dumb they think we are.
[03:38:19.100 --> 03:38:23.980]  He wrote a public letter basically admitting they stage 9-11 and that they'll stage more
[03:38:23.980 --> 03:38:29.060]  events to Iran thinking we're so dumb.
[03:38:29.060 --> 03:38:33.660]  That's what Bill Clinton did Friday on Lurie King Live, or not Lurie King Live, it was
[03:38:33.660 --> 03:38:35.500]  on CNN with Wolf Blitzer.
[03:38:35.500 --> 03:38:39.860]  He basically said, gee, I hope there doesn't have to be another terror attack to shut up
[03:38:39.860 --> 03:38:41.060]  the Tea Parties.
[03:38:41.060 --> 03:38:42.260]  That's an open threat.
[03:38:42.260 --> 03:38:43.780]  They're going to do this and blame it on us.
[03:38:43.780 --> 03:38:46.260]  Luke Radowski, tell folks about the Gary Hart incident.
[03:38:46.260 --> 03:38:52.500]  Gary Hart was a beautiful confrontation where he actually lied and denied saying that the
[03:38:52.500 --> 03:38:55.860]  U.S. government would do a false flag to get into the war with Iran.
[03:38:55.860 --> 03:38:57.660]  He said he never wrote a letter.
[03:38:57.660 --> 03:39:02.300]  And then Brian Kenney, we are came here, brought out the letter and read it to him, actually
[03:39:02.300 --> 03:39:06.100]  read the letter to him when he denied that that letter even existed.
[03:39:06.100 --> 03:39:10.900]  He would go see that video on YouTube now, and then he just pretty much admitted and
[03:39:10.900 --> 03:39:14.540]  said, yeah, I'm pretty much saying that the U.S. government would do something like a
[03:39:14.540 --> 03:39:17.100]  false flag to get into the war with Iran.
[03:39:17.100 --> 03:39:19.260]  Those are his own words.
[03:39:19.260 --> 03:39:20.820]  And he tried to lie about it.
[03:39:20.820 --> 03:39:23.060]  He tried to lie about his new world order comments.
[03:39:23.060 --> 03:39:25.500]  We asked him what it meant, and we said that.
[03:39:25.500 --> 03:39:30.060]  He said it a couple of times, he just went on from the pageant saying, no, I only said
[03:39:30.060 --> 03:39:31.060]  it once.
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:32.060]  It doesn't even matter.
[03:39:32.060 --> 03:39:37.380]  And then he started stammering and stuttering and profusely sweating because it's just like
[03:39:37.380 --> 03:39:39.620]  the movie They Live.
[03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:43.220]  He almost got his watch and said, I got one that can see.
[03:39:43.220 --> 03:39:45.540]  I got a bunch of them that can see.
[03:39:45.540 --> 03:39:47.300]  He suddenly got scared.
[03:39:47.300 --> 03:39:51.180]  He was in a room of people because for those that don't know, he helped plan some of the
[03:39:51.180 --> 03:39:52.500]  9-11 stuff.
[03:39:52.500 --> 03:39:56.620]  He wrote the Heart Rubin Commission calling for a big event that would bring in a new
[03:39:56.620 --> 03:39:57.620]  world order.
[03:39:57.620 --> 03:40:00.300]  We need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:05.060]  And he wrote this public letter, posted it on the Huffington Post, and then tried to deny
[03:40:05.060 --> 03:40:06.060]  to you.
[03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:09.220]  But once you gave him the letter, he said, okay, I did write the letter.
[03:40:09.220 --> 03:40:10.220]  And then he started sweating.
[03:40:10.220 --> 03:40:13.820]  I mean, again, they think we're all dumb.
[03:40:13.820 --> 03:40:15.100]  And it's not because we're dumb.
[03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:19.940]  It's because we're focused on petty issues or we're cowardly and won't stand up to these
[03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:23.140]  maggots and let them know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[03:40:23.140 --> 03:40:26.820]  And we are here to make everybody know there's no reason to fear anything.
[03:40:26.820 --> 03:40:31.340]  It's our courage, it's our love and persistence that will change things.
[03:40:31.340 --> 03:40:34.940]  And sending a message out to the world in the YouTube video showing how these people
[03:40:34.940 --> 03:40:37.140]  lie to us is critically important.
[03:40:37.140 --> 03:40:41.500]  But also sending them a message face to face, eye to eye, that we know your game.
[03:40:41.500 --> 03:40:42.500]  We're not stupid.
[03:40:42.500 --> 03:40:44.220]  We're not going to go along with it.
[03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:49.180]  Send them a message and they will have to think twice before they ever even plan or
[03:40:49.180 --> 03:40:53.340]  say anything publicly because they know that the people of this country, the people of
[03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:57.820]  this world are waking up to that bull crap and they're seeing it the way it is.
[03:40:57.820 --> 03:41:02.580]  We can see we're not stupid, we're not animals, we are human beings and our lives are just
[03:41:02.580 --> 03:41:04.460]  as important as their lives are.
[03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:08.620]  And we have to make everybody understand that because that is the true success of humanity
[03:41:08.620 --> 03:41:10.140]  is knowing that we are all equal.
[03:41:10.140 --> 03:41:13.100]  We are all human beings and nobody should rule over us.
[03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:17.860]  We are the full people of this world and we shall live our lives without being intruded
[03:41:17.860 --> 03:41:22.540]  and bothered by these global elites who so hope want to plan world events and do all
[03:41:22.540 --> 03:41:23.540]  these things.
[03:41:23.540 --> 03:41:25.460]  They can't do it unless we comply.
[03:41:25.460 --> 03:41:26.460]  We have to stop this.
[03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:27.460]  Exactly.
[03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:32.380]  They can't plan world events unless we sit on our butts and aren't involved in the world.
[03:41:32.380 --> 03:41:37.860]  We have to take the world back with little actions, but together it can move mountains.
[03:41:37.860 --> 03:41:41.660]  And again, your video has only been up about a day and a half, 24,000 views.
[03:41:41.660 --> 03:41:43.180]  It's up at wearchange.org.
[03:41:43.180 --> 03:41:45.460]  It's also up at infowars.com.
[03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:47.780]  It's also up at prisonplanet.com.
[03:41:47.780 --> 03:41:52.420]  It is so important to get this Colbert video out because all these Colbert listeners and
[03:41:52.420 --> 03:41:57.620]  viewers will now go look in the Bilderberg group and find our information.
[03:41:57.620 --> 03:41:59.580]  Luke, keep up the great work.
[03:41:59.580 --> 03:42:00.580]  Appreciate you joining us today.
[03:42:00.580 --> 03:42:01.580]  God bless you.
[03:42:01.580 --> 03:42:02.580]  Thank you, Alex, so much.
[03:42:02.580 --> 03:42:03.580]  And we're going to win this.
[03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:04.580]  I know we will.
[03:42:04.580 --> 03:42:05.580]  We are.
[03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:07.580]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:42:07.580 --> 03:42:08.580]  Okay.
[03:42:08.580 --> 03:42:12.220]  Now, Luke is another testament.
[03:42:12.220 --> 03:42:16.540]  I remember three years ago, 9-11 Truth, New York.
[03:42:16.540 --> 03:42:18.620]  Very good folks, but some questionable things.
[03:42:18.620 --> 03:42:20.220]  They didn't want us fighting the New World Order.
[03:42:20.220 --> 03:42:24.020]  They didn't want to talk about the CFR, eugenics.
[03:42:24.020 --> 03:42:26.540]  And Luke got basically kicked out of the group.
[03:42:26.540 --> 03:42:28.140]  And he was the guy that was really building it.
[03:42:28.140 --> 03:42:30.940]  And I told Luke, I said, Luke, don't quit.
[03:42:30.940 --> 03:42:32.180]  Get a good name.
[03:42:32.180 --> 03:42:33.180]  Start a new organization.
[03:42:33.180 --> 03:42:34.180]  I'll have you on the air.
[03:42:34.180 --> 03:42:37.740]  I'll support you just like I support all the other real activists.
[03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:40.100]  You don't see us promoting somebody.
[03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:42.500]  Word of the wise is sufficient.
[03:42:42.500 --> 03:42:45.860]  And you live, you learn.
[03:42:45.860 --> 03:42:50.660]  But Luke, just with an idea, I said, don't be centralized.
[03:42:50.660 --> 03:42:53.260]  Luke woke up watching my police state films.
[03:42:53.260 --> 03:42:54.740]  And then, see, he's waking up people.
[03:42:54.740 --> 03:42:55.740]  And then they're becoming leaders.
[03:42:55.740 --> 03:42:59.100]  And then they're going to wake up people who become leaders, who wake up people.
[03:42:59.100 --> 03:43:04.100]  This is how we take the planet back from the clutches of the globalist.
[03:43:04.100 --> 03:43:07.340]  This is how we do it.
[03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:13.220]  And God will open doors for you if you just have the faith, take action, are confident,
[03:43:13.220 --> 03:43:18.820]  and tell the truth and stand in the face of evil, stand up against the New World Order.
[03:43:18.820 --> 03:43:20.660]  It's incredible.
[03:43:20.660 --> 03:43:26.620]  And I told Luke, I said, have it be decentralized, just a code of ideas to go out and confront
[03:43:26.620 --> 03:43:31.300]  politicians and to go out and expose 9-11 and expose global warming and expose the
[03:43:31.300 --> 03:43:33.700]  New World Order, because that was what he wanted to do.
[03:43:33.700 --> 03:43:39.460]  And now it's we are changed that taught the world how to go out and confront Al Gore.
[03:43:39.460 --> 03:43:41.380]  Now the Tea Parties are copying it.
[03:43:41.380 --> 03:43:46.620]  And now there's all these other groups and organizations that go to these public events
[03:43:46.620 --> 03:43:53.220]  and shout down the New World Order, something I was doing 14 years ago.
[03:43:53.220 --> 03:43:54.220]  Everybody can do this.
[03:43:54.220 --> 03:43:56.260]  You know, Carl Rove's coming into town tonight.
[03:43:56.260 --> 03:43:58.140]  People need to be there.
[03:43:58.140 --> 03:44:02.060]  I've confronted Bill Clinton and Janet Reno and everybody at UT.
[03:44:02.060 --> 03:44:04.540]  You need to go down there and confront them.
[03:44:04.540 --> 03:44:10.580]  I've gone and been physically attacked, confronting MSNBC and Chris Matthews.
[03:44:10.580 --> 03:44:14.860]  I wouldn't stop bullhorning, that's why, but I took over the whole hour of TV and then
[03:44:14.860 --> 03:44:19.780]  when they broke my bullhorn with a knife, cut the wire, Luke showed up with even bigger
[03:44:19.780 --> 03:44:22.300]  and we put him on top of this huge guy's shoulders.
[03:44:22.300 --> 03:44:26.500]  So Luke was about nine and a half feet in the air.
[03:44:26.500 --> 03:44:29.940]  Oh, it's amazing.
[03:44:29.940 --> 03:44:30.940]  Okay.
[03:44:30.940 --> 03:44:33.140]  I want to go to this Willie Nelson clip.
[03:44:33.140 --> 03:44:39.220]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and notice how Larry King brings up 9-11 truth to him because
[03:44:39.220 --> 03:44:40.340]  it was in a Twitter.
[03:44:40.340 --> 03:44:47.740]  He's reading Twitter's to him and Willie talks about building seven, not hit by a plane,
[03:44:47.740 --> 03:44:51.100]  not hit by the debris of Tower one or two, falling in its own footprint.
[03:44:51.100 --> 03:44:55.980]  And we have the CNN footage of firefighters and police saying, get back, they're bringing
[03:44:55.980 --> 03:44:56.980]  it down.
[03:44:56.980 --> 03:44:58.500]  And we're not saying they were involved.
[03:44:58.500 --> 03:44:59.820]  They were told get back to bringing it down.
[03:44:59.820 --> 03:45:05.380]  We've had police officers on the show who heard the countdown 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3,
[03:45:05.380 --> 03:45:09.340]  2, 1, boom.
[03:45:09.340 --> 03:45:12.820]  This is the reality.
[03:45:12.820 --> 03:45:17.500]  And we have, before she even had her national TV show, Amy Goodman was down there and she's
[03:45:17.500 --> 03:45:20.860]  there when the same cops who we've interviewed and we've interviewed the people that are
[03:45:20.860 --> 03:45:21.860]  on the video.
[03:45:21.860 --> 03:45:23.740]  We went and found them.
[03:45:23.740 --> 03:45:28.620]  And you see her and they're telling her get out of there and she runs and then boom, building
[03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:29.620]  seven comes down.
[03:45:29.620 --> 03:45:32.140]  I don't have to go through all the evidence 9-11.
[03:45:32.140 --> 03:45:37.500]  If you have been told to hate 9-11 truth, also he says, well, there was also an investigation.
[03:45:37.500 --> 03:45:41.940]  Larry King says, well, there was also an investigation of 9-11 truth.
[03:45:41.940 --> 03:45:42.940]  Yes.
[03:45:42.940 --> 03:45:49.260]  And six of the 10 commission members appointed by Bush have said it's a criminal cover-up.
[03:45:49.260 --> 03:45:52.420]  So has Farmer, the head lawyer.
[03:45:52.420 --> 03:45:53.860]  I mean, it just came out three weeks ago.
[03:45:53.860 --> 03:45:57.700]  The ACLU sued and got it where Dick Cheney ordered the commission to not look at the
[03:45:57.700 --> 03:45:58.700]  attacks.
[03:45:58.700 --> 03:46:00.140]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[03:46:00.140 --> 03:46:03.140]  White House ordered commission not to look at 9-11 attacks.
[03:46:03.140 --> 03:46:05.940]  They weren't allowed to look at the evidence.
[03:46:05.940 --> 03:46:07.580]  It was a whitewash.
[03:46:07.580 --> 03:46:10.100]  We must have a new independent investigation.
[03:46:10.100 --> 03:46:13.540]  But here is Willie Nelson.
[03:46:13.540 --> 03:46:14.540]  Okay.
[03:46:14.540 --> 03:46:20.460]  Hey, I don't know why it's always in this fourth hour.
[03:46:20.460 --> 03:46:25.780]  It's like a jinx or a genie or a gremlin in the equipment.
[03:46:25.780 --> 03:46:27.260]  But we're going to start over this time.
[03:46:27.260 --> 03:46:28.260]  Here it is, folks.
[03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:32.540]  But he's questioned the official story.
[03:46:32.540 --> 03:46:35.460]  What prompted you to look into this from another angle?
[03:46:35.460 --> 03:46:40.180]  Well, just logic, I've seen buildings implode before.
[03:46:40.180 --> 03:46:45.340]  I just saw the Texas Stadium implode just a couple of days ago.
[03:46:45.340 --> 03:46:48.180]  And these two buildings imploded.
[03:46:48.180 --> 03:46:51.580]  And the one next to it, nothing hit it.
[03:46:51.580 --> 03:46:53.100]  No plane hit the one next to it.
[03:46:53.100 --> 03:46:55.220]  It just decided to fall on its own.
[03:46:55.220 --> 03:46:57.380]  So naturally, I have questions about how they did that.
[03:46:57.380 --> 03:46:58.700]  I think something was done inside.
[03:46:58.700 --> 03:46:59.700]  Yes.
[03:46:59.700 --> 03:47:04.060]  But I'm told that the reason it imploded was there's so much heat from above and so
[03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:09.220]  much fuel on the jets that that caused it to go down right at it to go over.
[03:47:09.220 --> 03:47:14.300]  Never before has a building collapsed because it was hit by an airplane, a steel building.
[03:47:14.300 --> 03:47:17.300]  Never before.
[03:47:17.300 --> 03:47:20.340]  Has any building been hit by 747, though?
[03:47:20.340 --> 03:47:22.700]  I'm sure they have.
[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:26.380]  So you think there was something going on inside the building?
[03:47:26.380 --> 03:47:28.500]  Well, I just questioned the whole thing.
[03:47:28.500 --> 03:47:30.660]  I questioned the story.
[03:47:30.660 --> 03:47:33.580]  I questioned the implosions.
[03:47:33.580 --> 03:47:36.580]  It just looks too simple, you know.
[03:47:36.580 --> 03:47:39.700]  Well, others have questioned it too, although there was an investigation.
[03:47:39.700 --> 03:47:43.100]  There was an investigation, and I think there should be more.
[03:47:43.100 --> 03:47:46.140]  William Elson, we are not a tweet to King Things.
[03:47:46.140 --> 03:47:47.140]  Okay.
[03:47:47.140 --> 03:47:48.140]  King Things.
[03:47:48.140 --> 03:47:49.140]  How many guitars?
[03:47:49.140 --> 03:47:50.140]  So there you have it.
[03:47:50.140 --> 03:47:51.140]  Here's raw story.
[03:47:51.140 --> 03:47:54.780]  It was also in the Associated Press, but never became national news on television.
[03:47:54.780 --> 03:47:55.780]  Revealed.
[03:47:55.780 --> 03:48:01.420]  Ashcroft tenant Rumsfeld warned 9-11 Commission about line it should not cross.
[03:48:01.420 --> 03:48:05.420]  Former Bush administration officials sternly cautioned the 9-11 Commission against probing
[03:48:05.420 --> 03:48:10.060]  too deeply into terror attacks of September 11, 2001, according to a document recently
[03:48:10.060 --> 03:48:12.860]  obtained by the ACLU.
[03:48:12.860 --> 03:48:14.500]  What I'm just supposed to ignore this.
[03:48:14.500 --> 03:48:19.460]  The notification came in a letter dated January 6, 2004, addressed by Attorney General John
[03:48:19.460 --> 03:48:25.180]  Ashcroft, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and CI Director George J. Tennant.
[03:48:25.180 --> 03:48:26.580]  And it's an order from the White House.
[03:48:26.580 --> 03:48:28.060]  You can read the actual document.
[03:48:28.060 --> 03:48:34.100]  The ACLU described it as a fact sent by David Addington, then counsel to former Vice President
[03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:35.260]  Dick Cheney.
[03:48:35.260 --> 03:48:36.260]  You can link through and read the document.
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:39.020]  In fact, we ought to pull the document up.
[03:48:39.020 --> 03:48:41.220]  That's LinkedIn here.
[03:48:41.220 --> 03:48:42.220]  And it continues.
[03:48:42.220 --> 03:48:47.340]  In the message, the officials denied the bipartisan's Commission's request to question
[03:48:47.340 --> 03:48:53.220]  terrorist detainees, informing its two senior most members that it would cross a line and
[03:48:53.220 --> 03:48:56.620]  obstruct the administration's ability to protect the nation.
[03:48:56.620 --> 03:49:03.780]  And I remember Cheney, I think it was on Meet the Press, when Congress was investigating
[03:49:03.780 --> 03:49:06.100]  separately from the Commission.
[03:49:06.100 --> 03:49:10.500]  And Cheney said, look, you better not investigate all this or you're going to frustrate our
[03:49:10.500 --> 03:49:14.780]  protecting you and we'll be nuked.
[03:49:14.780 --> 03:49:18.940]  And now Obama's saying, you better not criticize, and his surrogate, Bill Clinton is saying,
[03:49:18.940 --> 03:49:24.180]  you better not criticize our health care or the bank or bailout or anything else, the
[03:49:24.180 --> 03:49:28.780]  carbon taxes, because the hate you're creating is going to make federal buildings get blown
[03:49:28.780 --> 03:49:29.780]  up.
[03:49:29.780 --> 03:49:32.580]  I mean, use common sense.
[03:49:32.580 --> 03:49:33.580]  Use your head.
[03:49:33.580 --> 03:49:34.580]  Use your gut.
[03:49:34.580 --> 03:49:36.100]  Use your street smarts, folks.
[03:49:36.100 --> 03:49:38.940]  You've seen all this demonization leading up to this.
[03:49:38.940 --> 03:49:43.700]  And now they're saying we're all racist, totally made up and setting us up, posing as racists
[03:49:43.700 --> 03:49:45.460]  at tea parties.
[03:49:45.460 --> 03:49:50.060]  And then Clinton's out saying, gee, I hope we don't need another terror attack in America
[03:49:50.060 --> 03:49:54.500]  by domestic groups before this type of rhetoric isn't used anymore about the government being
[03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:55.620]  treasonous.
[03:49:55.620 --> 03:50:02.660]  The government is treasonous by every measurement in the universe, by every measurement in the
[03:50:02.660 --> 03:50:04.780]  world.
[03:50:04.780 --> 03:50:07.540]  If you just tuned in, you got to tune into the re-streams when the show ends there in
[03:50:07.540 --> 03:50:14.140]  about 10 minutes at infowars.com, because in the first and second hour, I nonstop went
[03:50:14.140 --> 03:50:24.940]  over NLE 010, 2010, the nuke detonations in these drills, and it says in this FEMA document
[03:50:24.940 --> 03:50:27.620]  that they're ordering newspapers to take down, no core order.
[03:50:27.620 --> 03:50:38.580]  They just are mafia and tell you to do it, that it says, to no notice, near simultaneous
[03:50:38.580 --> 03:50:41.500]  improvised nuclear device detonations.
[03:50:41.500 --> 03:50:47.020]  Can you imagine what the banks raping this country could do if they set off a nuke?
[03:50:47.020 --> 03:50:49.460]  The excuse they'd have to crack down on everybody?
[03:50:49.460 --> 03:50:52.140]  People wouldn't be worried about having their pension funds taken then.
[03:50:52.140 --> 03:50:54.260]  This is how we're going to go into 1984.
[03:50:54.260 --> 03:50:58.300]  This is how we're going to go into hardcore, Stalinist, Nazi-type tyranny.
[03:50:58.300 --> 03:51:01.780]  We're inches away, and they're going to blame it on the American people.
[03:51:01.780 --> 03:51:05.180]  Hi, this is Steve Shanky, Foodstrike.
[03:51:05.180 --> 03:51:10.980]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3, Get 1 free program, and have started production.
[03:51:10.980 --> 03:51:11.980]  Congratulations.
[03:51:11.980 --> 03:51:16.820]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove
[03:51:16.820 --> 03:51:18.660]  very wise.
[03:51:18.660 --> 03:51:23.380]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:51:23.380 --> 03:51:24.540]  Now something fun.
[03:51:24.540 --> 03:51:25.540]  It's springtime.
[03:51:25.540 --> 03:51:30.100]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement
[03:51:30.100 --> 03:51:33.460]  to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[03:51:33.460 --> 03:51:34.460]  Here's the plan.
[03:51:34.460 --> 03:51:39.620]  When you add a one-month superfood spring pack to your food storage, we'll send you that
[03:51:39.620 --> 03:51:43.260]  garden of non-high-bred seeds absolutely free.
[03:51:43.260 --> 03:51:45.540]  Order now while the free seeds last.

[03:52:02.020 --> 03:52:07.340]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:52:07.340 --> 03:52:08.340]  Tarani is here.
[03:52:08.340 --> 03:52:12.060]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:12.060 --> 03:52:14.660]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:14.660 --> 03:52:19.180]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[03:52:19.180 --> 03:52:20.420]  on earth.
[03:52:20.420 --> 03:52:25.260]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[03:52:25.260 --> 03:52:27.100]  expanded nationwide.
[03:52:27.100 --> 03:52:31.340]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[03:52:31.340 --> 03:52:33.180]  powerful shadow state.
[03:52:33.180 --> 03:52:37.580]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic is fallen.
[03:52:37.580 --> 03:52:43.300]  There to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[03:52:43.300 --> 03:52:48.540]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner, it's only the beginning
[03:52:48.540 --> 03:52:50.980]  of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:50.980 --> 03:52:53.020]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:53.020 --> 03:52:54.020]  It's here.

[03:54:16.060 --> 03:54:20.380]  I mean how naive is the general public to trust government?
[03:54:20.380 --> 03:54:23.220]  Have you studied history?
[03:54:23.220 --> 03:54:26.420]  The number one cause of death, of unnatural death.
[03:54:26.420 --> 03:54:36.780]  Unnatural death would be heart attack, cancer, old age, it's not drowning, it's not things
[03:54:36.780 --> 03:54:40.500]  like that, it's governments.
[03:54:40.500 --> 03:54:46.380]  Governments are the number one cause of death worldwide, governments.
[03:54:46.380 --> 03:54:50.900]  Governments killing and enslaving people.
[03:54:50.900 --> 03:54:56.020]  The number two cause of unnatural death is automobiles.
[03:54:56.020 --> 03:54:59.900]  How do they kill almost 300,000 people a year?
[03:54:59.900 --> 03:55:03.500]  So I'm actually scared of things that matter.
[03:55:03.500 --> 03:55:06.380]  Every time my wife's leaving with the kids in the car, I go please watch out for other
[03:55:06.380 --> 03:55:10.300]  drivers, please drive super safe and I drive real safe when they're with me, I don't tend
[03:55:10.300 --> 03:55:14.660]  to by myself, but I realize what's a real threat.
[03:55:14.660 --> 03:55:20.140]  I'm concerned about government, I'm concerned about cars, but see cops haven't been taught,
[03:55:20.140 --> 03:55:22.900]  they're like the general public to be afraid of what they should really be afraid of.
[03:55:22.900 --> 03:55:26.660]  I've seen the statistics, I think it's like something like eight times you can pull it
[03:55:26.660 --> 03:55:32.020]  up more likely that a cop will die in a car wreck or being hit while they're riding tickets
[03:55:32.020 --> 03:55:36.460]  than they will be by a citizen, but I see cops when they pull even old ladies over now,
[03:55:36.460 --> 03:55:40.180]  they're shaken, they got their hand on their gun, they're scared of the citizens because
[03:55:40.180 --> 03:55:44.180]  they tell them every day to be scared of us, that's mind controlled.
[03:55:44.180 --> 03:55:50.660]  But then I'll see a cop out on 360 or I-35 with their butt literally wagging out with
[03:55:50.660 --> 03:55:55.020]  cars about three inches away leaning on a car right in a ticket.
[03:55:55.020 --> 03:56:05.940]  I mean they got these cops for $200 fines risking their lives on the side of the highway
[03:56:05.940 --> 03:56:10.100]  and all it takes is some lady on her cell phone or somebody drops coffee in their lap
[03:56:10.100 --> 03:56:17.580]  to swerve out of the lane and boom, 70 miles an hour, that cop is sloppy Joe's.
[03:56:17.580 --> 03:56:25.460]  And again, I'm just talking about perception here, I, here's an example, my kids will leave
[03:56:25.460 --> 03:56:29.900]  the doors open unlocked and I explained to them, there are bad men out there, there are
[03:56:29.900 --> 03:56:34.900]  bad people out there and it's not that we're living in fear, we're protecting ourselves,
[03:56:34.900 --> 03:56:40.180]  you must lock the doors and then I make them where they're the security chiefs and make
[03:56:40.180 --> 03:56:44.020]  a game out of it, so now they keep the doors locked, but then they'll go to their room
[03:56:44.020 --> 03:56:49.100]  at night, come in and turn the light on, I'm scared, look under the bed, there's nothing
[03:56:49.100 --> 03:56:54.500]  under your bed, but their instincts are of a little primate, you're in the woods at night,
[03:56:54.500 --> 03:56:59.000]  that's when big cats might eat you, so that's an instinct, because one of the number one
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:04.540]  causes of death, you know, thousands of years ago would be a cat eating you or a bear eating
[03:57:04.540 --> 03:57:09.660]  you, or a snake, why are people scared of snakes, why are people have arachnophobia,
[03:57:09.660 --> 03:57:13.980]  because there's quite a few species of spiders that'll kill you deader than a hammer, those
[03:57:13.980 --> 03:57:19.940]  are instincts, you're scared of the dark because big cats hunt at night and our ancestors
[03:57:19.940 --> 03:57:24.940]  were preyed on by big cats, me I'm not scared of the dark, because I'm in conscious control
[03:57:24.940 --> 03:57:30.100]  of my brain, I know grown men, I'll take out our family ranch and we'll say we're going
[03:57:30.100 --> 03:57:34.700]  hog hunting at night with spotlight battery powered and most grown men in the woods will
[03:57:34.700 --> 03:57:40.380]  get scared once you've been walking a few hundred yards out in the woods, but they get
[03:57:40.380 --> 03:57:45.020]  in their car and aren't paying attention, flying down the highway with huge 18 wheelers
[03:57:45.020 --> 03:57:51.660]  all around them, I mean life and death situation, you'll drive by people dead, every year I'd
[03:57:51.660 --> 03:57:57.100]  drive by a fatality injury, I've seen guts, heads on the ground, blood everywhere right
[03:57:57.100 --> 03:58:01.100]  after an accident, I pulled over and helped people one time when the guy had his head
[03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:05.780]  almost completely severed, blood shooting all over the place, I'm really worried about
[03:58:05.780 --> 03:58:13.020]  real things, governments and cars, let me say it again, governments and cars, but they
[03:58:13.020 --> 03:58:17.140]  got you scared of being lied in underneath your bed, let me tell you, government and
[03:58:17.140 --> 03:58:25.180]  cars, the number one cause of death is government and cars, government and cars, our founding
[03:58:25.180 --> 03:58:29.540]  fathers knew it was the government, they didn't have cars, they also didn't understand behind
[03:58:29.540 --> 03:58:37.140]  a horse, horse will kick you to death, retransmission starts now infowars.com, great job crew,

[03:58:52.220 --> 03:58:56.260]  hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[03:58:56.260 --> 03:59:01.020]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle, did you know that in a real meltdown,
[03:59:01.020 --> 03:59:04.900]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold, it's true seeds have
[03:59:04.900 --> 03:59:08.380]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[03:59:08.380 --> 03:59:12.940]  even happen again, so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[03:59:12.940 --> 03:59:19.140]  mix of non-hybrid seeds, they call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[03:59:19.140 --> 03:59:23.700]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have
[03:59:23.700 --> 03:59:27.860]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[03:59:27.860 --> 03:59:35.260]  a full acre crisis garden, so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com
[03:59:35.260 --> 03:59:46.500]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember in a real crisis,
[03:59:46.500 --> 03:59:51.340]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item, this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
