[01:10.040 --> 01:15.320]  in the hour I've seen national television listen to radio promoting the
[01:15.320 --> 01:19.120]  federal anti-bullying bill saying have a heart you don't want kids to be
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.760]  bullied this is nothing more than the hate crimes law that they haven't been
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.280]  able to pass to federalize basically everything and to have pure federal
[01:30.280 --> 01:36.440]  curricula inside all public schools and to make it federal if somebody calls
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.400]  you a name and it's all selectively enforced to I mean I got beat up a lot
[01:41.400 --> 01:46.600]  and stuff when I was in public school and it wasn't because of sexual
[01:46.600 --> 01:50.680]  persuasion or even race it was just because that's what people do that's
[01:50.680 --> 01:54.680]  part of life government bullies you need to get strong and stand up for
[01:54.680 --> 01:59.840]  yourself not oh feds when you're not running checkpoints on my local highway
[01:59.840 --> 02:09.240]  that are illegal and bullying us will you come stop bullying in the school and I
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.280]  was thinking about all these news reports now about microphones going up
[02:13.280 --> 02:17.480]  all over the country and one company's been bragging about their federal
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.680]  contracts what's gotten some attention this has been going on for 13 years that
[02:21.680 --> 02:30.280]  I know and that's why they had the head of Homeland Security in one region come
[02:30.280 --> 02:34.520]  out and it's in the news report we're gonna play a clip later and say if
[02:34.520 --> 02:41.600]  Charlotte but North Carolina does get put the microphones in these that we've
[02:41.600 --> 02:46.200]  put up you'll never know and that was like whenever the Austin police chief
[02:46.200 --> 02:49.040]  was in here who by the way came up to our camera crew a few weeks ago and said
[02:49.040 --> 02:52.080]  I want to come on Alex you show haven't heard from him we've been calling his

[04:40.760 --> 04:46.120]  and they said Obama is gonna have a message and it was gonna be like a 30
[04:46.120 --> 04:52.320]  minute message but now they've backed off of that and drudge has got a report

[08:45.840 --> 08:49.800]  mention or any stories or questions or comments you have but before I give the
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.360]  number out let me just go over some of the news American newspapers as well as
[08:55.360 --> 09:00.480]  British are running the headlines don't panic FEMA urges Americans not to worry
[09:00.480 --> 09:06.680]  as national alert system is tested now federal news radio interviewing the
[09:06.680 --> 09:09.880]  deputy head of Homeland Security six months ago we first read articles about
[09:09.880 --> 09:16.920]  it then said that Obama was going to be on for 30 minutes making announcements
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.120]  today and that he would officially be there testing it there was gonna be a
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.760]  longer message then they said okay people are getting angry it'll be 10
[09:24.760 --> 09:31.320]  minutes then it'll be one minute and now it's gonna be 30 seconds I told you in
[09:31.320 --> 09:37.160]  96 I told you in 2000 I told you in 2003 I know people high up in the Texas
[09:37.160 --> 09:40.880]  Association of broadcasters I know engineers I know an engineer who was
[09:40.880 --> 09:50.840]  the head of it it's actually dead now and he's old guy God rest his soul the
[09:50.840 --> 09:55.480]  point is who were in the meetings with the feds when the telecommunications act
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.440]  passed and they came in and over the next year and they told him what was
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.800]  already in there the cell phones are being listened to and tracked you've
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.160]  got to wire the EAS systems in at your tower site and at your control site
[10:09.160 --> 10:14.480]  where you have your board ops and talk show host and you lose your license and
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.400]  maybe even get arrested if you don't do this and in the future we are going to
[10:19.400 --> 10:23.680]  have government break-ins with public service announcements and also people
[10:23.680 --> 10:28.800]  that are wanted the local police threat fusion center will be in command of it so
[10:28.800 --> 10:34.200]  it'll sound like a local announcement and these owners managers the engineers
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.840]  of these different meetings are sitting there with their mouths hanging open what
[10:39.840 --> 10:45.400]  was it 12 60 a.m. for a while I was broadcasting out of there back when they
[10:45.400 --> 10:49.320]  were talking also filling in for their afternoon host sometimes and their
[10:49.320 --> 10:54.360]  engineer talked to me about it there but but separately other engineers when I
[10:54.360 --> 10:59.040]  was at KJF K then I got introduced went to dinner with the engineer and the and
[10:59.040 --> 11:03.560]  the head engineer for the whole state and talked about it and he'll they wanted
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.800]  to tell me about this that's why I knew about it but it's just like Bill Clinton
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.440]  and I'm gonna play clips this later in the show from police state 2000 in a
[11:11.440 --> 11:18.400]  federal transportation policy change said move towards hardened and roving
[11:18.400 --> 11:24.000]  checkpoints at internal checkpoints nationwide under a national ID card
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.400]  that was in 1998 I put it in my film with the documents police state 2000 and
[11:29.400 --> 11:33.060]  people always comment on on YouTube oh look the checkpoints didn't come like
[11:33.060 --> 11:40.320]  Alex said I didn't say that I show the orders I show the the executive fiat
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.640]  directives and it takes time for them to get this stuff in place but now it's
[11:45.640 --> 11:49.240]  coming it's here now they're announcing all over the country FEMA Homeland
[11:49.240 --> 11:54.960]  Security TSA run checkpoints it's all over the news now it took them a long
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.640]  time but the point is they were getting ready getting geared up a long time ago
[11:58.640 --> 12:02.480]  I mean in the late 90s I went to urban warfare drill after drill and
[12:02.480 --> 12:05.960]  witness Marines training to go door-to-door and take our guns and admit
[12:05.960 --> 12:09.760]  it was for America and I'd show people the video and back then you weren't
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.280]  supposed to see that and so I got threats from the military all sorts of
[12:15.280 --> 12:20.120]  stuff went on the public wasn't ready so they said this must be fake again the
[12:20.120 --> 12:23.920]  Coronado landing hovercraft landing troops taking over part of Oakland
[12:23.920 --> 12:28.720]  foreign troops Rick Linklater said he had people telling him it must be fake
[12:28.720 --> 12:32.320]  when he gave him copies of police state 2000 and he laughed and so this would
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.760]  cost me you know 25 30 40 50 million dollars to do this you know to show
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.960]  ships like this landing and again it was real places it was news articles on
[12:42.960 --> 12:51.600]  top of it showing it was real but people were in denial now there's been the
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.200]  preconditioning so they go sure I told folks 13 years ago they were putting
[12:55.200 --> 13:01.040]  microphones and cameras hidden inside power transformers and light poles and
[13:01.040 --> 13:03.600]  they laughed at me even though I had the purchase orders and the federal
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.480]  regulations I even showed folks where they were going up in Austin and people
[13:08.480 --> 13:11.880]  would call into the show and say you're insane I'd say no no here's the company
[13:11.880 --> 13:16.960]  here's the 800 to something thousand dollar first purchase and then it goes
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.960]  up to 2 million next year in Austin and each successive year they got license
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.400]  plate reading cameras face scanning cameras microphones are up in every
[13:25.400 --> 13:29.160]  neighborhood in every major park they're all hooked into the stinking threat
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.200]  fusion center the average cop in there it doesn't even know that it's just rolled
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.400]  in you know about these functions let me show you these functions they can dial
[13:37.400 --> 13:42.800]  in to your cell phone live time and listen to you that's leaked out the
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.280]  average cop on the beat doesn't know that it's all need to know I mean it makes
[13:46.280 --> 13:55.000]  1984 look like child's play so I'm gonna get into all this but but I was on
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.480]  Russia today last night which is in every hotel in the US they're all part of
[14:01.480 --> 14:05.600]  that hotel video package I know cuz every time in a hotel I can see Russia
[14:05.600 --> 14:11.520]  today it's on most the cable systems in the United States and it reaches
[14:11.520 --> 14:16.720]  conservatively millions of people every hour and it's on in Europe as well and
[14:16.720 --> 14:22.320]  so I go on it and it's got kind of a liberal slant to it but but also brings
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.840]  in some libertarian ideas though I've seen last few months they've kind of
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.080]  steered a little bit away from that after getting government congressional
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.280]  criticism and I'll imagine that's what it's about because you've got the
[14:33.280 --> 14:40.240]  Japanese have English TV worldwide Al Jazeera other Arabic channels I mean
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.640]  English is the world language and so countries are all trying to put out
[14:44.640 --> 14:48.440]  their own propaganda in their own language so I'll go on Russia today but
[14:48.440 --> 14:51.720]  I was I used to be on every week I'd been on a couple months and I go on there
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.800]  and they've got a new lady on there named Liz attractive intelligent seeming
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.000]  lady and she lets me run on for you know five six minutes and then she says well
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.240]  what do you say to folks that say you sound like a schizophrenic now I had
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.440]  told people a decade ago they were putting tens of thousands of GPS units
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.600]  on cars and that on Star was a tracker GPS unit they were already using that's
[15:13.600 --> 15:16.640]  now admitted I told people they were listening to you without warrants over a
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.000]  decade ago I told you that they had face scanning license plate reading and
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.680]  microphones put up all over the place they've got giant police trucks in every
[15:27.680 --> 15:31.520]  major city some cities dozens of them that can tune into any frequency hack
[15:31.520 --> 15:34.880]  anything the police are pulling people over grabbing their cell phone without a
[15:34.880 --> 15:38.400]  warrant plugging into a system that hacks through their code downloads
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.760]  everything in a minute all over the country Marines are running checkpoints
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.800]  from Alabama to California they're setting up Homeland Security checkpoints
[15:46.800 --> 15:50.640]  pulling people out of their cars randomly they've got Viper teams going on
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.360]  trains and buses and actually saying face forward show me your ID now and
[15:55.360 --> 15:58.400]  and literally screaming at people that don't do it right I mean we're being
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.600]  inducted like people showing up at a supermax prison where they're putting
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.040]  child killers this is how child killers getting out of the prison are treated
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.640]  line up over there you know why you're here I mean this is hardcore indoctrination
[16:11.640 --> 16:15.920]  this is America going under and now there's calls to censor the web internet
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.880]  kill switches EAS takeovers it's all coming to the head they've been
[16:19.880 --> 16:24.880]  building this army against us behind the scenes and I'm on air just talking
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.520]  about how they're spying on us without warrants and how it's wrong and the
[16:28.520 --> 16:32.320]  Supreme Court is going to rule if they can spy on everybody without warrants
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.760]  and put GPS on your car without a warrant and they admit it's on tens of
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.680]  thousands of cars that's what the local police alone have ordered and they can
[16:41.680 --> 16:49.600]  use your cell phones to do it and this is now admitted admitted that I said
[16:49.600 --> 16:53.880]  Facebook says you know our users are dumb efforts ha ha ha they trust us and
[16:53.880 --> 16:58.720]  her response to me is so what do you say to people that say your risk gets a
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.040]  fronting and that's now what the TSA does if you don't want to stick their
[17:04.040 --> 17:07.840]  hands in your pants they go don't be a conspiracy theorist not wanting someone
[17:07.840 --> 17:12.600]  to touch your genitals is a conspiracy theory if you pull up at a hamburger
[17:12.600 --> 17:15.760]  place and say I want a strawberry shake instead of a chocolate that though
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.480]  that's a conspiracy theory wanting black tennis shoes instead of white
[17:20.480 --> 17:24.200]  tennis shoes conspiracy theory you're not supposed to have a thought you're
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.720]  supposed to be programmed by the television and that's it so all this
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.080]  stuff I got made fun of back when I had the government documents and did the
[17:33.080 --> 17:37.960]  research and all of our sources gave us the intel oh it wasn't real then the
[17:37.960 --> 17:40.800]  Marines weren't training to take our guns they weren't training for civil
[17:40.800 --> 17:44.760]  unrest now it's all admitted all over the news oh they're not gonna have
[17:44.760 --> 17:47.520]  checkpoints federal checkpoints in the middle of the country that's your
[17:47.520 --> 17:50.840]  conspiracy theorist really here's the Department of Transportation document
[17:50.840 --> 17:54.920]  I'm not gonna look at that nutcase well here's the document they want to take
[17:54.920 --> 17:58.800]  blood at the DMVs now they're starting to roll that out in several states they're
[17:58.800 --> 18:05.040]  like oh that doesn't exist now that it exists and as in everyone's face their
[18:05.040 --> 18:11.560]  answer is are you schizophrenic I mean I guess as you're marching into a pit to
[18:11.560 --> 18:15.520]  be shot in the back of the head by Soviets or by the Nazis did they please
[18:15.520 --> 18:18.400]  don't shit me in the head shut up conspiracy theorist this isn't even a
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.640]  gun boom I mean it's like some weird trance that people are under let's go
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.080]  ahead and go to the clip where she asked me if I'm a schizophrenic here it is like
[18:28.080 --> 18:33.080]  you're scum and trash they are letting us know we are filth and I've been to
[18:33.080 --> 18:36.440]  third-world countries where where they're a police state but the police are
[18:36.440 --> 18:41.480]  at least polite this is a open attempt to dominate and intimidate the American
[18:41.480 --> 18:44.480]  people Alex you said you're not trying to scare people I'm getting pretty scared
[18:44.480 --> 18:48.480]  listening to you it's pretty scary stuff what do you say to those that might say
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.640]  maybe you're a little paranoid maybe borderline schizophrenic what do you what
[18:53.640 --> 18:56.800]  would you say to your critics out there that that think that this is being
[18:56.800 --> 19:02.280]  hyped up a little too much well I believe in people's courage I believe that
[19:02.280 --> 19:05.480]  as Patrick Henry said I want to know the whole truth and make preparations for
[19:05.480 --> 19:09.680]  whatever it may be and so I believe that when people are faced with the truth
[19:09.680 --> 19:15.640]  that they will wake up and and take action against it I understand some
[19:15.640 --> 19:20.480]  cowards will rationalize and make excuses but they're openly announcing
[19:20.480 --> 19:24.080]  world corporate government run by the private banks that bankrupted the planet
[19:24.080 --> 19:28.880]  with derivatives the Vatican's calling for world government this stuff is all
[19:28.880 --> 19:32.520]  out in the open I mean I've got stacks of news here where Google admits all right
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.400]  the US government's telling and again I'm not blaming her she's clearly playing
[19:36.400 --> 19:40.320]  devil's advocate but devil's advocate at a certain point there is no devil's
[19:40.320 --> 19:44.880]  advocate all over the country the big six mega banks are allowed to take houses
[19:44.880 --> 19:50.320]  that aren't even in default that they don't even own and never did let's be
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.800]  clear they're taking houses pure theft and the judges and the states are saying

[24:11.680 --> 24:19.400]  lot more but think about the point we've gotten to in this society where
[24:19.400 --> 24:23.200]  you're you're simply covering the fact that the police are grabbing people's
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.560]  cell phones without warrants downloading the contents putting GPS on tens of
[24:28.560 --> 24:32.680]  thousands of people's cars dialing in and listening to our phone conversations
[24:32.680 --> 24:38.360]  without a warrant via federal law on the regulations not that they can do it under
[24:38.360 --> 24:44.040]  law but that the regulations say all the cell phones are designed to do that you
[24:44.040 --> 24:50.160]  understand that and it just goes on and on and on with hundreds of examples
[24:50.160 --> 24:55.920]  government completely out of control I saw a report just last week where actually
[24:55.920 --> 25:00.160]  Randy Kelton predicted this where 46 states attorney generals are making
[25:00.160 --> 25:04.920]  deals with the big banks and in the deals they're forgiving them for all the
[25:04.920 --> 25:09.200]  stuff they've stolen because that's their political bosses and actually
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.480]  changing the state laws and state regulations so they're allowed to steal
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.320]  your house it's like oh my gosh you've really have been stealing everything
[25:19.320 --> 25:24.240]  people are upset about this the law says it's illegal we'll just claim we're
[25:24.240 --> 25:27.680]  taking you to the woodshed and we're gonna publicly slap you on the rest
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.560]  but once we get around the woodshed we're gonna let you basically politically
[25:32.560 --> 25:35.800]  rape and financially rape the public some more we're gonna have the public
[25:35.800 --> 25:42.480]  tied down around the back okay I mean of course if Bank of America and others
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.000]  have been caught taking houses they know aren't theirs
[25:49.120 --> 25:54.960]  you see if a foreign army landed and said you are our slaves people might
[25:54.960 --> 25:58.480]  resist actually the way we've been domesticated most people would go out
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.240]  and wave handkerchiefs at them and you know worship them today of the Russians
[26:03.240 --> 26:08.440]  invaded people most people would go out and wave at them and say can I turn in
[26:08.440 --> 26:12.520]  my neighbor they don't like you I mean literally the average yuppie would say
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.120]  they'd show up at the commissar's office and say can I help round up Americans I
[26:16.120 --> 26:19.880]  love this tyranny can I have some power I notice you stomped a guy's brains out
[26:19.880 --> 26:24.320]  this morning down the road can I have a uniform I want that power I mean really
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.960]  I'd say about 60% of Americans would love it it doesn't matter though we're
[26:28.960 --> 26:35.840]  going to fight these people okay we're gonna fight them and it really hit me
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.920]  this morning while I was jogging that we always talk about the government the
[26:39.920 --> 26:44.600]  government this is not our government this is a foreign corporate system that's
[26:44.600 --> 26:50.120]  come in and is setting up a classical tyranny with a high-tech integrated
[26:50.120 --> 26:56.440]  system and if they're openly setting up illegal federal checkpoints everywhere
[26:56.440 --> 27:02.000]  they are intentionally trying to intimidate us they're going on the news
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.400]  and announcing yeah all these cities are putting in high-tech streetlights that
[27:07.400 --> 27:13.160]  watch you and listen to you and dial into the police in live time and cities
[27:13.160 --> 27:16.280]  are paying for these with Homeland Security grants and then at the end of
[27:16.280 --> 27:25.520]  the newscast they have the info babe on the local Fox affiliate Charlotte she
[27:25.520 --> 27:30.720]  says we talked to the local Homeland Security official he's an official not
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.400]  a servant he's a lord we talked to him and he said even if these were put into
[27:35.400 --> 27:40.480]  the streetlights that that city now has you would never know it's like well
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.320]  they're already there they're just putting more in because this company
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.840]  bragged about it a few weeks ago some new contracts they got there's a whole
[27:48.840 --> 27:52.720]  bunch of companies doing this and the feds had them pull the video but now
[27:52.720 --> 27:56.520]  they decided to go ahead and go with it so they're like yeah okay the streetlights
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.160]  are listening to you because they're like hey let the slaves know we're
[28:00.160 --> 28:05.240]  already taking their houses for no reason we for God's sakes we put cancer
[28:05.240 --> 28:12.000]  viruses in their vaccines and fluoride in their water so what let them know let
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.080]  them know we got an unlimited force of people that want to kick Americans

[28:28.320 --> 28:32.920]  offshore while this happens because we've got an unlimited fountain of
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.560]  control freak thug bullies and that's their attitude and that's where they're

[33:27.200 --> 33:34.120]  I don't want to give everybody the big news flash here the globalists are not
[33:34.120 --> 33:39.880]  going to give us quarter they are not going to back off this is a hot
[33:39.880 --> 33:46.320]  tyranny and military parlance that means it's it's an aggressive in-your-face
[33:46.320 --> 33:52.880]  total domination system the elites have bragged we've read their quotes written
[33:52.880 --> 33:56.520]  constant articles about it that they studied all the dictatorships and
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.720]  control systems of the world and that they decided to go with a pharmacological
[34:00.720 --> 34:06.680]  drugging of the water supply and food covertly overtly pushing drugs over
[34:06.680 --> 34:11.720]  the counter and illegal and prescription to bathe you in an entertainment
[34:11.720 --> 34:19.400]  distraction system to basically also divide and conquer populations and to
[34:19.400 --> 34:24.320]  bring in a tyrannical world government to incrementally shut off resources and
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.920]  then heavily social engineer the societies into total and complete
[34:30.920 --> 34:38.320]  collapse and then phases of ratcheted up controlled bio weapon release that then
[34:38.320 --> 34:45.240]  result in 80 to 90 percent population reduction and that's Rockefeller
[34:45.240 --> 34:50.920]  Foundation that's Eric Pionka that's Ted Turner Prince Philip Prince Charles
[34:50.920 --> 34:56.080]  Jacuzzo Club of Rome Bilderberg I've made films I've I've written articles I've
[34:56.080 --> 35:00.720]  linked to the Rockefeller Foundation and I'm sorry if that sounds like you woke
[35:00.720 --> 35:08.280]  up you know in a science fiction nightmare movie we're not in 1950 anymore
[35:08.520 --> 35:13.200]  you know now growing up I always thought why why is so much of what's in the
[35:13.200 --> 35:19.680]  science fiction movies actually coming true that's because a lot of those top
[35:19.680 --> 35:24.080]  writers are very informed and know what the elites are up to and it turns out
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.440]  to the big science fiction clubs they've bragged that they actually use
[35:28.440 --> 35:37.040]  certain writers to put these ideas out decades before Isaac Asimov Frank
[35:37.040 --> 35:43.880]  Herbert Robert a Heinlein you know Heinlein stuff is the only fiction books
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.000]  at West Point and Army War College that they have them read and of course you
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.160]  read it not the movie the book the rapid-deployed infantry the bionic
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.520]  suits the all-volunteer military the global government
[35:59.520 --> 36:08.640]  would you like to know more you know the point is is that if we can get it out to
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.680]  people the fact that it's a scientific dictatorship that's taken over that it's
[36:12.680 --> 36:19.560]  run by ultra-rich robber Baron families who 160 years ago publicly hired the top
[36:19.560 --> 36:25.440]  scientist of Germany England in the US and had public conferences calling for
[36:25.440 --> 36:33.720]  a scientific dictatorship just just type that term in and you'll get all these
[36:33.720 --> 36:40.800]  famous Nobel Prize winners Bertrand Russell I mean the list goes on and on
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.640]  HD Wells people writing non-fiction books in some cases a hundred years ago
[36:46.640 --> 36:51.600]  saying we'll genetically engineer people we'll drug the population we'll we'll
[36:51.600 --> 36:56.920]  set up a world government if we have to we'll nuke countries and make them we'll
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.320]  in the family so it's impossible for anyone to ever rebel against us this is
[37:01.320 --> 37:04.760]  how we'll do it we'll use the Roman model of breaking the men and women up and
[37:04.760 --> 37:09.120]  setting the women up as the boss we'll call it feminism
[37:11.880 --> 37:18.800]  Bernays wrote about this Department of War was actually hired in the 20s to
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.160]  break up the family they said the families are too strong we can't lower
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.440]  American education level we got to defeat these people and he wrote books
[37:26.440 --> 37:30.120]  about this you can go read it propaganda and others we need you to break up the
[37:30.120 --> 37:33.200]  family how are you going to do it and we'll he said we'll tell women it's
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.600]  stylish to you to have to have lots of sexual partners and we'll tell men it's
[37:39.600 --> 37:44.280]  stylish and we'll we'll have leaders we pay that are seen as cool call for
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.080]  feminism and they'll march and smoke cigarettes because then you can sell
[37:48.080 --> 37:53.120]  cigarettes to him as well and make some money as a side issue and he did he said
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.920]  thousands of things they implemented and totally got and he said then that way
[37:56.920 --> 38:00.880]  you'll get your goal of having the women all working to so that they can pay
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.960]  double taxes and so the stale raise the kids that is your goal correct and they
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.760]  had these big conferences with all the German psychiatrists there skull and
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.600]  bones actually set all that up and funded that in the 1830s 1840s the
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.200]  Charlotte is or be talked she has all the documents it's up at prison planet
[38:18.200 --> 38:23.920]  TV it's it's in the special reports area it's just incredible of course her dad
[38:23.920 --> 38:28.280]  and grandfather were both skull and bones high level and you and you learn
[38:28.280 --> 38:36.600]  about it I mean it's it's all dog training but the end game is not world
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.120]  government world government is only completing the gallows and then once the
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.480]  world governments complete they march you up to the top and of course they
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.320]  soft kill you you're like wise magic Johnson not get sick from HIV and
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.360]  doesn't take the drugs but everybody else is well he said he was given the
[38:53.360 --> 38:59.800]  cure if he would promote the fake cures I told you back then you know I was 16
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.960]  years ago he was given the cure 20 years ago that he'd be just fine because
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.080]  they have cures for everything they do to us and now he's lived quote 20 years
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.480]  with it and he's just fine my dad reading medical literature you know when I
[39:13.480 --> 39:16.120]  was in high school and college I would get real paranoid if I'd been
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.640]  promiscuous he said well you shouldn't be doing it anyways because it's it's
[39:19.640 --> 39:25.000]  bad and such as such but you can catch other diseases but he said HIV is a
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.880]  race specific bio weapon it's very hard to get it only time Caucasians get it as
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.840]  if they're already hemophiliacs or have debilitated immune systems and have used
[39:34.840 --> 39:38.800]  dirty drugs methamphetamine and things that have been cooked up in bathtubs
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.080]  where they can't get the core ingredients so they have to use other toxic
[39:43.080 --> 39:48.480]  ingredients and don't properly separate off the heavy metals that then kills
[39:48.480 --> 39:52.080]  the T lymphocytes or weakens and it would normally be able to recognize or
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.280]  fight off the HIV variant I'm like how do you know all this he goes oh here's
[39:56.280 --> 40:01.800]  the literature it's all the doctors the research scientists they all know it my
[40:01.800 --> 40:05.160]  dad was going to school to be a research scientist top of his class by high
[40:05.160 --> 40:08.560]  school he was already an MD Anderson working during the summers and then of
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.480]  course he met my mother she got pregnant in he wanted the fast track to just make
[40:13.480 --> 40:16.840]  some money became a dentist but the point is is that's why he's still into
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.080]  that stuff he reads all that literature that's another reason I know all of this
[40:20.080 --> 40:27.800]  but this was known a long time ago okay so people look at this government like
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.000]  oh it's out of control oh it's corrupt folks there are congressmen that listen
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.960]  to this show you've heard them talk about a listen and they're good people by
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.440]  and large but they're not even raising enough of a fit about domestic internal
[40:39.440 --> 40:43.160]  checkpoints that are 10th Amendment violators that are right out of the
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.720]  third world dictatorship that are dangerous and that are bankrupting our
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.280]  country you know they admit that in New York City in the last decade they've
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.800]  spent more than 20 buh buh buh billion you heard me right you look this up in
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.520]  one year alone they spent six billion on surveillance systems in New York you
[41:02.520 --> 41:06.680]  think that's just cameras I saw a report a few years ago where Boston spent a
[41:06.680 --> 41:11.520]  billion dollars in one year people won't believe it type Boston spends gets a
[41:11.520 --> 41:15.640]  billion dollars for security from Homeland Security Boston gets a billion
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.720]  and I think it was another article some others it was a Chicago got two billion
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.880]  the point is it folks two billion didn't just the cameras it's face scanning
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.720]  software license plate reading it's microphones that they're everywhere
[41:27.720 --> 41:33.840]  they're everywhere they're all over Austin and finally about a year ago I
[41:33.840 --> 41:37.440]  heard KLBJ doing the local news and they said yeah yes federal grants are
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.800]  putting an additional face scanning and license plate reading systems in Austin
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.400]  and gunshot detectors they're not gunshot detectors their microphones the
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.560]  company that got the grant in Congress that it says their microphones and they
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.000]  brag how they can listen to conversations at 200 yards away how it's run
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.560]  through a digital algorithm and how now when they're able to get a sample of your
[41:57.560 --> 42:01.560]  voice print like when you talk into Google and it's voice identification you
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.400]  know when you want to find a website give me where movies are showing where's
[42:06.400 --> 42:14.040]  the thing showing tonight and it tells you or it then takes you there they're
[42:14.040 --> 42:16.680]  getting your voice print right there attached to your phone now you're
[42:16.680 --> 42:21.280]  walking it hears you it goes into an AI system it's recorded you think your
[42:21.280 --> 42:26.200]  cell phone can do powerful stuff what about fake transformer boxes and and
[42:26.200 --> 42:30.840]  light poles just jam packed with it they announced a year ago they're gonna have
[42:30.840 --> 42:37.040]  all of the regular mail delivery USPS driving around with snooper systems
[42:37.040 --> 42:42.000]  grabbing all your data again getting intelligence on you not because you're
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.520]  bad but because they're criminals oh the idiot driving the vehicles a
[42:45.520 --> 42:50.920]  compartmentalized fluoride head I'm talking about how it's all collated by
[42:50.920 --> 42:56.360]  the super brain AI computers which they now admit can predict individual
[42:56.360 --> 43:02.160]  activities 93% of the time they know what you're gonna do before you do it 93%
[43:02.160 --> 43:06.040]  of the time because that systems mapped your subconscious decision-making
[43:06.040 --> 43:11.320]  processes they know when I'm not gonna be able to control myself and pull into a
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.520]  steakhouse at 9 o'clock at night because I've been up here working and forgot to
[43:14.520 --> 43:22.200]  eat they know predictively before I pull into the steakhouse they know
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.040]  predictively when I break down every few months and pull in and buy a 12 pack of
[43:26.040 --> 43:32.280]  beer they know it all now is that freedom but remember all the people in the
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.280]  earlier level of programming they were saying oh this will never happen that's
[43:37.280 --> 43:41.800]  that's big brother of America's free we don't have that and now they're like okay
[43:41.800 --> 43:46.400]  they're listening to us what's wrong with that are you a thought criminal what
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.360]  do you have to hide and it's peer pressure they get TSA they get cops they
[43:52.360 --> 43:55.600]  get military and domestic operations they get them all together they train
[43:55.600 --> 43:59.120]  them we're the enemy they give them examples of the media of it and they're
[43:59.120 --> 44:04.200]  ready ladies and gentlemen look the Germans were extremely moral people in
[44:04.200 --> 44:07.800]  Germany pre-Hitler and he knew how to manipulate them knew how to give them
[44:07.800 --> 44:12.360]  outside threats knew how to hit my increments come do more and more until
[44:12.360 --> 44:15.480]  the point the average German shoulder soldier would literally put a gun right
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.120]  to a two-year-old's head and blow its head off and I'm telling you right now
[44:19.120 --> 44:24.040]  right now on the current track within five to ten years or even sooner when
[44:24.040 --> 44:30.120]  they stage a big terror attack the police will do anything they're told the
[44:30.120 --> 44:35.360]  courts this is the key listen to me carefully what when tyranny is going on
[44:35.360 --> 44:41.880]  in an early stage people will deny it because it's scary and they're lazy they
[44:41.880 --> 44:46.080]  don't want to think about it but when it becomes overt and obvious a lot of
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.560]  people don't really get into denial they get into another form of denial they
[44:52.560 --> 44:57.440]  decide to just shut up and keep quiet and go along with it some decided just
[44:57.440 --> 45:02.320]  try to stay out of it so in the fence others decided to join with it others
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.840]  decide to try to go along with it and and well well maybe I can have some of
[45:07.840 --> 45:11.680]  this power you can't beat them join them as if you can make a deal with Hitler or
[45:11.680 --> 45:16.880]  the devil or Mao Zedong statistically that's even more dangerous I found this
[45:16.880 --> 45:21.560]  system hates its own number one threat they say returning veterans number two
[45:21.560 --> 45:24.800]  it's not in the documents they give cops but I've confirmed from my
[45:24.800 --> 45:29.520]  intelligence sources they say I'm dead on cops are actually even higher the
[45:29.520 --> 45:36.120]  average cop is under total Pentagon surveillance I mean you guys literally
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.800]  I've got magnifying glasses on you and they think as you learn about this you're
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.240]  gonna be cowards and watch what you say and do you've done nothing wrong you
[45:45.240 --> 45:50.040]  aren't a criminal stop acting like you're a criminal now it's illegal that
[45:50.040 --> 45:54.000]  they're listening to everything I do and building databases on me as a citizen
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.280]  but you know what at the end of the day good I hope all the scums listening
[45:57.280 --> 46:01.440]  because because I'm gonna sit here and you're gonna laugh today but next week
[46:01.440 --> 46:06.280]  you're gonna hear your wife Scott stomach cancer at 52 maybe then you'll go
[46:06.280 --> 46:09.880]  check cancer statistics maybe then you'll go read Rockefeller documents how
[46:09.880 --> 46:14.120]  they did it maybe then you'll get angry and realize that your wife being
[46:14.120 --> 46:18.480]  murdered in front of you or you or you're gonna learn you've got pancreatic
[46:18.480 --> 46:21.800]  cancer next week I guarantee you there's government people listening right now
[46:21.800 --> 46:25.000]  statistically who are gonna be diagnosed with cancer this isn't some
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.680]  preacher magically doing it I know statistically you're gonna you there are
[46:28.680 --> 46:31.760]  a lot of you feds listening right now who are compartmentalized who are gonna
[46:31.760 --> 46:37.040]  be dead in three months car wrecks you name it but a lot of you are have
[46:37.040 --> 46:41.240]  already been soft killed a lot of troops that have worked around DU you're
[46:41.240 --> 46:44.720]  gonna be dead soon and right now you feel like you're part of the system you
[46:44.720 --> 46:47.680]  feel like you know America's good you're doing a good job and I'm a crazy
[46:47.680 --> 46:56.480]  person but the key is before you die you can wake up and wake up others you
[46:56.480 --> 47:01.640]  understand that the tripling in the last 20 years the doubling in the last 10
[47:01.640 --> 47:06.440]  years of diabetes cancer doubling tripling just death all around us but
[47:06.440 --> 47:13.000]  it's not the big news item like Herman Cain and all these Democratic operative
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.400]  women saying he grabbed on them I don't like Herman Cain I've seen him lie with
[47:17.400 --> 47:20.360]  a straight face and say I didn't call people that want to audit the fed dumb
[47:20.360 --> 47:24.160]  when he's in his book saying it when he's on radio saying it and I said man
[47:24.160 --> 47:29.520]  that's a good liar but people that work for Axelrod people that constantly make
[47:29.520 --> 47:36.600]  these claims as part of a business model it's a bunch of bull I mean I know a lot
[47:36.600 --> 47:39.840]  of men who know cheat on their wives but still will flirt with women and he
[47:39.840 --> 47:42.440]  might have with some of them say baby you're looking good then when I control
[47:42.440 --> 47:47.360]  myself I mean I mean there's no doubt that might have gone on but the point is
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.960]  does that even matter I mean when Bill Clinton was on settling cases with women
[47:51.960 --> 47:56.480]  that said he raped them the feminists were defending him see it's just a
[47:56.480 --> 48:04.400]  political tool so no I can't get up here and talk about things that don't matter
[48:04.400 --> 48:07.880]  and are in a huge distractions as world governments being announced as the
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.000]  world economy is imploding today we got guests coming up on that and as a
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.720]  total surveillance grid goes in with tens of billions of dollars a year of
[48:16.720 --> 48:23.640]  federal grants I'm talking billions in major cities that that makes North
[48:23.640 --> 48:27.120]  Korean surveillance I saw somebody comment say we're not worse than North
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.560]  Korea I'm saying in the respect of surveillance we are we still have the
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.640]  free speech because we've always exercised it but now they're trying to
[48:34.640 --> 48:40.120]  take that let's go to this short clip from Fox News in the Carolinas after they
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.000]  admit the microphones are going up around the country they say well even if
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.920]  they are you'll never know see there's that arrogant in your face attitude
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.400]  here's that clip and we talked to the deputy chief of Homeland Security here
[48:52.400 --> 48:56.200]  in Charlotte he says if the city installed streetlights with surveillance
[48:56.200 --> 49:02.920]  abilities you would never know okay now let's go ahead and go to a clip from
[49:02.920 --> 49:10.000]  police state 2000 from 1999 but actually the news article is from 98 going from
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.800]  memory it'll be on screen in a moment now I already knew about this and got the
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.200]  purchase order sent to me by an engineer who was involved putting them in I'll
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.200]  leave it at that get a lot of stuff leaked to us now we're drowning in it
[49:21.200 --> 49:29.240]  and he said they're putting microphones up in in in lot lamp post and in
[49:29.240 --> 49:35.000]  transformers and cameras and here's the company and I went and found the company
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.720]  bragging to government that yeah we can list people 200 yards away then the
[49:38.720 --> 49:42.600]  statesman was forced to report on it but they said they're gunshot detectors
[49:42.600 --> 49:46.160]  of course they've never used them for gunshot detecting in East Austin when
[49:46.160 --> 49:50.680]  there's gunshots they're microphones and they use them to listen to people and
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.160]  they've been putting them in more and more to where every neighborhood's got
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.800]  them parks have got them it's everywhere so see they're now just getting ready to
[49:57.800 --> 50:04.040]  tell the slaves but here's a clip from police state 2000 it's not just armor
[50:04.040 --> 50:09.440]  that local law enforcement from state agencies to local police departments
[50:09.440 --> 50:14.200]  are getting know my friends it's listening devices of course the excuse
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.840]  is is to find the location of gunshots but the designers openly admit it can
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.280]  also be used to listen to your conversations and triangulate your
[50:22.280 --> 50:27.280]  position it's just consciously think about this for a second listening
[50:27.280 --> 50:34.960]  devices and I almost forgot in tandem with cameras all federal funding repeat
[50:34.960 --> 50:40.560]  all federal armor personnel carriers helicopters foreign troops practicing
[50:40.560 --> 50:44.880]  with local police with our military and in Austin Texas and many other cities
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.840]  I've visited I have noticed that many of the cameras aim into the neighborhoods
[50:49.840 --> 50:54.720]  I'm not kidding time and time again they are not focused will be back we'll be
[50:54.720 --> 51:01.360]  back with me warning you about EAS and federal checkpoints stay with us hi this

[54:16.720 --> 54:21.040]  then when our guest is on with us back Narek it's just it's so painful to know
[54:21.040 --> 54:26.800]  I'm right to understand this to study it and to have been there so many times and
[54:26.800 --> 54:31.840]  watch Marines train to take our guns and to have cameramen in places like
[54:31.840 --> 54:35.320]  Hebron, Maryland where Marines came up with guns and said don't videotape us
[54:35.320 --> 54:41.800]  and it's for America it's admitted it's for America now it's so illegal the
[54:41.800 --> 54:47.240]  government takes our tax money we've got really about a 25% unemployment rate
[54:47.240 --> 54:51.520]  right now even 60 minutes admits that a year ago last November they admitted
[54:51.520 --> 54:57.400]  23 all these economists admitted it's over 20 California is over 30 and they
[54:57.400 --> 55:01.080]  lied to us about that number and then they spend tens of billions of dollars
[55:01.080 --> 55:07.360]  putting up cameras and microphones just everywhere but then you take cops in
[55:07.360 --> 55:12.560]  public they arrest you and charge you with life in prison I mean what this
[55:12.560 --> 55:18.840]  country has cancer does that mean the average cops a bad person no but kind of
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.760]  like the average German wasn't the average German was just making munitions
[55:22.760 --> 55:25.960]  or working in a dairy or even if you were a soldier you were fighting other
[55:25.960 --> 55:31.680]  soldiers but your government was evil your government was evil and the
[55:31.680 --> 55:34.800]  bankers have committed all these crimes they've taken the country over now
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.960]  they've got to keep it let's go to this next clip in the near calls this is

[56:16.360 --> 56:20.320]  checkpoint from 98 and here I am talking about their plan to set up hardened
[56:20.320 --> 56:24.360]  checkpoints nationwide now it's begun here it is and then you've got the
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.720]  checkpoints those can't be ignored warrantless searches random searches can't
[56:29.720 --> 56:47.000]  be called America entering the eye of the checkpoint and at this time that

[57:40.160 --> 57:43.280]  got them just pulling them back pulling them off down there pulling them off
[57:43.280 --> 57:49.480]  here all part of Bill Clinton's funding and they love it I told Aaron to grab
[57:49.480 --> 57:52.320]  the clips that's actually not the clip where I showed the document and said
[57:52.320 --> 57:55.720]  they're gonna put in hardened checkpoints around the country but now by
[57:55.720 --> 57:59.440]  the way the state Supreme Court said that was illegal about a year after
[57:59.440 --> 58:03.400]  because they were starting to set them up everywhere and so now the feds are
[58:03.400 --> 58:07.160]  back and they're just saying well we just wave a magic wand and they go out and
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.000]  I've seen the video around the country it'll be state police like shaking like
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.040]  they're a bird dog of you know and you're about to shoot some quail or
[58:15.040 --> 58:17.720]  something and they're just looking at everybody just going with their hats on
[58:17.720 --> 58:22.040]  the ones and little kids are scared and they're over there I'm searching and home
[58:22.040 --> 58:28.640]  and the titles over the pervs TSA ready to grab the genitals and it's just it's
[58:28.640 --> 58:33.280]  just a total takeover we got the clip of my EAS info coming up because you know
[58:33.280 --> 58:40.160]  what in one hour the feds are taken over all the AM and FM stations we're on
[58:42.440 --> 58:49.200]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:04.400 --> 59:08.520]  old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what

[59:13.080 --> 59:18.640]  no useless dyes for fumes deodorants or antibacterials your risk is the hundreds
[59:18.640 --> 59:23.280]  of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes itching sores and a

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you on answers well so does he
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:21.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:27.120]  Jones we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us we
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.640]  got Michael back near coming to the next segment we'll have open phones while
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.720]  he's on with us with your questions or comments on the issue I haven't even
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.320]  gotten into the Herman Cain news the FEMA takeover alert news the McCain
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.120]  saying that there's gonna be a third party no kidding a bunch of big polls
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.200]  showing Ron Paul can and will win if we get behind him the amazing threats out
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.360]  of Iran to use low intensity asymmetrical gorilla attacks all over the
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.920]  West if they're attacked well that just guarantees the West will probably attack
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.480]  them then because they want that political distraction I mean that that's
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.600]  why they're getting ready with the checkpoints and things this is the
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.080]  excuse to really really take liberties while the banks rape us so that's all
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:13.520]  coming up but right now let's go to Christian New York then Rudy and others
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:20.920]  go ahead Chris thanks for holding I last week Jesse Ventura said he would
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.800]  he would consider running under the third party if they asked him so I emailed
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.000]  every everybody the libertarian party I could find email addresses for you know
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.400]  just through that idea by him see if they knew it not many of them really knew
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.240]  that idea but they do now so I don't know if you can put between you know the
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.360]  libertarian party at Jesse in the same room or on the same phone line and get
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.800]  them pop yeah no I thought about this morning I shouldn't just sit back and
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.480]  let them do you know never really get the news or Lord let them have it fall
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.120]  through the cracks I should get ahold of the president of the libertarian party
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.800]  I think I've interviewed the last head but whoever the head is now I know most
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.200]  of them know who I am I need to call them and get them on the horn and get
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.720]  them Ventura's number because he wants I guess the invitation to go to their
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:12.020]  caucus and you know that there be some interest he but I mean Jesse should know
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.960]  the libertarians he needs to go in there and stick his snout in the trough and
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.480]  basically take it over if that's what he wants it's all about that caucus voting
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.600]  for him but Jesse I'll tell you does not want to run for president but if he
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.680]  gets called he'll do it and I guess I should stir up some more trouble and make
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.600]  sure that that happens to try and pass that message along to Jesse and just
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.720]  trying to make that connection at least get that least first dialogue you know
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.200]  Lisa we try to get them talking oh listen do me a favor on that subject we
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.720]  have it all written up nicely with the video link of Jesse Ventura talking
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.600]  about it if you go to info wars.com it's poll Ron Paul third party bid
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.800]  can transform 2012 election and it goes on to say Paul Ventura ticket would
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.440]  pose greater threat than Ross Perot's 92 campaign and they've got ballot access
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.760]  and if Ron Paul doesn't win the Republican nomination if it's not clear
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.960]  he's going to get it here in about three months well know by March it's time to
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.160]  supercharge but they should have Ventura in the wings ready if Paul doesn't do
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:23.600]  it so it's a powerful one-two punch this article breaks down all the numbers
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.000]  we're gonna cover it later in the hour get this article out to everyone Ron
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Paul's also won another big straw poll and he came in second another big poll
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.960]  only to Romney a very very exciting news I don't have the context that you do so
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.840]  if you can kind of maybe get them together you know definitely be helpful
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.040]  no I just need to get on the horn and try to get a hold of the head of the
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.440]  libertarian party and but I mean wow I mean if they don't know how to get a
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:57.200]  hold of Ventura I'm sure I can make it easy for them if they want but I mean
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.400]  I'm sure they can get a hold of his publicist or if I can give them Michael
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:07.040]  Braverman's number if they wanted his manager and well I could I could just
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.240]  give him Ventura's home phone number I know he wants to talk to the other
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.120]  libertarian party but there you go everybody contact libertarians tell
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.680]  them get a hold of Ventura get a hold Alex Jones but certainly the videos the
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.800]  audio are out there if they they must be living in a cave if they don't know
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:27.960]  this but I don't know it seemed like a surprise to them but I think if we keep
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.640]  hammer I'm saying hey you gotta talk don't reach out to them let me out
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.840]  here from outside sale I said you have better contacts with each of these
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.160]  individuals than I do so this is my call out let's do this yeah no they should
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:47.520]  encourage him to seek the libertarian party nomination for president we'll be
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.800]  right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us imagine Ventura in the debates

[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.160]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.120]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.480]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.820]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.600]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.480]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:13.360]  radio network well we are in the thick of it yet again Jesse Ventura I can tell
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:19.960]  you right now we'll run as the libertarian presidential candidate he will go and
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:24.880]  attempt to get their nomination at their caucuses coming up and he would
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.720]  undoubtedly win if if the libertarian leadership contacts him and basically
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.240]  just shows him the ropes and shows him a little bit of interest quite friendly
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.240]  the way the libertarians work anyways is Ventura's you just go in there and do
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.640]  it himself but obviously I know they've approached Ron Paul a few weeks ago and
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.560]  they said we'd like you to come over here you're gonna have a third party run
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.040]  Ron Paul the city has no intention of that right now but he's leaving it open
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.760]  and might do it if he doesn't win the Republican nomination and he's got to say
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.760]  that because then they'll say you're not really a Republican you're not serious
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.240]  when he's number two or number three in every poll and people will say well what
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.920]  would you do if Ron Paul got the nomination and then Ventura was over
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.760]  there well Ventura would just run as an auxiliary to kind of educate people
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.880]  about libertarian ideas and expose the TSA and probably just throw a support
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.320]  behind Ron Paul the point is is that they've reached out to Ron Paul they
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.000]  should reach out to Ventura and then we'll know by the time that that that
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.600]  election process happens yeah it happens after March and by then we'll know
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.600]  if Ron Paul is gonna win the primaries or not I mean they'll probably try to
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.760]  cheat him in New Hampshire like they already did and we'll see what happens
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.440]  in a few other states but he's a lot stronger than last time and then if it
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.520]  doesn't look like he's gonna do it by staying in there he's educated folks
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.400]  injected real ideas been in the debates show but true libertarian
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.320]  constitutionalism is he punches out runs as a libertarian and Ventura is
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.040]  ready to run as his VP he's already said that so in the libertarian party gets
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.280]  somebody like Aaron Russo or somebody like Bob Barr somebody like Michael
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:09.440]  McNerrick those are all great people prominent well-known great men but
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.800]  Ventura is even more known and he's great in a stump speech and he's got very
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.400]  libertarian views they extremely libertarian when it comes to fiscal
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.760]  libertarian liberal edged but I mean yeah he's right in the middle of the
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.560]  libertarians and I'm telling you it is a power-packed duo I know politics but
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.560]  regardless if Ron Paul who's already saying he's retiring he doesn't win
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:38.520]  fades off can you imagine Ventura I mean look look here is John McCain today
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.960]  I'll show you a document cam shot of this this is out of Reuters fed up
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.240]  McCain predicts rise of third political party no kidding in some polls it's more
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.680]  than 80% are mad at both parties 9% approval rating for Congress they are
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.360]  ready for something new well it's got to be viable like a libertarian it's got to
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.440]  be viable candidates it's got to be somebody with name recognition and not
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.120]  something like Newt Gennrich running on a third party McCain predicts rise of
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.360]  third political party says the public is totally angry that it's going to
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:15.400]  happen no kidding well here's the other article right here Paul dealing with
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.960]  Ron Paul Paul Ron Paul third-party bid could transform 2012 election Paul
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:26.200]  Ventura ticket would pose greater threat than Ross Perot 92 campaign Ross Perot
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.160]  went up to above 30% then they threatened his family he backed out when he
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:36.080]  began he was at about 5% in national polls Ron Paul is polling at 18% in the
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.280]  latest scientific poll I've seen him as high as 30 he does much better against
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.000]  Obama in every poll than any other Republican he's a true constitutionalist
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.760]  he'll in the Federal Reserve he'll cut back all these wars and military and
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.800]  and this globalism he's against the New World Order he is the antidote to the
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.240]  cyanide at this level and again even if he doesn't win he wins by putting out
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:09.360]  real issues exposing the real enemy so Mark Henkel is the head of Libertarian
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.200]  Party right now and Jesse Ventura just wants to be shown around and then he
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.160]  says you'll go through the process so imagine if the Libertarian Party who's
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.400]  got ballot access and all this what a Ventura candidacy or even him involved
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.360]  in the caucus would do imagine in fact maybe he want to be vice president to
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.920]  somebody you already said it was for Ron Paul he just wants to be able to
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.000]  inject real issues he is perfect and some have said the Libertarian Party has
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.120]  had infiltrators in over the years to make sure it didn't get going because
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.360]  it is the strongest third party out there with ballot access and millions of
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:48.160]  voters so if they don't reach out to Ventura at least and I don't know Chris
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.080]  Henkel from a hole in the ground I'm sure he's a great guy
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:58.880]  his background looks good yeah Mark Henkel was that calling Chris Henkel it
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.760]  doesn't matter I'm brain dead Chris Henkel is Mark Henkel she had a home from
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.760]  a home of her I don't even know his name Mark Henkel I was trying to pull it up
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.680]  here I was going for memory you can go to mark4chair.com I guess that's his
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.560]  website when he was running to be the Libertarian Party head and in contact
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.840]  him and contact the entire Libertarian people like how do we contact him type
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:25.480]  in Libertarian Party then it gives you links to their site then you click on
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:31.760]  their site on the Libertarian National Committee and it gives you all the
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.560]  people on the committee and there it is now perfect timing for the rest of the
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.960]  hour and five minutes into the next hour to have Michael Bagnarek a good friend
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.120]  of mine former Austinite narrowly we actually died survived a heart attack this
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.280]  was a year and a half ago or so now he's an American software engineer political
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.920]  figure former radio talk show host he was Libertarian Party nominee for
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.320]  president of the United States in 04 elections and placed fours in the race
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.880]  nationally by an independent Ralph Nader two years later he ran his Libertarian
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.680]  Party candidate in 06 congressional elections for the 10th congressional
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.720]  district seat Bagnarek's political philosophy emphasizes individual
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.840]  liberty personal responsibility and strict adherence to the original
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.720]  interpretation of the U.S. Constitution all of his positions arise from this
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.080]  foundation in economics Bagnarek believes in the laissez faire capitalism a
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.560]  system in which the only function of government is the protection of
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.720]  individual rights from the institution of force and fraud he therefore opposes
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.460]  institutions such as welfare and business regulation Constitution
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.840]  preservation.org is this great website we're going to get into all the new
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.240]  horrors the open overthrow of the Constitution now that that's just in
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.920]  it's in full flames right now we're gonna get his view on everything that's
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.880]  happening his take on it but first Libertarian Party I mean they've got a
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.720]  responsibility I think to run a really hardcore focused candidate who will be
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.840]  an activist and who will attack the police state Ventura has really woken
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.640]  up now I've seen his policies as governor he was a maverick he a real
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:12.440]  guy but not very well informed at the time now he is you just heard my rant
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:18.400]  Michael about him what do you think he should do because he's wanting to be
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.560]  contacted by the Libertarians what's your view on that I think that the
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.400]  Libertarian Party should at least reach out to him if your background people
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:35.880]  will text me into his phone number I'll make sure that Mark Hinkle gets it so
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:41.120]  you know Hinkle I do know Mark Hinkle is a good man he was I was there in St.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.560]  Louis last year when he was nominated as our national chair I've spoken to him
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.000]  fairly recently and I will make sure that Mark at least gets Ventura's phone
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.840]  number they may have it already I spoke to someone about two weeks ago who
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:05.120]  suggested that they had invited Jesse to come and participate in a debate I
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:10.600]  don't know that phone call I don't know but I will tell you right now just even
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.960]  Tura talks to basically no one and see that's the issue is that he's just his
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.520]  own guy so it's hard to get a hold of him I mean I'm friends with him and so
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.000]  I'm ready for them to talk to Libertarians right now I'm ready to get
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.960]  this going right now well I can at least give Mark the phone number and do
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:34.840]  that much at least the we'll start the phone calls you know rolling yeah well
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.240]  if you just have Hinkle call me up at the end of the show I'll just I'll get
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.600]  him on the phone a three-way with Ventura right now or I mean whatever I
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.320]  mean I would give you Ventura's number but I got to call him and ask
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:46.400]  permission and he never wants me to give anybody his number I was there with
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.680]  some billionaire industrialist wanted to get in contact with him and and he said
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.240]  no when I was out this event I mean I don't want to say he's reclusive but at
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.520]  borders on it that he just does he goes out in public a lot but he just doesn't
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.360]  like telephones he doesn't have a cell phone but we'll work on that but
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:05.600]  obviously I think Ventura would bring just a lot of energy and attention to
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.600]  the Libertarian Party I mean that's a no-brainer well one of the reasons that
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.720]  Libertarians would love Ron Paul to run as a Libertarian candidate is to bring
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:21.720]  all that notoriety that he has with him and so I think that it's possible if not
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:28.720]  probable that Libertarians would nominate a notable figure like Jesse well
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.960]  well sure plus he is a Libertarian but more importantly he's ready to be a
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:38.440]  placeholder for Ron Paul he's ready to be VP I understand that I mean he's the
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:44.160]  perfect candidate he's ready right now and again folks imagine Ron Paul's a lot
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.840]  better than Ross Perot Ross Perot was hardly known when he first ran Ventura is
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.440]  super well known I mean these are both dynamite candidates and again again I
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.960]  know Ventura if Ron Paul was to get the nomination and Ventura was already going
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.840]  as Libertarian they would just become an auxiliary of Ron Paul while building up
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:07.160]  the Libertarian Party I believe that it's perfect then all right well it's
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.080]  just everybody's calling me now that Ventura said this yesterday on the show
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.360]  and last week and Ventura hadn't been contacted or they don't know how to get
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:20.080]  a hold of him and so all of that's going on and so now I'm getting emails phone

[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.760]  called Free America Now one of the things that people have said for years is
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.600]  we need to have an umbrella organization that will combine the
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.360]  Constitution Party the Libertarian Party all these libertarian all these
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.400]  liberty-minded groups nobody wants to have an umbrella group over them so the

[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.360]  phone numbers said they've been trying to basically get a hold of interon and
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.320]  can't I think that's kind of what McNerrick was saying he heard a few
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.880]  weeks ago and he is the former 2004 presidential nominee and candidate so
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.320]  obviously he's got the inside scoop they're very exciting now now Michael
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.280]  you're bringing up this new educational group you've launched I'm gonna get more
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.160]  into that later and give out a website or as they find it at
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.600]  constitutionpreservation.org but what do you make of the coming out of the
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.480]  closet now of tyranny yeah we got microphones and face scanning cameras
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.480]  listing and watching hidden everywhere yeah we're gonna arrest you videotape
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:00.360]  us yeah we're putting federal checkpoints on highways yeah we're gonna
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  just start taking all your rights I mean yeah the CIA is gonna be in your town
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.600]  yeah we're tracking all the conservatives and libertarians and
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.480]  putting you on terrorist list I mean it's like they're trying like a like a
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:20.280]  a art type or a absurdist image of a police state I mean where it's like a
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.640]  joke it's like one Homeland Security deputy directors you know made jokes
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.520]  about big sis is listening and you won't know when I mean it's like they're
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.560]  what are they doing have they gone crazy I think what they're doing Alex is
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.320]  trying to close the window we have so many people who have woken up and much
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.080]  of that goes thanks to you with all of your videos you know that you and I have
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:50.080]  been fighting for liberty for last 14 years that I know of because we we
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:56.040]  started in Austin Texas back in at least 1997 that I can think of but these
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:01.680]  people are waking up I think the powers that be realized that they have a small
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.640]  window of opportunity and they have to rush to to complete their program we
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:13.000]  have the Tea Party the Occupy Wall Street the Oak Patriots all these different
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.200]  organizations I mean you can't throw a stick without any protest and so I
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.160]  think we're we're getting down to well we're gonna know in a year or two whether
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.800]  we've been able to restore liberty your skype has broken up a little bit I'm
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.160]  gonna have you stay on video skype but go to your home phone number if we can
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:35.920]  to perhaps get your computer closer to you during a break Michael because I
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.720]  really want to be able to fully understand everything you're saying but I
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.160]  heard most of it what I'm I totally concur they're now trying to finish a
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.320]  plan that they had over another 10 20 years they're trying to speed it up
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.720]  right now because they realize we're waking up to them because of the I
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.440]  mean Sabina Brzezinski last year told the CFR he said the world is awake and
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.000]  staring at the elite for the first time in history we're in trouble and so now
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.680]  they're just dispensing with it's for your own good and saying hey we're
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.440]  basically authoritarian thugs be scared of us I mean is that what you're
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.720]  saying
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:17.320]  okay great they're they're they're trying to fix his connection with Michael
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.160]  Bagnarek with us today and I also want to go to your also go to your phone calls
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:30.440]  with him today I tell you it is just it is just so overt and now to see mainstream
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.120]  media try to go it's reasonable to secretly record people and have
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:39.440]  microphones and cameras it's reasonable to have the TSA stick their hands down
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.760]  your five-year-olds pants and then they see you know we'll stop doing that and
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.400]  then they the next day search all children and they just go we're not
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.760]  gonna stop Michael go ahead so so this is an attempt to intimidate us or to
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.640]  finish their program it is an attempt to intimidate is a lot of people
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.080]  understand what is happening but they really don't have the courage to stand
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.800]  up against it there are still people who put their hands over the head and allow
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.840]  TSA to take the naked photo of them I refuse to do that myself I figure if I
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.920]  have to be you know suffer the indignity of a search then someone else is gonna
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.280]  have to suffer the indignity of patting me down but you know that's a good point
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.720]  I mean the search is meant to intimidate you into taking the scanner but in a way
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.520]  it's by by resisting them it makes them do something just as bad and exposes
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.800]  them well the last few times I've had been pat down the inspector that was
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.440]  patting me down was far more embarrassed than I am I used to be a skydiving
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.360]  instructor so I'm not terribly shy and you know I've I told him that I usually
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:57.200]  have to pay $30 for massage like that but but still I mean we can laugh about
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.800]  it again it's meant to get in our personal space though it is and we need
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.280]  to start pushing back we need to let them know that we are not afraid of them
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.720]  that we are not going to tolerate these violations of our rights and and I think
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:18.920]  that eventually more and more people are going to do that the Occupy Wall Street
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:24.920]  is you know across the nation I believe that they are well-meaning but some
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:30.920]  sometimes misinformed let's talk about that Herman Cain in the Fed yeah well
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:36.440]  let's talk about that Herman Cain in the Fed let's get into where you see the
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.240]  world going how you would handle these federal checkpoints that violate Fourth

[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.400]  going back to Michael bagnarek Michael you were making a point as we went to
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:52.880]  break and then when you're done making that point I want to ask you I mean the
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:56.280]  system knows what they're doing and they know they've been created the
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.680]  derivatives between corporate mega banks and government they know they're
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.560]  going to use the crises to offer their world government is the solution now
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.520]  that's all out in the open whereas years ago you and I would be attacked for even
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:12.240]  talking about it because we were informed the public wasn't we were trying to
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:17.600]  inform them and now all over the country you just pull up and they're looking at
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.960]  you like you're being inducted into a maximum security prison and they jerk
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:25.680]  families out of cars they search and it's all for your safety because you're
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.400]  guilty until proven innocent because government's got to protect you from
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.880]  terrorist when you got a better chance of dying in a car wreck or a bolt of
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.720]  lightning or a bee sting or snake bite then being killed by terrorism then you
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:41.200]  look at terrorism when you find out most of its manufactured and staged or
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  provocateur the underwear bombers put on the plane the shoe bombers put on the
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.560]  plane the Fort Hood shooters protected Al Qaeda is given control by NATO of
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.600]  Libya I mean it's incredible so Michael Bagnaric libertarian activist talk show
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.840]  host author I think you hit the nail on the head people are angry I'm on talk
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:05.280]  shows all the time and they say okay I get it you're right I thought you were
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.400]  crazy I mean I get this every day when I do interviews you're right it's all
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:16.160]  true man Cal Muller this morning he goes what do I do and and so I'm gonna do
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.240]  some news reports the next week or so about what we do from my perspective but
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:25.080]  people are all looking for some magic bullet it's about rediscovering liberty
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:29.840]  becoming an activist waking others up making personal decisions about what you
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.240]  eat what you buy who you support and spreading the culture of liberty shedding
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:39.720]  brush fires in the minds of men and women just like the decades of committees of
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.880]  correspondence before the Revolutionary War we we've got the people awake now
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:50.880]  but we've got a fully informed them now and then start moving forward well I'm
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.160]  sure this happens to you Alex where people come up to you and say Alex all
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.400]  you have to do is and then they give you their favorite idea what I tell people
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.880]  is don't tell me what I have to do go out and find the resources make it happen
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.880]  and then come back after you've been successful so that I can congratulate you
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:14.240]  you know you and I and Ron Paul Jesse Ventura the four of us can't restore
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.680]  liberty alone we need all of those people out there those Americans to do
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:24.400]  their port their part of the job and one of the things that was about to say was
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:31.000]  that no more Gaddafi is recently eliminated but months ago they took him
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  out of the Capitol and I mean any rational person would have been hiding
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.760]  on a desert island using some kind of a mask into changing their name but when
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.320]  you're a sociopath you just cannot conceive of losing power and no more
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.840]  Gaddafi stayed around until they actually found him I think that there are
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.600]  people like that in the American government who think they can get away
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.160]  with anything that they can continue to intimidate us continue to do our
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.760]  checkpoints to to frisk our our young children at the airports and that
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:10.920]  Americans will continue to tolerate that type of activity and you and I both know
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.960]  that we will not tolerate forever that's what we're saying now with all these
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.760]  protest rallies and what I try to do is I try to give people practical things
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.240]  that they can do the first thing that I recommend is they they store up on food
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:32.040]  and and make sure that they can feed at their immediate family convert their
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:37.680]  paper money to silver and gold or some commodity that they can trade when the
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:43.040]  you know the economic breakdown happens I also recommend strongly that they have
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.840]  some sort of a gun with ammunition so they can protect the food and silver
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:53.440]  and finally I get them to network with their neighbors when you and I were
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.960]  growing up Alex we knew the neighborhood all the parents in the
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.920]  neighborhood knew us and there was a camaraderie here there on a neighborhood
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.080]  now people live on the same block or in the same apartment building but they
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.640]  don't know who their neighbors are and so I recommend that they start to network
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:18.520]  but people get to know them and trust them before the emergency happens well
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.520]  you're right and again you join us from a hotel lobby I guess so that's why people
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:27.000]  can hear a little bit of background noise there but it's it's kind of kind
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.280]  of quaint so I like it and you know it shows the reality of you out there on
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.680]  the road fighting the New World Order again our guest right now is Michael
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:43.360]  Bagnarek Michael expanding on all of this I agree with you I think that
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:49.240]  analogy or that parallel with Gaddafi he really thought and he stood up for
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:53.720]  six months that he would end up winning and you know he fought to the bitter
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:39:00.800]  end because these guys do tend to get delusional and this system thinks with
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.600]  all this high-tech surveillance and all this intimidation they're going to win
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:10.520]  but I've got news for them at a certain point people stop caring and that's
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.280]  what's happened in Mexico the government and the other drug cartels
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:17.960]  allied with it are fighting against other people that just don't care and it
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:23.200]  basically embraced a culture of macho death worship and the whole country is
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.480]  going to hell in a handbasket and that's what's going to happen across the West
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.320]  as people just can't take it anymore I mean government from what I've read and
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:34.920]  seen I saw a police chief admit a few years ago that that was Baltimore that
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.840]  they wear black uniforms to intimidate people in mask well it that's
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.200]  understanding it's not intimidating most people sure some sheeple it does it's
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.200]  making people hate you it's making people see you as a threat and then you
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:51.240]  act like one and then you act like somebody in Nazi Germany and so the
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.000]  opposite is happening people it's actually getting people out of their
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.160]  catatonic stupor means long as the globalists were just siphoning off money
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.120]  and doing all these corrupt things and launching foreign wars and hiding the
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.120]  coffins this could have gone on for a long time but the fact that they want
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.920]  to squat on us and spit in our faces and and bosses around all day it's having
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.800]  the opposite effect so I guess you're saying they're basically delusional yes
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.800]  very much so some of them it's really hard to put a label on is who is
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.320]  government I mean government is a compilation of lots and lots of people
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.040]  I'm sure that there are some people in government who still believe that they
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.120]  are doing the right thing and they are I mean if you and I could sit down with
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.240]  them they would be on our side and they would realize what's going on but they
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.840]  have been trained that they just need to keep on doing the thing be the cog in
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:52.240]  the wheel make sure that that happens one of the things that people are
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.520]  afraid of is to take stand up for themselves there is a county sheriff
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:04.480]  project that is underway sheriff Richard Mack I'm sure you know is trying to
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:11.200]  organize 200 shares to come to Las Vegas in January to teach them about the
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.440]  Constitution to teach them about the responsibility and their oath of office
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.560]  Richard has invited me to come and and assist by giving a presentation on the
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:26.640]  Bill of Rights what we need we need your listeners to go to CSP away that's
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:32.440]  county sheriffs and police officers association.org to contribute money so
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:39.360]  that we can pay to have these sheriffs flown to Vegas the goal is to have 200
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:44.520]  sheriffs trained and ultimately to sign a letter that we will mail to Washington
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.680]  DC letting them know that these county sheriffs are not going to tolerate
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:56.360]  federal intrusion into the counties well I have a clip we're gonna play here in
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:01.200]  just a few minutes where the police to occupy protesters that are just at a
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:06.200]  park they're told you're not allowed to be here it's the penal code and they
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:11.080]  say what about the Constitution right to assemble and they say that's trumped by
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:15.520]  the penal code and they just make up these penal codes they just make up
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.080]  these regulations and now I see police all over the country and I see cases where
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.880]  judges say don't bring the Constitution in my courtroom and and and I see police
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.040]  and their training manuals being taught it's bad but the Constitution is what
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.080]  they swear an oath to I mean it's like those that police training manuals we
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.120]  put out years ago that we were sent where it says don't trust someone and
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:44.120]  prepare to arrest someone who makes frequent references to the US
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.240]  Constitution and then we have footage of state police pulling Abby Newman over
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.240]  no criminal record naval veteran in town Invert rural Virginia going to buy
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:58.400]  canning equipment and they first see a Patriot Games video with Harrison Ford
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:02.720]  on it and they're so afraid of the phantom menace of patriots that they
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:07.040]  get scared oh we got to search you oh my god she's got a Patriot Games VHS tape
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:11.240]  oh my Harrison Ford frightening the word Patriot then they find a pocket
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.480]  Constitution and they start actually hyperventilating it's in road to
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.000]  tyranny folks we think I'm joking it's free all over the web or you can buy the
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  DVD from us and they start hyperventilating and go I can't believe
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.040]  we got one and one kind of leans on the car and goes and it's it's it's like a
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.000]  Saturday night live skit like where they find a baby kitten and they're
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.320]  they're crawling up the wall in fear and urinating on themselves from the baby
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:42.000]  kitten and she's and they put her in handcuffs to take her to jail and and
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.760]  she went to court and got off her resisting she didn't resist they grab
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.240]  her and she goes ah don't take me to jail you know it kind of that involuntary
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.600]  pull back they go we'll get you for that but and there and they're sitting there
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.120]  going to she allowed to have this and the cops actually going I can't believe
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:04.080]  she's got this I mean it's like they took these cops in and put them under a
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.720]  mind control machine or something where you go look
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:12.360]  constitution they're like and and you're like how did they get grown men like
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.080]  this Michael and by the way if you're a new listener I'm not joking about this
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:24.000]  I'm not joking in the same film we cut to this to FEMA in Kansas City in 2000 a
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.400]  firefighter sent us a huge room a cops firefighters and they're like the
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.120]  number one terrorist is George Washington and the men are like that's
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:36.360]  right that's him he's the one who else is a terrorist Thomas Jefferson good good
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.280]  job and it's this military top guy they're going and these people are the
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.080]  enemy and they're here today they believe in what they're doing it's all
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.720]  these rednecks going right we're gonna get them I mean and I was sent 17 hours
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.080]  of this I was sent three days of it and so these cops are and then they pull
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:57.320]  over a woman she's gotta she's got one of them
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:03.040]  coasties meanwhile they've sworn an oath to that Michael how did they get the
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.880]  police to literally be scared of George Washington I don't know what kind of
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:12.960]  mind control that is a friend of mine was running for office and wanted to
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.440]  pass out copies of the Constitution on the University campus the University
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:22.840]  would not allow it unless he put labels on each of the copies of the
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.040]  Constitution that said the University does not necessarily can endorse the
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:32.960]  content of this material I wouldn't have believed it Alex if I hadn't seen it
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:39.400]  myself well said my friend I well you you know what maybe maybe they're right
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.600]  maybe George Washington did you see just two weeks ago they had news articles
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:48.520]  saying is the Declaration of Independence illegal and they had debates with law
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:54.120]  professors in the US saying it may be it may be illegal
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:59.840]  see that I'm shocked to hear about it that doesn't surprise me but we are in
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:05.800]  an ideological war we were in a war of words and a war of ideas and we have been
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:10.760]  losing that war because the bad guys change the definitions they use these
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:16.440]  terminologies like assault rifle and they give it this bad connotation and the
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.080]  rest of us just kind of accept these terms and we've been defeated before we
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.400]  even start you and I have been pushing the ideas of liberty individual rights
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:33.000]  private property personal responsibility those are the ideas embodied in the
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.120]  Constitution and I think those ideas are starting to take hold again in the
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:45.760]  movie V for vendetta the hero says you cannot kill an idea but you can let it
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.800]  die if most of us stop thinking about liberty and freedom and private
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:56.680]  property then the socialist communists they win and so I think we are seeing a
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:02.440]  huge resurgence of this idea that private property is sacred and that the
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:07.000]  government works for us not the other way around well you're right the founders
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.400]  didn't like imminent domain because they knew it would turn into taking land and
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:13.840]  not fully paying for it or taking land if it wasn't a hundred percent
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.520]  absolutely needed and now all over the country they take land and don't even
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.120]  pay a 10 cents on the dollar I saw that in the Connecticut cases a few years
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:27.960]  ago where they would if you challenge them in court and didn't take 25 cents on
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.280]  the dollar they would actually charge you for the legal fees when you lost and
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:36.840]  take your house bulldoze it nice houses some of the houses were four
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.640]  generations old family and I'm those big triple-deckers and they just took it I
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:46.080]  mean I mean it's getting crazy my dad a few years ago was sent the Texas and
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:51.320]  landowners Bill of Rights you know they called it rights and it said we want to
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.880]  let you know Texas has changed the regulations that if anybody wants to
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.080]  put a pipeline across your property or one or the government wants to put
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:04.960]  power lines up or they want to take it you're given six weeks to accept the
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:11.280]  terms and if you don't accept that term we just take it and well I got those
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:17.440]  rights well thank you for informing me of that I take what you offer or bye bye
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.160]  and then now all over the country they're saying well you you lived on this
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.960]  lake for 80 years in one case and your parents grew up here we're saying it's
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:32.720]  too close to the water you got to tear it down now I mean it's movie one time I
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.240]  think was the godfather we're gonna make you an offer you can't refuse that's
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.840]  exactly the type of strategy that the government is currently using yeah we're
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:47.120]  gonna we're gonna oh you don't want to fly we're gonna set up checkpoints and
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.920]  grope your wife over there and then these cops get together and they like just
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.640]  arrogantly walk over and do it and I'm like why are you staring at me like I'm
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.360]  a criminal you just randomly walked off the highway I got some place to go and
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:05.480]  you're waddling over here with your eyes trying to intimidate me and instead I
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:10.080]  want to throw up on you you do you you sorry excuse for for an American you
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.360]  disgrace by the way we're gonna come back and go to calls but for all of our

[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:30.040]  you won't hear the ad because and then the station's left to refund the money
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.320]  to the sponsors because somebody's gonna take some of the time now for 50
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.080]  years they've just made you put in a box that you dialed to during an emergency
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.760]  to get the nuclear attack alert sounded reasonable now they've announced the
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:45.880]  government's going to be breaking in with announcements and they said six
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:50.520]  months ago federal news radio said Obama would have a 30-minute speech for you
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:54.280]  about how he's going to start breaking in on your cell phones with text
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:00.160]  messages video messages and on jumbo screens on street corners commons

[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:09.200]  shown you the video it's on the news you you are in a science fiction horror
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.920]  movie it's 2011 it is happening but because of outrage big scissors in the
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.000]  news she actually says don't worry that's the headline don't worry it's only a
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.280]  test but the stations don't even have a choice under their their civil
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:28.720]  regulations to dial over to the system and report that the system's taking over
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.840]  the government is wired in at the towers now and it's gonna be breaking in
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.400]  Michael Bagnaric in T-minus nine minutes and 30 seconds here but because

[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.600]  gonna be a nightly news you're not gonna want to miss until the end of the month
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:26.960]  we're doing a 15-day free trial at prisonplanet.tv and I keep meaning to
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.600]  plug this chair when you go to the shopping cart and infoworks.com I kept
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:37.680]  seeing 14 films on DVD but I knew I had more than that it's 18 films 18 of my
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:47.680]  20 plus films basically everything that's on DVD for $99.95 and so I mean
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.760]  normally that'd be 360 bucks you're getting 18 films so that's pretty much
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:58.400]  your Christmas shopping right there you're getting 18 of my films that by
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.160]  the way are incredible you watch these from some of these from Tim 12 13 14
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:06.960]  years ago and you're like whoa all of this he talked about it as exactly as
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.600]  he said it would be because we know what we're doing we've studied history we've
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.800]  got the Alex everything special available at infoworks.com on the
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.320]  shopping cart you can go up there you can also call toll free and talk to our
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:28.800]  crew it is 888-253-3139-888-253-3139 the Alex shows everything special and
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:34.240]  that will end whenever shipping ends for guaranteed Christmas delivery which I
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:39.680]  think is about like the 18th or something of December so that's a deal we do
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:45.360]  once a year we've never done a deal like that $99.95 you save 260 plus bucks on
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:51.520]  that bad boy and of course prison planet TV memberships I want to go to calls so
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:55.360]  perhaps we'll we'll hold back Eric I know he's out there in a hotel lobby it's
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:59.080]  noisy but I don't care I want to talk to him a little bit in the next hour so we
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:02.480]  can take some of these calls ahead of Paul Craig Roberts joining us but but
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.840]  you heard me getting into the issue of EAS I was told by engineers and by a
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:11.320]  high-level Texas Association of Broadcaster people that they've been in
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.680]  meetings this is years ago and we're told the feds are gonna start taking over
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:20.360]  programming then Obama announces six months ago he's gonna have a talk he's
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:24.600]  gonna personally give a speech in the test now they've pulled back from that
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:30.680]  but the point is they're really trying to get us ready for this Michael what
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:37.240]  does that mean it means that Americans are gonna have to stand up if we sit back
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:43.080]  and just allow it to happen we're gonna be a second Holocaust you know we're
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:47.000]  gonna we're gonna end up having people say well this should never happen a
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.080]  third time well it shouldn't have happened the first time it should never
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.480]  happen again and it's gonna take people to stand up and be brave and do the
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:59.600]  right thing so continuing to listen to you but getting out there and being
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:03.800]  active in all of these different Liberty organizations would certainly help
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:07.400]  well here's an example I know every day we have about three million viewers and
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.600]  listeners one way or another that listen okay I'm selling our bumper stickers at
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.000]  cost right now and I almost don't even want to plug that because it's brought
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.840]  the whole shipping department to a standstill I had to hire two more people
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:23.000]  just to get the bumper stickers out at cost so now I'm losing money because I
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.440]  had to hire more people to even be able to ship it some I have to go up a little
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.640]  bit because the two new shippers it's insane back there plastering them all
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:34.000]  over the place you but but what about folks making their own bumper stickers
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.320]  or their own signs or their own banner hangs or their own local newsletter or
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:42.840]  there are calling to talk radio or go to city council I mean everybody has this
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:47.240]  image that they've got to overturn the system themselves overnight do an access
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:53.000]  TV show study the Constitution start speaking to police officers when you see
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.480]  cops doing something wrong videotape them put it on YouTube it's about all of us
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:04.800]  doing a little bit every day Michael I agree I agree completely and again these
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.400]  people need to come up with their own ideas join the organizations they're
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:13.560]  already there contribute to run all find Liberty candidates in your area and
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.640]  don't just send them a small check get out there and volunteer walk the
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.920]  neighborhoods talk to your friends your family your neighbors exactly stay there
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.440]  stay there we're going to break you'll only hear us when we come back on the
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.880]  internet for some stations because it was going to be Obama completely taking
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:34.280]  over but now they're just going to take over without the station's control here
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:40.560]  in just a moment folks this isn't a game you got to get involved now
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:52.760]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today a very wealthy US citizen is

[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:58.720]  it's everywhere the system was set up by President Harry Truman back in 1951 as a
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.440]  top-down chain of communication for civil defense but he never used it in
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.760]  fact the system was only activated nationwide once by accident back in
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:13.720]  1971 warning television stations to prepare for an announcement from the
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:18.040]  White House the emergency alert system is primarily used for severe weather
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:27.440]  warnings again this is only a test that was only a test and this is America live

[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:40.680]  do it suggests it they didn't even do it on Fox but she said it was coming it was
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:44.680]  all edited and ready these people are insane and notice oh Harry Truman did
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.840]  it no that would be one local station that during an emergency the signal went
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:53.520]  out and other stations would tune to it now because of communication this only
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:56.880]  allows dictatorship and control it's going to be citizens on the ground
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:59.880]  they're gonna be able to report what's really happening but that way if
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:02.680]  something started coming out the government doesn't want they hit one
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:08.480]  button and they admit it's internet it's cell phones it's everything this test
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:16.000]  is of cable UHF VHF what'd you say turn okay back near its back so she just said
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.480]  the test was there but it wasn't and I've got my crew and they're recording it
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:23.400]  on radio in places where it's happening and again you've always heard this
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:27.560]  before but just since 96 did they have it where the government could do it
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.720]  themselves but they always send out pre-signals to make sure you had it
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:36.320]  hooked up then the board operator would flip over to that channel when it went
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:42.640]  live that's that only a test thing and in the future it's gonna be guns or evil
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:47.080]  we're looking for this homeless person this person's a terrorist they admit
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:49.960]  that license plates are gonna have it they're gonna be digital computer
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:54.400]  screens and show you wanted people like something out of minority report but
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.400]  there she was saying it's no big deal it's you know never been used except by
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.360]  accident not even on 9-11 but now our gracious leader wants to come and talk
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:07.680]  to you but now they backed off and and said Obama won't make the announcement
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.400]  they're just gonna break in and test it and no one government they're so
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.240]  idiotic maybe it failed because I didn't see it on Fox I'll go out and find
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:21.480]  out from our guys recording local radio and TV what happened during the next
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:28.560]  break we got Michael Bagnaric back Michael please continue it is just like in
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:32.280]  v for vendetta the guy in the big screen telling the people what they should
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:37.760]  think and being but it's not gonna happen forever Alex you and I both know
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.280]  that Americans will stand up whether they are brave enough to do it right now
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:48.560]  they have been embodied with this idea that they have a right to life liberty
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:54.320]  and property and it's just a matter of time before they stand up and and put
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.800]  the the genie back in the bottle so I am very hopeful it's gonna be a very
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:06.880]  interesting time to be alive and I hope that we can can restore liberty very
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:13.480]  quickly because I know you have a child now right don't you in June your wife
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:19.360]  have a baby not too long ago absolutely yes well I mean that gives us more
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:25.800]  reason to restore liberty so that future generations don't have to put up with
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.960]  this type of tyranny I agree with you stay there we're gonna come back with one

[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:29.760]  over the country station 98.1 KVET and it aired once and then fed back on
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.560]  itself so it worked the NPR station it was garbled hammered garbage sounded
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:41.040]  like Cylon Raiders were invading the earth and on broadcast TV they took over
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:47.360]  on Fox on cable it must have malfunctioned and again they've announced
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:52.120]  they're gonna start taking over internet with just constant announcements and
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:57.360]  videos that the feds have said will break in on your phone call or your
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.960]  web surfing you'll have to look at Obama look at Hillary look at Mitt Romney I

[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:09.600]  something like that and and and now telescreens at Walmart's and Mall of

[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:54.200]  going to your calls this isn't a game the tyranny we're already living under is
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.440]  only the setup for the real takeover that's why I've been so desperate that's
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:05.880]  why I can work 18 hours well I worked I worked 22 hours one day this week there
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:10.920]  were a lot of days in the last week but one day I worked 24 hours another day I
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:15.440]  worked 22 hours a lot of days it's been 18 hours and people ask how do you have
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:20.800]  this energy folks it'd be like if I was in Nazi Germany in 39 and they said why
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:26.000]  do you have all this energy because if I don't abandon ship I got a fight I mean
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.040]  I'm dead if we don't beat these people and see I don't think you're a coward
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:33.880]  people say why are you scaremongering I'm not if I tell you hey don't go out on
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:39.160]  that balcony it's about to collapse and I've got a 50-story you know balcony and
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.080]  you go out on the balcony and it's it's all rotten and you fall through it by
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:47.280]  the way that's happened in real life before I'm not being a fair monger I'm
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.960]  like don't go on the balcony it's rotten it's it's it's it's it's about to be
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.160]  replaced it's about to collapse it was condemned you know I'm gonna have it fixed
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:00.240]  and you run out there go no that's nothing wrong I'm not being a fair monger
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:05.480]  or I was at the beach a few weeks ago three weeks ago Texas Beach and it was
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.600]  about 7 a.m. I went out there to swim by myself the kids were still asleep with
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.520]  my wife and there was a person jogging on the beach they said you better watch
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:17.000]  it there's a bunch of jellyfish out there right now and I saw a few Portuguese
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.160]  man award I'm like a whatever that guy's a wimp they didn't have a flag up a purple
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.840]  flag showing that that a yellow flag I thought I'll just go wake up a little
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:31.680]  bit I went ten feet out there because I was by the little scuba dive with with
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:36.120]  you hear back in the background you know with jellyfish I've been stung many
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:39.640]  times I went out there got stung all over you know the point is the guy wouldn't
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:42.400]  be in a fair monger he was like hey there's a bunch of jellyfish right now
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.040]  watch out and and and here we are saying look out this stuff's coming down this
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.800]  stuff's happening this stuff's going on we know what this is and then everything
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:54.520]  we've talked about so far is happening now I'm telling you what's coming next
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:58.400]  stuff that makes this look like a joke Michael Bagnaric what's your view on the
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:05.320]  wake-up call for America in the world I agree it's gonna be much worse and very
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.560]  very soon I think that next year at this time we'll be looking at today and
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:16.160]  wondering you know we'd be calling this the good old days people just will not
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:20.520]  believe how bad it's gonna get some of us are gonna be prepared some people are
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:24.440]  gonna get into the lifeboat they are gonna survive and get through to the
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.640]  other side but the people who were completely unprepared are gonna be
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:34.520]  suffering and look at the foreclosures how many people are being thrown out of
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:39.880]  their homes at this point in time it and I know people personally who are getting
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:45.520]  ready to walk away from the home I mean they've invested in it for 20 years now
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:50.800]  because they they own more than the house is worth they're getting ready to walk
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.560]  away and walk away from 20 years worth of payments with no equity my grandmother
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:01.200]  has a paid for home for something like a decade or whatever and she can't pay
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.000]  the property taxes it's a little bitty nice blue-collar house with a big
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  backyard and they're saying well we're gonna make you pay $15,000 a year in
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.240]  property taxes because you've got a big backyard and they built condos two miles
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:18.960]  from here and potentially you know you could sell this and do it's not even
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.280]  zoned for that but it's just and I know a bunch of people who may have to sell
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:28.840]  their house because of the property taxes Michael absolutely they've had the
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:33.600]  same thing here in Northwest Indiana they've built the number of casinos
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.120]  nearby and I think the casinos are trying to force people out of their
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:43.680]  property by raising the taxes to the point where they can't afford them that
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:50.160]  way the casinos can move in and purchase the property at ultra low prices yeah
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:53.400]  that's what you get with a mafia economy and if folks want to gamble that's your
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.320]  business but don't always make us pay for the attractions around it you know the
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.600]  the venues and things with our tax money the mafia can pay for it with all the
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:06.840]  families they destroy with all their gambling and all the poor people where
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:09.840]  the kids don't get food because they cashed their check and go buy lotto
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:14.760]  tickets from the filthy state of the drug-pushing murdering government I want
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.720]  to go to phone calls here in this segment the next with our guest and I
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:24.040]  promise we're gonna get to all of you here Julio Joe Clayton everybody with
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:31.640]  Michael Bagnaric but we've got the video of of the radio in in the studio with
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:37.640]  the emergency EAS alert system this was on the local country station and we've
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:41.640]  also later tonight have other videos of them screwing up on other stations this
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:46.800]  is the feds without the station getting the alert on the system and then
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.480]  flipping to it voluntarily this is the government taking over and they're
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:54.160]  announcing in the future this is just the beginning they're gonna have whole
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.600]  programs they were gonna do this this was gonna be Obama commandeering this
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.880]  show you wouldn't have been hearing it but the stations and people got upset so
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:06.960]  it was only a 30-second message and again you hear these all the time but the
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:11.120]  station flips to it themselves we always said that was dangerous because it
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  would lead to this here it is
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:16:05.600]  okay that was recorded off FM radio it goes on and on so longer than 30 seconds
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:10.960]  they said that's it looping back on itself and they make the radio station
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:15.080]  some small ones I've talked to spend tens of thousands a year with engineers
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:20.000]  just trying to comply with the reports and getting it hooked up right now the
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.240]  feds are just gonna break him whenever they want incredible Bagnaric it is
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:29.840]  incredible I never if you and I had talked 15 years ago and you told me that
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:33.640]  this is what was gonna happen I never would have believed it Alex well I did
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.080]  tell people I did tell people 15 years ago they thought I was crazy well I I
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:41.920]  wouldn't have believed they could get this bad I never thought the American
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.680]  people would tolerate the Patriot Act the Military Commissions Act the homegrown
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:52.720]  terrorist act but we have and and so I'm hoping that Americans finally get that
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.400]  courage that that we're supposed to have what about Department of Defense now
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:05.120]  it will run rural affairs and literally have spies in the rural areas it just
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.440]  keeps getting scarier but at some point in time they're gonna push too far the
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:14.160]  people are gonna push back Thomas Jefferson said that you know the Tree of
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.840]  Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of Patriots and
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:22.320]  tyrants and I'm afraid that that's about the only option we have left oh
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:28.960]  boy let's go to Julio in Illinois we're gonna move quick now Julio thanks for
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:34.240]  holding her on the air yeah no problem I was watching fixed news and trying to
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.000]  put her on the TV and I didn't see anything big brother taking over my TV
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:46.360]  screen I saw one on on my local WGN and it just had just a picture saying EAS is
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:51.560]  only a test with the background of some talk show so it's a big fail by big
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:59.080]  brother in my eyes well you know why every engineer I know giggles and says if
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:05.960]  they ever try it I've got it hooked up wrong and so quite frankly that's why
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:10.920]  all these things are screwing up a the feds designed it it's it's antiquated
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:17.680]  be the engineers are all sabotaging it that I know well I agree with that too
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:21.480]  there's a lot of smart engineers out there oh but you guys keep talking about
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:26.040]  Jesse Ventura and I heard him on Coast to Coast last night and on your show the
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:30.840]  other day as well and I just think the system is gonna have to you we would we
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:36.600]  have to be on false flag alert now just because if you get Jesse Ventura in a
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:42.440]  debate with these neocons and with Barry Satoro he's just gonna bring out real
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:46.760]  issues he's gonna talk more about the TSA and the system is gonna be shaking oh
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.940]  yeah we gotta get him to run we got it I'm gonna put him in contact with
[02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:54.160]  libertarian head I've got the number here as soon as the show ends and it is
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:57.000]  very very exciting in fact I got him I had the idea so why don't you go on
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.680]  Coast to Coast A.M. and I called George Norrie up said are you interested I
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:03.040]  know they do it that night I didn't listen last night I had to get some
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:07.880]  sleep for the first time in days but he was on there with him yeah he was on
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.880]  there he was on there for the first hour just talking about the whole case and I
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:15.720]  have a question Alex a suggestion for something guys can do for Info Wars
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:18.480]  Nightly News we hear about this whole Penn State
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:24.320]  pedophilia scandal you know yes it's shocking and I feel outraged for those kids no you
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.360]  don't get into the elite unless you unless you're a pedophile that's the
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:33.120]  problem yeah well how about how about we talk about how you know child services
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:37.680]  just the kids all the time no no no that's who gets them they have five
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.960]  times more likely than any other group in criminology they are I mean the image
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:46.560]  a large portion of them are active pedophiles they're the only group that
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:50.800]  can get away with it I mean it came out in the Texas Youth Commission that the
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:55.160]  kids they grab are run at brothels and cops and judges line up and just come
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:59.200]  into the jails and have sex all day with the kids I mean I mean it's it's
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:05.400]  real I have bought a few bottles of heart and body extract and have to say
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:09.200]  that it it certainly does work that's what Jack from Michigan had to say after

[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:16.920]  extract I actually had a huge heart flutter is also having some edema around

[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:15.880]  Roberts joins us on the economy of Rob do in his car he videotaped this the the
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:20.200]  digital screen and went through the channels and showed every radio station
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:27.320]  taken over by the feds it shows the radio you know show going and then boom
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:34.280]  it's cut out and the government takes it over just just amazing let's go to Jay
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:39.960]  and Utah you're on the air with Michael Bagnaric go ahead yes how you doing good
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:48.560]  brother you know Michael was talking about people getting involved and you
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:53.440]  know finding different ways of getting involved your show gets about three
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:59.200]  million views of for your videos and your show I mean if only 1% of those
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.440]  people contacted the role Ron Paul campaign and asked to get involved they
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.080]  have a program where you can make calls on behalf of Ron Paul from your house
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:16.000]  and that would be 30,000 people actively making calls for Ron Paul here in here
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.640]  in Salt Lake we have a occupy the Fed movement that's been occupied in the
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:27.160]  fed since October 19th continuously you know they get confused with the occupy
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:31.960]  Salt Lake and some of the people are part of both movements but that's why it's a
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:36.000]  process of informing people and Michael you started getting into occupy Wall
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.640]  Street earlier what's your overall view of that well I'm glad that people are in
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:48.040]  the streets and protesting the tyranny I agree that we should end the Fed I
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.520]  agree that we should put an end to corporate bailouts unfortunately some
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:26:01.120]  of the people in Operation Wall Street think that government should bail out
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:07.040]  the student loans and and I disagree with that the you know you got to take
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:10.800]  that money from somebody else I've had people call me and say I'm a student
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.760]  it's too expensive pay me more money it's government giving all this money to
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:19.000]  people that created the bubble to begin with don't they get it people that
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.520]  produce can't pay any more taxes and the globalist that want more taxes are
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:30.840]  exempt from it offshore yeah we I mean it's stealing is is bad and doesn't
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:35.520]  matter who you give the stolen merchandise to it's still stealing from
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:42.000]  someone and and I've been contacted by somebody in the occupy Wall Street
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.120]  organization asking if I would come out and offer training classes to these
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:51.720]  people and so that's in kind of negotiations or just one phone call I
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:56.280]  don't know if anything's actually going to happen with that but I said yes I'm
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:00.920]  always happy to educate people on individual rights and private property
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.280]  well that's where you really shine is in your four-hour classes and people can

[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:11.280]  air welcome yeah hi Alex hi Michael are you I'm sorry can you hear me yeah yeah
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.800]  he heard you go ahead job okay yeah I had a this one's for Jesse Ventura in
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:22.440]  his case his case versus humanity yeah I had a similar situation that equals
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:26.640]  exactly almost similar situation that happened to me where the judge failed to
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:33.480]  rule on purpose and I had another judge who was sympathetic towards my case and
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:39.760]  basically what he told me to do was file a writ of mandamus and that that
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:44.160]  forces it into the pellet level actually filed with the pellet level I
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.960]  didn't think of a writ of mandamus that's a good idea so yeah I just wanted
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:54.080]  to share that and see if Michael had any as a constitutional yeah that forces the
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:57.640]  appellate to at least look at it that's like you got the death penalty you're
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:00.840]  gonna be executed in two days and you don't think you got a fair trial it's a
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.440]  desperate appeal and they'll at least have to look at it and rule one way or
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.200]  the other on whether they're gonna hear the case so yeah you know what tonight
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:12.800]  we're gonna have a real calm he's one of the top experts out there I've talked
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:18.320]  to Michael tonight I'll pose the question to you on constitutional remedies if the
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:22.040]  courts were operating properly on what you would do about TSA and roadside
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:26.000]  checkpoints how's that sound that sounds good we'll talk to you tonight

[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:55.540]  more and more we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:03.400]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:07.840]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:11.840]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:15.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.960]  skipped through the channels showing every AM and FM station taken over
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:08.840]  simultaneously by the feds through takeover boxes in the last 15 years that
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:15.400]  have been put under federal regulations in all UHF VHF cable satellite AM FM
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:20.760]  and it was gonna be Obama when a 30-minute transmission then it was

[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:28.880]  introducing myself letting you know that's because FEMA came out six months
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:33.800]  ago and said this getting us ready for government text government videos on our
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:38.320]  phones government break-ins over our telephones I forgot that point government
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:47.280]  break-ins over jumbo screens in public where it places like Las Vegas in areas
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:53.200]  or places in New York where they've got all the different jumbo trons and TVs
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:59.120]  up there I'm having one of those moments it's not Central Park what's the name of
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.000]  the place in New York that's just total saturation of billboards and videos and
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.920]  flashing lights yeah Times Square thank you they admit that's what the world's
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:14.280]  gonna be like your license plate because its government is gonna have a TV

[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:45.320]  Craig Roberts he is the former head of Policy Department of Treasury he is the
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:50.360]  father of Reaganomics he has been listed by many publications one of the top 10
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:54.040]  living economists out there he's the former dimension wall street journal
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:59.960]  editor also he's a syndicated columnist and his stuff appears at info wars.com
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:03.800]  and prismplanet.com and he predicted pretty much what's happening now that
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:08.880]  to be a slow long slide with currency wars going on and that nothing could
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:11.840]  ever be fixed because we've been deindustrialized and that's the real
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:15.600]  issue why you get college degrees and it's not worth it because there's not
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:22.320]  the jobs so I wanted to get him on to talk about the the the debt crisis they
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:28.080]  they want trillions for a hundred billion grisos now Italy's going down what
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:31.640]  golden silver are doing where all of this is going I mean you said three four
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:35.000]  years ago on the show it'd take three four years to really really start getting
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.920]  really bad if they didn't turn it around well here we are three four years
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:42.880]  later what's your prognosis now sir well they haven't learned anything have the
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:52.520]  Alex no and so it's continuing to spiral out of control you know the main
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:41:01.160]  problem I think for the U.S. is that the European Union centralizes trying to use
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:08.320]  the crisis in order to curtail the sovereignty of individual countries so
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:15.080]  they were using the Greek crisis to take away the ability of the Greek
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:21.760]  government to decide its taxes its spending its budget and this is part of
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:28.320]  the creation of the European super state and they were saying that the fact
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:35.080]  that the individual countries were not financially responsible with the proof
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:43.200]  that they had to centralize the decisions of spending and taxing in
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:48.800]  Greece Italy and elsewhere in Brussels with the European Union bureaucracy so
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:55.400]  that's one of the problems it was being used to create the super state another
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:01.160]  reason another way of being used Alex is to establish the principle that the
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:08.800]  taxpayers have to bail out the big banks and so this produced a policy that
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:15.520]  made no sense from the standpoint of the ability of the embedded countries to
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:21.720]  provide will pay the debt so we throw all the rods you know in Greece it was
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:26.240]  becoming quite violent with people throwing little tough cocktails the
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:32.480]  please and the Greek employment collapsed they have a official number like us
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:37.280]  and our official number nine percent which is as far as their official
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:43.120]  number sixteen percent about double about the real rate of unemployment in
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:52.080]  Greece is about 25% the youth that are educated are leaving the country there
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:59.360]  seems to be some migration from cities back to towns with countries on retail
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:04.960]  trade seems to be collapsing and so they've created the situation in which
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:17.680]  the Greeks have 465 billion dollars of debt and there's no economy to pay it so
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:27.240]  and now it seems to be spreading to Italy so I think that that they'll
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:34.200]  continue with their falling and it's all falling back on the Germans how much
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:41.760]  are they willing to pay to bail out or the European Central Bank will have to
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:46.760]  do with photoresert there just print the money to bail it all out and that of
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:54.240]  course has the inflation risk and so there doesn't seem to be a solution
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:44:01.240]  given the agendas that are in place now dr. Roberts you've hit the nail on the
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:04.840]  head as usual here but I know you must watch financial news me your economists
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:10.360]  are always up on it but I've heard Bloomberg I've I've seen MSNBC CNBC in
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:18.560]  the last month go it's bad that Germany is might be able to vote out of this we
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:21.960]  need to take over these countries and have EU enforcers in them and they
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:26.840]  never mentioned that most of this is derivatives and garbage and that it's
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:31.200]  the very central planners that set all this up that are now saying give us more
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  power to fix it and every time they get more power we learn it's 10 times worse
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:41.480]  or 20 times worse so it's just crazy it's a huge power grab with the Vatican
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:45.040]  calling for world government and you know that'll punish the bankers give them
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:52.640]  even more power where do you see this going well I I think that when their
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:45:01.880]  agendas don't make any sense and they can't reach a solution here the Germans are
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:06.960]  because of the rise of people and all of that they went through and so they
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:11.920]  won't be very receptive to the European Central Bank putting the money to bail
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:16.120]  out Greece sure sure but doctor speak up for us a little bit because your phones
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:21.280]  a little bit hazy how can our media now openly say they want to put microphones
[02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:25.560]  in all the street lamps listening to us and and and now TSA's announces I'm
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:29.040]  sure you know checkpoints all over the country jerking families out of their
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:33.400]  cars it's now happening including to us how can this be and then and then
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:37.880]  they're on the news saying the problem is Europeans might vote their way out of
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:42.040]  this we've got to get rid of freedom I mean they're really bringing this out
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:47.400]  in the open right now yes that's true that's exactly true as I said they're
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:53.080]  using they're using the Greek crisis to destroy the sovereignty of the
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:57.720]  individual members of the European Union and of course we have a we have a
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:05.160]  police state here you know what may well you know what may happen if there's any
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:12.000]  intelligence in Germany is they simply exit the EU and form an alliance with
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:17.320]  Russia because the Germans don't want inflation they don't want the
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:24.040]  debt they're financially responsible Russia has massive resources that fit
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:29.080]  very well with German industry and you would you would have a real powerhouse
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:37.880]  there and the German-Russian economic alliance would of course bust up NATO and
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:42.480]  make it harder for the United States to run around causing new wars of aggression
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:45.600]  everywhere by the way that was something the British were always scared to death
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:51.240]  of that would be a new power axis how would NATO try to block that because of
[02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:55.600]  if if the Germans could kick the NATO agents out not that I even like the
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:59.160]  Russians you know these systems are all corrupt it's just this hegemonic power
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:04.360]  of the Rothschild banking system and the Rockefeller system has got to be
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:09.680]  defeated and and so that's a great idea for the German people with their
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:15.720]  military and everything why not make an economic deal with Russia yes that's
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:24.240]  the way out for Germany and I think probably some of them think about that
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:30.760]  in the back of their minds they probably are very reluctant to make such a
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:37.960]  fundamental break with the United States but I don't think the Germans are
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:43.040]  happy with the prospect of inflation and I don't think they're happy with the
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:49.640]  prospect of losing their own sovereignty to the European Union because what
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:55.760]  they've seen with the European Union is debts out of control banks are in
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:03.040]  control and the way out is to print money and that's not anything that
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:08.360]  Germany is happy with and by the way as you know sir they would leave sure sure Germany is already
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:13.960]  snuggled up to Russia and Russia vice versa in all sorts of manufacturing and
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:24.080]  energy deals yes right so but if they don't if the Germans stay in then they'll
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:30.520]  face the same kind of pressures to have interference in their budget policy
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:36.840]  their taxing and spending they'll be expected to somehow guarantee some of
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:44.040]  the bailout money and as they are part of the euro if the European Central Bank
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:49.880]  prints euros to buy up the debt to save the private banks then Germany will be
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:57.280]  subject to the same inflation so it's a lose-lose game to the Germans saving
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:03.480]  Europe means worth for Germany so I don't know whether they'll pay that price
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:07.200]  or not I really have no idea
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:15.320]  Dr. Roberts studying this police state it's it's if I was gonna write a Kurt
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:21.640]  Vonnegut absurdist book about a clownish police state so over the top that
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:28.200]  it had to be satire I would do what this ruling class is doing I mean usually
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:33.760]  tyrants try to hide it or have excuses in this case it's just naked I've studied
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:37.480]  psychological warfare manuals that have been declassified from the 60s and 70s
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:42.840]  they want to win the hearts and minds during a domestic takeover instead now
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:50.320]  it's like they want to make us angry they want to to act like bad guys and I
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:53.680]  guess for their morale it might be fun to dress up in black outfits with black
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:58.760]  helmets and strut around but in my experience it's not intimidating most
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  people it's actually waking up folks that were on the fence and it's driving
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:11.040]  others into maybe basically arms build-ups and and I don't I I think the
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:14.960]  hubris filled people running things do not have any idea what they've turned
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:19.120]  loose because it's actually scaring me I'm not some macho guy that wants to see
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:22.560]  some giant uprising and war on the streets or maybe that's what they want
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:25.680]  but I don't think it's gonna go the way they want because I've seen these
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:29.320]  government bureaucrats and their enforcers they're a bunch of wimps they're
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:32.680]  real tough when they've got some old man surrounded who hadn't paid his property
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:36.440]  tax and 20 SWAT team guy shoot even killing but they're not gonna be too
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:39.440]  tough when all hell breaks loose I think most of them are gonna run off and hide
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:43.240]  I want to get your take on that where you see America going because you've
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:49.000]  tried to get people good ideas of how to turn the course but is it too late to

[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:36.120]  problems in Mexico and you should blame the second amendment even after they got
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:40.480]  caught staging fast and furious here's a London Guardian Attorney General Eric
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:43.880]  Holder tells Senate hearing that Congress is partly to blame because of its
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:49.560]  hostility to gun control Mexico has a total gun ban and is absolute hell on
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:53.920]  earth and most guns are brought in to the military and sold their full auto and
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:57.780]  then meanwhile the rest are government shipping in dr. Paul Greg Roberts is our
[02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:02.040]  guest stocks of course plunged hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:08.680]  of points today just amazing on that front and it's just where is America
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:15.920]  going it's not going to change course at least for a while everything's going
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:23.760]  headlong where does this end dr. Roberts well that's we don't know the
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:28.760]  economy is not recovering it's worst thing I see a recent report there's
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:36.360]  another 10 million full closed use pending so you're going to have massive
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:41.560]  homelessness joblessness you know the real unemployment rate in the United
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:48.760]  States today is about 23% and I was surprised by this I could buy a Wall
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:53.960]  Street was the way it sprang up in so many places not just in this country but
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:56:01.000]  even in other parts of the world if that proves to have any staying power then
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:08.800]  probably the establishment will try to break it with force and it's not quite
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:14.600]  clear what the response to that will be so I agree with you that the
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:21.360]  establishment is saying and full of hubris relying on force and violence not
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:27.680]  just everywhere in the world place of the moment in the military speak up doc
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:34.320]  but also at home they're going to use force and violence and so whether the
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:40.240]  people take it or not remains to be seen other than sure I mean if we beat these
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:45.200]  people we're going to look back on George W. Bush, Janet Napolitano as the
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:50.560]  Nazi-like Mussolini-like pull-pot characters they are I mean they're
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:54.280]  running drone attacks worldwide killing innocent people breaking all our laws
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:58.720]  they say they can kill US citizens they're spying illegally and they're
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:02.320]  just and they're shipping drugs in and guns out I mean these are really just a
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:06.120]  bunch of criminals and doc they know their criminals I think it's more than
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:13.840]  hubris now these are wild dogs well there's certainly the greatest danger
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:20.040]  not just to Americans but to the world all the danger we face is in Washington
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:27.400]  there's no doubt about that I don't know whether they will succeed or not I
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:32.920]  don't think elections any longer mean anything but it just really the you know
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:37.400]  what when it's like Gerald Salenty says when people have nothing left to lose
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:42.480]  they lose it and more and more Americans are have nothing left to lose
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:47.200]  they're losing their homes their jobs and careers the savings the living
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:53.080]  standard the prospects for their children this is a massive loss it's now
[02:57:53.080 --> 02:57:57.840]  affecting tens of millions of people if you look at the poverty numbers the
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:01.840]  United States is the worst and the developed world in fact it's actually
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:06.080]  worse than some of the underdeveloped countries I know I don't want to be I
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:10.760]  wouldn't want to be some of these cops and people their black uniforms aren't
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:14.360]  gonna protect them from insanity and the veneer of civilization burning away
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:23.920]  doc it may not it may not and it the police themselves may lose part in
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:29.920]  terms of serving the 1% I mean why should they be serving the 1% why should
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:34.760]  the military be serving the 1% stay there doc back in one minute for five

[03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:14.920]  us you can follow his columns at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[03:00:14.920 --> 03:00:20.200]  you can also of course get his great books he's got some new ones out just
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:23.680]  type Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and you'll find them they break down the economy
[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:30.840]  you name it but looking at everything that's happening here doc I mean it's
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:35.520]  just it even when I'm awake you're awake it's still hard to believe it's this
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:39.040]  crazy and then to understand historically if it follows the regular
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:45.000]  pattern which it is it's going to get 20 times crazier and it all kind of
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:50.760]  compresses down to a short period I mean my god these people are just lunatics
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:56.080]  well you know they're about to start a war with Iran that appears yeah let's
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:01:02.480]  talk about that I mean it well it's the only sense you can make out of all the
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:08.880]  absurd claims that have come out of Washington you know the notion of the
[03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:13.480]  Iranians going to assassinate the Saudi ambassador with a Mexican drug gang in a
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:19.920]  used car salesman it's like we've talked before Alex that the people in
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:22.600]  Washington think they can tell the American people anything and they'll
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:28.840]  believe it so we have the absurd story of a used car salesman and a Mexican drug
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:35.560]  gang and now we have the International Atomic Energy Agency under new
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:42.360]  leadership who whose career track is to please the American so that they further
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:50.640]  his career and they've come up with some sort of really wishy-washy possibly
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.920]  Iran is studying how to make a bond we don't really know but they might be and
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:01.880]  we're asking them for more information blah blah and this can be spun by the
[03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:08.280]  people in Washington to get more hysteria try to build a case for
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:13.600]  attacking Iran which they've been trying to do now for at least ten years
[03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:18.960]  well I don't think they would be doing all of this if they didn't really intend
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:25.000]  to attack Iran they're just trying to set the stage so that it's acceptable and
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:30.600]  I don't know if they'll succeed you know I don't know why the Russians or the
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:35.880]  Chinese would go along with it because it's not their interest I don't even
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:41.280]  know why anyone in Europe would go along with it but they're now trying to
[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:47.120]  create more false intelligence like they did about Saddam Hussein's weapons of
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:51.720]  mass destruction the non-existent weapons that they knew didn't exist
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:59.080]  they're pulling the same stunts now with Iran well that kind of a war is much
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:09.600]  more dangerous and how Europe going down the tubes Greece Italy Spain how the
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:15.520]  United States economy going down the tubes have they been handle some real
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:21.520]  war a large scale war with an opponent that could possibly fight back in some
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:29.400]  ways maybe even cut off through the straighter hormones the oil supply flows
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:34.680]  who knows what would happen and who knows how provoked the Russians or
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:39.040]  Chinese would get it the whole thing is like you say it's reached the point of
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:44.080]  insanity it's even worse than Hitler marching off into Russia
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:49.120]  well remember Cheney certly we're sure I mean remember Cheney launching the
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:54.040]  888 attack it he brags about it and then trying to say Russia attacked Georgia I
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:58.600]  mean these people are going to destroy us and in closing they've now done it a
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:02.320]  federal FEMA takeover of all communications an hour ago and there's
[03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:05.880]  the Washington Post now announcing they're going to start taking over your
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:11.120]  phones everything tell us greens at Walmart telling you don't trust your
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:16.520]  neighbor doctor we've woken up and like a science fiction movie yeah we've
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:24.320]  woken up in all of 1984 that's where we are I agree it is a police state and
[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:29.080]  we'll just have to see if the people accept it I mean you could see it
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:34.640]  coming because of all the stage fake terrorists that the FBI would go out
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:39.920]  and organize so they could arrest produce more scares yeah no no the government
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:43.320]  stage in the terror and provocative during it aging at all in order to have
