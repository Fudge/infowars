[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  You want answers?
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.920 --> 00:23.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.840 --> 00:34.880]  It's Friday, ladies and gentlemen, and the information that I have discovered was so
[00:34.880 --> 00:46.080]  sickening and so shocking that it gave me flashbacks, flashbacks to all my research
[00:46.080 --> 00:55.640]  into 9-11 before it happened, and then after yesterday, I began to read an article when
[00:55.640 --> 01:04.760]  I got off air that had just come out from FoxNews.com on April 22, titled, Shame on
[01:04.760 --> 01:12.960]  Jesse Ventura, and I didn't finish reading the story.
[01:12.960 --> 01:20.240]  And then I got home yesterday evening, put the children to bed, went in, and saw somebody
[01:20.240 --> 01:25.000]  had posted a link to it on my Facebook account, or one of our Facebook accounts.
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.360]  So I said, oh, I'll go ahead and read that, see how they're coming after the governor.
[01:32.360 --> 01:48.580]  And when I got to the second page, I involuntarily started crying, and my wife has caught this
[01:48.580 --> 01:49.580]  a few times.
[01:49.580 --> 01:52.480]  I don't sob and wretch when I cry.
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.520]  In fact, I wouldn't even be aware of it if something is particularly upsetting to me,
[01:56.520 --> 01:57.520]  and I'm even focused.
[01:57.520 --> 02:00.720]  I'm not even in an emotional state, really.
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.880]  I'm calm and focused, but a certain air of my brain is so upset by it, tears start coming
[02:04.880 --> 02:17.360]  out from the corners of my eyes, doesn't happen often, but a lot of tears came out, a lot
[02:17.360 --> 02:18.360]  of tears.
[02:18.360 --> 02:24.500]  Then I tried to go to bed, and I woke up at 2.30 in the morning, and I couldn't go back
[02:24.500 --> 02:27.040]  to sleep, even though I was exhausted.
[02:27.040 --> 02:40.360]  I tried to lay on the couch, I tried to go get in the bed, couldn't go to sleep, and
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.040]  so many issues came up with this.
[02:45.040 --> 02:48.200]  What am I talking about?
[02:48.200 --> 02:55.960]  It's just another mainstream news reporter admitting that the police and firemen were
[02:55.960 --> 03:01.880]  told that the government was going to blow up Building 7 that day.
[03:01.880 --> 03:09.160]  Look, I was driving to get a pizza, listening to ABC News.
[03:09.160 --> 03:17.840]  Back then, 590 AM, our local affiliate had ABC, they have Fox now, and I heard them just
[03:17.840 --> 03:26.160]  calmly reporting at about 4.15 my time, 5.15 Eastern, that, oh, yes, Building 7 is so damaged,
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.640]  they're going to go ahead and have a controlled demolition of it, and I was distracted by
[03:29.640 --> 03:35.720]  Tower 1 and 2 that imploded hours before, but I thought that's strange, it takes weeks
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.520]  or months to wire a building.
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.240]  We did point out that day, because I did more than 12 hours of broadcast on Genesis that
[03:44.240 --> 03:57.280]  day, from about 9 in the morning until past midnight, off and on, on different shows,
[03:57.280 --> 04:05.920]  and we did talk about the strange collapse of 7, but then we got to CNN videos of police
[04:05.920 --> 04:08.680]  saying get back, they're going to blow it up, and you can hear the bombs going off, and
[04:08.680 --> 04:12.240]  it falls, and see the squabs.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.360]  And then, we'd always talked about how it was all over TV and radio, and folks dug
[04:16.360 --> 04:27.080]  up BBC and CNN saying it was going to fall before it fell.
[04:27.080 --> 04:35.200]  And then Silverstein, I guess trying to cover his tracks, two years after the attacks went
[04:35.200 --> 04:43.000]  on, PBS and said, yeah, we made the decision to pull it, gave the order, watch it come
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.760]  down, and then he changed his story, and then to just see Fox News having one of their
[04:48.760 --> 04:55.600]  pundits go, yeah, we were talking about blowing it up, man, they all love being part of this,
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.440]  it's so evil, so evil, you people.
[05:00.440 --> 05:01.440]  What's your home worth?
[05:01.440 --> 05:05.680]  How can you compare local real estate agents, and how do you get MLS listings for the entire
[05:05.680 --> 05:06.680]  country?
[05:06.680 --> 05:09.960]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.440]  house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[05:58.880 --> 06:00.880]  Ow.
[06:59.880 --> 07:06.360]  Hi, I'm Sara Atkins, inventor of Better Than Rocks, the one-of-a-kind solution to planter drainage.
[07:06.360 --> 07:10.480]  A few years ago, I searched for a lightweight product to put in the bottom of my containers
[07:10.480 --> 07:11.800]  to help with drainage.
[07:11.800 --> 07:16.600]  I found there was nothing on the market, so I decided to develop something myself.
[07:16.600 --> 07:18.640]  The result is Better Than Rocks.
[07:18.640 --> 07:24.720]  It keeps soil in, lets excess water out, and helps oxygen reach the plant's roots by creating
[07:24.720 --> 07:27.360]  an air pocket in the bottom of the planter.
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.120]  This helps the plant absorb nutrients which is necessary to grow healthy plants.
[07:32.120 --> 07:36.240]  Better Than Rocks is practically weightless, so your containers will be lighter, and it's
[07:36.240 --> 07:40.160]  made of 100% recycled plastic right here in North America.
[07:40.160 --> 07:44.320]  You can reuse it year after year, so it should never end up in a landfill.
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.440]  I discovered Better Than Rocks last year, and I was happy to find my plants were much healthier,
[07:49.440 --> 07:52.240]  fuller, and the containers were easy to move around.
[07:52.240 --> 07:58.640]  Use for Better Than Rocks at your favorite garden center, or visit www.betterthanrocks.com.
[08:22.240 --> 08:32.160]  The swine flu H1N1 hysteria as a fraud has been vindicated in spades and triplicate.
[08:32.160 --> 08:36.200]  It is now all over the mainstream media, Wall Street Journal, you name it, that the whole
[08:36.200 --> 08:43.720]  thing was a fraud, the big pharma companies paid off the European Union, the US government,
[08:43.720 --> 08:46.640]  the British government, the Canadian government to lie and say it was deadly and that the
[08:46.640 --> 08:49.680]  vaccine itself is dangerous.
[08:49.680 --> 08:54.520]  So in two hours we have Dr. Russell Blalock, top brain surgeon, he's invented many of
[08:54.520 --> 09:04.240]  the most commonly used brain surgeries out there, exposes how they're putting toxins
[09:04.240 --> 09:10.240]  in the food by design, and he's also created a compendium of those government documents,
[09:10.240 --> 09:13.840]  and there's a new EPA report out where they admit that they're allowing hundreds of toxic
[09:13.840 --> 09:16.200]  chemicals to be put in the water on purpose.
[09:16.200 --> 09:22.560]  So we're going to have him on about that and the whole flu situation in hindsight ahead
[09:22.560 --> 09:26.720]  of the next PSY op that they launch.
[09:26.720 --> 09:34.760]  Also cities all over the United States simultaneously yesterday, including the town where I live,
[09:34.760 --> 09:44.120]  passed taxes, roughly doubling the taxes overall, not just energy taxes, but this dwarfs all
[09:44.120 --> 09:50.520]  taxes combined, and they're openly all over the news, calling for one child policy in
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.480]  the US, and I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to go over it today, Austin Renewable
[09:54.480 --> 10:01.120]  Energy Plan sales easily through council on Earth Day last night, unanimous vote, and
[10:01.120 --> 10:09.240]  we have caught the head of elections in Travis County, and it's even been in the statesman
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.320]  that we basically don't have elections here, and that's why this is going on.
[10:15.320 --> 10:22.320]  That's why it doesn't matter how many people are angry or what happens, even a state board
[10:22.320 --> 10:29.160]  has admitted to Capital Metro, the bus agency just steals hundreds of millions of dollars
[10:29.160 --> 10:35.160]  and no one knows where it goes, and they won't say, and this is only the beginning.
[10:35.160 --> 10:41.000]  This is only the beginning, because the people know the government's corrupted out of control,
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.360]  but they have no idea how bad it really is, and the criminals have had decades to move
[10:47.360 --> 10:53.880]  into every position of power, and they have handbooks on how they run their scams and
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.520]  how they deceive people and how they distract, and when I say the sky is the limit, I mean
[10:59.520 --> 11:06.920]  it is the limit, the tyranny that is now going to come to full fruition in the western world
[11:06.920 --> 11:17.680]  is going to dwarf anything ever seen in human history, but I don't say that lightly.
[11:17.680 --> 11:23.400]  So we'll go over that also, the latest takeover of the economy through the value added financial
[11:23.400 --> 11:29.480]  tax, the environmental value added taxes, all of it.
[11:29.480 --> 11:37.880]  So we'll be breaking that down today.
[11:37.880 --> 11:44.080]  Greece welcomes its new IMF overlords with Day of Rioting and National Strikes, that's
[11:44.080 --> 11:55.360]  from Mark Fauber, top financial analyst, and Mr. Black, one of the top former federal regulators
[11:55.360 --> 12:04.080]  who gave testimony earlier in the week before Congress, and he, I'm going to play it later,
[12:04.080 --> 12:10.040]  and he just said, look, I've been here all day hearing other testimony, and he said,
[12:10.040 --> 12:14.080]  no one's talking about the real issue, all of these brokerage firms and big banks are
[12:14.080 --> 12:18.220]  completely criminal and know they're criminal, and this is designed to destroy the economy
[12:18.220 --> 12:29.080]  and this will destroy everything and consolidate power for them, this is a criminal takeover.
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.480]  And the chairman of the committee for the last two minutes of his testimony starts banging
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.320]  the gavel, tapping it to distract what he's saying, a new tactic we've seen the last few
[12:37.320 --> 12:44.040]  years from these people, and watching Mr. Black, Professor Black, who by the way is
[12:44.040 --> 12:53.560]  in fall of the republic, it just brings it home even more that anybody who's clear thinking
[12:53.560 --> 13:00.840]  looks at this and understands it's a worldwide kleptocracy or a government run by criminals,
[13:00.840 --> 13:09.800]  kleptomaniacs, and they enjoy it, they have fun doing it, they compete with each other
[13:09.800 --> 13:18.240]  for who can twist things the best, who can lie the best, who can kill the most people,
[13:18.240 --> 13:22.680]  and because America had so much liberty it produced more wealth in the entire world
[13:22.680 --> 13:33.840]  combined in the last 80 years, and we've gone from the richest to now the most in debt,
[13:33.840 --> 13:42.160]  and it's accelerating rapidly, because the average American has had it so good, even
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.480]  if you're poor in this country, you've got it a lot better than people, 15 million children
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.920]  starved to death, the UN's own numbers a year, another 10 million adults, so 25 million people
[13:52.920 --> 14:03.280]  starved to death, so even our poor have had it the best, but the system is designed to
[14:03.280 --> 14:09.560]  make us all poor and all dependent, and so because we've had it so good, it had so much
[14:09.560 --> 14:18.360]  entertainment and so much bread and circus, fundamentally people can't take things seriously,
[14:18.360 --> 14:23.720]  and that's what Professor Black was saying, he says, don't you understand, it's all over,
[14:23.720 --> 14:30.080]  the world is going into a global depression and it's not going to stop and nothing has
[14:30.080 --> 14:34.920]  been fixed, in fact it's getting worse, and that's exactly what's going on on every other
[14:34.920 --> 14:45.320]  front, and those of us that are continually upset and are trying to do something about
[14:45.320 --> 14:54.000]  this, we're the people that have good instincts, I mean as a man I'm supposed to not be able
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.080]  to sleep, when we have absolute 100% incontrovertible proof that the federal government involved
[15:03.080 --> 15:10.840]  with other foreign intelligence agencies and private MERT groups carried out 9-11, and
[15:10.840 --> 15:16.960]  even say that, I mean I could spend 500 hours and never exhaust all the evidence, it's ridiculous
[15:16.960 --> 15:25.240]  on every front, 100% inside job, 100%, we've got government planning documents, we've got
[15:25.240 --> 15:30.320]  every facet of the attacks being a complete lie, then when you find out what really happened,
[15:30.320 --> 15:39.280]  100%, I mean how can any of you even sleep, oh you choose not to believe it, you choose
[15:39.280 --> 15:45.680]  not to look into what I'm saying, you choose to not believe that the global warming fraud
[15:45.680 --> 15:51.680]  is a complete takeover of society, you choose to not believe that sodium fluoride is a sterilant
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.920]  and a cancer causing agent of the highest magnitude, you choose to believe everything's
[15:56.920 --> 16:07.640]  going to be alright in the economy, you choose to believe Iraq had WMDs, you choose willfully
[16:07.640 --> 16:13.920]  to be fools, willful, idiocy, and I'm not talking to our regular listeners, I'm talking
[16:13.920 --> 16:19.640]  to the tens of thousands of new listeners that tune across the AM and FM, XM dial, shortwave
[16:19.640 --> 16:29.840]  dial, internet dial, I mean this is so intense and so real for me because I've lived research
[16:29.840 --> 16:41.560]  for 16 years and on air for almost 15, this knowledge is so overwhelming that more and
[16:41.560 --> 16:47.320]  more, I'm not even sure if I can continue ladies and gentlemen, but then I know I can't
[16:47.320 --> 16:51.240]  stop either because I can't get it out of my head, I can't stop thinking about it, I
[16:51.240 --> 16:57.160]  can't stop learning, I can't stop developing a clearer and clearer picture of who runs
[16:57.160 --> 17:03.400]  the planet, if you knew what I knew, okay, if you would have done the research, I'm not
[17:03.400 --> 17:06.560]  even that smart, if you would have gone out and studied history and learned the tricks
[17:06.560 --> 17:13.520]  of elites and learned what they're currently doing, you would be horrified, you would have
[17:13.520 --> 17:20.280]  got chills through your body, I've got chills right now.
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.520]  You think I want to go on air and say 9-11's an inside job, you think I liked doing that
[17:24.520 --> 17:33.600]  eight and a half years ago, you think it's fun, you think I just get up here and say
[17:33.600 --> 17:50.560]  this stuff for attention, heaven help us, heaven help us, why have I been able to say
[17:50.560 --> 17:55.160]  the things I say, why have I been able to get on so many AM and FM stations, why have
[17:55.160 --> 18:02.000]  I been able to do this, because no matter how wild the things I talk about are, truth
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.440]  is wild, truth is stranger than fiction, the world's a crazy place, history is out of
[18:07.440 --> 18:14.240]  control and dangerous and amazing and beautiful and ugly and everything in between, and it's
[18:14.240 --> 18:19.240]  because we have predicted many events accurately, we've talked about so many things that were
[18:19.240 --> 18:25.720]  in government documents that months or years or a decade later become mainstream media,
[18:25.720 --> 18:30.200]  that's why we're getting on so many stations, that's why this show is growing so fast, because
[18:30.200 --> 18:36.960]  finally station managers and radio executives and the population, the listeners who heard
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.760]  me as a guest in the thousands and thousands, I've probably done more than 5,000 radio
[18:40.760 --> 18:50.480]  interviews the last 15 years, I was doing radio interviews before I had a radio show,
[18:50.480 --> 18:58.280]  because most people once or twice have heard me or seen videos I produced and they would
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.040]  laugh at it at the time or say, look at this nut and then years later they'd see it in
[19:02.040 --> 19:09.160]  their face admitted, and I go back to a parallel to this, back in the 1950s you can pull up
[19:09.160 --> 19:15.240]  the actual date when La Cosa Nostra and the hearings were admitted in Congress, but you
[19:15.240 --> 19:21.320]  know you have this FBI director who's in there for 20-something years, up until the 50s,
[19:21.320 --> 19:29.240]  he'd been there since the 30s, Jagger Hoover, or even earlier, and he would go around saying
[19:29.240 --> 19:35.520]  it's a conspiracy theory that let La Cosa Nostra exist, because he was being paid off
[19:35.520 --> 19:41.240]  by La Cosa Nostra, now everybody knows the mob he is real now, the Italian mob, and that's
[19:41.240 --> 19:46.280]  how stupid all of this is, everything I'm talking about is completely real, it's there,
[19:46.280 --> 19:50.680]  you can't just deny it and make it go away, just like in the 50s if they said the mob
[19:50.680 --> 19:58.600]  didn't exist, now that sounds silly doesn't it, well 9-11's an inside job, now I'm gonna
[19:58.600 --> 20:01.440]  go over and we come back, stay with us.
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.840]  Are you considering taking herbal supplements instead of overpriced and potentially dangerous
[20:05.840 --> 20:10.880]  pharmaceutical drugs, but just not sure where to start, are you confused by the thousands
[20:10.880 --> 20:15.720]  of products and brands, what if you could find what you're looking for in herbal supplements

[21:05.880 --> 21:11.600]  order based upon collective action, Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalist
[21:11.600 --> 21:13.720]  through their own words and documents.
[21:13.720 --> 21:18.200]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[21:18.200 --> 21:20.680]  It means all the world under their control.
[21:20.680 --> 21:25.680]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[21:25.680 --> 21:26.680]  world.
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.680]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[21:31.680 --> 21:34.200]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[21:34.200 --> 21:38.680]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[21:38.680 --> 21:39.680]  financial system.
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.200]  The global governance with the establishment of the G20, so it's going to be an inner ruling
[21:44.200 --> 21:49.080]  elite and then everyone else and I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[22:00.280 --> 22:05.280]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity,
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.060]  content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[22:10.060 --> 22:14.760]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat Continental System.
[22:14.760 --> 22:19.120]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[22:19.120 --> 22:23.640]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.720]  country ever experienced.
[22:25.720 --> 22:29.680]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.600]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its
[22:33.600 --> 22:34.840]  original value.
[22:34.840 --> 22:39.560]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.120]  Hi this is Ted Anderson, I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[23:00.000 --> 23:04.820]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt-related

[24:10.360 --> 24:14.120]  Okay what I'm going to do is I'm going to go live in the second, third and fourth hour
[24:14.120 --> 24:21.440]  today at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[24:21.440 --> 24:30.600]  And the entire second hour I'm going to devote to building seven, the key to unlocking 9-11.
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.920]  Oh you have all the other sectors and areas of the 9-11 attacks, every one of them proves
[24:36.920 --> 24:41.720]  total inside job and the official story of course makes no sense, has been proven to
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.800]  be a lie, six of the 10 commissioners say it's a lie, a cover up, that's only in the
[24:45.800 --> 24:57.880]  back of the newspaper, the head lawyer farmer says it was a criminal cover up by the Pentagon.
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.780]  And their official story makes no sense but then once you realize how they really carried
[25:01.780 --> 25:12.840]  it out then it all fits together perfectly and you can see how they did it.
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.680]  How they set up the underwear bomber was part of a drill, we told you that day one, the
[25:17.680 --> 25:26.360]  eyewitnesses came out even before 2009 was over, the Christmas Day bombing.
[25:26.360 --> 25:32.880]  And then two months later the Under Secretary of State, Mr. Kennedy said well yes we were
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.840]  ordered by an unnamed US intelligence agency to give him a visa and help him get on the
[25:37.840 --> 25:46.080]  plane, the FBI had said the witnesses at the airport and the Haskells were lying and of
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.040]  course they weren't lying when they saw the government get him on the airplane with no
[25:50.040 --> 25:58.240]  passport and no ID and they were videotaping the whole thing on board the craft and the
[25:58.240 --> 26:04.120]  young moron Patsy thought it was a drill, same thing on 9-11, we know Muhammad Atta
[26:04.120 --> 26:13.720]  and others were trained at US military bases, AP Newsweek, San Jose Mercury News and it's
[26:13.720 --> 26:16.680]  even on record, yeah it's weird they were trained at bases but we're not going to have
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.040]  a big discussion about that and yeah the government was running live action drills
[26:21.040 --> 26:31.600]  seeing if they could insert Arabs on planes and yeah we've got the recordings where there
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.720]  were real air phone calls made, not the magic cell phones that couldn't work at 30,000 feet
[26:37.720 --> 26:42.880]  with the statuses saying I can't breathe, there's something in the air, the planes take
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.120]  off, they think it's a drill, they nerve gas, remote control the aircraft in the buildings,
[26:48.120 --> 26:51.400]  that's what happened, okay?
[26:51.400 --> 27:07.080]  Let's see, I can back up every millimeter of what I just said and that whole area of
[27:07.080 --> 27:15.680]  the hijackers trained at US bases, that's only conservatively one one thousandth of
[27:15.680 --> 27:22.760]  the issues, I mean no exaggeration, within one month of 9-11 I had done a two hour road
[27:22.760 --> 27:28.800]  to tyranny film, the first version that only offered for a few months and I made the official
[27:28.800 --> 27:36.600]  version and released it in February a few months later of 2002 where I went over more
[27:36.600 --> 27:47.520]  than 500 mainstream news articles disproving the official story, you know that's what's
[27:47.520 --> 27:53.440]  sick about this, the truth really comes out and then if anyone looks at the raw reporting
[27:53.440 --> 27:59.200]  and all the information and points it out they say oh that doesn't exist you're insane,
[27:59.200 --> 28:01.960]  that's what I'm going to talk about in the next hour just with building 7 and the new
[28:01.960 --> 28:10.280]  information that's come out is that it's not even new information, it's just another national
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.360]  reporter going yeah I was there and yeah they were going to blow up building 7 what's the
[28:15.360 --> 28:22.200]  big deal, what's the big deal blowing up building 7, after Silverstein has said they didn't
[28:22.200 --> 28:28.480]  blow up building 7 after he went on TV and said we blew up building 7 and then it's
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.400]  not just that I have all this video of CNN, Fox you name it, of firefighters and police
[28:33.400 --> 28:37.880]  saying get back and you hear the explosions going off and they say that building's about
[28:37.880 --> 28:44.040]  to completely blow up and then 10 seconds later it does, I mean I heard them on the
[28:44.040 --> 28:49.720]  news on ABC radio saying they were going to blow it up 15 minutes before they did and
[28:49.720 --> 28:53.680]  then I go on air and I say here they are saying they were going to blow it up and they say
[28:53.680 --> 29:02.000]  shut up you un-American piece of trash, nobody blew that up, shut up you un-American piece
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.040]  of trash that the hijackers weren't trained at US military bases, it doesn't matter if
[29:06.040 --> 29:11.440]  at the defense language school the dean Colonel Steven Butler went public and said this is
[29:11.440 --> 29:18.400]  a government operation in a letter to the San Jose Mercury News, these people were trained
[29:18.400 --> 29:29.240]  at our base, I don't know exactly what happened but Ada sat in my classroom, okay, I'll tell
[29:29.240 --> 29:34.620]  you what this new information pertains to and why it's so upsetting to me because every
[29:34.620 --> 29:39.320]  time we get proven right it doesn't make me happy, it makes me sick but let me tell you
[29:39.320 --> 29:45.600]  something if we don't own up to who's running our country and how bad it is, 9-11 is nothing
[29:45.600 --> 29:49.200]  compared to what these murderers are going to do and you are the target, you remember
[29:49.200 --> 29:51.000]  that.
[29:51.000 --> 30:00.240]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.440]  They helped to create a new world order, we are part of a new world order, a new world

[30:17.760 --> 30:20.240]  It means all the world under their control.

[31:00.200 --> 31:04.160]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[31:04.160 --> 31:07.080]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[31:07.080 --> 31:11.120]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[31:11.120 --> 31:12.120]  or gold?
[31:12.120 --> 31:15.400]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[31:15.400 --> 31:17.680]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[31:17.680 --> 31:21.840]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[31:21.840 --> 31:22.840]  seeds.
[31:22.840 --> 31:28.160]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[31:28.160 --> 31:30.000]  food for you and your family.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.200]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[31:34.200 --> 31:37.800]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[31:37.800 --> 31:43.480]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com or give them
[31:43.480 --> 31:55.120]  a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[31:55.120 --> 31:56.840]  are the ultimate barter item.
[31:56.840 --> 32:01.640]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[33:10.720 --> 33:17.120]  I can't make a conscious decision like most people do to lie to myself and say two plus
[33:17.120 --> 33:25.040]  two equals five.
[33:25.040 --> 33:29.880]  I can't do it.
[33:29.880 --> 33:38.800]  I can't lie to myself just because the truth is scary.
[33:38.800 --> 33:44.920]  I can't rationalize what's going on and that's why I'm so disgusted about the new information
[33:44.920 --> 33:54.880]  that I'm going to cover in detail in the next hour is because I understand the psychology
[33:54.880 --> 34:00.120]  of the controllers more and more, and the more I get in their mind, the more disgusting
[34:00.120 --> 34:01.120]  it is.
[34:01.120 --> 34:04.840]  It's like I'm locked in a cell with these people psychologically.
[34:04.840 --> 34:10.360]  You can't help but just get the dirt on you, psychically.
[34:10.360 --> 34:14.520]  You dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you.
[34:14.520 --> 34:15.960]  That's the knowledge of it.
[34:15.960 --> 34:21.720]  I always wondered why when they had disinfo operatives in the media and disinfo operatives
[34:21.720 --> 34:26.200]  on the ground in the last eight plus years at ground zero who demonize and come up and
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.880]  get in the face of 9-11 truthers, why they'd always march up and say, so you're saying
[34:30.880 --> 34:34.920]  firemen and police were involved in the attacks.
[34:34.920 --> 34:39.320]  We'd say no, but they are on video saying get back, they're going to bring down, they're
[34:39.320 --> 34:42.640]  going to blow up building seven, they're going to bring it down, they're going to pull it,
[34:42.640 --> 34:43.800]  they're going to blow it up.
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.160]  Those are all quotes on TV.
[34:48.160 --> 34:53.120]  I wondered why they always invoke that in the newspapers and it's meant so that firemen
[34:53.120 --> 34:57.680]  and police hear that and get angry and say, well, I'm not involved, sure, I heard they
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.720]  were going to blow it up, but that was just because they didn't want building seven to
[35:03.720 --> 35:11.560]  damage anything and that's psychologically involving the police and the firemen, many
[35:11.560 --> 35:16.600]  of which died in tower one and two in the crime when they're not involved in the crime.
[35:16.600 --> 35:22.840]  But then after the fact, they do become involved in the crime because all these thousands of
[35:22.840 --> 35:30.000]  police and firemen and medical workers and federal agents and others who were all down
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.080]  there in lower Manhattan all around building seven and heard the countdown that police,
[35:36.080 --> 35:38.320]  multiple police are on record saying happened.
[35:38.320 --> 35:41.360]  You can see the media and the police start running and the cops say get back and they're
[35:41.360 --> 35:42.760]  about to blow it up.
[35:42.760 --> 35:44.720]  That building's coming down, they're bringing it down.
[35:44.720 --> 35:50.560]  We're going to play that audio and video coming up and we've got dozens of them and
[35:50.560 --> 35:51.560]  time constraints.
[35:51.560 --> 35:52.560]  I don't know.
[35:52.560 --> 35:55.120]  I guess I'll play five, six clips.
[35:55.120 --> 35:56.320]  I mean, that's another issue.
[35:56.320 --> 35:57.640]  There's just so much evidence.
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.000]  It's disgusting.
[36:01.000 --> 36:10.520]  Then I read this Fox News contributor, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, and he's like, oh, shame on
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.240]  Jesse Ventura.
[36:15.240 --> 36:20.320]  He's discredited, he says, because he's going on national TV and saying the government
[36:20.320 --> 36:26.320]  blew up building seven as a pretext for war.
[36:26.320 --> 36:28.680]  And you know, there's really no big deal with building seven.
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.320]  And I was there that day, says, and you know, I talked to the city officials, I talked to
[36:33.320 --> 36:38.080]  the power company and yeah, Larry Silverstein got on the phone and called the insurance
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.600]  company and said, we need to have a controlled demolition of seven so it doesn't damage
[36:42.600 --> 36:46.920]  other buildings.
[36:46.920 --> 36:53.200]  And he just throws it out there like it's no big deal.
[36:53.200 --> 37:00.520]  And Silverstein went on PBS in, what, 2003 in a documentary about the demolition of
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.640]  the other towers that happened weeks after, six and others, and about the attacks and
[37:05.640 --> 37:08.880]  he says, yeah, we made the decision to pull it and we gave the order and watched the building
[37:08.880 --> 37:09.880]  come down.
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.440]  And then they cut to another clip of them demolishing building six months later and
[37:13.440 --> 37:17.760]  they say we're getting ready to pull building six and they blow it up.
[37:17.760 --> 37:20.120]  They demolish it.
[37:20.120 --> 37:21.760]  And that's the demolition definition.
[37:21.760 --> 37:25.680]  So the mainstream media came out and said, no, that's not the definition.
[37:25.680 --> 37:26.680]  That's not what he meant.
[37:26.680 --> 37:28.720]  And then Silverstein wouldn't talk about it for a few years.
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.700]  And finally through the New York Times said, yes, I meant, let's pull the firefighters
[37:33.700 --> 37:39.920]  out at five o'clock because there's been such a loss of life and I don't want any firefighters
[37:39.920 --> 37:42.880]  dying battling ablaze.
[37:42.880 --> 37:46.800]  The problem is the firefighters were pulled out before noon out of building seven and
[37:46.800 --> 37:48.960]  it was small fires.
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.200]  And Barry Jennings, the deputy head of emergency management in the city before he mysteriously
[37:53.200 --> 38:02.000]  died after we aired audio on the show, said, yeah, you know, before the other towers even
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.840]  fell, there were big explosions in the lobby, dead people everywhere.
[38:05.840 --> 38:08.720]  The firemen came in with the police and said, don't look at the dead bodies.
[38:08.720 --> 38:13.800]  We're bringing you out.
[38:13.800 --> 38:16.160]  And that they made the decision then to pull the building.
[38:16.160 --> 38:24.240]  Well, he died real fast, but we've been to the neighbor's houses and they won't talk.
[38:24.240 --> 38:33.840]  And it looks like he's maybe on the witness protection program.
[38:33.840 --> 38:37.960]  They said suddenly the family was just gone, moved out, and they heard he was dead.
[38:37.960 --> 38:41.760]  And the hospital's been very secretive about it.
[38:41.760 --> 38:48.960]  So it was coworkers, but, but side issue, again, the evidence just goes on and on.
[38:48.960 --> 38:57.080]  I mean, we ended up getting in contact with the police that are on the CNN and Fox and
[38:57.080 --> 38:58.080]  democracy.
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.880]  Now it was a year before she got the show, but she had her local show in New York.
[39:00.880 --> 39:01.880]  She's there.
[39:01.880 --> 39:02.880]  Amy Goodman.
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.360]  And, and, and there's all this footage and they say, get back.
[39:06.360 --> 39:07.360]  It's coming down.
[39:07.360 --> 39:08.360]  They're going to blow it up.
[39:08.360 --> 39:09.360]  Get back.
[39:09.360 --> 39:10.360]  They all start running.
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.560]  They found the cops, we've had the cops on and they said, yeah, no, there was a countdown.
[39:16.560 --> 39:22.720]  They didn't tell us till the countdown started and they said, run for your lives.
[39:22.720 --> 39:25.840]  And all of this happened.
[39:25.840 --> 39:27.760]  And as I said, I was going to get a pizza.
[39:27.760 --> 39:30.400]  I've been on air since it happened on 9 11.
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.760]  I was driving over to the local pizza place listening to news radio 590 ABC news.
[39:36.760 --> 39:40.520]  And they said, well, they're looking at a controlled demolition of building seven for
[39:40.520 --> 39:43.920]  everyone's safety.
[39:43.920 --> 39:45.200]  And then they changed their story.
[39:45.200 --> 39:48.280]  Once they blew it up, they said, no, we're just going to say fires did it.
[39:48.280 --> 39:52.000]  And they had all these suspicious characters very well spoken on all the major news channels
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.360]  as men on the street wearing Harley Davis and shirts and ball caps, you know, acting
[39:56.360 --> 39:58.960]  like average Schmoes intelligence operatives.
[39:58.960 --> 40:06.560]  We played these videos reading a script explaining why it fell within seconds that they're there.
[40:06.560 --> 40:17.160]  And then, of course, we have BBC 25 minutes before on two channels, BBC World BBC 24 reporting
[40:17.160 --> 40:24.120]  live from Manhattan, simultaneously off the teleprompter, the exact same message.
[40:24.120 --> 40:29.480]  And I went research where they get their pre feeds from and I discovered Reuters is their
[40:29.480 --> 40:31.880]  main supplier.
[40:31.880 --> 40:38.080]  And so I predicted, I said, that was a Reuters false start with the official story that went
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.160]  out early.
[40:41.160 --> 40:46.200]  Then we found out CNN had actually gone on an hour before and Aaron Brown an hour before
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.960]  61 minutes before, but he lived in New York, building seven is falling from fires in its
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.520]  own footprint, a complete collapse, but he's on a rooftop and he turns around, you know,
[40:55.520 --> 40:58.880]  the Brits didn't know what building seven was, and he looks and he says, but I don't
[40:58.880 --> 41:06.040]  know this report is right, exact same report before it fell, just like before they'd even
[41:06.040 --> 41:11.400]  captured Lee Harvey Oswald before it was even in the news in Dallas in 63.
[41:11.400 --> 41:17.840]  They got their time zones off by two hours in New Zealand, in Thailand, in Australia
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.360]  and several other nations and had his name and the whole story printed because, you know,
[41:22.360 --> 41:27.920]  back in the 60s, they still had afternoon editions and multiple editions of certain newspapers
[41:27.920 --> 41:29.240]  were published at certain times.
[41:29.240 --> 41:30.520]  That was the internet of the day.
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.480]  So it was always coming out of different times.
[41:34.480 --> 41:38.280]  And so they already, again, that's the exact same thing that happened here.
[41:38.280 --> 41:39.840]  They already had their official script.
[41:39.840 --> 41:44.080]  When you run something like this and it's an inside job, you've got to have the official
[41:44.080 --> 41:48.880]  script and it just goes on and on just with building seven.
[41:48.880 --> 41:52.280]  And I'm going to go back over all of this in detail in the next hour.
[41:52.280 --> 41:55.160]  But why am I so upset?
[41:55.160 --> 42:04.000]  I have seen so many reporters go, yeah, okay, we were talking about blowing it up.
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.160]  After all these years of them denying it and saying no one ever discussed blowing it up,
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.920]  but now all these news, live news feeds have been discovered and posted on the internet.
[42:13.920 --> 42:16.040]  There's new ones all the time.
[42:16.040 --> 42:20.880]  So many that now when they come out, people don't even really pay attention to it.
[42:20.880 --> 42:21.880]  9-11 Truth really doesn't.
[42:21.880 --> 42:23.400]  It's just like, yeah, we already know.
[42:23.400 --> 42:25.720]  They blew up seven, you know, the dumb public won't wake up.
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.280]  Well, you've got to keep bringing the info to the public.
[42:29.280 --> 42:32.240]  We can't sit there and talk to 20 million people through the mainstream media at one
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.960]  pop and we have to do it through alternative media over and over again, continually reaching
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.200]  more people because if we don't, the same crew that carried out 9-11 is going to have
[42:42.200 --> 42:44.960]  their way with this society.
[42:44.960 --> 42:48.440]  You think they're going to stop there with wars and no, they're going to take your pension
[42:48.440 --> 42:49.440]  funds.
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.840]  They're going to jack up all your taxes.
[42:50.840 --> 42:52.340]  They're doing it now.
[42:52.340 --> 42:56.760]  They're going to set up domestic police, secret police networks that are already been set
[42:56.760 --> 42:57.760]  up.
[42:57.760 --> 42:58.760]  They're going to use them.
[42:58.760 --> 43:00.280]  They're going to arrest anybody that criticizes the government.
[43:00.280 --> 43:02.560]  They're now promoting it everywhere.
[43:02.560 --> 43:03.880]  They're going with it.
[43:03.880 --> 43:15.680]  They're trying to really convert us to a incredibly horrible despotism.
[43:15.680 --> 43:24.120]  Now, if you want to get the full picture, there's an article and I, I am Paul Watson
[43:24.120 --> 43:28.160]  and wrote some of the points I wanted in the article at three o'clock, four o'clock in
[43:28.160 --> 43:35.280]  the morning and he had it out by seven AM because he's in England six hours earlier
[43:35.280 --> 43:41.680]  than us bombshell Silverstein wanted to demolish building seven on 9 11 box news hit piece
[43:41.680 --> 43:46.680]  against 9 11 true than Jesse Ventura and inadvertently reveals a shocking truth for the millionth
[43:46.680 --> 43:47.680]  time.
[43:47.680 --> 43:52.120]  WTC leaseholder was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they could authorize the
[43:52.120 --> 43:59.200]  control demolition of the building and there's a preface to the article from Alex Jones.
[43:59.200 --> 44:02.120]  It says to truly grasp the magnitude of the story.
[44:02.120 --> 44:06.880]  You really have to read the entire article immediately after the pull at controversy
[44:06.880 --> 44:11.480]  with Silverstein debunkers claimed that there was no plan to conduct a control demolition
[44:11.480 --> 44:12.760]  of the building.
[44:12.760 --> 44:20.040]  Now the facts that officials were considering blowing up the building is established Silverstein
[44:20.040 --> 44:24.120]  consistent denial that this took place as a huge smoking gun.
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.720]  How did Silverstein expected to demolish the building safely when such a process takes
[44:28.720 --> 44:35.200]  weeks or even months to properly set up even without the additional chaos surrounding WTC
[44:35.200 --> 44:37.000]  seven on 9 11.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.760]  All good explosives have been correctly placed on such short notice inside a burning building
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.080]  that had already been evacuated unless the explosives were already in place.
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.760]  This new revelation is astounding and it needs to be investigated immediately.
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.000]  And then we go into all the evidence in the videos and the eyewitness reports and Silverstein
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.080]  saying they blew it up and then saying he didn't say that when he did.
[45:02.080 --> 45:13.200]  But it's the sickeningness of cowards like Jeffrey Scott Shapiro attacking Jesse Ventura
[45:13.200 --> 45:19.600]  as an American and then going well yeah we were discussing and I did talk to city officials
[45:19.600 --> 45:26.480]  and Silverstein was trying to get permission to blow up the building.
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.720]  See something went wrong on 9 11 flight 93 the more I look at it was probably not meant
[45:31.720 --> 45:34.960]  for the capital because it could have gone either places it was meant for seven they
[45:34.960 --> 45:36.480]  already had it wired.
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.160]  The CIA was based in the building the state and city emergency system was based they
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.800]  were running tripod to drill of the buildings being attacked that day that's now declassified
[45:45.800 --> 45:53.560]  Giuliani denied it for five years and now it's been declassified tripod to congressional
[45:53.560 --> 45:57.320]  testimony 9 11 Commission.
[45:57.320 --> 45:59.880]  That was their cover well what's all this stuff going on why are all these people here
[45:59.880 --> 46:05.800]  oh it's just a drill officers you'll see later going up the building we need to have some
[46:05.800 --> 46:17.160]  martyrs going up to the top of the firemen
[46:17.160 --> 46:21.000]  and you've got Silverstein then frantically on the phone because he just got the building
[46:21.000 --> 46:26.960]  six months before he'd taken out six plus billion dollars in insurance five hundred
[46:26.960 --> 46:36.360]  plus million just on building seven and it's going to be obvious if they blow this thing
[46:36.360 --> 46:39.760]  up people are going to know it's a controlled demolition what are we going to do we've got
[46:39.760 --> 46:47.240]  to get rid of the evidence and the black ops come in and say don't worry we'll float the
[46:47.240 --> 46:51.680]  story that we're going to have a controlled demolition to save other buildings but wait
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.200]  people know you can't wire building that fast especially when it's got fires in it don't
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.360]  worry they'll buy anything believe me we've got you know we've gotten reports back our
[47:01.360 --> 47:06.120]  psych warfare experts say they'll buy it just just say we wired it and then somebody changed
[47:06.120 --> 47:10.640]  that I guess when he couldn't get the insurance money just an added little thing in this whole
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.120]  system and so they said we'll just blow the thing and say that it fell on its own and
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.960]  that's what they did and and it's admitted they did that and then the way psyops and
[47:19.960 --> 47:24.640]  black ops work is is they go well a lot of cops and firemen know this people are talking
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.520]  these 911 truthers are talking to him what you do is on one or two programs you just
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.960]  mentioned that you gave the order to pull it to save life but then on the insurance
[47:34.960 --> 47:41.560]  settlement it says that he didn't and then that way you're covered just like we use drills
[47:41.560 --> 47:46.240]  you know this is them talking to Silverstein just like we use drills sir so that we can
[47:46.240 --> 47:49.720]  have plausible deniability the public doesn't want to believe these type of things so they'll
[47:49.720 --> 47:55.400]  buy the lie no matter how ridiculous are you sure about that yes sir we are thanks for
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.880]  working with us on this it's better for America and Israel this is gonna let us set up the
[47:59.880 --> 48:11.520]  empire and continue things this is upon sacrifice for America we appreciate your patriotism
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.200]  you really think they're gonna buy it you you mean we're gonna blow this thing up right
[48:15.200 --> 48:20.520]  in front of everybody sir it's better if you don't know all the details you saw tower
[48:20.520 --> 48:25.680]  one and two they bought that didn't they all right all right well my the deal was I let
[48:25.680 --> 48:33.800]  you do this to my buildings I get the six billion sir you know you're you're involved
[48:33.800 --> 48:40.240]  in the you know local underworld mafia in New York you understand how this works I mean
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.240]  I've been working with you for a long time and I have to sit there and I have to look
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.640]  at these people I mean they think we're so stupid they blow up all three of the buildings
[48:49.640 --> 48:53.680]  they admit they blew up seven and then say they never said it when they said it on TV
[48:53.680 --> 48:58.040]  and you got all the cops saying get back they're blowing it up and then you have a fox news
[48:58.040 --> 49:04.360]  person come out and say well yeah I mean we were gonna blow it up that day Silverstein
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.680]  tried to get permission but he couldn't so it it fell anyways perfectly in its own foot
[49:08.680 --> 49:12.000]  Brenton didn't damage nearby buildings which is the reason he wanted to blow it up was
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.080]  supposedly not to damage other buildings and then you talk to the general public they
[49:18.080 --> 49:22.600]  can't even grasp this elementary thing a lot of times they'll switch into crime stop or
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.080]  double think and say well the government had to blow it up you go no no no no the government's
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.760]  denying they blew it up but I thought you said Silverstein admitted they blew it up
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.600]  see they know how to confuse people well no they've said both that that's the reason there's
[49:37.600 --> 49:41.960]  a cover up here we know from the evidence they blew it up from the seismograph from
[49:41.960 --> 49:46.240]  the witnesses from the video from the cops and firemen saying get back from Silverstein
[49:46.240 --> 49:51.680]  admitting they blew it up from it being on the news they went with the story we're gonna
[49:51.680 --> 49:57.120]  blow up building seven to protect you and then they shift and say no we didn't do that
[49:57.120 --> 50:03.600]  we never said that you heard all over radio and TV and so an hour before they shift from
[50:03.600 --> 50:11.600]  we're gonna blow it up to oh no it's falling in its own footprint and the building's still
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.600]  standing there I mean they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off because
[50:15.600 --> 50:26.640]  something didn't go right with building seven they're out in the open and grown adults many
[50:26.640 --> 50:33.000]  of them can grasp but many others can't but then it just brings it all home how in your
[50:33.000 --> 50:38.920]  face this is how out in the open this is to have Fox News come out and say it is true we
[50:38.920 --> 50:46.240]  were looking at blowing it up but it fell on its own perfectly so we didn't have to
[50:46.240 --> 50:50.720]  when all these years they've denied that there was that they were promoting blowing up building
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.400]  seven but they knew that that wouldn't sail with engineers around the country and demolition
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.720]  experts oh man they really think we're stupid hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[51:02.720 --> 51:07.600]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.720]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[51:11.720 --> 51:15.880]  or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[51:15.880 --> 51:20.400]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have
[51:20.400 --> 51:25.840]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and

[54:29.920 --> 54:36.000]  hear the audio and see all the government documents and articles and i'll read over what
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.520]  jeffrey scott shapiro fox news said about the day he was on 9 11 this is his eyewitness account
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.680]  and he's just completely bought into the mass delusion as a reporter silverstein wanted to
[54:49.680 --> 54:57.120]  blow up building seven while it was on fire but silverstein has said they never wanted to blow
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.880]  up building seven they didn't blow up building seven that pull it meant that he had said get the
[55:02.880 --> 55:07.840]  firefighters out at 4 30 in the afternoon when the firefighters have been pulled out at around noon
[55:08.800 --> 55:14.720]  see everything he says is a lie but the fbi is not going to do anything the justice department's
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.040]  not going to do anything the pentagon's not going to do anything the local police aren't
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.960]  going to do anything and so of course the bankers are going to take all your pension funds of course
[55:22.960 --> 55:26.720]  they're going to double your local power bill of course they're going to take everything you got
[55:26.720 --> 55:32.560]  because they can blow kennedy's head off in front of everyone and have 50 something witnesses that
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.720]  saw the man behind the bushes shoot the gun and blow his head off and you know they tell you
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.440]  didn't see that so what they kill a few witnesses everybody shuts up doesn't matter if you've got
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.240]  people in the train control station 50 yards away that saw it all happen men get off a green pickup
[55:48.240 --> 55:53.040]  and shoot kennedy they just killed him he wouldn't change his story so they killed him they'll just
[55:53.040 --> 55:57.600]  kill whoever they want they'll kill a million iraqis they'll kill 3000 americans they'll take
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.800]  everything we've got they'll poison our water they're still they'll sterilize us through the vaccines
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.720]  it's real funny to these people they're killers you understand that
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.920]  kill us all and let god sort us out we're all weeds to the new world order there's six and a
[56:15.920 --> 56:19.680]  half billion of us and they want the world's resources and they don't need us anymore with
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.720]  robotics and technology and they made the decision 50 years ago to set up a total world government
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.880]  and just slaughter every stinking one of us and you're sitting there with your thumb crammed in
[56:28.880 --> 56:34.720]  your mouth sucking on it right now go and listen to this nut honey or your cop sitting in your car

[56:41.920 --> 56:46.560]  you're scared deep down deep down you know this is the truth deep down you remember hearing them
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.160]  on the radio and tv saying they were going to blow up seven and then saying they never blew it up
[56:50.160 --> 56:56.880]  up deep down you know the truth and so like cowards
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.520]  like cowards you're going to rationalize it look it doesn't matter though a lot of you
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.000]  were cowards support the system that's fine those of us that aren't cowards and understand we've
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.560]  got to save this species from your clutches are going to stand up and tell the truth to the end
[57:14.560 --> 57:22.480]  and just like the fbi until the 50s said the mafia didn't exist because they were paid off by them
[57:22.480 --> 57:27.440]  and said it was a conspiracy theory it's going to come out the environmentalists are a bunch of
[57:27.440 --> 57:38.400]  eugenics murdering criminals and it is coming out it's going to come out that the banks are
[57:38.400 --> 57:43.120]  engineering the collapse it now is coming out it's going to come out 9 11 was an inside job just
[57:43.120 --> 57:49.840]  like gulf of tonkin was an inside job every stinking bit of it is coming out and more is
[57:49.840 --> 57:55.120]  going to come out and i don't care if you kill me i don't care if you destroy my name i don't

[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:09.680]  them i just admire god's creation and i think about their grandparents and their ancestors and
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:14.160]  i i i want to protect the genetic information i want to protect them
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:21.520]  them and i understand that is maturity ladies and gentlemen that's what men are supposed to be like
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:29.840]  not a bunch of arrested development buck-toothed you know 40-year-old teenagers acting stupid
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:34.400]  giggling and gibbering and everything how many full-grown men and even positions of power have
[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:39.200]  i warned about things and they'll just laugh and gibber like monkeys or something
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:47.680]  and they've done that through archetypal model images where they always show the cool guy that
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:52.400]  gets the girls is a moron on the sitcom and then people act like morons and wonder why they don't
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:58.480]  have the women which is a fundamental first level for a male is to start your own hunt get your mate
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.680]  start having kids and that's just one level of programming they've got it all figured out and
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:11.520]  they're just screwing everybody over and i'm sick of it i can just see everything they're doing i
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:15.520]  know word for word what they're doing just by watching them and then years later i'll get a
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.880]  white paper they've written and it's as if i wrote it but but with their evil view that it's good
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:28.480]  i mean it's so frustrating to be completely in their brains completely i can step right into
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:36.880]  who they are and i can't stand it i want away from them you know they say that's the
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:43.920]  greatest military leaders are able to step into the enemy's mind and know their enemy
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.720]  and i really know the enemy and i and i learn more and more about them all the time that it's
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:53.680]  torture i'm not complaining i'm just warning people just once you really immerse yourself in
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:58.720]  this and then you know the enemy it is it is unspeakable and then you just want to warn people

[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:13.440]  and it was all over radio and tv and then they came out and said no we didn't blow up building seven
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:19.440]  seven and then larry silverstein went on pbs a year and a half after the event and said yes we
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:26.640]  did give the order to pull or demolish building seven then he got caught lying and saying well i
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:34.480]  meant getting firemen out but firemen had been out for five hours he said we gave the order to
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:41.120]  pull it and then watch the building come down and we have all these police videos all these
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:44.640]  interviews all these newscasts where they said they were going to bring down building seven
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:51.040]  then they changed the story and said no it's fallen on its own perfectly in its own footprint
[1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:57.280]  and then they did that early they screwed up in the internal press release that was put out to cnn
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:05.680]  and bbc and building seven was still standing for another hour after the cnn 25 minutes after bbc
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:12.400]  then you hear the explosions you see the blast the building falls there's police saying get back
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:16.720]  they're getting ready to bring down the building they're about to blow it up boom it blows up and
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:24.960]  falls and then they come out and tell the public that no we never said we were going to blow it
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:30.400]  up that's a conspiracy theory and then years later they come back out and say okay we were talking
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:36.800]  about blowing it up that day as if they could plant explosives in a building when it was on fire
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:46.640]  limited fires but there's so many facets to this so what i'm going to do now is
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:55.120]  go over the article that spurred me to cover this today because this is another mainstream admission
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:06.400]  by media that was there that day that yes indeed silverstein was calling the insurance company
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:15.840]  discussing the control demolition of building seven and it's just from another source there
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:22.480]  are hundreds of sources i have not just played the cnn and fox in local news clips of the firemen
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:25.360]  and police saying get back they said they're going to blow it up they're going to bring it down and
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:35.680]  those clips are coming up it is to know that these reporters and the police and the firemen
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:41.680]  who weren't part of this would willfully then be told a ridiculous cover story and then play
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:46.320]  along with it for the last eight years saying that no one ever talked about blowing it up or
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:52.560]  they didn't blow it up the official 911 commission report and the niss report is it fell from fire
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:12:01.600]  not hit by a plane small fires on three to four floors and they say it fell and they've given six
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:09.440]  different reasons and changed it each time for why it fell it had the cia fbi irs defense intelligence
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.360]  emergency management for the state the county and the city in that building they were running
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:22.080]  tripod to drill not in building seven that day they'd moved to mobile command post the night before
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:31.520]  and the deputy director of fema mr kennedy told abc news that morning well we arrived last night
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:36.400]  for a terror drill and then people said what what do you mean for a terror drill then he said oh
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.440]  i was mistaken and then it came out congressional testimony they were running tripod to
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:46.800]  of the towers being attacked so they moved out of seven because they were running a simulated attack
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:53.920]  on seven and then juliani that day admitted they were running drills then he said oh i never said
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:13:01.440]  that despite the fact we have cbs abc fox radio tv i mean just incredible amounts of interviews i
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:06.480]  think what is it seven different interviews he did that day saying yes luckily we were out of
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:10.560]  building seven because we were running a drill that day so so again they lie on every front
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:18.320]  that's a whole nother issue but i literally had flashbacks last night of all my research of all
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:23.600]  these video clips of of of the police officers we didn't just watch the videos of the cops saying
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:29.920]  get back they're blowing up building seven we then went out and found 911 truth went out and found
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:36.960]  police officers i've interviewed five of them who were there and heard the countdown or were told
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:41.280]  get back they were going to blow it up when you're in manhattan people walk up when you're holding
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:46.080]  up 911 truth signs business men and women firemen come over and patch on the back say we know the
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:50.000]  truth but we're too scared to speak up you know we heard them say they were going to blow it up
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:58.160]  i mean i was going to the pizza place at 4 30 in the afternoon i had been on genesis all day on
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:04.800]  other shows continued coverage back at the time eight and a half years ago and i heard abc news
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:12.800]  on the local news affiliate 590 the station we're on saying oh they're looking at demolishing building
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:18.720]  seven so it doesn't damage other buildings i mean you heard it you saw it how many videos and audio
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:24.240]  is there of this then it's a clear controlled demolition and silverstein comes out and says
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:32.160]  we didn't blow it up but previously said they did blow it up and then you get a fox news reporter
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:37.040]  going look i was there i was with the city officials i was with the power company and
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:43.200]  the port authority and yes silverstein called the insurance company and wanted to demolish it
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:48.880]  but uh we decided not to but then it just magically fell and they magically put a
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.880]  internal press release out that the building had already fallen because they had their coordination
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.080]  off an hour before it falls i mean we just absolutely open and shut this is like catching
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:05.040]  a serial killer in the act of chopping up a little girl and you go dig in their backyard and find 20
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:12.880]  bodies and then you find videotapes of them dismembering people i mean i mean it's absolutely
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:17.600]  open and shut and what does it say about the fbi what does it say about the defense department
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:23.600]  what does it say about the nypd what does it say about all of these people and how cowardly the
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:29.200]  average american is that these cops and firemen would know they blew up building seven and the
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:34.800]  majority of them have kept their mouth shut about it knowing it killed their colleagues in tower one
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:53.440]  and two i mean how mega evil is this how much worse can it get what are we expected to accept next
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:57.280]  and so when we wrote this big article for info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:03.040]  in the early morning hours i couldn't sleep after i read this i've been fully up since
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:09.200]  2 30 in the morning and i saw this i guess at about 10 at night fox news because it it literally
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:18.000]  cost flashbacks and an epiphany of of of further understanding that this is the system we live under
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:24.560]  this is the new world order control grid that they can steal our pension funds they can steal
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:29.360]  28 trillion the last year and a half they can lie about wmds they can launch new wars they can lie
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:40.000]  about the gulf of tonkin they can do whatever they want because the public will not face up to evil
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:46.560]  they are just ready to buy into any ashenine fraud and again just covering building seven which is
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:51.840]  the biggest smoking gun is only one of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of points that all
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:56.080]  prove this thing was a complete inside job from government documents where they were calling for
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:00.240]  staging attacks to blame it on foreign enemies where they did it in many cases declassified
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:08.800]  the hijackers trained at us military bases the list goes on and on and on
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:19.120]  there are just countless examples of this how the entire story is a fraud but what got me so upset
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:27.040]  was seeing another big high-powered reporter just weighed in to the psi op and just take part in this
[1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:35.600]  it's thoroughly disgusting this is jeffrey scott shapiro shame on jesse ventura the former
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:39.760]  minnesota governor has discredited himself and is honored and defamed his country
[1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:46.480]  our country is run by offshore banks you see always the terrorist always the bankers they always
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:52.720]  invoke oh you're not patriotic the former minnesota governor has discredited himself and is honored
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:57.360]  and defamed his country by promoting the mistaken view that our government was involved in september
[1:17:57.360 --> 1:18:01.680]  eleventh attacks jesse ventura should be ashamed of himself and embarrass no we should be proud of
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:08.000]  his courage the former minnesota governor recently lent his political credentials to the discredited
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:13.440]  nine eleven truth or movement by aligning and by alleging that the september eleventh attacks
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:19.680]  were either planned or permitted by the united states government during a march 10th interview
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:24.400]  with barbara walters on the view ventura implied that bush chaney administration used nine eleven
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:28.560]  as a pretext to start the iraq war under false pretenses well we know they used it for that
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:35.440]  we have the memos of rumsfeld five minutes after saying go major go massive say iraq did it i mean
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:42.720]  i mean ventura apparently developed the theory after former kennedy johnson advisor robert
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:47.360]  mcnamara visited him at harvard and allegedly admitted to him at the gulf of tonga incident
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.760]  which escalated the vietnam war never really happened that's been declassified for four years
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:58.560]  ventura was at harvard four and a half years ago when this got declassified so mcnamara admitted it
[1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:07.040]  it it isn't ventura alleges that mcnamara admitted this it's it was declassified
[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:13.840]  at that time when ventura was a professor at harvard a visiting professor a visiting scholar
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:24.320]  see how they work see i mean just everything's a lie oh ventura claims the gulf of tonga and
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:29.920]  was staged no ventura doesn't claim that what next you're gonna say that's a lie well you did
[1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:35.600]  basically perhaps what ventura is missing is there is probably more intercontrovertial evidence
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.920]  and more witnesses who have already established what happened on september 11 than most major
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:46.160]  historical events oh so he says we have the majority of paid-off media that agrees with us
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:53.040]  who dispute the conventional historical account is intellectually dishonest and nonsensical
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:58.960]  so he's saying ventura is dishonest this guy just implied gulf of tonga wasn't staged we'll be right
[1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:05.120]  back we all know that the burki water purification systems are the most trusted name of water

[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:18.240]  so jeffrey scott Shapiro continues then i'm gonna get into all the evidence the most important info
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:26.960]  is coming up he says that uh you cannot dispute the historical account it is intellectually
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:34.000]  dishonest and nonsensical and then his proof that it's dishonest is to confirm what we saw
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.600]  on television and heard on the radio and what the police were told we're not saying the police
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:46.000]  were involved they were told oh we're gonna blow it up we're gonna blow up building seven and then
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:52.160]  they deny they ever said this when it's on record that's coming up he says i know this because i was
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:58.000]  working as a journalist for garnet news at ground zero that day and i remember very clearly what i
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.960]  saw and heard and then what he saw and heard confirms what we're saying but they turn it around
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:09.680]  by the way i've confirmed from the transcript that uh two days ago limbaugh basically covered our
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:13.360]  and he's covered our present planet dot com articles before with credit he didn't give credit
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:18.880]  where we pointed out that they've killed the number one and two guys in al-qaeda five times each and
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:23.600]  never retracted the last time they supposedly killed him in iraq and limbaugh just said folks the
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:30.640]  media is lying to you why are they saying they've killed certain leaders in one case 14 times and
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:35.360]  they never retract the last time they said they killed them they do that to just practice the lie
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:41.600]  just test the media just train it it's kind of like fox news said uh monday as some have been
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:47.280]  laudan had a facebook account and then the next line said or someone posing as him and then they
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:52.560]  admitted it wasn't him they knew it wasn't him they usually say oh sama admits he did 9 11 look it was
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:58.000]  in an email oh look there's an audio tape that it turns out it's fake they do voice brand it's not
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.560]  him they just they just lie so so so here's this guy's evidence that we're making it up that they
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:09.840]  blew up building seven and his evidence is they had a big discussion in front of him about blowing it
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:21.520]  up that's like saying oh you're discredited no one saw men at the grassy knoll shooting at kennedy
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:28.720]  there were only 50 plus of them that said it you got all the witnesses going yeah there were men
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:32.960]  right there the motorcycle cop everybody said yeah but they were told to shut up and then oh uh
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.720]  our proof is that we saw i mean he's basically saying i saw the man at the grassy knoll shoot
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:46.400]  two that disproves it i mean this is the equivalent he says although i arrived at ground zero shortly
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:52.240]  after the 20 hours fell i was in the danger zone created by building seven oh he was in danger he had
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:57.600]  from the moment it collapsed in the afternoon and the event is one of the key cornerstones the 9 11
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:02.880]  conspiracy theory governor ventura and many 9 11 truthers alleged that government explosives
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:08.240]  caused the afternoon collapse of building seven this is false oh he's just says so i know this
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:13.360]  because i remember watching all 47 stories of building seven suddenly and silently crumbled
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:22.560]  before my eyes we've got all the police tapes videos you can hear and in fact i want watson he
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:26.720]  he only put two videos of that up i want to add a there's a bunch of audio tapes off the police
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:31.760]  radios and cbs radio and others where where people were saying boom boom and i've interviewed the
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:37.600]  witnesses they were like boom boom boom boom but these camera views are about 400 yards back and
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:47.680]  you hear them and then it's oh it's amazing but he says it was silent building seven silently fell
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:57.520]  it was silent he says this is false i know this because i remember watching all 47 stories
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:02.080]  of building seven suddenly and silently crumble before my eyes talk about somebody who's delusional
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:07.200]  shortly before the building collapsed several nypd officers and con edison that's the power
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.560]  company workers told me that larry silvestine the property developer of one world financial
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:17.200]  center was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they could authorize the
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:21.760]  controlled demolition of the building since its foundation was already unstable and expected to
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:26.560]  fall so there's the lie no modern steel building on it fallen from fire three do it that day
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:33.440]  building seven not hit by an aircraft so he just weaves this info in together here
[1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:40.160]  and just calmly slips in silvestine's on the phone as if they could go into a supposedly
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:46.800]  you know terminal building and wire it and then we have silvestine separately saying we went and
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:50.560]  wired it and blew it up and gave the order and watched it come down and then he said well that's
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:55.680]  not what i meant by that but here's another witness saying oh i talked to cops and and the
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:00.960]  and the power company that was based right there and everybody about bringing it down
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.480]  that's how he discredits us saying they were talking about blowing it up and clearly did
[1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:13.200]  is admitting it a controlled demolition would have minimized the damage caused by the building's
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:17.680]  imminent collapse which it fell perfectly in its own footprint a beautiful controlled demolition
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:23.440]  and potentially save lives to the same silvestine line why he says he did pull it many law enforcement
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:27.440]  personnel firefighters other journalists were aware of this possible option well yeah it was on the
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:32.720]  news but then you said we never heard that there was no secret there was no conspiracy because it
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:37.920]  was right out in the open but how do you wire a building and then why do you now lie and say it
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:43.200]  wasn't wired why does silvestine do that we'll come back finish up with this then get into our key
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:48.000]  article bombshell silvestine wanted to demolish building on 9 11 stay with us

[1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:24.000]  company the police knew that it was being discussed whether we should have a controlled demolition of
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:31.360]  building seven but it fell perfectly in its own footprint so we didn't need to not hit by an aircraft
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:45.680]  small fires in it and for pointing out the obvious he calls jesse ventura a intellectual fraud a a
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:51.920]  intellectually dishonest person no you're intellectually dishonest jeffrey scott shaperro
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:57.600]  and uh if you're a useful idiot you're one of the most gullible self-deluded people
[1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:04.800]  that ever run into and so you've got all these top police and firemen and military and fbi there
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:11.440]  and they blow up building seven and silverstein comes out and says they pulled it and then later
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:16.240]  they say no we never pulled it that's a conspiracy theory and then now they're saying how dare you
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:21.440]  ever question it when they admit it was being discussed whether or not to pull it i mean do you
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:27.920]  understand how fundamental this is now i want to play some video clips but first i'm going to read
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:35.920]  here on air paul joseph watson's article that we wrote together bombshell silverstein wanted to
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:44.480]  demolish building seven on 9 11 and the bombshell is here's another witness a senior fox news
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:53.520]  contributor and reporter who was there that day working for another media outlet confirming what
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:35:00.880]  we all heard and saw on tv and then don't forget one hour before cnn and bbc they've now admitted
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:05.040]  they wouldn't for three years admit i predicted it correctly because i looked at who feeds them
[1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:10.800]  roiders was told building seven had fallen in its own footprint for natural causes this is put out
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:15.680]  at the time that silverstein's running around telling the police oh we can wire that up in five
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:22.880]  minutes but i mean they they wire building sometimes for a month and a good percentage of the time the
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:27.280]  whole building doesn't collapse properly it's very hard to do but oh they were just going to wire it
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:34.480]  and you know just very quickly while four floors are on fire and no big deal they were just going
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:42.640]  to do this so you had to be pre-wired it's asinine to say they were looking at a controlled demolition
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:52.240]  if it wasn't preset and then you have them putting out the story it fell on its own
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:36:00.800]  before it fell and when we first found the bbc video on a major uh news archive site
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:07.760]  and blew the story wide open here it's covered my film terror storm the second edition
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:14.880]  it's chronicled in about 10 minutes of the two hour plus film in that section on government
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:19.360]  sponsored terror it's terror storm a history of government sponsored terror you should get that
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:24.080]  film at info wars dot com make copies give it to everyone you know because see they can't just kill
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.880]  ventura they can't just kill me they can't claim we committed suicide we're on record saying we're
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:33.280]  not because there's too many the number two person in the japanese government coming out
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:38.000]  and national news stories attacking him now the guy under the president the head of the diet
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:43.680]  their congress their speaker you've got the former german head of intelligence and the
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:47.920]  former head of their ministry of defense shang inside job you've got all these physicists
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:52.160]  and scientists and all these firefighters and police that have gone public and you can't get
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:56.640]  us all you kill one of us it'll only make our information more prominent that's what they
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:02.160]  can't stand that's why larry silverstein had thugs and it's covered in truth rising come up to
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.000]  luke radowski when they were having their weekly protest outside the new building seven and they
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.240]  said we're gonna say your backpacks a bomb your camera's a gun we know it isn't but we're gonna
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:14.480]  put you in prison for terrorism they call the uniform cops over and the cops go that's right
[1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:21.200]  this camera's a gun it's all on video they would frame someone on video and say they're framing
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:28.320]  you that's how corrupt his security goons are and believe me this mafia would just love the
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:33.760]  string luke up and they do call in death threat his family and his mother and him and other people
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:38.720]  just like they do me and they can't stand it they want their police state in that's why the adl
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:43.120]  and others are calling for patriots arrest and law enforcement action against us yesterday
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.040]  because they can't stand it they need to have it out in the open just like they tried to sell
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:51.520]  torture as a good thing they need to get you to accept it so it can be made legal and lawful
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:58.560]  all right let me just read the article here we're running out of time
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:04.080]  bombshell silverstein wanted to demolish building seven on 9 11 box news hit piece
[1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:10.000]  against 9 11 truth and jesse ventura inadvertently reveals a shocking truth
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:15.360]  for the umpteenth time but here it is again and it just brings back how ridiculous it is
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:22.400]  that this is out in the open wtc leaseholder was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:26.960]  they would authorize the controlled demolition of the building then they got the story ready to the
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:33.120]  media that it fell on its own preface from alex jones to truly grasp the magnitude of the story
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:38.320]  you really have to read the entire article immediately after the bullet controversy debunkers
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:42.240]  claim there was no plan to conduct a controlled demolition of the building and that's all over
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:46.720]  the news see they've always denied knowing it was on record they were talking about it they lied
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:51.520]  about that now the fact that officials were considering blowing up the building is established
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:56.240]  silverstein's consistent denial that this took place as a huge smoking gun how did silverstein
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:00.640]  expected to demolish the building safely when such a process takes weeks or even months to
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:06.320]  properly set up even without the additional chaos surrounding wtc 7 on 9 11 how could explosives
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:11.440]  have been correctly placed on such a short notice inside a burning building that had already been
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:16.240]  evacuated five hours before unless the explosives were already in place this new revelation is
[1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:20.400]  astounding and it needs to be investigated immediately and we could talk about how should
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:27.600]  this be investigated as fox news hit piece against jesse vinter in the 9 11 truth movement written
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:32.880]  by former washington dc professor jeffrey scott shapiro inadvertently reveals the shocking truth
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:37.120]  that world trade center leaseholder larry silverstein who collected nearly 500 million six
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:41.760]  billion total but 500 million on building seven in insurance as a result the collapse of building
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:46.800]  seven a 47 story structure that was not hit by a plane but collapsed within seven seconds at
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:52.720]  freefall speed on september 11th was on the phone to his insurance carrier attempting to convince
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:58.160]  them that the building should be brought down via controlled demolition and for six years of the
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:03.440]  eight and a half niss denied it fell at freefall but now with the recordings and the peer reviewed
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:09.840]  studies they said okay it did fall at freefall not pancaking it would it would all the math
[1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:15.840]  shows it would slow down and it fell perfectly the central column is blown it falls in writing
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:20.720]  for fox news jeffrey scott shapiro states i was working as a journalist for gannett news at round
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:25.040]  zero that day and i remember very clearly what we heard and he goes on to talk about nypd officers
[1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:30.560]  con Edison workers were talking about silverstein wanting to blow it up in february 2002 silverstein
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:36.880]  properties wanted 861 million from industrial risk insurers to rebuild on the side of wtc seven
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:42.320]  silverstein properties estimated investment the wtc was 386 million the building collapsed alone
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:47.040]  resulted in the payout of 500 million on that one building based on the contention that it was an
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:53.360]  unforeseen accident and then we have the report saying a controlled demolition would have minimized
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:41:00.560]  the damage caused by the building's imminent collapse is what shapiro said and potentially
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:04.320]  save lives many law enforcement and firefighters and their journalists were aware of the possible
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:07.920]  option this was no secret yet now they're not denying it was all over the news i mean they
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:13.280]  denied what was on the news for years this was no conspiracy right shapiro well because the cops
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:16.720]  weren't involved they had to give them a story oh we're gonna wire that up kind of like you make a
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:22.400]  hamburger takes five minutes or a ham sandwich however obviously aware of how it would impact
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:26.800]  his insurance claims silverstein has consistently denied that there was ever a plan to intentionally
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:30.960]  demolish building seven and the insurance companies don't they're owned by the big banks that
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:35.920]  involved in all this they go along they get big bailouts in june of 2005 silverstein told new
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:40.480]  york postjournalist sam smith that his famous bullet comment which has been cited as proof of
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:45.120]  silverstein plan to take down the building with explosives meant something else in january 2006
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:51.440]  silverstein spokesman darah mcquillan told the u.s senate department that the bullet comment
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:55.280]  meant to withdraw firefighters from the building despite the fact that there were no firefighters
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:42:00.880]  inside building seven as we shall cover later there was no mention whatsoever of any plan to
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:07.120]  demolish the building before it fell shaperos foxpaw was unwittingly let the cat out of the bag
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:10.960]  on the fact that silverstein was aggressively pushing for the building to be intentionally
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:17.040]  demolished a claim that he is always verificially denied presumably to safeguard against putting
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:22.160]  in doubt the massive insurance payout he received on the basis of the collapse was accidental and
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:27.600]  of course then every engineer or demolition expert would say how did you wire a burning building
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:36.240]  in a few minutes and do it so perfectly for over five years since the infamous pbs documentary
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:40.320]  was aired in which silverstein states that the decision was made to pull the building a construction
[1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:44.560]  term for controlled demolition debunkers have attempted to perform all kinds of mental gymnastics
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:50.240]  and fudging the meaning behind the wtc leaseholder comments i remember getting a call from the fire
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.000]  department commander this is a quote we're gonna play at the moment the video telling me that they
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:59.840]  were not sure that they were going to be able to contain the fire and i said we've had such a
[1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:03.680]  terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is just pull it and we made that decision to
[1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:09.040]  pull it and we watched the building collapse that's plain english made the decision to pull it and
[1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:13.280]  watched it collapse debunkers attempted to claim the silverstein meant to pull the firefighters
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:17.760]  from the building due to the danger of the structure was in and the explanation was also
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:22.000]  later claimed by silverstein spokesman however both fema report and the new york times even
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.960]  popular mechanics reported that there were no firefighters actions taken inside building seven
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:34.720]  let's go ahead and play silverstein now let's go ahead and play the audio and video of the
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:41.600]  text i just read to you here it is world trade center seven had always been considered the
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:48.320]  starting point for rebuilding located north of the slurry wall seven had been cleared
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:52.880]  faster than the rest of the site and there had been no bodies to recover
[1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:02.240]  pelted by debris when the north tower collapsed not true seven burned until late afternoon
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:09.040]  allowing occupants to evacuate to safety i remember getting a call from the uh fight upon
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:12.880]  a commander telling me that they were not sure they're going to be able to contain the fire
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:19.440]  as you know we've had such terrible loss of life maybe this one of those is pull it
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:25.040]  and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.960]  now what does pull it mean in the encyclopedia in demolition dictionaries it means to pull it
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:38.560]  with explosives or cables but to bring a building down in a controlled fashion now on that same pbs
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:47.360]  documentary they then cut to a month later demolishing building six and using the exact
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:51.760]  same term pull it in the same documentary as if it isn't clear enough what that means
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:56.560]  the makers of the film sure know because this is the next clip in the film here it is by mid
[1:44:56.560 --> 1:45:02.480]  december the department of design and construction had leveled world trade center buildings four
[1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:10.080]  and five hello oh we're getting ready to pull building six
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:17.920]  we have to be very careful how we demolish building six we're worried about the building
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:22.800]  six coming down and then damaging the slurry wall so we wanted that particular building
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:27.600]  to fall within a certain area there's a certain excitement in the air bringing the last structure
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:39.200]  down at the world trade center okay so over and over again they're talking about controlled
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:45.760]  demolition using the term pull it but they said we never you didn't hear that on the news that
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:50.320]  that's been the newspapers i'm a liar and i go but here's the cnn clip here's the fox clip here's the
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.360]  local cbs clip here's the local uh democracy now clip when she just had a local show you know
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:45:58.720]  we went and interviewed the police and said well what did you hear there was a countdown they said
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:03.360]  they were going to blow it up they said get back and they said you crazy conspiracy theorist that's
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.880]  not what those cops meant and firefighters on tape from the other towers going there was molten metal
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:15.520]  jet fuel couldn't do that it was like a foundry it was like lava something's going on you know
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.360]  jet fuel doesn't do this those fires are almost down we have the firefighter tapes they didn't
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:23.600]  release for two years where they're going the fires are almost down people are in buildings
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:28.480]  waving suddenly those columns shatter the buildings are turned into ash into powder
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:33.200]  blown from top down building seven blown from the bottom the classical control control demolition
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:41.360]  now let's go ahead and play clip three this is one of many from cnn and other channels
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:45.040]  where the police are saying get back get back they're going to bring it down they're going to
[1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:59.600]  blow it up here's that clip back it up back it up you hear those explosions
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:09.600]  and then it goes down okay then this was reared on cnn play it again listen to this and then
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:18.160]  it and then the cops are talking listen
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:30.720]  we are looking back
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:43.600]  just in the last few seconds another building so uh fox news says the building
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:48.560]  silently fell but we have clip after clip in fact well i want watson is listening now there's
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:54.400]  even better clips off the radio and tv and there's uh let's add to the video the clip of
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:01.360]  the head of democracy now amy goodman with the cops saying get back and she starts running you
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:05.200]  hear the blast let's let's add all that to and we have time later in the last hour i'll play that
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:10.400]  let's go to another clip now here's dan rather talking about how it looks like a controlled
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:16.720]  demolition here's dan rather now here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:19.680]  describe that you want to go to videotape the collapse of this building
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:33.520]  it's amazing amazing incredible picture word for the third time today
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:39.440]  reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much in television before when a building was
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:47.040]  deliberately destroyed destroyed by will place dynamite to knock it down now last friday willy
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:51.760]  nelson was on with larry king and he said well i question 9-11 because building seven wasn't hit
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:59.120]  by a plane and fell and king goes no they were all hit by planes just end of story no no it was
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:06.160]  hit by a plane no it wasn't they admit it wasn't now let's play a another clip here this is bbc
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:12.800]  reporting building seven collapse 20 plus minutes before it fell and then for two weeks bbc denied
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:18.480]  this was real video and said that we were faking it then years later they said no roiders gave it to
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:24.800]  us it's true and and and for that two-year period they said they lost their archive tapes and that
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:32.640]  we were liars and then oh wait it is jane graham it is our reporter and oh it was on another bbc
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:38.080]  channel and it was on cnn so they put the story out in fallen of natural causes on its own in its
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:42.240]  own footprint and right behind her through the window is building seven here it is
[1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:53.120]  now more on the latest building collapse in new york you might have heard a few moments ago was
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:57.840]  talking about the salomon brothers building collapsing and indeed it has apparently that's
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:03.760]  only a few hundred yards away from where the world trade center towers were and it seems that this was
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:10.080]  not a result of a new attack it was because the building had been weakened during this morning's
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:15.200]  attacks we'll probably find out more now about that from our correspondent jane stanley jane what
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:21.680]  more can you tell us about the salomon brothers building and its collapse well only really watch
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:27.760]  you already know details are very very sketchy there's almost a sense down town in new york
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:33.520]  behind me down by the world trade centers of just an area completely closed off as the rescue
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:39.760]  workers try to do their job but this isn't the first building that has suffered as a result
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.760]  back up about 10 seconds when we come back after this quick break i'm gonna finish the clip
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:50.720]  and then we have erin brown 40 minutes before this saying it had fallen reading a script and he looks
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:57.040]  behind him because he's from new york and it's going it's right there see all scripted we'll be

[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:12.960]  beginning that it was all over the news they were going to blow up seven then they demolished it and
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:17.200]  then said we never said that and then silverstein came out and said no we did have a controlled
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:24.000]  demolition then he said oh i didn't mean that and now the media just shift gears again and said okay
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.240]  we were talking about blowing it up it would have been easy to wire it up but we didn't it magically
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:33.600]  fell on its own when every independent demolition expert that looks at it on record says my god
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:38.480]  that's a beautiful controlled demolition only you know top experts can do that only a handful of
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:44.080]  companies they try to blow up the intel building here in austin that they built the skeleton up
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:50.240]  but then intel pulled out of austin when they blew it up a few years ago it failed a top firm it
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:59.360]  failed what was that building 15 stories they couldn't even blow it up continuing let's go back to bbc
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:07.760]  reporting building seven has fallen the exact way it did fall with the whole script before it fell
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:15.520]  and then when we are changed england confronted the bbc reporter that's talking to
[1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:20.800]  uh jane stanley i said jane grams we had her on earlier in the week uh he said i don't remember
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:27.040]  that i i i i was taking my son to football that day i didn't i i wasn't at work on 9 11 and they
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:33.920]  said excuse me and and then he got real slick and went oh okay i was there clear operative i mean
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:38.640]  most these guys big national level or intelligence ops and he suddenly looks at the crowd and goes
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:44.160]  it is quite curious isn't it you little people he didn't have that last part it is quite curious
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:49.600]  actually i was reporting that day all day now i remember thank you for reminding me
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:57.600]  hmm i mean you know it it is so sick because all that matters is his house his family his money
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:04.560]  and and it's a bunch of political prostitutes let's finish the clip what more can you tell us about
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:11.040]  the salomon brother's building and its collapse well only really what you already know details
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:17.120]  are very very sketchy there's almost a sense downtown in new york behind me down by the
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:24.320]  world trade centers of just an area completely closed off as the rescue workers bb bbc the
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:30.720]  reason i knew it was a transcript is bbc 24 this is bbc world almost had the exact same words and
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:36.080]  so did cnn see they were all given a script and it was confirmed Reuters internal news feed
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:43.280]  feed right through the pentagon to them see i'm not a genius folks but i work in the media
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:49.280]  and i knew it was the same script same time this was scripted they were given this info
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:53.040]  they screwed up they said get the press release ready we're getting ready to blow this thing
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:56.400]  tell them it fell on its own we're going with a new plan we're not saying we're blowing it
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:57:01.360]  that's too suspicious you know no one can wire building you know in a few minutes they'll catch
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:06.320]  us we're just gonna say it fell on its own we're going with that we're going with that and then
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:12.240]  they got to release out watch you don't it's so incredible i can just go into their minds let's
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:17.440]  let's finish the clip down by the world trade centers of just an area completely closed off
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:24.000]  as the rescue workers try to do their job but this isn't the first building that um has suffered as
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:30.240]  a result we know that part of the marriott hotel next to the world trade center also collapsed as
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:37.600]  a result of this huge amount of falling debris from 110 floors of two the two twin towers of the
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:44.080]  world trade center as you can see behind me the trade center appears to be still burning we see
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:50.880]  these huge clouds of smoke and there's seven we know that behind that there's an empty piece of
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:58.080]  what was a very familiar new york skyline there's the building of the financial prosperity and the
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:05.600]  dis info ops came out and said we lied that wasn't real video and said that seven had fallen in the
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:10.640]  video but now because we've proven it to the public they're going okay we were talking about
[1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:16.480]  blowing it up nothing to see here these aren't the droids you're looking for move along move along
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:25.200]  little jedi mind trick on the public okay so we have another reporter from fox news saying yeah
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:30.960]  we were there they were talking about blowing it up what's the big deal but we didn't blow it up
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:37.280]  and silverstein never said they were gonna blow it up i mean think about this we'll be right back

[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:35.200]  own capital another staged event you can pull up his quotes i've read many of the papers he wrote
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:42.000]  he gave speeches saying you know to his propaganda corps lies don't have to be good they have to
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:48.560]  speak to people's laziness and their fear and so make it simple and so that's what they do i mean
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:53.520]  they they blow the building up in front of you they've got different stories going first they were
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:01:04.080]  going to announce it then they weren't and this article by watson great job by paul watson goes on
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:09.600]  and on and on through all the other eyewitnesses and greg bartmer and police officers and people
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:13.840]  you know not just the videos from cnn cops saying they're bringing it down get back at that building
[2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:21.520]  is about to blow up boom boom boom it falls but just all these other witnesses and all the other
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:29.520]  facets and the points we're not safe as a society unless we start facing up to evil but but people
[2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:34.880]  think if they play the mind game the middle mind game of denying something's going on
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:43.120]  it makes it go away it doesn't make it go away it only gets worse and now you've got limbaugh
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:47.680]  and michael savage and others coming out and saying especially savage that he believes obama's
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:51.200]  going to stage terror attacks to blame it on us and clinton's out there saying there's about to be
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:55.920]  bombings it's going to be your fault you better shut up and do what we say and the adl saying arrest
[2:01:55.920 --> 2:02:01.680]  people that criticize obama care basically and the rhetoric's really getting bad well yeah
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:06.160]  i mean of course the government in oklahoma city that evidence is even more voluminous in 911
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:14.160]  absolutely red-handed on every front but but the bill politicians come and go bill clinton
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:19.600]  george bush all these people when you understand the military mind you understand the pentagon
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:26.160]  mind 99.99% of them aren't involved in these things but over and over again the pentagon
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:30.800]  stages terror attacks even on their own forces that's in north woods to kill our own troops
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:36.400]  to get them angry at a foreign enemy but it's even worse than that it is stated
[2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:44.480]  west point and army war college doctrine of collateral damage and acceptable losses it
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:54.000]  goes back to chess invented in persia 4 000 years ago you sacrifice a pawn it's called a gambit
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:03:02.800]  and it's taught 101 in field officer captain and above that hey you got a thousand people
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:07.440]  under you you know you're a colonel you're taking orders from a general don't tell your men this
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:11.440]  but go ahead and send 10 or 15 of them into an area knowing they're going to get killed
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.640]  but it'll draw out the enemy and then you'll be able to kill the enemy and save more of your force
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:21.440]  because if you send your whole force in you'll end up losing 10 20 30 times potentially
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:28.560]  what you'll lose if you just sacrifice 10 men and once you buy into that america's got to get
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:33.040]  tough it's not going to fight the islam threat unless we do this that's why we're doing this
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:40.160]  that's the argument that's what they say in north woods well our country won't face the
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:44.880]  communist threat and we need to do it so we're going to stage terror attacks bomb dc bomb miami
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:49.280]  kill us troops at bases and blame it on the commies we're going to have nuclear war with them
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:56.400]  and kennedy said no i'm firing l.l. linman sir and kurtis lemay and all the rest of you and they
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:04:02.960]  said no we're firing you dead and then it was declassified two months ago by the state department
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:08.240]  this is mainstream news that bobby kennedy disagreed with his brother and that he was four
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:12.000]  staging events but he wanted to do it in latin america
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:24.880]  i mean that's how standard this is 2004 that declassified the manual being used up until this date
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:30.640]  but we don't know past this date past 2004 but it was the current manual
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:34.240]  where they teach army captains in black ops you can go read it how to stage false flags
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:39.760]  you're outnumbered by a force in a guerrilla situation the stage of false flag against the
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:44.400]  people you're trying to protect to motivate them to get behind what you're doing for the greater
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:52.560]  good that's how we win yeah that's how you win isn't it with that pawn sacrifice three thousand
[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:58.800]  people that's what peenak and separately was the big presence he said three thousand dead to launch

[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:33.840]  2.6 billion in new taxes over the next three years to be paid into the large banks just where i live
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:40.240]  we're going to get into the cnn calling for one child policy it says don't be so keen on having
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:44.560]  babies how about adopting a child instead or implementing a one child policy we're going to
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:50.240]  be talking about that and the financial looting legislation that supposedly is going to get the
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:55.600]  big banks believe in the texas banking association saying it's a fraud takeover and another bailout
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:09:01.200]  to the big central banks that's coming up now i spent the last hour on fox news admitting
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:06.560]  that the government larry silverstein were looking at the controlled demolition of building seven
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:10.240]  and and they're now admitting that they were considering blowing it up that's that's another
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:15.440]  big admission the article's bombshell silverstein wanted to demolish building seven on nine eleven
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.080]  and the fox news article is called shame on jesse ventura and that's where they admit it
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:24.960]  that their reporter was there and oh it's no big deal that we were going to blow it up uh so all
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:29.200]  these years later all the video a cop saying get back the government's going to blow it up
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:34.480]  they ignored all that here's another admission it is a big deal all right shifting gears for the
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:40.160]  balance of the hour we really appreciate his time he's one of the most prestigious authors and
[2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:46.880]  lecturers and a newsletter writers from newsmax out there dr rustle blalock is a prestigious
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:55.840]  brain surgeon and uh expert on the brain and uh rustle blalock md.com is one of the websites
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:01.200]  you can visit he's a board certified neurosurgeon author and lecturer he attended lsu school of
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:06.080]  medicine in new orleans and completed his general surgical internship at neurosurgical residency
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:10.320]  at the medical university of south carolina and charleston during his residency he ran the
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:15.040]  neurology program for one year and did a fellowship in neurosurgery after his residency for the past
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:19.760]  25 plus years he's participated in neurosurgery in addition to having a nutritional practice he
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:24.000]  recently retired from both practices to devote full time to nutritional studies and research
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:30.000]  during his residency trained training he worked with the eminent neurosurgeon dr ludwig kimpey
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:37.600]  together that developed the trans uh it's all scientific terms removal of intervascular tumors
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:42.800]  which is uh one of the most widely used systems today he has presented their cases utilizing
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:47.840]  the technique to the congress of neurological surgeons look it's a long bio multi pages i'm
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:52.480]  i'm going to stop right there uh and of course we've had many other medical doctors and brain
[2:10:52.480 --> 2:10:59.280]  surgeons and uh endocrinologist and and just on backing up what he's saying but he has all the
[2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:04.720]  studies this stuff is not secret uh and uh we're going to be discussing it with him today but he
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:09.680]  was very critical of the h1n1 he pointed out that it popped up in the wrong hemisphere
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:13.520]  wrong time of year many other scientists a virologist said it was engineered in the lab
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:20.000]  we know that uh other big companies with the bird flu killed a bunch of people that was the
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:26.640]  london telegraph in fact google homeless die and bird flu vaccine trial that got covered up uh and
[2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:31.840]  then it what three months ago we had wolf gang woodrig a medical doctor from germany on who ran
[2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:41.360]  the eu 47 nation board uh so i'm just prefacing this before we go to him 47 nation board that
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:47.760]  that found that the un and others were paid off by big pharma to lie and create this hoax and
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:53.280]  now we have all this mainstream news new canadian study suggests seasonal flu shot increased h1n1
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:12:02.880]  risk here's another one who admits that they exaggerated the dangers of h1n1 times of india
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:07.760]  here's another one seasonal flu shot may increase h1n1 western australian reports of
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:13.840]  adverse reactions to seasonal flu and h1n1 millions of h1n1 vaccine have been recalled
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:19.360]  washington post so again dr blaylock and others got attacked by the mainstream media for even
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:24.240]  questioning this well here they are vindicated yet again so we're going to talk about the flu
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:29.200]  in hindsight and then other toxins in our food and water dr blaylock thanks for joining us thank
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:35.520]  you alec good to have you here well you've got the floor let's talk about vaccines mercury uh
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:41.040]  your the studies that you've looked at about the increases of Alzheimer's brain damage uh
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:47.200]  explain what's really going on here well you know i think uh just a brief review of of this
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:53.360]  whole fiasco of h1n1 is very telling and we need to remember this next year because this is going
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:59.040]  to be revisited uh we're going to go through the same thing all over again and remember the major
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:06.800]  government organization cdc uh the institute value infection diseases national institutes of
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:11.840]  health all of them were just sending the same message out that this is going to be a killer virus
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:17.760]  it's going to target pregnant women it's going to target young people it's going to be the most
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:23.760]  devastating thing we've ever seen uh world health organization of course started just nonsense
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:30.960]  yet when you actually got into the journals that the real high tech journals that were discussing
[2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:36.880]  this it didn't match what the government was saying and we talked about our government as well as
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:44.480]  the the international body that the un world health organization uh what the science was
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:50.960]  actually saying is that this virus is difficult to transmit uh more difficult than the seasonal
[2:13:50.960 --> 2:13:58.560]  flu that it is not that pathogenic and they didn't expect it to cause uh that much death
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:06.800]  all of this science reported in the best of the science journal was ignored uh even the cdc
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:14.000]  would secretly secretly doing studies which found that this virus is very difficult to transmit
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:20.080]  yet when you turned on your television here's the news media saying oh this is so easy to transmit
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:26.480]  it's just going to spread all over the world we're expecting the icu intensive care units
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:31.840]  to be overwhelmed uh we're not going to have enough respirators for all the people that's going to
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:38.320]  need them uh young women are going to die that are pregnant in mass numbers they were putting out
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:46.960]  figures of uh 90 000 expected to die on and on and on yet the science the whole time was saying
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:55.040]  none of that's true uh when you actually got on the cdc site you found out well uh your whole
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:15:02.400]  basis uh for this mass vaccination and threat of force vaccination has no foundation whatsoever
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:10.640]  from your own data when it soon uh became obvious uh that uh the number of uh infection
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:17.600]  based one and one was nowhere near uh what the government was saying and at the death rate was
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:25.760]  far less than 101 percent so that meant your your chances of uh being seriously ill or dying from
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:36.880]  this flu uh was less than 99.9 percent uh so uh it was less dangerous than the regular seasonal
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:44.320]  flu uh and then when the actual flu came through its first big wave that's exactly what we saw the
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:53.040]  death rate for the entire world was astronomically low incredibly low uh well then their next uh
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:16:00.080]  method of scaring the public was oh we're watching a southern hemisphere we're expecting millions to
[2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:07.040]  die well the flu went through uh the southern hemisphere in both of its ways it had one of
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:13.680]  the lowest death rates of any flu season that's ever been recorded and that includes young children
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:21.040]  that includes uh pregnant women that includes young all the so-called targeted uh eight groups and
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:26.240]  then i started to looking at the new england journal of medicine which was doing the largest
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:31.520]  studies on the flu in the southern and northern hemisphere and ironically they left out one of
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:37.440]  the most important factors in the people that were dying and asked that they were obese and that
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:43.280]  they were smoking well they did mention the obese connection but it would never enter the
[2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:49.920]  beta uh that well doctor most of the deaths we saw were people who were 75 years old had
[2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:55.360]  double the amputations from diabetes had lung problems and then i would see a month later
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:17:01.120]  that oh this fella in austin really didn't die it was a false positive h1n1 uh they died of
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:06.640]  complications from something else so there was also lots of hyping people who hadn't died from it
[2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:11.680]  well everything they said about it ended up alive in other words they were saying well the people
[2:17:11.680 --> 2:17:17.200]  were dying from bacterial pneumonia after they got the flu and that it was pneumococcal pneumonia
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:23.040]  therefore they need a pneumococcal vaccine as well well when you look at the autopsy report
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:28.240]  it said well most of the pneumonias were not pneumococcal and there was no vaccine to protect
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:35.040]  anybody from and that as you said most of these people had serious illnesses diabetes or auto
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:42.080]  immune diseases uh immune deficiency diseases uh cancers so even in the children that were dying
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:48.000]  they were sick children they were not normal healthy children but if they could find a so-called
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:54.080]  healthy person that that died from it or became seriously ill that's the one they plastered all
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:18:00.080]  over the news so they would tell the public oh you're a healthy teenager is that horrendous risk
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:06.560]  look here's a case they had to search high and low to find the case most of the cases were from sick
[2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:12.320]  children well it's even worse than that all the sick children and sick adults you had very few
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:19.760]  cases of anyone else dying from this flu uh it was all concocted from A to Z and it and this is what
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:27.200]  so upsetting about uh the government the government knew all of this they had access to the same
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:35.600]  information i did uh so they knew from the very beginning and all throughout that this was a lie
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:43.360]  this was all nothing but a concocted epidemic to sell vaccines and to do damage to large numbers
[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:48.640]  of people in this country now you remember when i first talked to you about this when all this
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:54.800]  started i said irion beret is going to be a big danger uh of this vaccine particularly in the
[2:18:54.800 --> 2:19:00.720]  countries where they're using uh the ms-59 azure well let me interrupt you let me interrupt you
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:06.720]  doctor i know a whole bunch of people talk show hosts that are 42 years old you name it that went
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:12.160]  and got the shot and their hands and feet are still numb and they got gion beret and i know people
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:17.520]  that are in the hospital dying right now i know a whole bunch of people in austin that took it and
[2:19:17.520 --> 2:19:24.400]  are in deep trouble well my point being is when they first started this they said oh we're carefully
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:31.120]  tracking gillion beret because the risk factors have you heard any major network to a follow-up
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:37.120]  no seen in any newspaper a follow-up of what they found but what you're saying exactly true
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:42.960]  because i get emails from all over the world and all over the country of people telling me this
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:48.400]  same story in fact one uh uh person doc stay there doc sorry to interrupt we got a break come back
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:53.680]  and tell us that story on the other side i've got a list of questions for you you know what was really

[2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:21.760]  you were trying to finish up a story about the report you're getting but i mean i have family
[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:27.680]  friends my dad has scores of patients that he knows that have gone to the hospital many of them
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:32.080]  have recovered thank god and the doctors are even telling them and i've seen this a few places in the
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:36.880]  news but it's not a big news story like you were saying that yes you have gion beret and we believe
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:42.800]  the vaccine caused it in fact talking to dale dudley who has the number one talk show in the
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:49.760]  morning on 93.7 it's the sister station to 590 our local affiliate the am i mean he has
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:54.320]  numb fingers and numb toes and he went to the doctor and they said the vaccine did this to you
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:25:01.360]  but that was the seasonal shot he took go ahead uh right you know i i got an email from a man who
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:10.800]  said uh he felt so bad because he had uh encouraged his father to get the h1n1 vaccine and he got it
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:17.280]  and his father ended up with the vir case the good young beret ended up on a respirator for three months
[2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:24.080]  and it just uh gotten out of the hospital he felt fairly weak uh while they were in the hospital
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:32.160]  they uh saw a 10 year old child who ended up with gion beret ended up on a respirator for over a month
[2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:41.520]  and is still on the respirator uh i've gotten over uh a list of 200 women who lost their babies uh
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:48.880]  because they believe the government hyped that women needed to get the h1n1 vaccine during pregnancy
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:56.960]  and i warned people of that uh that you would have a tremendous number of uh spontaneous abortion
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:04.640]  uh and the big risk the really big thing is to show that if you over-stimulate immunity during
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:11.840]  mid-pregnancy you increase the incidence of schizophrenia and autism uh as much as 10 fold
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:18.560]  so we still have to wait and see what is going to be the full impact of this because it's going to
[2:26:18.560 --> 2:26:26.720]  take a good 10 years before we know uh just how many people's babies have been ruined uh by this
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:31.520]  vaccine this isn't like that tranquilizer in the 40s and 50s where they came out deformed
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:35.840]  and you saw it right away but but again you're a medical doctor brain surgeon but let's talk about
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:43.280]  why this does uh that to the brain but i remember just reading in the inserts of vaccines period
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:48.160]  they had always said don't give them to pregnant women and now sickeningly they were on the news
[2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:55.040]  saying pregnant women particularly need this i mean this is diabolical well they were doing that
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:02.320]  at the time there was convincing evidence from our research in neuroscience that if you stimulate
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:10.560]  the immune system of a pregnant woman mid-term uh you know in mid-pregnancy uh you produce this
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:18.240]  high incidence of autism and schizophrenia well uh i don't think i would trade having my child
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:25.040]  have autism or schizophrenia but this false idea that they were going to protect him during pregnancy
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:30.080]  because there's no evidence the vaccine had any protection whatsoever of anybody but what about
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:34.240]  the autoimmune response what about the autoimmune response from the medical stuff i read correct
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:39.760]  me if i'm wrong the the miscarriages though uh throughout the pregnancy the body gets overstimulated
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:48.400]  and then sees the fetus as an outsider yeah you know that's that's part of it it uh interferes uh
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:56.720]  during the baby's development uh with the placenta so that the the oxygen and blood supply of the baby
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:04.000]  is damaged and you have a spontaneous abortion and this was occurring in women who uh were almost
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:11.280]  near term uh so here they were almost ready to have their baby and they lost it uh well if you
[2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:18.640]  look at the the scientific literature you're not surprised by that uh but the media played a big role
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:27.760]  in getting these women to go take this ridiculous vaccine uh and uh you know as i say that they're
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:35.200]  just compelling research that if you vaccinate with these powerful vaccines because they contain
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:42.720]  aluminum or mercury uh it produces abnormal development of the brain and produces long-term
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:49.040]  changes in the brain that makes that child at high risk of neurodegenerative diseases like
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:54.880]  Parkinson's and Alzheimer's for the rest of their life uh they become hypersensitive to
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:29:02.000]  environmental toxins like pesticides and herbicides for the rest of their life uh this has been shown
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:08.160]  repeatedly in the laboratory yet here we have a government policy because of payoffs
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:15.360]  from big pharma uh pharmaceutical companies uh and government agencies that are pushing this agenda
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:22.240]  they're totally ignoring this research and nobody's refuted it nobody's come back and said well that's
[2:29:22.240 --> 2:29:28.480]  not true because it is true it's very well accepted in the neuroscience literature uh and
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:33.360]  these are the type of things to concern and the other thing to concern about Dr. Blalock got a
