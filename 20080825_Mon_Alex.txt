[00:00.000 --> 00:14.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.180 --> 00:24.300]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones all right folks it is the 25th
[00:24.300 --> 00:33.960]  day of August Monday 2008 it is DNC time it has kicked off Alex Jones is going to be live reporting
[00:33.960 --> 00:39.840]  breaking in with all the hot news you can see live streams over info wars dot com that should be
[00:39.840 --> 00:44.720]  starting in about half hour 45 minutes if it's not already up we got a jam-packed show for you
[00:44.720 --> 00:50.520]  otherwise we have Alan Watt at 1130 we have Marty the soap man shactor very a lively character at
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.540]  1230 Bob Chapman will be joining us and of course in the final hour we're going to have Kevin Ryan
[00:55.540 --> 01:02.980]  to discuss the new NIST World Trade Center 7 report now before we get into that over the weekend it
[01:02.980 --> 01:09.860]  was announced that Joseph Biden Joey B as I like to call him has been tapped to be the vice
[01:09.860 --> 01:17.060]  presidential nominee now Joey B is a longtime company man he was recently named in a Bush
[01:17.060 --> 01:22.060]  administration scandal where they're like hey you know maybe maybe there'll be some good words in
[01:22.060 --> 01:26.220]  it from you for from Joseph Biden I think it on Kurdistan or something like that I forget the
[01:26.220 --> 01:32.780]  nation but Aaron posted a story about it before he left but what I don't like about Joe Biden is
[01:32.780 --> 01:38.220]  is he obviously knows about global government aka the new world order although it's in different
[01:38.220 --> 01:43.780]  forms he actually wrote an article back in 1992 for the Wall Street Journal you got to remember
[01:43.780 --> 01:48.500]  this guy is a CFR guy that's counsel on foreign relations doesn't hide it anyway he writes this
[01:48.500 --> 01:55.420]  article called how I learned to love the new world order and Joey B has been trying to be
[01:55.420 --> 02:00.500]  president for quite some time now I believe he was in the 2004 and 2008 Democratic debates for
[02:00.500 --> 02:07.540]  that nomination failing both times he's also very aware of RFID technology when Roberts was
[02:07.540 --> 02:13.620]  going to be named to the Supreme Court and they were having hearings for that he asked him he said
[02:13.620 --> 02:18.340]  look it's going to be decided on in your lifetime on what are you going to do when the government
[02:18.340 --> 02:22.980]  says it wants to chip the US population of course Roberts said he would be against such a thing
[02:24.180 --> 02:29.820]  but just that he's aware of that shows you that he is a cunning politician now I have a movie
[02:29.820 --> 02:34.460]  coming out called fabled enemies that deals with the international intelligence ring that helped
[02:34.460 --> 02:40.380]  carry this out showing the different roles of different nations and Pakistan's role was to be
[02:40.380 --> 02:46.460]  set up as the funding arm the covert funding arm of the hijackers so we could later blackmail them
[02:46.460 --> 02:52.780]  into using their nation as a launching base for the occupation of Afghanistan yes we did mass
[02:52.780 --> 02:56.980]  troops in all these other areas before that but Pakistan was another strategic point where we
[02:56.980 --> 03:04.060]  wanted to use and we did and Joseph Biden got on the floor on the 12th and started saying all
[03:04.060 --> 03:09.700]  these awful things about Pakistan they pretend to be our friend they're not our buddies we're
[03:09.700 --> 03:15.380]  going to have to deal with them blah blah blah then Colin Powell gets up he says well we'll see
[03:15.380 --> 03:19.820]  what Pakistan can do to help us and then of course they give into our demands as they are a puppet
[03:19.820 --> 03:26.300]  establishment now another interesting fact is that Joseph Biden is meeting with this guy who is
[03:26.300 --> 03:32.140]  covertly funding Muhammad and others from the Pakistani ISI the inter-services intelligence
[03:32.140 --> 03:38.300]  organization over in Pakistan basically their CIA set up in the 80s by our CIA it is just another
[03:38.300 --> 03:44.300]  arm of again this international intelligence monopoly now a mood of med is in DC the week before
[03:44.300 --> 03:50.780]  9-11 meet with Joey B meeting with George tenant meeting with Porter goss and Bob Graham on the
[03:50.780 --> 03:55.180]  morning of 9-11 having breakfast with them and those are the two guys that head up the initial
[03:55.180 --> 04:01.820]  congressional investigation into 9-11 where 27 pages are redacted concerning the foreign
[04:01.820 --> 04:08.180]  governments that's foreign government involvement in 9-11 and we go over that also in fabled
[04:08.180 --> 04:13.980]  enemies now we have a new teaser out I launched on Saturday evening after Joey B was named as the
[04:13.980 --> 04:19.980]  Democratic nominee and he plays a vital role in the sea he admitted to knowing that the ISI was
[04:19.980 --> 04:28.460]  funding the Taliban al-Qaeda and he later says that that information is classified now once again
[04:28.460 --> 04:35.020]  we'll be playing this in the next segment but is it important to note because he's just another
[04:35.020 --> 04:40.780]  cover-up artist he's another globalist he's another person on the payroll I guess he's
[04:40.780 --> 04:45.740]  bringing supposed what is it called credibility and experience the Obama campaign give me a break
[04:45.740 --> 05:08.700]  just another globalist folks the Alex Jones show info wars.com prison planet.com you like being a
[05:08.700 --> 05:12.100]  puppet sir you like being a puppet from the new world order I'll do the American people know
[05:12.100 --> 05:17.540]  that 9-11 was a stage was engineered by you David Rockefeller the fallout or commission to see
[05:17.540 --> 05:25.540]  it. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to
[05:25.540 --> 05:31.900]  grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11 a global awakening has taken place.
[05:31.900 --> 05:42.260]  An inside job. How dare you. If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable

[07:58.140 --> 08:06.980]  Ease the T-Rex in political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:06.980 --> 08:16.340]  All right folks, I'm Jason Bermas. I'll be sitting in through Thursday and Alex is going to be with
[08:16.340 --> 08:21.700]  us in just a few moments calling in live from the DNC. Remember we are broadcasting live from
[08:21.700 --> 08:29.140]  the DNC over at infowars.com via Justin.tv. Nice little service there. Before I go to this fabled
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.900]  enemies teaser, Infowars just posted an article called Joe Biden's New World Order Speech. You
[08:34.900 --> 08:40.740]  see he doesn't just write about it, he likes to talk about it. In his speech on the threshold of a
[08:40.740 --> 08:46.420]  New World Order, this is his speech, a rebirth for the United Nations. He's not a lot like world
[08:46.420 --> 08:51.620]  government to me, maybe I'm the kook. Biden called for meddling in the former Soviet Union in China
[08:51.620 --> 08:56.500]  and posing a free economy on these countries, i.e. allowing the international bankers to freely
[08:56.500 --> 09:01.780]  loot and pillage and expanding NATO and allowing it to operate outside of its territory. You know,
[09:01.780 --> 09:07.740]  I called up my buddy who was an ex-military guy. I guess he's still on reserve now. He went to Iraq
[09:07.740 --> 09:13.260]  and I hadn't talked to him in a little bit over a month, so I thought I'd catch up and wanted to
[09:13.260 --> 09:18.060]  ask him if he knew what was going on in Georgia and Russia. And he's like, well, you know, from what
[09:18.060 --> 09:23.820]  I've heard the Russians attacked and I told him exactly what happened. He's like, wow. And I told
[09:23.820 --> 09:27.820]  him the role of NATO forces surrounding Russia over the past few years. And he's like, yeah,
[09:27.820 --> 09:32.700]  NATO, okay. And he's like, yeah, they're far from peacekeepers. They just do whatever they want.
[09:32.700 --> 09:38.220]  And, you know, the conversation furthered. And I was like, well, did you know that, you know, Black
[09:38.220 --> 09:43.340]  Water has started to open up publicly their own, quote unquote, intelligence organizations? And he's
[09:43.340 --> 09:47.020]  like, well, that's really no surprise to me. He's like, you know, I've always considered going back
[09:47.020 --> 09:51.580]  to Black Water if things get really bad because, you know, you got to choose a side. And I'm like,
[09:51.580 --> 09:56.700]  would you really want to choose that side? And he's like, well, I would never attack American
[09:56.700 --> 10:01.340]  citizens or do anything like that. But, you know, when it comes down to it, and, you know, I was
[10:01.340 --> 10:08.620]  just like, man, that is the wrong way to go. So without further ado, let's expose Joe EV on the
[10:08.620 --> 10:14.460]  Mamoud Ahmed ISI tie-in that he knew exactly about, has still really not exposed publicly and has
[10:14.460 --> 10:21.660]  admitted is classified, take it away. Senator Joe Biden, who had also met with the head of the
[10:21.660 --> 10:32.380]  Pakistani ISI, would have harsh words on the Senate floor. And the word should go out to those who
[10:32.380 --> 10:39.740]  pretend that they wish to be our friends, that they're going to have to make some very difficult
[10:39.740 --> 10:48.140]  choices. Pakistan in particular is going to have to make a very difficult choice very soon. Words
[10:48.140 --> 10:56.140]  will not be sufficient. Actions will be demanded. When Biden was confronted, he confirmed his
[10:56.140 --> 11:00.940]  meeting with Ahmed, saying Pakistani intelligence was indeed funding the Taliban.
[11:03.900 --> 11:09.260]  In the days following 9-11, you met with the head of Pakistani ISI, General Mohad Ahmed. It has
[11:09.260 --> 11:14.220]  since come to light that he ordered Saeed Sheikh to wire 100,000 miles to Mohamad Allah. Why was he
[11:14.220 --> 11:18.780]  allowed to go back to Pakistan? And why was he questioned? And why were you meeting with him?
[11:18.780 --> 11:26.860]  I met with him to deliver a message that if he didn't, if he didn't stop supporting the Taliban,
[11:26.860 --> 11:30.620]  we would take him up. Why did we let him go? We let him fly freely. We never investigated him.
[11:30.620 --> 11:35.740]  We never even looked into him. Look, first thing called diplomatic passports. We did not arrest
[11:35.740 --> 11:47.420]  Khrushchev when he came. But he fined the hijackers and you let him go. He would later state that
[11:47.420 --> 12:04.620]  the information was indeed classified. Well, there you go. It drops September 1st on DVD. You can
[12:04.620 --> 12:14.860]  pre-order it now at infowars.com. It's really ready to go. It is fabled enemies and it is my
[12:14.860 --> 12:20.380]  latest and greatest movie. I have wrote and directed this picture. Of course, Rob Jacobson,
[12:20.380 --> 12:25.020]  Aaron Dykes helped me edit this, did the majority of the editing. Thank God. And I just want to
[12:25.020 --> 12:29.420]  thank Alex one more time for providing the assistance that I needed to make this picture,
[12:29.420 --> 12:32.860]  because this picture really delves into just more than the Pakistani operation.
[12:32.860 --> 12:39.980]  It delves into the Saudi Arabian funding, the banking in this country. The continuity of government
[12:39.980 --> 12:43.820]  program, which is the shadow government that so many people still insist does not exist.
[12:44.540 --> 12:50.780]  You see, the shadow government isn't real because only kooks and tinfoil hat people actually talk
[12:50.780 --> 12:55.980]  about it. Well, now I'm sorry. The continuity government was in place on 9-11 through war games,
[12:55.980 --> 13:00.620]  including Global Guardian and others. And we had these E4Bs in the air that just happened to be on
[13:00.620 --> 13:07.660]  the scenes of the attacks. And people are still just not aware. Dick Cheney was given all this
[13:07.660 --> 13:12.300]  power on the morning of 9-11. The shadow government was pretty much put into place indefinitely.
[13:12.300 --> 13:17.260]  We've suspended all sorts of constitutional rights in this country. We now have domestic
[13:17.260 --> 13:21.420]  wiretapping going on. Nothing can be done. Can't go after the government. It's all into the veil
[13:21.420 --> 13:29.580]  of national security. And it's quite disgusting. I have lost hope. No. Am I upset with what's
[13:29.580 --> 13:34.540]  going on? You bet your bottom dollar. I'm very upset at what's going on. And I feel like the
[13:34.540 --> 13:39.100]  only way that we can conquer this is to expose the lie of 9-11, in which all of our foreign and
[13:39.100 --> 13:44.620]  domestic policy is based on. And with that, I want to talk about some grand standards.
[13:45.740 --> 13:50.620]  Well, I'll be down at ground zero. So will Alex. On September 10th, the show fabled enemies and
[13:50.620 --> 13:54.620]  truth rising. And then, of course, September 11th, to be down at ground zero to talk to people,
[13:54.620 --> 13:58.060]  hand out DVDs. We hope you can make it. There's a couple of events going on after that. You can
[13:58.060 --> 14:05.100]  go to werchange.org and check it out. However, to the bill, if you will, of September 11th,
[14:05.100 --> 14:09.580]  we're going to have Obama and McCain down in New York City grandstanding before family members.
[14:10.140 --> 14:14.780]  All right. Alex is on the line. We'll get to that later. Alex from the DNC in Denver. How are you,
[14:14.780 --> 14:22.220]  my friend? Good. I am here. I'm just a mile or so away from the camp coming up in about 15-20
[14:22.220 --> 14:28.140]  minutes at prisonplanet.com and infoworks.com. We're going to go live with a live video feed there.
[14:28.140 --> 14:34.380]  The video feed is dead right now. It'll go live. And we're also going to have several other cameras.
[14:34.380 --> 14:38.780]  We're going to go up and investigate the camp to see if they already have people out there.
[14:39.500 --> 14:43.020]  So that's coming up in about 15 minutes. We're going to move Helen Watt back to noon.
[14:43.020 --> 14:49.580]  And that means you'll still have some time with Ellen Watt coming up today. We're going to be
[14:49.580 --> 14:54.300]  doing this throughout the week, just preempting or moving guest as the schedule changes here,
[14:54.300 --> 14:59.980]  because this is all a fluid situation. But we've already had feds coming up to us and asking us
[14:59.980 --> 15:05.900]  out of the blue, basically, if we want weapons or we want security. I mean, it's just the classic
[15:05.900 --> 15:11.580]  thing. There's black helicopters, army, black hawks flying around. There's police and riot
[15:11.580 --> 15:16.380]  gear everywhere. When you drive by these groups of clustered police, they just look at every
[15:16.380 --> 15:22.940]  citizen in every car all over downtown Denver, Mile High and sitting with just disgust and hatred
[15:22.940 --> 15:29.420]  with the ugliest looks on their faces and just just absolute just disgust. And
[15:30.380 --> 15:36.700]  with the lowest forms of life, we are just looked at with just abject hatred like we are
[15:36.700 --> 15:42.940]  the lowest form of life on the planet. They've obviously told the police to act like this.
[15:42.940 --> 15:48.140]  Okay, I'm on spear. Hold on one second. We're in multifaceted things here. Spear is closed. Do
[15:48.140 --> 15:54.700]  I need to turn right on Lawrence? Yeah, pick up 15 if you can. Okay. All right. So again,
[15:54.700 --> 16:03.740]  I'm here navigating through checkpoints, police, all sorts of activities. And then now there is
[16:03.740 --> 16:09.900]  an officer, the first one I've seen actually not looking at people like their dog feces.
[16:09.900 --> 16:15.420]  He was handing people a little little information sheets. And I think
[16:17.900 --> 16:22.140]  I have to go through this checkpoint. It is a checkpoint just to go down a main street
[16:23.100 --> 16:28.060]  here. So they have large areas shut down. Again, I'm driving on the cell phone and doing a radio
[16:28.060 --> 16:34.940]  show and being videotaped by the guys. So there's a lot happening here. It's hard to focus in on
[16:34.940 --> 16:40.860]  the news. But bottom line, the anarchist engaged another false flag this time of acting like
[16:40.860 --> 16:48.700]  total scum. Yesterday, there were thousands of peaceful demonstrators and protesters out
[16:48.700 --> 16:57.820]  at Fox News knew how to focus in specifically
[16:57.820 --> 17:04.620]  on the provocateurs and violence right now. Hold on one second. I'm going to talk to the
[17:04.620 --> 17:10.140]  police. Absolutely. I mean, Alex down there at the DNC right now. Hold on one second. Yep.
[17:10.140 --> 17:14.300]  Hold on one second. Officer, what is this? We're just on the radio right now.
[17:15.180 --> 17:18.540]  Which one do you want to do is make a right? Okay, gotcha. Which one do you want to do is make
[17:18.540 --> 17:23.100]  a right? That's on the 15th or that's on the plate. Okay. Thank you. What are those?
[17:23.100 --> 17:27.900]  Not for you. Well, obviously, I'm not royal. I just didn't know what they were. Thanks.
[17:30.060 --> 17:33.660]  Not for you. They're like handing these little sheets out. I'm like, not for you.
[17:34.380 --> 17:38.620]  Ah, I'm sorry. It's all crazy here. Let me just get to the bottom line. The anarchist
[17:39.260 --> 17:43.580]  that Fox went up and talked to ignoring the families and people with strollers and
[17:43.580 --> 17:47.020]  all the peaceful people, conservatives, liberals, you know, anti-war folks,
[17:47.020 --> 17:50.460]  people who want the Democratic Party to do what they were elected for almost two years ago.
[17:50.460 --> 17:57.100]  They all got ignored. And Fox went up to all these 18 and 19-year-olds arrested development people
[17:57.100 --> 18:01.180]  that acted like they were 11 who screamed FU and flipped the cameras off and acted like a bunch
[18:01.180 --> 18:06.540]  of monkeys, which was basically always their job. We know in hindsight back in the 60s and 70s,
[18:06.540 --> 18:10.780]  they would hire anti-war protesters to go into towns and break windows and cuffs and yell
[18:10.780 --> 18:15.500]  to turn the people against the anti-war movement. So whether they're fed, whether they're paid,
[18:16.220 --> 18:19.740]  or not that particular group that was on Fox News and CNN yesterday,
[18:19.740 --> 18:23.900]  they might as well be. I mean, the worst possible image you could imagine,
[18:24.540 --> 18:28.620]  these arrested development drug heads cussing and screaming at people, again,
[18:28.620 --> 18:34.860]  making the image of police in black uniforms and checkpoints and dogs and microwave guns and
[18:34.860 --> 18:40.060]  sound cannons look good because after all, you know, now we've got these dangerous anarchists
[18:40.860 --> 18:44.140]  that are out there causing all these problems. Someone lets you get back to what you're doing
[18:44.140 --> 18:53.900]  in the next 10, 15 minutes. In the next 15 minutes, we will be down at the camp and I'll be calling
[18:53.900 --> 18:58.940]  in live via cell phone with audio backup. We'll have cameras rolling live and we'll be streaming
[18:58.940 --> 19:03.340]  over the web. Lord willing, there's so many people using cell phones and these different
[19:03.340 --> 19:07.100]  wireless connections and sometimes it gets choked in the downtown, but we've got two different
[19:07.100 --> 19:10.140]  wireless cards. So we're trying to get these reports out for you as well. We're also going to
[19:10.140 --> 19:14.940]  stream live tonight. It's a seven or eight o'clock. It's kind of fluid at the big showing of truth
[19:14.940 --> 19:21.420]  rising at the Oriental, I believe. Yeah, the Oriental theater. So that is coming up as well.
[19:21.420 --> 19:25.980]  Again, I'm doing 50 things here in traffic, checkpoints, you name it. The next 10, 15, 20
[19:25.980 --> 19:30.700]  minutes, we'll be calling in live transmission from the secret FEMA camp that the police lied
[19:30.700 --> 19:34.540]  about and been forced to admit exist. I'll turn it back over to you, Burma. All right, there you
[19:34.540 --> 19:39.740]  have it. Alex Jones live from the DNC on his way to the detention camps, a complete police
[19:39.740 --> 19:45.980]  state down in Denver right now. You can check it out live streaming at info wars.com. The video
[19:45.980 --> 19:48.860]  will be broadcast shortly. I'm Jason Burmus. We'll be back after this.
[20:00.540 --> 20:06.620]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, Monday, August 25th, 2008. Gold open at 82510.
[20:06.620 --> 20:13.100]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $849.76, $418.75 for half ounce, and $209.38 for quarter
[20:13.100 --> 20:20.060]  ounce. That's $849.76, $418.75, and $209.38. Hedge fund is caught in the malaise of mortgage
[20:20.060 --> 20:25.020]  bankruptcies. The bond market continues to slump. J.P. Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal
[20:25.020 --> 20:30.700]  for Chrysler. Housing sales fell 6.6%. Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was
[20:30.700 --> 20:35.660]  spreading to the middle and upper class. Investors cast out on investment banks, credit protection
[20:35.660 --> 20:40.220]  insurance for mortgage lenders, and skyrocketing due to the increased risk. The U.S. dollar is
[20:40.220 --> 20:43.900]  free falling against foreign currencies, and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[20:43.900 --> 20:48.780]  are now seeking safer alternatives. Economist Rody Boyd published the report bubble leaking.

[21:00.140 --> 21:06.540]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[21:06.540 --> 21:11.900]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Ben
[21:11.900 --> 21:16.220]  Lawton. This is his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben
[21:16.220 --> 21:21.100]  Lawton. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[21:21.100 --> 21:25.900]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[21:25.900 --> 21:32.700]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[21:32.700 --> 21:38.380]  citizens have been detained. Ben Lawton's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[21:38.380 --> 21:42.620]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[21:42.620 --> 21:48.380]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[24:24.300 --> 24:31.100]  broadcasting live over at infowars.com. They pulled the broadcast, but Alex is shotgun. Not even shotgun
[24:31.100 --> 24:35.260]  really riding. Right through everything. I can't wait to see the footage. They're going down to the
[24:35.260 --> 24:39.660]  DNC, checking out the detention camps, the total police state that they have put in place there.
[24:40.380 --> 24:44.220]  It's just craziness. Like you said, black helicopters, military is the police down there,
[24:44.220 --> 24:48.940]  checkpoints everywhere. And the man still found a way to get a film crew down there.
[24:48.940 --> 24:56.700]  And he's going to be covering it for you like no other. And I'm just totally excited for him.
[24:56.700 --> 25:02.940]  If I wasn't doing this right now, I would be there. And just the fact that he's allowing me to do the
[25:02.940 --> 25:08.060]  show so much is really an honor. I love getting up here for four hours and talking to you people,
[25:08.060 --> 25:12.060]  taking your calls, talking about the issues, the real issues, the issues that matter.
[25:12.060 --> 25:19.900]  And I want to get back to this Obama, McCain, New York City deal. Now this thing is going to be totally
[25:19.900 --> 25:25.100]  staged. They are going to go through the questions with a fine tooth comb beforehand. I wonder if
[25:25.100 --> 25:29.580]  Biden is going to be their grandstanding. I wonder if McCain will have picked his running mate by then.
[25:29.580 --> 25:35.740]  I would have assumed so since the RNC is coming up the week after the DNC. I don't even know if it's
[25:35.740 --> 25:39.260]  a full week afterwards, but I think it's the weekend afterwards, actually. That's when the
[25:39.260 --> 25:44.540]  Ron Paul event is going on in the other convention. But these people are, I'm sure it's going to be
[25:44.540 --> 25:49.260]  broadcast all over television. It's going to be on every single major network. And they're going to
[25:49.260 --> 25:54.060]  tow the official party line. I mean, John McCain is a master at towing the official party line.
[25:54.060 --> 26:02.460]  I did like the look on his face when Luke Radowski confronts him. And you can actually see him react
[26:02.460 --> 26:06.620]  when Luke says, hey, wait a minute, the 9-11 Commission said they were set up to fail themselves.
[26:06.620 --> 26:11.660]  They said they were underfunded and that they were blocked in most of their investigation.
[26:11.660 --> 26:15.100]  And McCain's eyes just let out, well, it looks like you got a good point there. I'm just going to
[26:15.100 --> 26:21.020]  walk away. McCain is so out of it that he's pulled up to 9-11 Truthers and to get a picture,
[26:21.020 --> 26:25.740]  seeing the investigate 9-11 science and still taking the picture. This is the same guy that
[26:25.740 --> 26:35.180]  actually wrote the forward to popular mechanics, Leifest, debunking 9-11 myths. Names loose
[26:35.180 --> 26:42.780]  change specifically. And loose change was the topic of some of the mainstream networks,
[26:43.340 --> 26:48.540]  you know, liathons, if you will, after NIST came out with their report. In fact,
[26:48.540 --> 26:54.380]  we're going to play that clip. I'm going to get that up to John Harmon. But basically,
[26:54.380 --> 26:59.500]  what happened was, you know, seeing, and it mystery solved. Mystery solved. We should play
[26:59.500 --> 27:06.860]  that earlier than Kevin Ryan, because mystery solved. Just so you know, fire did it. First
[27:06.860 --> 27:12.540]  time ever, hundreds of degrees below what they thought it was going to do. And no big deal. Just
[27:13.980 --> 27:18.300]  go back to sleep. I mean, we're not going to let any real reporters ask any questions.
[27:18.300 --> 27:24.700]  That's why when our guy, now let me tell you about the motivation of some of these people,
[27:24.700 --> 27:28.220]  and I encourage these people to keep doing what they're doing. This is what we need for info
[27:28.220 --> 27:34.220]  warriors. Somebody shows up to the office says, Hey, I really want to go to this. I would really
[27:34.860 --> 27:40.780]  like to attend. Can I get some press passes through you guys? And we say, Hey, you know,
[27:40.780 --> 27:43.660]  of course, we'll support you in the press passes, give them a call, see what you can do.
[27:44.460 --> 27:51.260]  So we call off calls up on behalf of info wars, gives them the office number,
[27:51.260 --> 27:54.380]  they call back, they say, is this guy for real? And we go, Oh, yeah, he's for real.
[27:54.380 --> 27:58.780]  Guy's pretty sympathetic on the phone. Ben Stein, not the Ben Stein, but Ben Stein
[27:58.780 --> 28:03.580]  was the contact information. So this guy takes his own money. Remember, we are a small operation.
[28:03.580 --> 28:09.820]  We can't fund everything. So he takes his own money. He flies from here to Maryland to go
[28:09.820 --> 28:15.660]  there to ask a question, which does get covered by CNN for a split second. And they don't cover
[28:15.660 --> 28:22.140]  the fact that they turned the lights off on him. Okay, they turned the lights off on the real
[28:22.140 --> 28:29.980]  questions. Let's go over it again. No science to these animation models, pure speculation.
[28:29.980 --> 28:34.060]  They had to retract their statement that 10 stories was scooped out of the building.
[28:34.860 --> 28:38.620]  They said there was someone significant, but not as significant as they once thought. They said,
[28:38.620 --> 28:43.020]  Oh, you know, even without the damage, it would have come down from the fire. Well,
[28:43.020 --> 28:46.940]  there was no massive damage. It was just a complete and total hoax that they put on through
[28:46.940 --> 28:51.500]  popular mechanics magazine. And it was the talking point of all these debunkers for the last two
[28:51.500 --> 28:55.260]  or three years. Oh, a third of the building was scooped out. A third of the building was scooped
[28:55.260 --> 28:59.100]  out. Well, we showed in video evidence that a third of the building was not scooped out. We have
[28:59.100 --> 29:02.940]  it in fabled enemies. It's in loose change final cut as well. I think it's described maybe a little
[29:02.940 --> 29:08.300]  bit better in fabled enemies, but we literally have the south face on video. We have people going
[29:08.300 --> 29:12.140]  in through the south face after at least one of the towers has collapsed. And yeah, there's a
[29:12.140 --> 29:17.740]  couple broken out windows and there's smoke coming from the building, but that's it. No heavy fires.
[29:17.740 --> 29:22.060]  It's just ludicrous to say that one of these beams detached on the 79th floor. They have no
[29:22.060 --> 29:27.020]  evidence for it. They just picked it out of the blue and then animated something applied. No physics
[29:27.020 --> 29:33.020]  whatsoever. Discredited explosives from the quote unquote, decibel levels on the tape. You feel like
[29:33.020 --> 29:37.100]  you're being lied to. Well, you are. We're going to play that CNN clip on the other side. Prison

[32:02.460 --> 32:07.740]  ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state. This confederation of evangelicals,
[32:07.740 --> 32:12.380]  Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block. Their agenda
[32:12.380 --> 32:17.020]  is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill
[32:17.020 --> 32:21.500]  of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the Bible
[32:21.500 --> 32:25.900]  proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our
[32:25.900 --> 32:30.700]  love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character,
[32:30.700 --> 32:35.500]  not civil enforcement. From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome,
[32:35.500 --> 32:40.060]  religious intolerance resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of
[32:40.060 --> 32:45.580]  our nation. America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda. Protestant America, awake before it
[32:45.580 --> 32:53.740]  is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715

[33:10.220 --> 33:15.100]  All right folks, we are back at the Alex Jones show. I'm Jason Bermas filling in until Thursday
[33:15.100 --> 33:20.940]  as Alex brings you live coverage from the Democratic National Convention. And they're not broadcasting
[33:20.940 --> 33:25.180]  right this second, but they will be there on their way to the detention centers built for this event.
[33:26.380 --> 33:32.620]  But as promised, we have Alan Wad of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com, very educated not only on the New
[33:32.620 --> 33:38.140]  World Order, but the esoteric symbols that we see in all of our lives. Thanks for joining us, Alan.
[33:38.140 --> 33:43.740]  It's a pleasure to be here. Alan, you know, just to kick it off, I kind of wanted to get your
[33:43.740 --> 33:49.100]  take on the Olympics. You know, I watched a lot of the opening ceremony. I saw how they blurred
[33:49.100 --> 33:54.540]  reality by putting in fake fireworks. Obviously, they faked the little girl's voice, but they made
[33:54.540 --> 34:01.660]  the image of God walking into the arena. Basically, they were putting off these fake fireworks of
[34:01.660 --> 34:06.540]  footprints. And then when it arrived, obviously, there were these huge explosions, but then it goes
[34:06.540 --> 34:12.220]  right into a Chinese sundial. And, you know, obviously, everything was in Chinese, so I couldn't
[34:12.220 --> 34:17.260]  tell whether it was zodiac symbols or whatever. But I found it very interesting and almost like
[34:17.260 --> 34:22.380]  the 36 Olympics in Berlin when it was just such an obvious occultic ritual.
[34:23.020 --> 34:30.220]  Yeah. Well, it's always occultic rituals that they show us, and even the symbol that the Chinese
[34:30.220 --> 34:37.260]  gave us for this Olympic Games. It looks kind of like a man, but it's actually a Chinese letter
[34:37.820 --> 34:45.980]  which stands for the power, the sexual power of the male, basically. But the one difference in it
[34:45.980 --> 34:51.820]  is that they cut off the penis, which is quite interesting in that in itself. So they believe
[34:51.820 --> 34:57.180]  that the power comes from the kidney even through even for sexual potency, but they cut the penis
[34:57.180 --> 35:03.260]  of the man off, which is quite a telling statement. Yeah. Is that for their hemaphroditic androgynous
[35:03.260 --> 35:08.940]  symbolism? It's partly that, and there's no doubt about it. I mean, China, every statistic they give
[35:08.940 --> 35:14.620]  you shows you that there's going to be 70% more males and females shortly because they're doing
[35:14.620 --> 35:21.020]  away at birth with the female species, and they're encouraging all kinds of alternate
[35:21.900 --> 35:27.100]  sexual release. So it's quite interesting. Well, yeah. I mean, on Friday, I had somebody who was
[35:27.100 --> 35:33.020]  just so pro-China on. It was unbelievable. He was denying that they were taking the
[35:33.020 --> 35:38.460]  dissidents organs and that China was this wonderland and all these things that were
[35:38.460 --> 35:42.460]  happening in the Eastern world are good, and of course he was pro-world government at the end.
[35:42.460 --> 35:48.700]  But I am not pro-world government. I see a huge problem over in China with 1.2 billion people
[35:48.700 --> 35:53.980]  and having the military as the police. I mean, there is no posicomentatus there. You're guilty
[35:53.980 --> 35:59.420]  until proven innocent. And although I've seen it geared towards a lot of Western things, you've seen
[35:59.420 --> 36:03.900]  McDonald's Coca-Cola come in there in the last 30 years and kind of Westernized it. You still have
[36:03.900 --> 36:09.260]  one child policies, and it's still acceptable that, again, they're doing away with the female
[36:09.260 --> 36:13.980]  population. You want a boy, which just doesn't seem normal to me. Do you think that they're
[36:13.980 --> 36:17.420]  putting China out of... Why do you think they're bringing China out on the world stage in this
[36:17.420 --> 36:24.860]  level? Because China, as the United Nations has stated already, because of its collectivist system,
[36:24.860 --> 36:30.220]  which is what the whole world is to become, China is the model state which we will all emulate.
[36:30.220 --> 36:35.420]  That's why the United Nations has stated that a few times. And that seems to fit. I mean,
[36:35.420 --> 36:40.860]  it is a total police state there, and there is the slightest veil of freedom under this
[36:40.860 --> 36:47.740]  dictatorship. But at the same time, again, our laws, our constitution, and our bill of
[36:47.740 --> 36:52.300]  rights have been eviscerated so much that they become more and more like China's policies every
[36:52.300 --> 36:57.980]  day. And I do see us kind of coming towards one another. They get Westernized. We take
[36:57.980 --> 37:04.380]  Easternization, at least in our police measures, our military measures. And that's very, very
[37:04.380 --> 37:10.700]  scary to me that now, in front of the whole world, China has been shown as this total
[37:10.700 --> 37:15.260]  superpower. Do you think there's going to be a military conflict with them to bring in this
[37:15.260 --> 37:19.420]  one world order? Obviously, we've just had this situation over in Georgia, South Ossetia, and
[37:19.420 --> 37:24.060]  Russia, which we'll get into later. But is this the next big event? Are we going to try to challenge
[37:24.060 --> 37:31.980]  Red China? I don't think so. To be honest with you, we created, the West created Red China.
[37:31.980 --> 37:39.340]  We funded them into existence. Bertrand Russell was sent over the 1920s to introduce
[37:39.340 --> 37:45.580]  communistic ideas in the universities. And he wrote about that and stated that in those words,
[37:45.580 --> 37:51.820]  in his own memoirs. He was one of many he was sent over. And then we found in the 70s and 80s,
[37:51.820 --> 37:57.980]  with the 80s and 90s, you had the GAT treaties and so on, which allowed Western corporations,
[37:57.980 --> 38:03.740]  factories to be shipped over wholesale to China to set up China as the manufacturer for the whole
[38:03.740 --> 38:10.700]  planet. So we funded China into existence. We don't have nations. We have a facade of nations,
[38:10.700 --> 38:14.780]  but everyone at the top of all the countries for a long time now, these dynasties, these family
[38:14.780 --> 38:21.420]  dynasties have been international. And they have sewn up the world's economy into an international
[38:21.420 --> 38:29.180]  scale. So much like a web, you can't separate the countries anymore. You have a handful of people,
[38:29.180 --> 38:35.900]  maybe 20 or up to 200 families who invest every day in the stock market in the billions,
[38:35.900 --> 38:41.020]  and they can create or destroy countries overnight. So we're all tied together. We are
[38:41.020 --> 38:47.420]  interdependent financially. And so China is only part of this. If you go into the records of the
[38:47.420 --> 38:51.500]  Royal Institute for International Affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations, which is the same
[38:51.500 --> 38:59.020]  organization from the 1930s, they talked about building China up to be the superpower that
[38:59.020 --> 39:04.140]  would eventually take over towards the end of the millennium into the new millennium,
[39:04.140 --> 39:09.980]  the role of world police after the U.S. falters and is exhausted. And that's what we're seeing today.
[39:09.980 --> 39:16.220]  The U.S. is doing its final push and it will falter financially and so on and sink back.
[39:16.220 --> 39:22.780]  And China is to take over. Arnold Toynbee, that was the top internationalist for the road scholarships,
[39:22.780 --> 39:27.980]  wrote about that again back in the 1930s. And what you're talking about is actually very frightening
[39:27.980 --> 39:34.460]  because there will be a total change in this country if we're driven into China's ways.
[39:34.460 --> 39:39.100]  I mean, let's look at a documentary I really enjoy called Walmart, The High Cost, the Low Prices.
[39:39.100 --> 39:44.380]  And I brought this up yesterday. Now, sure it's awful that the employees in the Canadian Walmarts
[39:44.380 --> 39:49.180]  and the American Walmarts that they're paid, you know, between six, eight, maybe $10 an hour.
[39:49.180 --> 39:54.540]  They don't get overtime. There's no benefits. That's awful. Okay. But what's even worse are the
[39:54.540 --> 40:01.020]  Chinese slave shops where literal families spend nights in their Walmart dorms. They live in the
[40:01.020 --> 40:04.860]  factory. They're charged rent from the factory. And even if they decide not to live there,
[40:04.860 --> 40:08.780]  they still have to pay for that room. I think it's something like half the cost. I believe
[40:08.780 --> 40:13.420]  when I watched it back in 2005, 2004, they were paying, they were being paid something like
[40:13.420 --> 40:19.340]  35 cents an hour. And the rent on their room was like $171 a month. And if they didn't want it,
[40:19.340 --> 40:23.900]  it was still 70. I mean, those type of slave labor conditions, and they bring you inside the factory
[40:23.900 --> 40:29.100]  are unimaginable in this country at this point. But really not that far in the future, is it?
[40:29.740 --> 40:36.700]  It's not far. And here's how it works. You see, 100 years ago, 150 years ago, when they set up
[40:36.700 --> 40:42.620]  the big foundations, there was to take over this new role of what they call governance, global
[40:42.620 --> 40:50.380]  governance. They said that the duty, and this is in the role of the Council on Foreign Relations'
[40:50.380 --> 40:56.220]  own mandate, they say that they're creating a world state where everyone will serve the state.
[40:56.860 --> 41:02.700]  Now, when you look at the communist system, under the same facade as everyone worked for the state.
[41:03.260 --> 41:08.860]  Now, in the Western idea, we have camouflaged, you have the big international corporations,
[41:08.860 --> 41:14.540]  the Walmarts and so on. And technically, they're producing, or they're, they give out all the
[41:14.540 --> 41:22.220]  stuff that we need. So technically, they're part of the big factory system. And we will all eventually
[41:22.220 --> 41:28.060]  serve the state. And all these big corporations technically are getting put over on us as being
[41:28.060 --> 41:33.100]  our benefactors. They're part of our system, our global system. We need them. Therefore,
[41:33.100 --> 41:37.740]  we will serve them. And therefore, with all that could be reduced down to the common denominator
[41:37.740 --> 41:42.300]  as working for the state. And those corporations will come under that facade.
[41:43.020 --> 41:48.060]  Under the communist system, technically, again, it's all technically or appearance-wise,
[41:48.060 --> 41:53.980]  everything was owned by the state, the means of production and the outlets. And the Western system
[41:53.980 --> 41:59.260]  is camouflaged, the outlets and the means of production are in the hands of a few families,
[41:59.260 --> 42:06.300]  basically. And we've all deserved that system. The Council, or the Club of Rome, stated that
[42:06.300 --> 42:11.340]  they'd looked at all the different systems the world had, and the one that was most efficient
[42:11.340 --> 42:18.540]  for their needs, for their use, in their view, was collectivism. And that falls right in with
[42:18.540 --> 42:22.780]  the Cetus Rhodes Foundation, which created the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the
[42:22.780 --> 42:28.700]  Council of Foreign Relations, where everyone would live in a collectivist society with a ruling class
[42:28.700 --> 42:33.740]  of elite intellectuals at the top, and aristocracy, and the masses would be run on a
[42:33.740 --> 42:39.900]  communistic-type system. And their one duty would be to serve the world state. That's what we're
[42:39.900 --> 42:46.380]  seeing. And all of the means of production and the outlets for production are an international
[42:46.380 --> 42:52.380]  hands, a few hands. They're all part of this collectivist system. That's why we're getting
[42:52.380 --> 42:56.300]  reduced with our wages and so on, down to the lowest common denominator.
[42:56.300 --> 43:00.540]  And I also want to point out that our economy is being gutted here, and a lot of the money that
[43:00.540 --> 43:06.860]  we're borrowing from, the majority of the money, in fact, is from the Chinese. So if they call in
[43:06.860 --> 43:13.500]  their debt, God knows what happened. Again, I want to warn people that our economy is about to
[43:13.500 --> 43:18.540]  falter. All these military conflicts are just helping it. And I mean, when do you see this
[43:18.540 --> 43:23.740]  happening? Obviously, the United States seems to be trying to prolong their power by having Georgia
[43:23.740 --> 43:30.460]  invade South Ossetia with NATO forces surrounding Russia, trying to coax Russia into a large
[43:30.460 --> 43:34.300]  scale attack. They've already fooled most of this country into believing the bear is back
[43:34.300 --> 43:38.940]  and that they, you know, attacked with no reason on South Ossetia, when we know
[43:38.940 --> 43:42.220]  very, very different. Is this what they're trying to do? Are they trying to bring in a
[43:42.220 --> 43:45.820]  military conflict to bring in the end of the United States, or do you think that they're
[43:45.820 --> 43:51.900]  just going to drop the economy all at once? Well, again, they did through the big think tanks
[43:51.900 --> 43:58.300]  and the top think tanks for planning future strategy to attain this world system is the
[43:58.300 --> 44:05.660]  Club of Rome. And in their book, the First Global Revolution, written by the two founders,
[44:05.660 --> 44:09.420]  who are completely interlaced with all the other big foundations, by the way, they all
[44:09.420 --> 44:16.460]  work together. But the Club of Rome stated that they'd have to create a war situation,
[44:16.460 --> 44:22.700]  a prolonged war situation, because they could ram their agenda through under the guise of war,
[44:22.700 --> 44:29.740]  because the public go along with it. We take rationing, we take ID cards, we take limited
[44:29.740 --> 44:35.420]  travel, all the things that come from war. And that's why, after 9-11, it was stated,
[44:35.420 --> 44:41.020]  this is going to be a hundred years war, is to change all of society, like Carl Quigley said,
[44:41.580 --> 44:47.340]  that's what war's main function is, is to create, is to change culture and society,
[44:47.340 --> 44:53.500]  because government departments can multiply like cancers and take over all the functions
[44:53.500 --> 44:58.700]  that the citizens normally do themselves. They take the power from the citizen under war.
[44:58.700 --> 45:04.940]  And this is a war to change the entire planet. It's not just the US. The US has its role in it,
[45:04.940 --> 45:11.820]  its role is to bring it in. And once it's exhausted itself financially and through manpower and so
[45:11.820 --> 45:18.620]  on, is to submerge and then China is to take over. It's so amazing to realize that China was a main
[45:18.620 --> 45:24.620]  enemy. Communism supposedly was the antithesis of capitalism. That's what the public were taught.
[45:24.620 --> 45:29.100]  It's not true because capitalism created communism. They funded it from its inception.
[45:29.900 --> 45:35.740]  And what they really wanted, the elite wanted, and the aristocracy wanted, was a manageable
[45:35.740 --> 45:41.900]  society where there was no individuality. So individuality is destroyed under communist systems.
[45:42.540 --> 45:46.940]  And they wanted to bring the same system to the West and manage the whole planet,
[45:46.940 --> 45:52.300]  that in that way. It's been very successful. Individuality is frowned upon today. In fact,
[45:52.300 --> 45:58.380]  you're down as a potential terrorist if you're an individual. And they're teaching collectivism
[45:58.380 --> 46:05.260]  in the schools already so that this generation growing up in the school system will merge easily
[46:05.260 --> 46:11.580]  with the communist type system of China and the old Soviet type union.
[46:11.580 --> 46:16.220]  Well, let me give an example of that actually. Again, with the Olympics, I download it because I
[46:16.220 --> 46:22.540]  missed it of the Australian feed of the Olympics. And it opens up with a young Chinese boy talking
[46:22.540 --> 46:27.420]  about, you know, one world and then an Australian girl coming on and saying one world together.
[46:27.420 --> 46:31.180]  And then they're both on screen together and they're hugging and embracing. And you know,
[46:31.180 --> 46:35.420]  we can make this one world. It's much like Obama goes all the way to Berlin to give his
[46:35.420 --> 46:40.300]  new world order speech where he talks about global citizenship and the fact that we will be
[46:40.300 --> 46:44.780]  required to do more, not less in the future as a global citizen. Do you realize that folks?
[46:44.780 --> 46:49.420]  There are a lot of people out there. I used to be one of them who works 60 plus hours a week.
[46:49.420 --> 46:57.580]  How much more do they expect? What they mean by that is your life is dedicated to serving
[46:57.580 --> 47:03.980]  the world state. That's what they mean by that. That's put implicitly in the mandate for the
[47:03.980 --> 47:08.700]  Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal and Super International Affairs. Every citizen,
[47:08.700 --> 47:14.780]  in fact, you won't get born unless they have a duty for you to fulfill. That's also in their
[47:14.780 --> 47:20.940]  mandate. It's a controlled society. It's global family planning on a large scale and it's been
[47:20.940 --> 47:25.580]  taught. It has been taught in the school for the last 15, 20 years. Now it's on a roll.
[47:25.580 --> 47:30.380]  They're really indoctrinating the ones even in kindergarten for the world they're going to grow
[47:30.380 --> 47:38.380]  up into. This is a scientific indoctrination planned for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[47:38.940 --> 47:43.820]  I couldn't agree with you more. Really, it is quite frightening. A lot of the people that I went to
[47:43.820 --> 47:49.260]  high school and college with did end up becoming teachers in middle and grade school. They just
[47:49.260 --> 47:53.740]  tell me these horror stories. My one friend, Matt, was like, he walked in one day and they
[47:53.740 --> 48:00.780]  literally had DNA swab kits for his kids. No permission slips. No one told the parents
[48:00.780 --> 48:04.940]  and he was expected to administer these to the children. He said, look, I'm not giving these
[48:04.940 --> 48:09.500]  to my kids until I see a permission slip and I know that all the parents were called. This is
[48:09.500 --> 48:16.620]  insane. Another example of the surveillance society that we live in is my friend Amy. She
[48:16.620 --> 48:20.540]  was teaching a fifth grade class and she also happened to be coaching softball. She'd often go
[48:20.540 --> 48:25.980]  to her classroom after school to change and she was in there with her mother and her sister.
[48:25.980 --> 48:29.980]  Her mom was the school nurse and they were cleaning up and they noticed in the center column,
[48:29.980 --> 48:35.180]  usually where the outlets are plugged in, there was a dummy spot and in the dummy spot was actually
[48:35.180 --> 48:40.780]  a hidden camera. So she got worried. She couldn't believe what she had seen. She put a post-it over
[48:40.780 --> 48:44.940]  it and she went away. It was on a Friday. She came back Monday to school, took the post-it off
[48:44.940 --> 48:49.900]  and magically the camera was gone. Now she didn't want to be accused of paranoia so she went down
[48:49.900 --> 48:55.100]  to the superintendent's office and she said, look, we saw a camera there. I put a post-it over it.
[48:55.100 --> 48:59.900]  My mother can verify it and the guy's like, well, yeah, I kind of want to talk to you about that.
[48:59.900 --> 49:05.420]  Well, you know, the camera wasn't really on and we had somebody stealing in that classroom with
[49:05.420 --> 49:10.300]  the teacher who was there last year. So it was just in place. But of course, that doesn't make
[49:10.300 --> 49:14.540]  sense because if the camera wasn't on, they wouldn't have been able to track and trace it and pull
[49:14.540 --> 49:22.380]  the camera. So obviously they were watching her. We're turned into surveillance society and the
[49:22.380 --> 49:28.700]  message is loud and clear for those who don't quite get it. The elite claim that they own us.
[49:30.140 --> 49:36.380]  Now lots of people in a socialized system are quite content being owned as long as they can go and
[49:36.380 --> 49:42.060]  play. But the playing is going to stop one day and they're all going to freak out and that's why
[49:42.060 --> 49:48.060]  they're built up internal armies to take care of the fallouts when it all comes out and open.
[49:49.020 --> 49:54.860]  But that's what the statement is. You are owned. You have no rights. And the only way you can get
[49:54.860 --> 50:00.140]  your rights is to, first of all, I don't know, like the people that try this, try and be really
[50:00.140 --> 50:06.060]  indignant. Once in a while, just start with being indignant when you've been frisked or told to bend
[50:06.060 --> 50:11.180]  over or have little Johnny give his fingerprints to school or whatever else that happens to be.
[50:11.180 --> 50:17.660]  Start with indignancy because your ancestors fought battle after battle after battle to have
[50:17.660 --> 50:24.060]  the right to be free so that they were not owned by the king. And here we are right back in the
[50:24.060 --> 50:29.100]  same place and the people don't recognize it because it can still go out and play at the moment.
[50:29.100 --> 50:33.820]  Well, they're too busy sucking down Jenny Light, getting home from work watching their sports team
[50:33.820 --> 50:39.500]  only to cuddle up at night and watch American Idol, which is just this total blasé mesmerization
[50:39.500 --> 50:45.260]  of the American populace. We're with Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix.com. I'm Jason Burmese,
[50:45.260 --> 50:49.980]  Infer Alex Jones. Remember, fabled enemies drops August 31st on PrisonPlanet.tv. Get
[50:49.980 --> 50:52.140]  your DVD at infowars.com.
[51:00.940 --> 51:06.780]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[51:06.780 --> 51:11.820]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[51:11.820 --> 51:17.020]  bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[51:17.020 --> 51:21.340]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[51:21.340 --> 51:26.060]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are

[54:00.140 --> 54:14.460]  There's a man going around taking names

[54:47.500 --> 54:50.940]  All right folks we're back. That's the great Johnny Cash on the line right there.
[54:50.940 --> 54:56.940]  We've got some good tunes that guy does. We're with Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[54:56.940 --> 55:03.740]  Alex's live video feed is now up over at InfoWars.com as they pass the DNC Detention Center. He's
[55:03.740 --> 55:06.860]  going to be joining us shortly and we're going to be taking your calls in this last half an hour
[55:07.420 --> 55:12.780]  with Alan Watt. Alan you've dropped some serious names and organizations. One of my
[55:12.780 --> 55:18.460]  wanted to talk about was Carol Quigley who was kind of in on it. He was part of the elite crowd.
[55:18.460 --> 55:23.340]  They let him look at their documents Cecil Rhodes and the Round Table group and he came out with a
[55:23.340 --> 55:29.100]  book called Tragedy and Hope in which he described these guys as plans for world government and he
[55:29.100 --> 55:34.620]  wasn't down with all the means but he was down with the end so he promoted it and of course this
[55:34.620 --> 55:40.540]  guy was also you know Clinton was his protege and he talked about him in his inauguration speech and
[55:40.540 --> 55:45.420]  other speeches about Carol Quigley. So of course Clinton is part of this group of course Bush is
[55:45.420 --> 55:50.380]  part of this group but I kind of want you to touch on the founding of the Council on Foreign
[55:50.380 --> 55:56.380]  Relations because of course you know Obama speaks at the CFR. His wife is a member of the CFR and
[55:56.380 --> 56:02.220]  they just picked good old boy Joe Biden who is another CFR member to run as the VP nominee.
[56:03.980 --> 56:11.340]  Well the CFR is just the wing of the foundation that Cecil Rhodes began at the Cecil Rhodes
[56:11.340 --> 56:17.020]  Foundation merged with the Milner Foundation and they created the Royal Institute for International
[56:17.020 --> 56:21.500]  Affairs and in the 1920s they opened their American branch. They couldn't call it the Royal
[56:21.500 --> 56:26.140]  Institute so they called it the Council on Foreign Relations. It's the one and the same thing.
[56:26.140 --> 56:31.180]  It's the same organization and their goal from Cecil Rhodes and Milner through the Royal Institute
[56:31.180 --> 56:37.260]  of International Affairs has always been to create a world governmental system where the eugenic
[56:37.260 --> 56:45.420]  eugenic superiors would run the world scientifically to help the aristocracy and run us all in the
[56:45.420 --> 56:52.540]  collectivist system and these states right on their mandate that everyone's duty will be to serve
[56:52.540 --> 56:58.380]  the world state, serve the world state that will be of purpose in life. It's unbelievable and we're
[56:58.380 --> 57:03.420]  seeing more and more in that technology come out and instead of being used to free us as human
[57:03.420 --> 57:09.100]  beings it really is being used to enslave us as human beings and you know some of these examples
[57:09.100 --> 57:13.900]  that I'd like to give out are these iPhones all right they track and trace you AT&T was caught
[57:13.900 --> 57:18.940]  with the secret room there's nothing we can do about it apparently national security is called
[57:18.940 --> 57:23.740]  we appeal that in the federal court and try to sue them you know not through federal court but
[57:23.740 --> 57:27.340]  through a regular court and they throw it out as well these guys are all protected under the
[57:27.340 --> 57:32.140]  national security act it makes me sick. Meanwhile I'm not sure if you're aware of this guy named
[57:32.140 --> 57:35.500]  John Kanzius but I've been playing him on the show every once in a while there's this guy
[57:35.500 --> 57:41.660]  out in Erie, Pennsylvania that not only cured his cancer with radio fields and precious metals
[57:41.660 --> 57:47.180]  basically injecting himself with nanoparticles of gold and then running himself through these radio
[57:47.180 --> 57:52.540]  waves it kills the cancer but he also found a way to make saltwater burn now that's saltwater folks
[57:52.540 --> 57:58.780]  uh listen listen to me here he literally has it burning at 1500 degrees centigrade and no one's
[57:58.780 --> 58:04.620]  talking about it he fit his car uh you know to run on four fifths water the the companies don't
[58:04.620 --> 58:08.860]  want you to know about this because they don't want you to be energy independent instead Alan
[58:08.860 --> 58:13.660]  they want to make you feel guilty for your quote unquote carbon footprint and get you to pay a tax
[58:13.660 --> 58:19.260]  isn't that correct yeah you're supposed to be interdependent independent is taboo for business
[58:19.900 --> 58:24.860]  interdependence is the mandate for the world yeah all right we're going to be taking calls on the
[58:24.860 --> 58:28.460]  other side this is the Alex Jones show I am Jason Burma's remember you can get fabled enemies over

[1:01:56.940 --> 1:02:00.540]  again i want to take this opportunity because i don't get to talk to alan watt much this is
[1:02:00.540 --> 1:02:05.580]  my first interview with him and i really became aware of your work alan um i think it was winter
[1:02:05.580 --> 1:02:10.540]  of this year somebody passed along some of the cutting through the matrix uh mp3s and whatnot
[1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:15.180]  and we were listening to him out in napal's california and you definitely have a unique
[1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:20.940]  perspective you're well spoken and uh you're a breath of fresh air in my opinion uh in this
[1:02:20.940 --> 1:02:24.940]  movement because you're not somebody who tears other people down you really are just looking
[1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:32.220]  at this system of control and trying to expose others to it yeah it's so old and quickly himself
[1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:37.580]  in his other big book which is worth reading it's called the anglo-american establishment
[1:02:37.580 --> 1:02:43.980]  uh he he claims that this particular group that makes your policy uh the council of
[1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:49.340]  foreign relations has so many members in the u.s government and outside of the u.s government
[1:02:49.340 --> 1:02:55.660]  and all through the bureaucracies of washington dc they create the policy for the united states
[1:02:55.660 --> 1:03:00.780]  and he he says they'll be behind all major wars for the last couple of hundred years this particular
[1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:06.700]  group anglo-american group they went through different um societies into the seasill roads
[1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:11.900]  group into the council of foreign relations and it's the same bunch they were running at this show
[1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:17.900]  and their policy has always been to create a world governmental system which is efficient for them
[1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:25.580]  to rule over and to do so they must abolish to see the mean culprit which is individuality
[1:03:25.580 --> 1:03:31.900]  and make it a collectivist type society that has been also behind uh the push for eugenics
[1:03:31.900 --> 1:03:37.180]  and for literally removing certain genes um and all right alan i got to interrupt you just because

[1:09:32.700 --> 1:09:37.180]  detain people and i guess those are the uh vans that they're going to round people up to process them
[1:09:37.180 --> 1:09:44.620]  at this facility correct well he can't believe their air condition camp they didn't it wasn't
[1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:49.580]  going to be air condition before they also removed the barbed wire and the sign that said electroshock
[1:09:49.580 --> 1:09:53.420]  once the public found out about this they put air conditioning in last week removed the confidence
[1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:58.140]  you know why are on top defenses inside and remove the signs that said electroshock devices in use
[1:09:58.140 --> 1:10:04.220]  just to terrify terrorize people and they came to the camp very interesting stuff and he just
[1:10:04.220 --> 1:10:08.380]  showed you um the the separate air conditioning facilities that they they look like they're
[1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:13.900]  mobile air conditioning facilities as this is a mobile prison uh remember these are makeshift
[1:10:13.900 --> 1:10:20.140]  prisons to make sure that the officers that descent isn't out of control here we go how are you guys
[1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:33.500]  doing alex is approaching the uh police officers on the right area what is that
[1:10:36.060 --> 1:10:37.420]  we got about five cops there
[1:10:37.420 --> 1:10:46.700]  it's hard to see what's going on denver county or city jail after
[1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:53.020]  yes sir
[1:10:55.740 --> 1:11:01.900]  thank you why was this secret at first okay thank you thank you guys
[1:11:01.900 --> 1:11:05.100]  beautiful day huh
[1:11:07.660 --> 1:11:12.860]  oh alex and his charm absolutely amazing thank you officer can we have that number
[1:11:14.300 --> 1:11:19.180]  thank you and it looks like they have to leave we're supposed on the police day here but look
[1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:25.100]  at how gorgeous the mountains are oh i love this camera just look at those clouds i wish i was up
[1:11:25.100 --> 1:11:29.100]  those mountain hiking right now instead of doing this i think it's probably just
[1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:36.060]  like yeah overlooking the camper let me see overlooking the camp some of the most beautiful
[1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:42.460]  scenery rocky mountains are off in the distance
[1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:50.860]  and there you have all of this and you can take alex's word for it let's uh let's go back to
[1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:55.020]  alan wop but yeah it is gorgeous there i've been out to colorado the scenery is amazing
[1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:59.180]  uh alex just talking to some of the police officers outside of this makeshift
[1:11:59.180 --> 1:12:03.900]  detention center and alan they really drilled it up for this in the in the months coming i mean
[1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:08.140]  they literally had black helicopters flying around they broke out the microwave weapons
[1:12:08.140 --> 1:12:14.620]  they even pamphleted the city with wrapped up american flags with uh orange uh light sticks
[1:12:14.620 --> 1:12:20.620]  and a little uh propaganda card as well so it's pretty outrageous the amount of preparation
[1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:27.580]  they've done for this event yeah it is too it's also a way of getting the public used to this
[1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:36.620]  um it it's a psychic form of separating them from the people and putting a barrier between you
[1:12:36.620 --> 1:12:41.500]  psychologically subconsciously you you start to accept that's the natural order of things from
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:47.740]  now on and so the more that they do this the more we'll get used to it and accept um that we're
[1:12:47.740 --> 1:12:52.540]  being ruled see it's all to do with making you accept that you're being ruled not really governed
[1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:59.100]  by elected people but ruled by people who are chosen by by an intellect an intellectual group
[1:12:59.100 --> 1:13:04.940]  above you that is what they call the natural order and it's true enough they do give us the
[1:13:04.940 --> 1:13:10.140]  candidates to vote for the candidates they're always handpicked as carl quickly said because
[1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:16.300]  if they belong to the council and formulations or they have been in it or their wives are and in
[1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:21.180]  fact i think even obama's wife is in the council and form relations yes they're all connected to
[1:13:21.180 --> 1:13:26.940]  the same society absolutely it is total and complete acclamation of the population to be ruled by a
[1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:32.460]  global elite in the backdrop i mean we are just so brainwashed and mesmerized most people have no
[1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:37.180]  idea that there's even three branches of government alan they couldn't tell you that there's like you
[1:13:37.180 --> 1:13:41.900]  know supposed to be checks and balances that's why we have the legislative the executive branch i i
[1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:48.060]  mean again these they're there for us but we don't know how to use them we don't know about the
[1:13:48.060 --> 1:13:53.020]  judicial branch in this country people just are so far gone they think that these people on the
[1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:57.900]  television are there to tell them how to live and what to do and fix their problems they have no idea
[1:13:57.900 --> 1:14:02.220]  about this housing crisis they don't know what they're going to do when their banks falter i mean
[1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:08.060]  we are in some real trouble in this country as banks start to go under as houses are foreclosed on
[1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:13.340]  as people are no longer going to live in this cushy society which they have in the last 20 years
[1:14:13.340 --> 1:14:18.940]  which has really made them blind all these problems yes and again even the council and foreign
[1:14:18.940 --> 1:14:24.620]  relations on magazine they put their own magazine out every month that gives you their long-term agenda
[1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:30.860]  and i think 20 odd years ago uh... this dated in one of them that that that the u.s constitution
[1:14:30.860 --> 1:14:35.900]  was such a nuisance that was always in the way of this big plan so they'd have to do an end run
[1:14:35.900 --> 1:14:42.620]  around it in other words through tradition through through gradual acceptance um you won't need it
[1:14:42.620 --> 1:14:47.020]  anymore and that's how you sort of gradually think about it in your mind if you thought about it at
[1:14:47.020 --> 1:14:51.900]  all you don't really need it anymore things have changed well it was the only protection that you
[1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:57.580]  had to keep your sovereignty and the whole idea was to do to demolish sovereignty and all of these
[1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:04.220]  characters that are presented for you to vote for are a complete globalists in in their their makeup
[1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:10.140]  the psychological makeup and in their family traditions they're interwoven internationally
[1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:16.380]  with their own investments in fact and uh their own families are too they're all internationalists
[1:15:16.380 --> 1:15:22.140]  and carl quickly said it doesn't matter if there's republican elite at the top or the ones in the
[1:15:22.140 --> 1:15:27.260]  democrats he says he says they're always picked by the council and foreign relations and all you
[1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:31.820]  have to do is have your presidents and your advisors in the council and foreign relations
[1:15:31.820 --> 1:15:35.980]  the rest of the lesser politicians can have a form of competition between them
[1:15:35.980 --> 1:15:40.380]  but it doesn't matter the ones at the top always belong to the council and foreign relations and
[1:15:40.380 --> 1:15:45.580]  the trilateral commission absolutely let's cut back to alex he just showed a shy insight on
[1:15:45.580 --> 1:15:49.180]  one of these makeshift prisons where they literally had the statue of liberty another
[1:15:49.180 --> 1:15:55.820]  hemaphroditic illuminati symbol actually but let's cut back to alex right now yelling screaming
[1:15:55.820 --> 1:16:01.100]  cussing uh fox news yesterday only went to the bad protest only went to one little group
[1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:05.660]  of young people going after you screw you ah you know looking like total scum
[1:16:05.660 --> 1:16:09.500]  instead of all the women with baby strollers and the nice families this is how they demonize
[1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:15.740]  anti-war folks we're here at the dnc because the democrats obviously were swept into office
[1:16:15.740 --> 1:16:20.460]  almost two years ago uh in the congress and the house and senate supposedly in the war
[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:24.620]  you got over 90 percent of democrats wanting to end the war about 65 percent of republicans
[1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:28.940]  wanting to end the war the vast majority of america people close to 80 percent but it doesn't end
[1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:33.260]  well that's why they're putting this police state into place because they know it's all of these
[1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:37.260]  are used as drills as training they admit they are to get them better and better at controlling
[1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:44.620]  populations i am just so angry we didn't show up five minutes earlier because we showed up here
[1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:49.900]  and the microwave gun was being wheeled out and i saw it i saw it it had the jack so they could
[1:16:49.900 --> 1:16:55.340]  jack it up it had the control system it's exactly what we saw in 60 minutes rob come over here
[1:16:55.340 --> 1:17:00.700]  which one of you i want to get i want to get rob on camera rob tell folks what you saw did you get
[1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:07.020]  it on video it's on this camera yeah i got maybe uh as i tell the camera around the car was moving
[1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:11.100]  and they came out we're going this way we were going that way so it's beautiful so i bought a pot
[1:17:11.100 --> 1:17:16.300]  like on the corner of the screen uh maybe half talking about this but i did see it like by the time
[1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:21.260]  my brain was like you've got a whole camera yeah i drove past it man i got a good look at it all
[1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:25.100]  right let's uh let's let alex go we'll go right back to him again they're still right on the
[1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:30.540]  scene at that detention center uh let's take some of your callers uh calls for alan watt right now
[1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:39.180]  let's go to roi in missouri roi what's on your mind are you there roi um all right if roi drop
[1:17:39.180 --> 1:17:44.940]  let's go to no oh you're there okay what's on your mind roi hey anyway what i what i was uh
[1:17:44.940 --> 1:17:50.780]  getting i was going to get out here was that it seems to me that uh the resolution to our problems
[1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:59.180]  have already been clearly defined in 1776 which is in the declaration of independence it says
[1:17:59.180 --> 1:18:03.820]  it's our duty to throw off this government well absolutely i mean that's why the second
[1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:09.100]  amendment's there is that if this government ever gets out of control the uh people are there to
[1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:14.380]  overthrow it violently if necessary i mean right i agree with you there i mean i absolutely i just
[1:18:14.380 --> 1:18:20.060]  don't see people uh attempting to do so not even peacefully because they just not in tune with the
[1:18:20.060 --> 1:18:26.940]  issues roi i'm curious about more than anything maybe somebody can tell me is that uh to properly
[1:18:26.940 --> 1:18:33.180]  do this wouldn't we have to have like a uh a representative from each state you know signed
[1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:40.140]  like a uh a minor league uh rewritten declaration of independence to be produced to uh like congress
[1:18:40.140 --> 1:18:46.380]  oh well let's ask alan watt roi thanks for the call what do you think alan well it is true um that's
[1:18:46.380 --> 1:18:54.860]  why you see that's why they've taken so long to brainwash the american public and to um basically
[1:18:54.860 --> 1:19:01.500]  amnesia a state of amnesia you must create amnesia and psychological warfare and lack of will
[1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:08.460]  as well as another factor that comes into it you do that by socialization and entertainment
[1:19:09.020 --> 1:19:14.700]  and keeping them busy with other things so they're not involved in their own um self determination
[1:19:14.700 --> 1:19:21.180]  so that was been a long psychological war that's helped us to happen it's only at the beginning
[1:19:21.180 --> 1:19:27.020]  when you see it beginning to happen that you can actually take um it into your own hands and do
[1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:31.740]  something about it because you still have the will you still have the memory of what you're
[1:19:31.740 --> 1:19:36.460]  you're wanting to retain and why you fought in the first place to try and get those rights
[1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:43.260]  that's gone with the general public exactly and lincoln lincoln did state though that any um
[1:19:43.260 --> 1:19:50.140]  any one of the states and and and so did franklin too that wanted to withdraw from this confederation
[1:19:50.140 --> 1:19:55.420]  had the right to do so yeah i'm with you apathy has taken over in this country and it is very very
[1:19:55.420 --> 1:20:00.460]  unfortunate to do something the people must have the will again info wars dot com prison planet dot

[1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:38.540]  about it so it didn't exist again what are local police doing running secret prisons what are they
[1:25:38.540 --> 1:25:46.140]  doing running secret facilities why did they why did they lie about that all right let's let's go back
[1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:51.020]  to alan walk is i want to get his take on these underground cities over in denver colorado for
[1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:56.460]  those that don't know the denver international airport is just full of gargoyles occultic paintings
[1:25:57.100 --> 1:26:04.300]  sickles hammers all sorts of weird symbolism and like alex just said you know this seems to be the
[1:26:04.300 --> 1:26:08.940]  the home of the shadow government the cia i think is moving in one of their bases there it's going
[1:26:08.940 --> 1:26:14.460]  to be larger than the one in virginia so this is a hub for this uh... quote unquote new world order
[1:26:14.460 --> 1:26:21.260]  isn't it alan there's no doubt uh... they've been setting it up for a long time that's part of this
[1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:27.340]  era we're going through the envisage this time would come when it has to push with with military
[1:26:27.340 --> 1:26:33.340]  might to take over the whole planet and every and the mind of every person as well and so they
[1:26:33.340 --> 1:26:39.740]  knew they'd have to start building up internal police forces really militaries to deal with the
[1:26:39.740 --> 1:26:44.140]  fallout when the public start to have their toys and their goodies taken away from them
[1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:50.620]  and their economy is gradually basically inflated out of sight they're told money is worth nothing
[1:26:50.620 --> 1:26:55.980]  so they've been preparing for this for many many many years and uh... the preparing for their own
[1:26:55.980 --> 1:27:01.660]  continuity of government as well they have bases for the united states not only in in the u.s
[1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:05.820]  they have once in a while in australia they've been building for twenty years for continuity of
[1:27:05.820 --> 1:27:11.740]  government in case they have to move to australia so that this is an international elite remember
[1:27:11.740 --> 1:27:17.260]  and the world is their playground and they rule over us even when they keep us under the illusions
[1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:22.540]  occasionally when it suits them but we're still a national sovereignty all right let's take another
[1:27:22.540 --> 1:27:27.740]  caller let's uh... let's go to scott in arizona scott what's on your mind
[1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:33.020]  hey jason um... and and i would like to add one of my questions that i have for
[1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:38.460]  is that eighty percent population reduction down to five hundred millions um they've got to do this
[1:27:38.460 --> 1:27:42.780]  sometimes and i don't think they're going to hold off for many years to make that to happen
[1:27:42.780 --> 1:27:47.260]  the only way they can get this military uh... where you can go where they're going to scrounge
[1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:52.220]  up into camps is they're going to have to release some kind of bio-terrorism on us
[1:27:52.860 --> 1:27:57.340]  and a big grand scale or a regular war to get us into camps because no other way they're going
[1:27:57.340 --> 1:28:01.260]  to be able to do it well you know i've heard that you know they possibly may use codex
[1:28:01.260 --> 1:28:07.100]  elementarius which is uh... food regulation to just you know basically make the population so
[1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:10.860]  sick because they don't have the proper nutrients that they will die on their own i thank you for
[1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:15.180]  the call what's your take on that alan well people people have already been dying on mass
[1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:20.700]  it's not all together at the same time but we've been dying uh... increasing in numbers
[1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:26.540]  with the pre-aging diseases for the last thirty years and it's escalating there's never been
[1:28:26.540 --> 1:28:31.740]  a time when there's so many tumors of all kinds hitting younger people not just from the cell
[1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:36.940]  phones but from other means as well they've also denaturalized your food until there's hardly
[1:28:36.940 --> 1:28:42.140]  anything in it worth eating and they just two days ago passed along the u.s. that they could
[1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:47.740]  irradiate your vegetables as well to make sure that there's nothing worth eating the only thing
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:52.860]  that's worth eating probably is the E. coli because it's only source of protein left so i'm not
[1:28:52.860 --> 1:28:57.340]  kidding you they're they're they're they're basically making it so unhealthy and so unfit
[1:28:57.340 --> 1:29:03.100]  which falls into the whole plan because we are you have pure nourishment pure nutrients like
[1:29:03.100 --> 1:29:08.780]  mouth is said the people can't think too swiftly they're more obedient to do what they're told
[1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:14.780]  they're always lethargic that falls right in with the line again of what they want to do plus
[1:29:15.340 --> 1:29:19.740]  the weakened immune systems make them wide open to die off from even simple
[1:29:19.740 --> 1:29:25.980]  viruses or bacteria which normally would not affect them absolutely alan you are just a great

[1:36:22.300 --> 1:36:32.700]  to 208 weeks of supply now we're talking about 156 weeks is two dollars and 25 cents a week
[1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:43.500]  and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to multiply 225 by 156 and that'll give you the
[1:36:43.500 --> 1:36:50.780]  total cost factor and if you really want to save some big money then get our four to five years

[1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:12.300]  talking about honestly spending so much so little money i mean for five years you're
[1:37:12.300 --> 1:37:17.420]  literally talking less than a hundred dollars a year to clean your clothes to clean yourself
[1:37:17.420 --> 1:37:23.340]  it's unbelievable and this stuff is non-toxic completely natural triple concentrated

[1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:08.140]  now investment means to save money that's an investment and that's what we're talking about

[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:45.580]  has really done me nothing but good things and you know i came out here i i watched my clothes for
[1:38:45.580 --> 1:38:50.700]  the first time and i started getting itchy you get that sometimes when you use these detergents
[1:38:50.700 --> 1:38:55.820]  that they sell at the supermarket you don't get that when you go to five-star soap dot com do you
[1:38:55.820 --> 1:39:03.260]  know because the coconut oils and the vegetable oils lubricate the fabric lubricate the skin so
[1:39:03.260 --> 1:39:10.380]  that it removes all the toxins all the detergents all the toxic ingredients all the antibacterials
[1:39:10.380 --> 1:39:16.620]  all the crap they put in there through all the fillers and then none other than invasive materials
[1:39:16.620 --> 1:39:21.900]  who needs it they have a choice now and this is what's so great alex has been using our products

[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:38.860]  think i can go back i'm probably gonna have to order some when i go to new york but really
[1:39:38.860 --> 1:39:42.860]  why don't you just go over all the different products that you do offer i mean you you run
[1:39:42.860 --> 1:39:47.660]  the gamut anything that needs to be cleaned you take care of well i could get a bulk package of
[1:39:47.660 --> 1:39:54.700]  three to four or four to five year supply lasts a long time saves them a tremendous amount thousands
[1:39:54.700 --> 1:40:01.900]  of dollars worth of of cash they can also not allow maybe they think they're a little i'm not sure
[1:40:01.900 --> 1:40:08.780]  sounds too good to be true well i'm telling you it's good and it's true they can get a free catalog
[1:40:08.780 --> 1:40:16.380]  describing everything in detail they can also to be on the safe side order a one month supply
[1:40:16.380 --> 1:40:22.540]  which is a sample of supply for twenty dollars plus shipping to their home it'll last four to eight
[1:40:22.540 --> 1:40:27.500]  weeks depending on the family and that gives them a return that's something that lasts a day
[1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:35.340]  or a week we want to detoxify the skin the laundry the clothing the environment in their home and
[1:40:35.340 --> 1:40:42.300]  that's why we say four to eight weeks you'll know what you want what you can use what it costs you
[1:40:42.300 --> 1:40:48.620]  and this is our guarantee unconditional one hundred percent we're talking about the four basic

[1:42:58.220 --> 1:43:05.340]  we try to educate not sell but educate the consumer that they do have freedom of choice
[1:43:05.340 --> 1:43:11.340]  of buying something that's not available in the supermarket not available by mass merchandisers
[1:43:11.340 --> 1:43:18.060]  we are not a billion dollar company or a small family company that knows what we're doing and
[1:43:18.060 --> 1:43:24.300]  that's important we know it that's why we can guarantee it and we're talking about a cost factor
[1:43:24.300 --> 1:43:29.980]  i mean we're talking factory direct we eliminate the middleman the broker the wholesaler the job
[1:43:29.980 --> 1:43:36.140]  are all these people that mark up the products and right now you it doesn't take much to go
[1:43:36.140 --> 1:43:40.940]  to the supermarket and look in the shelf and i'll tell you what's really aggravating there are no
[1:43:40.940 --> 1:43:47.580]  prices on anything there is a barcode on all the products and you have to go to the checkout counter
[1:43:47.580 --> 1:43:55.260]  to read the barcode it will sell cleaning 595 concentrate 1295 it doesn't even specify the
[1:43:55.260 --> 1:44:00.460]  brand and the quality and the kind of product you're buying absolutely zero so you don't know
[1:44:00.460 --> 1:44:05.580]  whether you're getting ripped off or not because you don't know what it cost you to buy the tide
[1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:11.740]  and the oil and the dash and the cheer and it don't take much to take up a bar of zest or dev
[1:44:11.740 --> 1:44:18.940]  or irish spring read the panel they have anywhere from 15 to 20 chemicals in the bar it's listed
[1:44:18.940 --> 1:44:25.180]  right on the bar and a predominant item is sodium chloride and you're thinking sodium
[1:44:25.180 --> 1:44:32.380]  core must be a new cleaner no sodium chloride is table salt all these products have a vast
[1:44:32.380 --> 1:44:41.020]  majority of table salt a white table salt doesn't clean would you wash your face your body maybe
[1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:48.140]  with table salt through your break it's a filler it's an inert ingredient it's a weight enhancer

[1:54:17.820 --> 1:54:24.300]  people by this makeshift attention center who were very well aware of provocaturing of state
[1:54:24.300 --> 1:54:31.020]  sponsored tariff um it says it's not broadcasting now i'm not sure if it is if it is can we go to it

[1:54:45.100 --> 1:54:50.220]  from you or perhaps alex will call in himself well let's take this opportunity to get to some of
[1:54:50.220 --> 1:54:54.700]  the other callers that have been holding on patiently for quite some time now let's go to
[1:54:54.700 --> 1:55:01.020]  derrick in texas derrick what's on your mind hey jason thanks for having me on sure thing
[1:55:01.900 --> 1:55:06.860]  uh started a campaign of a couple years ago actually getting the truth out on national
[1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:13.340]  radio indicator radio if the audience isn't aware each 30 seconds on a national syndicated show
[1:55:13.340 --> 1:55:16.940]  is about three or four thousand dollars an advertisement about you know money
[1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:22.380]  and i would like everyone that's listening to this show because this show tends to be activists
[1:55:22.380 --> 1:55:29.020]  to just take time out of your week to make one call to rush limbaugh hannity medved whatever
[1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:34.540]  going on the topic that they're talking about and immediately go to the nist report immediately
[1:55:34.540 --> 1:55:39.660]  go to the 9-11 commission reporter whatever your particular item is and jason uh since you're now
[1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:45.340]  in talk radio give your me or other listeners strategies because if you're going to go to
[1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:49.980]  this topic it's going to be pretty much a 30 second and you're out and sometimes like mark
[1:55:49.980 --> 1:55:55.340]  levin showed or even delay you out give us some strategies on one and out and then on like michael
[1:55:55.340 --> 1:56:00.380]  medved he'll go toe to toe with you on 9-11 truth and you know like friday i called in and he gave
[1:56:00.380 --> 1:56:04.860]  me four minutes to yak about the nist report so if you would please uh touch on that you got a
[1:56:04.860 --> 1:56:08.300]  thanks for the call man all right derrick this is what i would do first of all you bring up the
[1:56:08.300 --> 1:56:12.860]  molten metal as fact and you say uh what do you have to say about the molten metal that was both
[1:56:12.860 --> 1:56:17.420]  taped on the scene of the world trade center collapse and then found in the days after under
[1:56:17.420 --> 1:56:24.060]  world trade centers one two six and seven uh this was denied by john gross of nist but has
[1:56:24.060 --> 1:56:30.300]  been confirmed by the nasa thermal imagery and cut um that is one of the many things that i would
[1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:35.820]  use i would also probably use the stance that nist has retracted that they had a video and
[1:56:35.820 --> 1:56:41.500]  photographs no one else had that suggested that one third of the lower of uh south face was scooped
[1:56:41.500 --> 1:56:46.620]  out or one fourth of the entire building 10 to 12 stories i would ask their opinion on that i would
[1:56:46.620 --> 1:56:51.900]  ask uh what their opinion is on the animations that they made from the blueprints and the fact
[1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:58.460]  that they did no scientific analysis to actually uh inject those beams with the uh proper physics
[1:56:58.460 --> 1:57:01.660]  in other words they should have certain physical properties they did no such thing they just
[1:57:01.660 --> 1:57:07.100]  animated what they felt happened so those are three quick points um i mean you gotta be quick
[1:57:07.100 --> 1:57:11.740]  on your feet you gotta be well educated on the matter i'm not sure everybody should be calling
[1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:16.300]  up these shows because some people just don't know how to talk but if you are a gabor like myself
[1:57:16.300 --> 1:57:22.060]  or you do know what's going on derrick's got a great idea i mean uh you know john uh
[1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:28.380]  and or i'm sorry uh mark dice formerly known as john connor is calling for everyone to do this on
[1:57:28.380 --> 1:57:32.940]  september 11 and i think we do it i think nine eleven truth has to have a huge showing nationwide
[1:57:32.940 --> 1:57:39.180]  especially calling international radio shows like limbaugh hannity orie lee gibson all these you
[1:57:39.180 --> 1:57:46.700]  know right wing neo cons neo nazis really that continue to hide the truth and misconstrue the
[1:57:46.700 --> 1:57:52.220]  truth and basically string along these zombified audiences that are like let's bomb the middle
[1:57:52.220 --> 1:57:58.140]  east into a glass parking lot let's take over russia we can do it we're number one we need

[1:59:25.340 --> 1:59:30.620]  in laudans connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection
[1:59:30.620 --> 1:59:35.580]  the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more

[1:59:47.980 --> 1:59:59.260]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio networks
[2:00:05.660 --> 2:00:12.940]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:22.220]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:30.540 --> 2:00:34.620]  all right folks we're back and hopefully alex will be joining us on the phone sometime soon
[2:00:34.620 --> 2:00:40.060]  we have bob Chapman coming up on hold right now but let's uh let's go back to joe in pennsylvania
[2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:46.300]  and uh give him his say how you doing joe oh pretty good uh i just wanted to touch on what
[2:00:46.300 --> 2:00:52.380]  scott in arizona was saying from all the research i've been doing over the past few months it looks
[2:00:52.380 --> 2:01:00.060]  like our time is short i think they're going to probably use this russia georgia thing to actually
[2:01:00.060 --> 2:01:06.220]  stage their next false flag attack here on our soil that's what it looks like to me and so you
[2:01:06.220 --> 2:01:10.620]  think that the new terrorists are going to be white is what you're saying well the old ones
[2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:15.740]  were weren't they well not publicly but i you know and now the simon weasenthal center is
[2:01:15.740 --> 2:01:19.820]  presenting these blonde blue hired al qaeda they're presenting architects and engineers
[2:01:19.820 --> 2:01:24.860]  for 911 truth is a conspiracy theory group that's pro al qaeda so you know anything's in the making
[2:01:24.860 --> 2:01:31.900]  but keep going yeah but that's basically you know all the research that i've done listening to alex
[2:01:31.900 --> 2:01:41.580]  uh watching all all the uh all of your loose change additions uh blueprint for global enslavement
[2:01:41.580 --> 2:01:48.460]  all of that pretty much says that uh we don't have years left i don't know if we have years left we
[2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:54.300]  may have a decade left of you know sparse freedom here and there but you know what let's take bob
[2:01:54.300 --> 2:01:58.940]  chatman's uh opinion on the matter what do you think bob do you think that a false flag terror
[2:01:58.940 --> 2:02:04.380]  attack is in the works to be blamed on russia now possible but not probable
[2:02:05.180 --> 2:02:11.260]  um i i think they started to accomplish what they want to accomplish and it backfired on
[2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:20.940]  and that might sound like uh an idiom but it's not um rusher uh over the weekend uh told israel
[2:02:20.940 --> 2:02:28.300]  if they continued to uh send armaments of offense to georgia that they're going to arm
[2:02:28.300 --> 2:02:33.820]  the other nations in their area with offensive arms and they have talks going on right now with
[2:02:33.820 --> 2:02:42.780]  syria and that'll be the beginning so there's the escalation phases begun and uh uh i as far as
[2:02:42.780 --> 2:02:52.860]  false flag attacks based on georgia and rusher i don't think so um i i think in at this time
[2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:58.860]  and they're going to have a hard time pulling off some kind of a false flag attack because
[2:02:58.860 --> 2:03:03.500]  you know who do they blame it on i mean that's the question i mean who do they blame it on do
[2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:07.740]  they blame it on the traditional al-qaeda and try to say that iran has something to do with it
[2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:12.860]  do they blame it strictly on iran do they blame it on uh separatists or anarchists within the
[2:03:12.860 --> 2:03:20.060]  country uh do they now blame it on you know russian spies it's really wide open it is so
[2:03:20.060 --> 2:03:28.140]  and and you know uh uh how believable is it going to be uh after what you and others have done
[2:03:28.700 --> 2:03:35.260]  in the massive exposure of the scam that we just went through which is 9 11 and in terrorism
[2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:42.940]  uh i think uh it's like the boy called wolf uh he he called once too often and uh which in
[2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:50.940]  this case is only twice if you want to call Oklahoma City one of them and it probably was and so i
[2:03:51.580 --> 2:03:59.180]  i think that uh they just really made a mess out of things again and i think they'd like to start
[2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:07.580]  and and prolong uh hostilities uh in georgia and in the Balkans and i think that that will happen
[2:04:07.580 --> 2:04:14.460]  and but i think you know more even more importantly uh the reason why they're doing that and in my
[2:04:14.460 --> 2:04:21.100]  mind is that to take the heat off of western europe canada united states and they're terrible
[2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:27.820]  financial and economic economic problems and so uh whatever the reason there's going to be
[2:04:27.820 --> 2:04:35.580]  continued conflict and now russia will be involved in quite frankly uh i don't think with the exception
[2:04:35.580 --> 2:04:42.460]  of high technology weaponry uh we're no match for them right now it's bob Chapman from the
[2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:46.380]  international forecaster dot com we're going to be getting his opinion on world affairs in the next

[2:08:21.260 --> 2:08:27.580]  dot com and i want to switch gears a little bit bob i i want to get your economic forecast for the
[2:08:27.580 --> 2:08:32.300]  united states for the next month uh where do we seem to be heading it looks like uh you know gas
[2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:37.020]  has gotten a little bit cheaper at the pump doesn't seem like they're gouging food prices as much as
[2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:41.420]  they were perhaps two weeks ago three weeks ago but what are we going to see now that the summer
[2:08:41.420 --> 2:08:47.340]  is ending and we're coming into the fall well i think uh prices are going to continue to move higher
[2:08:47.980 --> 2:08:55.420]  uh in food and in probably an energy because i think oil and the energy complex as well as
[2:08:55.420 --> 2:09:01.260]  the agricultural complex are basing out i think they're finding support uh it'll wallow around
[2:09:01.260 --> 2:09:08.380]  here perhaps for another week or two uh in golden silver and i think it'll take a little longer
[2:09:08.380 --> 2:09:13.900]  for commodities to reset a bottom all right bob i gotta interrupt you just because alex is calling
[2:09:13.900 --> 2:09:17.900]  in live from the dnc i'm sorry about the preemption we'll go right back to you alex are you with us

[2:09:47.660 --> 2:09:52.460]  overdrive the day because the anarchist little hirelings have walked off the street again we
[2:09:52.460 --> 2:09:58.780]  are now rushing from a femur camp recharging our laptop batteries to go live uh over there so
[2:09:58.780 --> 2:10:01.900]  getting through traffic it's really hard to run the gauntlet but we should be there
[2:10:01.900 --> 2:10:06.220]  uh the police are marching in now this already exploded yesterday with uh
[2:10:06.220 --> 2:10:11.500]  much people being arrested being taken to secret femur camp uh and so i'll be calling back up by
[2:10:11.500 --> 2:10:15.660]  the end of the hour maybe even in the overdrive i'll tell everyone overdrive so i'll give you
[2:10:15.660 --> 2:10:19.900]  live reports and again there's a video feed up on info wars dot com that will be going live off
[2:10:19.900 --> 2:10:24.460]  and on throughout the day back about jenny all right thank you yeah we've got these live reports
[2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:31.420]  from the dnc all day bob and i apologize for all that's fine but that's that's uh you can always
[2:10:31.420 --> 2:10:37.180]  have me on again but this is live and it's exciting and you're getting the scoop right from the
[2:10:37.180 --> 2:10:41.100]  street so that's more important well what do you what do you think about the dnc obviously you've
[2:10:41.100 --> 2:10:45.180]  been on in the past few months you know about the drills that they ran the black helicopters you
[2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:49.340]  know that they set up detention centers you know that they're planning on using some of these microwave
[2:10:49.340 --> 2:10:54.460]  weapons you even know about recreate 68 and their attempts to try to provocateur violence
[2:10:54.460 --> 2:11:00.620]  and really shut down any form of real dissent so i mean you know it doesn't we're trying to
[2:11:00.620 --> 2:11:05.660]  shatter the left right paradigm that's why we're at the dnc right now what do you think uh the
[2:11:05.660 --> 2:11:11.900]  predictions are going to be for the weekend well i think that um you will have the uh
[2:11:11.900 --> 2:11:19.020]  junk provocateurs there and uh not only in 68 did they do it in the united states but they did it
[2:11:19.020 --> 2:11:27.500]  all over Europe if you remember Danny Cohen bended uh he's been in uh in the Bundestag in Germany
[2:11:27.500 --> 2:11:35.180]  for a number of years as an elected representative so it shows you how things can turn but um and
[2:11:35.180 --> 2:11:43.820]  obviously he was working in a secret but capacity in doing what he did in paris but uh yes they will
[2:11:43.820 --> 2:11:52.780]  continue to try to do that and um you know i had a conversation with uh tony hilder in 1964 about
[2:11:52.780 --> 2:11:57.900]  what we're seeing today and what we saw in the 60s and what we were trying to do and still trying
[2:11:57.900 --> 2:12:05.100]  to do is bring the left and the right together so to speak and it's working and we're all
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:13.980]  Americans and we all want generally the same thing peace and prosperity and uh the other forces uh
[2:12:13.980 --> 2:12:19.500]  the alumnus who run our government uh they're not very happy about that and so whenever they
[2:12:19.500 --> 2:12:26.220]  get it can get can get an opportunity to create havoc toward their aims and goals they will do
[2:12:26.220 --> 2:12:33.580]  so in this convention is one of them um did you see this morning the filing of a lawsuit against
[2:12:33.580 --> 2:12:43.820]  mr. obama by an attorney who is will call him in the hillary clinton camp this is the philberg one
[2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:49.900]  is it is just the philberg uh uh lawsuit about philberg i mean he's he's been uh you know he's
[2:12:49.900 --> 2:12:54.300]  dabbed in 9 11 truth if you will by representing some of the family members in an early lawsuit
[2:12:54.300 --> 2:13:00.780]  against saudi arabia and i did do alex's sunday show yesterday someone did briefly uh bring that up
[2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:07.580]  it had to do with uh his citizenship uh apparently not being born in the states uh you know i i think
[2:13:07.580 --> 2:13:12.060]  that's in both corsie's book and uh tarpley's book what are you elaborate on that for us
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:23.260]  well it's basically the way that you've said it and there is a uh a reproduction of a document
[2:13:23.260 --> 2:13:29.740]  showing that he's an indonesian i've seen the reproduction in fact we had it in the forecaster
[2:13:29.740 --> 2:13:35.260]  as a link on saturday uh i believe either it's in the next issue i can't keep track and that's
[2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:41.420]  apparently been corroborated by the associated press is what i've heard and that's right so what
[2:13:41.420 --> 2:13:47.420]  do they do at the convention that uh you know this ought to be interesting well absolutely i mean
[2:13:47.420 --> 2:13:50.780]  you know the hillary fans are going to say hey wait a minute this guy isn't qualified
[2:13:51.980 --> 2:13:56.460]  it's it's very interesting and they've been promoting this guy what's your feeling on them
[2:13:56.460 --> 2:14:02.140]  taking joseph biden as uh the pick for vp obviously one of these globalist guys one of the good old
[2:14:02.140 --> 2:14:07.260]  boys member of the cfr well aware well aware of the new world order given several speeches on the
[2:14:07.260 --> 2:14:11.820]  matter wrote about it in the wall street journal what's your opinion of joey b as i like to call him
[2:14:13.100 --> 2:14:20.140]  well i think he is is uh two things number one the strength the real strength in the ticket uh
[2:14:20.140 --> 2:14:26.380]  from the alumina's viewpoint because he's been involved for a long time and uh they i guess
[2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:32.380]  wouldn't mind having him as president if mr obama were to be elected and stepped out of line
[2:14:32.380 --> 2:14:39.660]  that would be the iluminati line and uh if they had to assassinate him then they wouldn't worry
[2:14:39.660 --> 2:14:44.460]  about it because they could biden in there that seems to me that's the way they look at it and
[2:14:44.460 --> 2:14:48.940]  that's why he was chosen well you know i always thought the emphasis was either going to be on
[2:14:48.940 --> 2:14:53.980]  hillary or edwards and then they burned edwards with his affair scandal and then it was kind of
[2:14:53.980 --> 2:14:58.620]  up and up up in the air it could have been anybody and then they started mentioning biden and i guess
[2:14:58.620 --> 2:15:04.060]  i kind of lucked out because in my new movie fabled enemies i show biden's ties to the pakistani
[2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:09.420]  isi and the fact that he was well aware that they were funneling money into the taliban and al-qaeda
[2:15:09.420 --> 2:15:15.260]  through this inter-services intelligence organization that the cia created in the eighties
[2:15:15.260 --> 2:15:20.780]  and uh we get him to admit on camera that indeed uh general memud Ahmed was funding the hijackers
[2:15:20.780 --> 2:15:26.060]  and the taliban and later that that evidence was classified now he was a huge tough talker on
[2:15:26.060 --> 2:15:31.500]  september 12th he went before the house he threatened pakistan and as you know pakistan
[2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:36.540]  cowed down to all of our demands we were able to uh put troops there and launch them into the
[2:15:36.540 --> 2:15:41.980]  afghanistan aggression right from pakistan and that government has been nothing but a us public
[2:15:41.980 --> 2:15:46.220]  government for some time now and now with musharov stepping down nothing seems to change
[2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:52.780]  no and the boutou family have been working for mi6 and the cia for years
[2:15:54.140 --> 2:15:58.300]  yeah i mean i don't know killed his wife and he's the next candidate
[2:15:58.300 --> 2:16:05.020]  yeah i don't know killed his wife but uh i do know uh first hand that she was an agent
[2:16:05.900 --> 2:16:10.940]  i i believe it i mean she seems to be that way she did spread out that information a lot of people
[2:16:10.940 --> 2:16:16.860]  have tried to get me to pick up on where she was on the bbc and said that uh omar sayid sheik
[2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:22.540]  who was uh actually facilitating these all wire transfers this money laundering by the isi for
[2:16:22.540 --> 2:16:28.540]  general memud Ahmed had killed osal bin laden and that he had uh connections to many and in
[2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:32.780]  intelligence organization and indeed omar sayid shake dead he was involved in the kidnapping
[2:16:32.780 --> 2:16:39.740]  of daniel pearl and his murder and also involved in funding some of the 911 hijackers quote unquote
[2:16:39.740 --> 2:16:44.140]  but i'm not quite sure that he assassinated bin laden that doesn't necessarily mean that i think
[2:16:44.140 --> 2:16:48.540]  that bin laden is alive but i think that that might have been some well placed this info
[2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:54.620]  it could be right and um but that's the way that line looks beginning back to biden
[2:16:55.420 --> 2:17:03.500]  um he is just doing exactly as he is told is told to do and has been uh previously in his
[2:17:03.500 --> 2:17:09.180]  position in the senate and so he'll do what they want him to do and that's why they want him there
[2:17:09.180 --> 2:17:14.940]  and in case they have to remove obama and you know we wouldn't be talking this way if we hadn't seen
[2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:22.300]  uh the assassination of john kennedy among many many other people uh in the interim uh the
[2:17:22.300 --> 2:17:29.340]  thousands and thousands of people uh that they've suicided in in all of these things and um i've
[2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:34.780]  talked to alex about this a number of times and and that puts us you and i in jeopardy as well
[2:17:34.780 --> 2:17:39.820]  because um there's going to come a time probably when they want to kind of come along and whack us
[2:17:39.820 --> 2:17:47.100]  too absolutely if you don't think that you know people like alex jones bob Chapman uh myself
[2:17:47.100 --> 2:17:52.780]  alan watt kevin ryan the list goes on or on some sort of a list well they're on public lists folks
[2:17:52.780 --> 2:17:58.860]  i mean when you see the simon weasenthal center presenting us as terrorists white al qaeda you
[2:17:58.860 --> 2:18:03.340]  better believe that we're on a list at homeland security you better believe that we're on a
[2:18:03.340 --> 2:18:08.860]  watch list for the fbi you just never know when they're going to decide to pull the trigger and
[2:18:08.860 --> 2:18:12.940]  say that's it we're going to round them up i mean the patriot act gave them this right with section
[2:18:12.940 --> 2:18:19.020]  802 basically allows them to arrest you for anything really just thinking about committing a crime or
[2:18:19.020 --> 2:18:23.740]  not even thinking about it just you know maybe talking about something that might be illegal
[2:18:23.740 --> 2:18:27.740]  in somebody's eyes and they can detain you forever basically call you an enemy combatant you will
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:32.220]  get no trial and even if you do get some kind of a mock trial maybe a military tribunal it's
[2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:36.940]  highly controlled the media does not have access to you you can be sentenced to you know one to
[2:18:36.940 --> 2:18:41.020]  five years such as bin laden's limo driver but then they can just turn around and say like well
[2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:44.540]  we don't know if we're going to be released in him in one to five years we might just hold him
[2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:50.460]  indefinitely it's really incredible but what it tells people if they get any brains whatsoever
[2:18:51.020 --> 2:18:57.020]  is that you let now live all under a corporate fact a corporate as fascist dictatorial government
[2:18:57.020 --> 2:19:02.940]  it's already begun and you're seeing that in reference to what alex is doing this week at
[2:19:02.940 --> 2:19:08.860]  the convention and the efforts that have been put into subduing anything that they don't want to
[2:19:08.860 --> 2:19:14.300]  happen i mean you don't run around with people in combat outfits with combat gear and combat
[2:19:14.300 --> 2:19:20.620]  weaponry to put down people who are screaming and yelling in the streets absolutely not and that's
[2:19:20.620 --> 2:19:26.860]  why they had these organizations like unconventional action and recreate 68 to try to get the lemmings
[2:19:26.860 --> 2:19:33.500]  to come and protest in shields with red paint and armor and to provocateur these events to
[2:19:33.500 --> 2:19:38.220]  destroy cameras when they saw them they want nothing but violence here so they can shut down
[2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:43.980]  any sensible meaningful peaceful protest we're going to be back with bob Chapman of the international

[2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:37.100]  dot com we're on the line with bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com
[2:24:37.100 --> 2:24:42.220]  we're gonna go to some of your calls so hopefully you got a question for bob or myself it looks like
[2:24:42.220 --> 2:24:47.820]  resheen in new york has been holding the longest so let's go to resheen you with us
[2:24:47.820 --> 2:24:53.420]  all right let's go to joe or we already went to joe let's go to chuck in indiana then
[2:24:55.820 --> 2:25:01.580]  hi jason how you doing chuck what's on your mind um i got a question for bob i've been
[2:25:01.580 --> 2:25:07.660]  reading over the weekend that uh george is set to uh make another offensive against the russian
[2:25:07.660 --> 2:25:12.860]  peacekeepers and uh i just wondered what your thoughts were on that sure thing thanks for the
[2:25:12.860 --> 2:25:18.220]  call what's your thoughts bob uh first of all i didn't see that um i certainly take your word
[2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:24.940]  for it um i don't see that happening uh the the russian force will just come back in that that's
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:32.380]  been removed and this time they won't stop uh you know at gory and some of the other places
[2:25:32.380 --> 2:25:38.540]  in the country they'll just take the whole place over and um and that could elicit uh
[2:25:38.540 --> 2:25:45.260]  uh nato action although uh georgia doesn't belong to nato i don't know how the u.s will handle that
[2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:53.100]  they would have to perhaps have to do it unilaterally um outside of nato but um where that
[2:25:53.100 --> 2:25:59.420]  to happen that would be the result and the russians are perfectly easily capable of
[2:25:59.420 --> 2:26:06.300]  taking over georgia and the ukraine for that matter without uh any any great effort whatsoever
[2:26:06.300 --> 2:26:13.980]  uh ukraine's making all kinds of noises about uh blocking the black sea fleet uh from coming into
[2:26:13.980 --> 2:26:21.820]  sebastopol and i don't think they ought to do that uh they may end up as a russian satellite
[2:26:22.860 --> 2:26:27.260]  all right uh let's go to norman in north carolina norman what's on your mind
[2:26:28.540 --> 2:26:35.580]  and uh i just want to take this opportunity to uh commend yourself and alex and and people
[2:26:35.580 --> 2:26:42.220]  like bob who are fighting the good fight and doing it right and you guys are an inspiration um i've
[2:26:42.220 --> 2:26:49.660]  woke up in 2003 and i've been fervently pursuing the truth and sharing it with people and and just
[2:26:49.660 --> 2:26:55.340]  trying to you know be the little bit of leaving that leaves the whole loathe and i'm astounded at
[2:26:55.340 --> 2:27:02.140]  nist that they have chosen to continue down the road of pathological science in the light of all
[2:27:02.140 --> 2:27:08.380]  of the empirical data i witnessed testimony and just common sense information that we have now
[2:27:08.380 --> 2:27:14.140]  we know that building seven was obviously a controlled demolition and it just amazes me
[2:27:14.140 --> 2:27:19.820]  that they continue down this road when we all know that the united states american citizen
[2:27:19.820 --> 2:27:26.300]  is the highest authority in this land and we have valid questions and we deserve valid answers well
[2:27:26.300 --> 2:27:30.460]  we need to start acting like we're number one uh norman and i thank you for the call and i thank
[2:27:30.460 --> 2:27:34.140]  you for all you've done you know without you you know we're not able to spread this message
[2:27:34.140 --> 2:27:37.900]  hopefully you're burning dvds and handing them out but you know of course they couldn't say
[2:27:37.900 --> 2:27:42.300]  controlled demolition i mean they didn't even do any tests to discredit explosives you want
[2:27:42.300 --> 2:27:48.300]  to touch on the world trade center seven nist report really quickly bob uh no i i think you
[2:27:48.300 --> 2:27:54.220]  covered it uh it's it's true it's just unbelievable i'm not an expert at it and i can't really add
[2:27:54.220 --> 2:28:00.060]  to it yeah but obviously you think it's a sham correct oh absolutely i when i i was watching
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:05.420]  television and i looked at my wife and i said you know that's a prepared demo what it was
[2:28:05.420 --> 2:28:11.100]  this thing's a setup i knew right away yeah it's pretty incredible and uh you know people like
[2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:16.220]  me who just were not in touch with quote unquote the new world order globalization or false flag
[2:28:16.220 --> 2:28:20.620]  terror on 9 11 just were so dumbfounded to everything that was going on i think that we
[2:28:20.620 --> 2:28:25.100]  were just willing to accept any explanation that was given and things that went into the
[2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:28.860]  background weren't even thought about i mean we were under attack and we knew who the enemy was
[2:28:28.860 --> 2:28:33.020]  and the enemy was bin laden so i didn't give him much thought and a lot of people out there still
[2:28:33.020 --> 2:28:37.100]  haven't given it much thought seven years later even though the constitution and bill of rights
[2:28:37.100 --> 2:28:42.700]  are now down the drain we're in two separate foreign nations as aggressors iraq and afghanistan
[2:28:42.700 --> 2:28:48.140]  we're now helping georgian troops attack south ossetia and russia i mean the insanity has to
[2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:53.500]  stop somewhere and i hope that it stops soon you know one of the other things that norman might be
[2:28:53.500 --> 2:28:59.260]  able to do to you know help himself is probably invest in uh hard assets such as gold and silver
[2:28:59.260 --> 2:29:05.820]  can you tell him how he can do that bob well that's pretty easy um there's mitis of course at the gcn
[2:29:06.460 --> 2:29:13.340]  and his uh deal is all over the country uh who a deal in golden server coins and uh unfortunately
[2:29:13.340 --> 2:29:22.700]  there seems to be a little bit or or a large um uh absence of lots of coins around nowadays
[2:29:22.700 --> 2:29:28.620]  and that all depends on who you talk to but um there's a there's a tremendous departure
[2:29:29.180 --> 2:29:35.740]  uh from the physical market and the futures market which the the uh physical market must
[2:29:35.740 --> 2:29:43.580]  win the future market can't win and incidentally um on the trading last week the cftc's gonna
[2:29:43.580 --> 2:29:50.700]  have to act uh two banks were the ones who drove the price of silver down all right we'll be back
[2:29:50.700 --> 2:29:58.220]  with bob Chapman we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:33:12.780 --> 2:33:17.180]  ryan on for this segment and uh we'll go back to bob chapman later but i really want to discuss
[2:33:17.180 --> 2:33:22.700]  this new nist report with kevin ryan formally of underwriters laboratories who certified the
[2:33:22.700 --> 2:33:28.380]  steel structure used at the world trade center kevin thank you so much for joining us thank you
[2:33:28.380 --> 2:33:32.620]  thank you it's good to be with you it's good to be with you and you know we've interviewed you
[2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:37.900]  a couple times the loose change crew you're a very gracious individual you've dedicated now
[2:33:37.900 --> 2:33:43.820]  more than i believe five years of your life to trying to expose the lie that is uh you know
[2:33:43.820 --> 2:33:48.460]  the control demolitions at world trade center one two and seven give us your thoughts on this
[2:33:48.460 --> 2:33:55.740]  latest nist report well this this is a very surprising report that it's it's really shocking
[2:33:55.740 --> 2:34:02.380]  and uh in that it appears that nist didn't really even try to come up with a legitimate story for
[2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:08.700]  what happened uh we were expecting a great deal more from them and uh you know there's just so
[2:34:08.700 --> 2:34:13.580]  many points that it can be criticized on it it's hard to even know where to begin well let's let's
[2:34:13.580 --> 2:34:19.020]  start with the fact that s shyams under the uh the head of this investigation if you will the mouth
[2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:25.020]  piece talk to popular mechanics uh some three years ago now for their first article on the subject
[2:34:25.020 --> 2:34:30.780]  i think it was in april of oh four that they put this out and he was quoted as saying that up to
[2:34:30.780 --> 2:34:36.860]  25 percent of the building was actually scooped out of the south face on the lower third up to 10
[2:34:36.860 --> 2:34:42.620]  stories and you know we provided video evidence and eyewitness testimony to the contrary and they
[2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:49.340]  seemed to have dropped uh that uh that theory if you will absolutely and uh what he actually said
[2:34:49.340 --> 2:34:56.060]  was uh as you said 25 percent of one third of the face which is one quarter of one third of the
[2:34:56.060 --> 2:35:02.860]  foundation or a 12th of the foundation that was misstated in the in the major media as being
[2:35:02.860 --> 2:35:07.180]  a quarter of the foundation of the building but there's no way they could have proven that and
[2:35:07.180 --> 2:35:13.580]  and uh the the shocking thing or the the the sterling thing is that the buildings on adjacent
[2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:19.580]  sides of world trade center seven were not really damaged at all prior to the fall of of building
[2:35:19.580 --> 2:35:24.940]  seven so just the probabilities that this one building could have this huge amount scooped out
[2:35:24.940 --> 2:35:30.620]  while the buildings on either side equidistant from the north tower did not have any damage
[2:35:30.620 --> 2:35:35.580]  that uh was incredulous i think absolutely now let's talk about the fact that they didn't
[2:35:35.580 --> 2:35:41.020]  even look at the molten metal evidence we know that john gross of nest has denied that there was
[2:35:41.020 --> 2:35:45.580]  molten metal on the scene of world trade center one two six and seven even though we have the
[2:35:45.580 --> 2:35:51.020]  thermal imagery we have ken holden before fema talking about it we have numerous fire fighters
[2:35:51.020 --> 2:35:55.980]  talking about it we have the quote unquote world trade center uh asteroids which is a combination
[2:35:55.980 --> 2:36:02.940]  of the steel iron and concrete that mesh together in one formation we even have which nobody really
[2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:08.940]  talks about the world trade center cross now this was two steel beams that were fused together
[2:36:08.940 --> 2:36:14.460]  in the form of a cross with iron hanging off the side all of it must have been moltenized
[2:36:14.460 --> 2:36:19.420]  for it to be able to come become one solid state isn't that right absolutely and i've
[2:36:19.420 --> 2:36:24.060]  been searching through this report just this weekend just briefly reviewing it i can't find
[2:36:24.060 --> 2:36:29.500]  any references to the comments that fema made about the sulfidation and the high temperature
[2:36:29.500 --> 2:36:35.340]  corrosion so i'm still looking for that but i doubt they're going to have any satisfactory
[2:36:35.340 --> 2:36:42.220]  explanation for molten metal or sulfa sulfidation in the steel or the environmental data of course
[2:36:42.220 --> 2:36:46.700]  that we've recently put out and those are the microspheres in the uh in the thing that shows
[2:36:46.700 --> 2:36:53.260]  that this was moltenized right so if we find microspheres that match the residue of thermite
[2:36:53.260 --> 2:36:58.940]  as dr jones has done then uh that pretty much indicates that there's something other than
[2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:03.660]  cleanup operations and the metal had to be molten at some point in order to form spheres so
[2:37:04.860 --> 2:37:10.140]  yeah molten metal is a key and um i doubt that they're going to have anything in this report
[2:37:10.140 --> 2:37:14.940]  that's going to that's going to explain any of that i doubt that as well especially with them
[2:37:14.940 --> 2:37:20.860]  saying that the temperatures of the fire that supposedly uh caused thermal expansion and the
[2:37:20.860 --> 2:37:26.460]  detachment of one of the beams i believe 79th beam or something like that on the 13th or 17th
[2:37:26.460 --> 2:37:30.380]  floor i'm not quite sure which one it was but they basically said it was hundreds of degrees
[2:37:30.380 --> 2:37:34.620]  below the temperature temperature they first expected and instead of making a commute a
[2:37:34.620 --> 2:37:39.980]  computer model where the steel steel beams and the concrete were given physical properties they
[2:37:39.980 --> 2:37:45.340]  basically built their own computer model based on the architecture of the building and the blueprints
[2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:51.820]  and then animated it to suit their needs right and the whole thermal thermal expansion idea is
[2:37:51.820 --> 2:37:58.220]  interestingly opposite of what happened in the towers so that the in the towers the floor assembly
[2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:02.860]  sagged right they weakened and sagged and and then pulled on the external columns in this
[2:38:02.860 --> 2:38:10.220]  case it's the opposite um some small office fires are relatively small office fires created
[2:38:10.220 --> 2:38:16.060]  rigidity in the in the steel and actually caused the steel beam to become rigid and expand and
[2:38:16.060 --> 2:38:22.620]  lengthen uh is what they're saying and then somehow dislodge this column 79 which caused
[2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:29.420]  further collapse of floor segments uh it's just it's absurd because it's uh not believable in
[2:38:29.420 --> 2:38:33.900]  itself but also quite opposite of all the other stories they've given in the past well that's
[2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:38.300]  the thing about criminals and people that are guilty or some of something you know they're
[2:38:38.300 --> 2:38:43.660]  lying to you when they give you multiple versions of the same event for instance it was originally
[2:38:43.660 --> 2:38:48.380]  reported 20 plus minutes before the building fell that it fell because of debris from the north
[2:38:48.380 --> 2:38:53.180]  and south tower and fires within the building uh later in the week they said well it looks like
[2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:58.300]  the diesel fuel tanks must have exploded bringing the building down later it was one third of the
[2:38:58.300 --> 2:39:05.340]  building was scooped out and now we're we're into a realm that is just beyond belief where they say
[2:39:05.340 --> 2:39:12.540]  small fires cause thermal expansion and one let me count them one column detaches causing quote
[2:39:12.540 --> 2:39:17.580]  unquote a term they love and they have created global collapse can you talk about global collapse
[2:39:17.580 --> 2:39:23.260]  for me yeah global the idea of global collapse is where one segment of the building fails and
[2:39:23.260 --> 2:39:30.620]  then the rest kind of cascades in a failure uh progressively then uh collapses to uh the result
[2:39:30.620 --> 2:39:36.700]  of global collapse the whole building then falls and uh generally this is something that people
[2:39:36.700 --> 2:39:43.660]  we see in earthquakes for example and uh never before in fire and they admit that uh they talk
[2:39:43.660 --> 2:39:49.740]  about this extraordinary event and everything's extraordinary suddenly um the fire itself is
[2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:54.460]  extraordinary although it doesn't heat up the steel very much but i think what's very important
[2:39:54.460 --> 2:40:01.020]  here is this hair trigger column which causes this eight second or six and a half second collapse of
[2:40:01.020 --> 2:40:07.260]  this building uh their mist is now arguing over 40 difference on 18 stories as being significant
[2:40:08.060 --> 2:40:13.980]  but six and a half seconds or eight seconds total um that could never have been predicted by anyone
[2:40:13.980 --> 2:40:19.580]  right and we can all imagine that if this is happening for the first time ever in one column
[2:40:19.580 --> 2:40:24.940]  is like a hair trigger you know switch that causes the whole building to fall in on itself
[2:40:25.660 --> 2:40:29.740]  nobody could predict that but yet a number of people did predict it
[2:40:29.740 --> 2:40:33.980]  now you're a member of architects and engineers for 9 11 truth correct
[2:40:34.780 --> 2:40:40.540]  yes and uh richard gauge is currently working on a new paper to go over all of these flaws
[2:40:40.540 --> 2:40:46.300]  within the nist report we had him on on friday but it is really just completely ludicrous what
[2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:51.340]  they are expecting us to swallow and the mainstream media is now touting this as the final word on
[2:40:51.340 --> 2:40:56.860]  building seven i mean do you expect uh follow-ups by popular mechanics do you expect them to parade
[2:40:56.860 --> 2:41:01.180]  this report around now that we're close to the seventh anniversary of 9 11 are we going to see
[2:41:01.180 --> 2:41:07.260]  this in the news on 9 11 what do you think well i'm not really sure what to think jason this is
[2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:12.300]  the story is so weak it makes me wonder and there's a couple of options that i can think of either
[2:41:13.420 --> 2:41:17.180]  for example it's just the anniversary and they need to say something quickly or
[2:41:18.300 --> 2:41:23.180]  those of us engaging in the independent investigation are getting close enough where
[2:41:23.180 --> 2:41:28.220]  they just like to close the books on the whole thing and move forward um i'm not sure what to
[2:41:28.220 --> 2:41:34.540]  think on on why they would put out such a weak story and uh and just leave themselves open to
[2:41:34.540 --> 2:41:41.580]  criticism but you know there's a lot of things that could be said um there are several blatant
[2:41:41.580 --> 2:41:47.260]  lies in the story and this this investigation clearly took five years they've been saying three
[2:41:47.260 --> 2:41:52.780]  years but they worked from august 2002 to june 2004 and they produced literally hundreds of
[2:41:52.780 --> 2:41:59.180]  pages of a detailed report on world trade center seven that were part of either the uh the report
[2:41:59.180 --> 2:42:05.980]  they put on the towers or was a preliminary report in 2004 and so they'd worked on it for
[2:42:05.980 --> 2:42:11.500]  two years before they started their three-year new investigation that's one lie they also talked
[2:42:11.500 --> 2:42:15.740]  about how they were very open to discussing alternative theories and that's a blatant lie
[2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:21.180]  uh they've there've been multiple invitations from independent investigators to discuss this
[2:42:21.180 --> 2:42:28.300]  openly with nest they've never even responded to those invitations um you know my own story being uh
[2:42:28.940 --> 2:42:34.300]  fired from a job just for politely and professionally asking questions of the of the nest team
[2:42:34.300 --> 2:42:38.540]  through the proper channels might add i mean you were writing professional letters based on their
[2:42:38.540 --> 2:42:43.420]  research contradicting what they were saying correct absolutely and being as respectful as i could
[2:42:43.420 --> 2:42:50.140]  possibly be and never receiving any response other than uh termination within five days from
[2:42:50.140 --> 2:42:55.500]  underwriters laboratories and so it's clear they were not very open to discussing alternative theories
[2:42:56.220 --> 2:43:00.860]  um but you know i think this whole thing where they're now saying that they uh they looked into
[2:43:00.860 --> 2:43:06.940]  explosives and and they say that the way they did this was they they imagined that someone
[2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:14.060]  put a very large bomb next to column 79 and you know that is is uh something that would have
[2:43:14.060 --> 2:43:20.460]  caused a sound that would be too loud and people would have remarked on this very loud sound that's
[2:43:20.460 --> 2:43:25.260]  their logic and they also said that the decibel levels on the videos would have disproven the
[2:43:25.260 --> 2:43:29.820]  use of explosives when your main hypothesis over the architects and engineers for 911 truth
[2:43:29.820 --> 2:43:35.660]  is that they use thermite or thermate which does not make a large boom like sound in fact it just
[2:43:35.660 --> 2:43:39.900]  cuts through the columns rather easily without much of an explosive sound at all isn't that correct
[2:43:39.900 --> 2:43:45.900]  that's right and and the only comment that um shiam sunder made about the thermite
[2:43:46.940 --> 2:43:52.140]  possibility was a little absurd as well he said that uh you know the thermite would have to be
[2:43:52.140 --> 2:43:57.500]  held close to the column so that didn't make any sense to him and and of course we've done some
[2:43:57.500 --> 2:44:02.460]  investigation and found out that there's a type of material called nanothermites which can be
[2:44:02.460 --> 2:44:11.500]  sprayed on or or dip coated onto um things like steel and uh and you know just turns out that the
[2:44:11.500 --> 2:44:15.340]  NIST team has a lot of connections to these materials yeah please talk about that because
[2:44:15.340 --> 2:44:19.580]  that never gets any play and i know that alex would love to hear it talk about these NIST guys
[2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:25.100]  connection to thermite and thermate research yeah well i started looking into this because
[2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:31.500]  i found a few stray connections and uh there's a there's an article at the journal of 911 studies
[2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:37.180]  just from last month called the top 10 connections between NIST and nanothermites and it turns out
[2:44:37.180 --> 2:44:43.020]  that some of their directors for example the the harden beam it guy who is uh nominated by george
[2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:48.220]  w bush just a month after september 11th has a lot of connections to this kind of technology
[2:44:48.220 --> 2:44:52.380]  he was also director at betel which is an interesting organization that manages
[2:44:53.100 --> 2:44:57.820]  national laboratories including the fort detrick laboratory where the anthrax came from
[2:44:57.820 --> 2:45:04.060]  um but uh there's another uh director who replaced him called harratch submergian and he wrote
[2:45:04.620 --> 2:45:09.020]  quite a few papers with the world's leading expert on nanothermites his name is michael
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:15.660]  zachariah um there is uh forman williams who is quoted often by popular mechanics and is the
[2:45:15.660 --> 2:45:24.060]  lead engineer on this advisory team who is an expert on the energetic the the ignition of porous
[2:45:24.060 --> 2:45:29.420]  energetic materials and that's exactly what we're talking about with nanothermites it really goes on
[2:45:29.420 --> 2:45:35.180]  quite a bit and if you read that paper i think you'll be startled to see that nist would never
[2:45:35.180 --> 2:45:39.500]  have thought somehow they would never have thought of these materials they don't know how
[2:45:39.500 --> 2:45:46.300]  thermite might be applied to this day uh they don't know that thermite can be explosive as well as
[2:45:46.300 --> 2:45:52.860]  as incendiary um and those things just aren't both those statements by nist now just aren't
[2:45:52.860 --> 2:45:58.460]  believable and uh i think that people ought to call them on these things and of course we will
[2:45:58.460 --> 2:46:03.180]  with our response to this report well they say that they're going to be taking alternative
[2:46:03.180 --> 2:46:07.740]  information or any information the public has until september 15th i believe and i hope that
[2:46:07.740 --> 2:46:12.940]  everybody out there forwards them barry jennings interview of explosions inside the building
[2:46:12.940 --> 2:46:17.660]  prior to either tower collapsing and he's not the only one that was there he was with michael
[2:46:17.660 --> 2:46:21.980]  hess the city corporation council both went on the news that day both talked about these
[2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:26.860]  explosions inside the building uh we know for a fact that barry jennings not only talk to fema
[2:46:26.860 --> 2:46:31.500]  because he is in the femur report but he also talked to the 9 11 commission so this guy's
[2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:35.900]  testimony is on record he is one of the few people's that was people that was in the building
[2:46:35.900 --> 2:46:40.540]  and i will bet dollars to donuts that he was not even considered in this final report kevin
[2:46:41.340 --> 2:46:47.020]  i'm certain of that uh yeah i wonder if they talk to him at all for this report but i doubt it
[2:46:47.020 --> 2:46:52.540]  no i doubt it as well because if you saw that hack job on the bbc about a month ago it was very
[2:46:52.540 --> 2:46:57.500]  apparent that barry told the same exact story minus the bodies in the lobby as he was always
[2:46:57.500 --> 2:47:02.460]  saying we and he was talking about the many explosions but they edited it in a manner to
[2:47:02.460 --> 2:47:07.340]  make it look like he was alone they did a reenactment of just him there they took out any
[2:47:07.900 --> 2:47:13.100]  any corroborating evidence that hess was there and then they distorted his timeline by going to
[2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:18.460]  other eyewitnesses saying that they had evacuated after i believe it was the second plane strike
[2:47:18.460 --> 2:47:22.460]  or the pentagon being hit which is totally ludicrous because barry puts himself there
[2:47:22.460 --> 2:47:27.820]  after the first plane strike before the second one yeah your interview the interview that you
[2:47:27.820 --> 2:47:36.060]  posted jayson uh the loose change crew posted is really stunning and uh it contradicts the bbc
[2:47:36.060 --> 2:47:42.780]  approach quite clearly um jennings talks about looking out the window and seeing uh no evidence
[2:47:42.780 --> 2:47:47.980]  for any collapse of the towers uh after this explosion right yeah absolutely he says that he
[2:47:47.980 --> 2:47:52.620]  looked both ways and the the towers were there and then he says that as he was talking to firemen
[2:47:52.620 --> 2:47:56.780]  they ran away as the first tower went down then they came back and then he was talking to them
[2:47:56.780 --> 2:48:00.780]  again and then the second tower fell then they came back they didn't get him out of there
[2:48:00.780 --> 2:48:04.780]  uh for another hour hour and a half plus and when they did get him out of there they took
[2:48:04.780 --> 2:48:10.060]  him down to the lobby and they had to make a makeshift hole and he said it looked like you know
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:15.260]  explosives had went off in the lobby and he said he was listening to these explosions inside and
[2:48:15.260 --> 2:48:19.580]  outside he could feel them from underneath them him and michael hess were almost killed by that
[2:48:19.580 --> 2:48:24.460]  initial explosion while they were in the uh eighth to sixth floor being blown back from that explosion
[2:48:24.460 --> 2:48:30.620]  from underneath them and i can almost guarantee you that his testimony was not even considered
[2:48:30.620 --> 2:48:36.540]  because it would cause an alternative hypothesis and they really have no interest in looking at the
[2:48:36.540 --> 2:48:43.020]  truth i agree we see no evidence that they have any interest in pursuing the truth at nest in fact
[2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:47.900]  starting to believe that there may be strong connections between those who are involved
[2:48:47.900 --> 2:48:53.340]  in the investigation and those who committed the crimes and i know that's a that's a stretch to say
[2:48:53.340 --> 2:48:59.660]  that but i can't imagine another reason why people would be so persistent in avoiding the truth as
[2:48:59.660 --> 2:49:05.900]  nest has been you know being a member of architects and engineers for 911 truth i'd like to hear how
[2:49:05.900 --> 2:49:13.100]  you feel that the simon weasenthal center literally showed al-qaeda snuff films right before flashing
[2:49:13.100 --> 2:49:19.980]  architects and engineers for 911 truth as a terrorist website i mean how does first of all
[2:49:19.980 --> 2:49:25.340]  you're an american citizen you have no ties to radical islam to terrorists of any nature from
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:30.220]  any country how does it make you feel when you see yourself being demonized in this group being
[2:49:30.220 --> 2:49:36.300]  demonized for doing nothing but applying real science well it's troubling that's for sure and
[2:49:36.300 --> 2:49:42.860]  that's a smear campaign there's no question about that so i know some people may respond in ways
[2:49:42.860 --> 2:49:48.060]  where they're trying to protect themselves from assumed accusations and there have been no accusations
[2:49:48.060 --> 2:49:54.540]  that i know of toward the simon weasenthal center from the 911 truth movement but the 911 truth
[2:49:54.540 --> 2:49:59.500]  movement in my view the people i've met they essentially represent the american people
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:04.620]  that's who we are we're not you know we're not terrorists we don't we don't we're not connected
[2:50:04.620 --> 2:50:10.300]  to any political organizations per se we we have no agenda other than just getting to the truth and
[2:50:10.300 --> 2:50:16.540]  i think it's it's a abhorrent really that that we would be smeared like that just asking for the
[2:50:16.540 --> 2:50:22.540]  truth that that we need nor to survive in the future absolutely our entire you know way of life
[2:50:22.540 --> 2:50:27.260]  depends on it or the future of our freedom in this country depends on it the future of our
[2:50:27.260 --> 2:50:32.460]  constitutional republic truly depends on getting the truth out about 911 i said it before i'll say
[2:50:32.460 --> 2:50:38.380]  it again our entire foreign and domestic policy is based on 911 kevin any uh thoughts to wrap up how
[2:50:38.380 --> 2:50:43.820]  can people help well i tell you what you can go to architects and engineers from 911 truth and
[2:50:43.820 --> 2:50:48.700]  there is uh something you can copy there and send every architect and engineer you can find that's

[2:54:18.940 --> 2:54:25.900]  including the falsified mist report where fires hundred degrees below the once thought
[2:54:25.900 --> 2:54:31.420]  temperatures cause thermal expansion and uh... a complete demolition of a forty seven story
[2:54:31.420 --> 2:54:37.100]  skyscraper that house the largest cia base outside of langley the largest secret service

[2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:48.380]  but go back to sleep it was just fire of course all right let's take some callers uh... into the
[2:54:48.380 --> 2:54:52.220]  next hour actually going to be taking calls until we get bob chapman back on at around two thirty
[2:54:52.220 --> 2:54:56.460]  alex should be popping in shortly and we may even go into overdrive to bring you even more
[2:54:56.460 --> 2:55:03.740]  exclusive d n c footage all right let us go to i believe it is mark in florida mark what's on your
[2:55:03.740 --> 2:55:09.980]  mind hey how you doing jason good man good good i just wanted to uh... talk a little bit about
[2:55:09.980 --> 2:55:17.580]  the uh... trade center uh... the building seven uh... announcement of uh... uh... shine thunder i'd i
[2:55:17.580 --> 2:55:23.660]  think it's very weak uh... just even from a non scientific point of view if you just look at it
[2:55:23.660 --> 2:55:29.500]  the law philosophically uh... experimental science studies repeatable phenomenon
[2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:37.260]  yes so uh... this is a phenomenon that has never before or since happened
[2:55:37.260 --> 2:55:41.740]  so it's not and then we'll never ever be repeated in any type of a lab if it was a
[2:55:41.740 --> 2:55:46.140]  reputable phenomenon anyway shape or form they would have been able to build computer models
[2:55:46.140 --> 2:55:50.540]  with actual physics to demonstrate their point they were unable to do so they built computer
[2:55:50.540 --> 2:55:56.540]  models and animated them towards their conclusion thought he did say that he had some kind of a
[2:55:56.540 --> 2:56:02.380]  computer model to model this this fire but it's very i think it's a very interesting kind of thing
[2:56:02.380 --> 2:56:07.900]  but i might be mistaken in that no i think they had a building um... they had a building model
[2:56:07.900 --> 2:56:12.700]  which was based on the blueprints but then they weren't actually able to apply the heat from the
[2:56:12.700 --> 2:56:17.180]  fire as they said that it would have been hundreds of degrees below what you know a computer model
[2:56:17.180 --> 2:56:21.420]  or anything they had tested uh... would have actually done they kind of just had to hypothesize
[2:56:21.420 --> 2:56:25.980]  it and then they put this this model looks so ridiculous i mean one column starts to fall
[2:56:25.980 --> 2:56:29.660]  then the surrounding column start to fall somewhere near the middle of the building and then they
[2:56:29.660 --> 2:56:33.420]  don't even show the facade of the building and they don't even show the thing come all the way down
[2:56:33.980 --> 2:56:38.780]  what what i what i think they're doing jason is i think that they're have you ever have you ever
[2:56:38.780 --> 2:56:42.780]  heard of like chaos theory where you have the butterfly effect and he flaps his wings in
[2:56:42.780 --> 2:56:49.100]  australia and you get a tornado in miami sure but if you put him 30 meters away he and he flaps
[2:56:49.100 --> 2:56:54.140]  his wings nothing happens six months later than in miami yeah i think what these nisk guys are
[2:56:54.140 --> 2:56:59.260]  doing is working the thing in reverse and finding the initial conditions you know they
[2:56:59.260 --> 2:57:04.860]  worked the program in reverse first find some initial conditions and then they put the butterfly
[2:57:04.860 --> 2:57:09.340]  exactly where they need him to flap his wings in this case it would be fires you know or in the
[2:57:09.340 --> 2:57:15.260]  in the case of the of the towers burning it would be like you know they they needed 42 inches of
[2:57:15.260 --> 2:57:21.020]  a bend in the in the state sag in the steel rather than just three inches uh but then they worked
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:26.860]  their computer programs for and they say wow we've got evidence now that that it just came from
[2:57:26.860 --> 2:57:31.660]  this one thing because they've worked it backwards first oh absolutely that's my opinion no that's
[2:57:31.660 --> 2:57:35.340]  exactly what they did they did work it backwards i thank for the call you again they had the
[2:57:35.340 --> 2:57:40.620]  conclusion first and they worked their models around that conclusion applying no science
[2:57:40.620 --> 2:57:46.780]  to their actual computer models let me say that again no science no physical properties all right
[2:57:46.780 --> 2:57:49.740]  let's go to james in new york james what's on your mind
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:55.740]  oh we dropped james let's go to greg in detroit then greg what's up all right i have two points
[2:57:55.740 --> 2:58:03.180]  to make if i can make them both 1911 one about denver uh as far as 1911 goes uh i've heard that
[2:58:03.180 --> 2:58:09.340]  george bush's younger brother was ahead of security at the world trade center uh neil bush
[2:58:09.340 --> 2:58:15.900]  was the head of secure a calm uh later called strata sec and his company did do security for
[2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:20.700]  both the world trade center and dullas airport prior to 9 11 not sure if they were involved on
[2:58:20.700 --> 2:58:25.180]  9 11 i think they were going through the process of kind of giving that over to cruel which is
[2:58:25.180 --> 2:58:30.140]  just a really a cia shell corporation we'll get your point on the dnc on the other side this
[2:58:30.140 --> 2:58:34.860]  is the alex joneshow remember fabled enemies august 31st at prisonplanet dot tv
[2:58:43.020 --> 2:58:48.540]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[2:58:48.540 --> 2:59:00.380]  it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world
[2:59:00.380 --> 2:59:06.220]  government it's known as the builder bird put their objective the world domination
[2:59:06.780 --> 2:59:12.860]  for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:59:12.860 --> 2:59:18.620]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:59:20.300 --> 2:59:25.740]  for the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[2:59:25.740 --> 2:59:29.580]  you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[2:59:29.580 --> 2:59:33.340]  builder bird is making great progress toward a world government most people have no idea
[2:59:33.340 --> 2:59:36.220]  they're not after money they have all the money they need they're after power
[2:59:36.220 --> 2:59:45.100]  all right folks we're rocking it man i love this starship troopers game
[2:59:48.220 --> 2:59:54.140]  off into the stratosphere of the info war you found it this is the spear the tip of it
[2:59:55.340 --> 2:59:59.980]  and uh we're taking calls right now alex jones is going to join us from the dnc we reported on
[2:59:59.980 --> 3:00:04.380]  the detention camps earlier there was live streaming video over at info wars dot com
[3:00:04.380 --> 3:00:10.060]  and go check it out right now and uh we're gonna just keep taking some college till alex calls in
[3:00:10.060 --> 3:00:14.860]  and we're gonna go back to bob chappan we had to end with abruptly for kevin ryan in the last
[3:00:14.860 --> 3:00:20.140]  half hour we may do overdrive so uh you know they're in the thick of it over at the dnc right
[3:00:20.140 --> 3:00:25.500]  now things are going down you know polo sees out there grandstanding for the democrats saying
[3:00:25.500 --> 3:00:30.700]  oh we're not united yet a whole bunch of nonsensical issues but we've got greg in detroit
[3:00:30.700 --> 3:00:35.340]  bringing up some real issues uh you talked about nine eleven uh let's get into your dnc point
[3:00:35.980 --> 3:00:39.900]  well i just wanted to know i didn't make my point about nine eleven yet the only thing i wanted to
[3:00:39.900 --> 3:00:46.940]  say was uh i haven't really seen any expose or investigation about about bush being uh
[3:00:47.500 --> 3:00:51.900]  security there and seems like he would be the key in the lock if there was advanced preparation
[3:00:51.900 --> 3:00:58.060]  to bring the twin towers down well let's also look at this uh his other brother jeb bush uh
[3:00:58.060 --> 3:01:02.700]  where he was that day was governor of florida and he declared marshal law on september seventh
[3:01:02.700 --> 3:01:07.180]  okay so he had marshal law in place on the morning of the attacks in case something went wrong i think
[3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:13.420]  that's another aspect that really needs to be heavily investigated okay about Denver uh why
[3:01:13.420 --> 3:01:18.540]  it'd be a harbinger of anything that would turn out to be true but i've had a bad feeling ever
[3:01:18.540 --> 3:01:24.860]  since i heard that uh obama is going to uh do a speech at the stadium that sure seems like a lot
[3:01:24.860 --> 3:01:30.060]  of vulnerability to me i'd like you to comment on what you think could happen if anything would
[3:01:30.060 --> 3:01:35.740]  happen to him at that event there and what it would do to the city of Denver and why there may
[3:01:35.740 --> 3:01:39.820]  be so much preparation to incarcerate people well yeah i mean it would be a total police state and
[3:01:39.820 --> 3:01:45.180]  i thank you for the call um jeez if they got to obama and say they did get them i i don't see
[3:01:45.180 --> 3:01:49.180]  it happening until after the election until they get their boy in before they would even think about
[3:01:49.180 --> 3:01:54.140]  something like that i may be wrong i'm not a global elitist i'm not one of these big time
[3:01:54.140 --> 3:01:59.180]  political players but it seems like if that were to happen that would not only screw up the dnc
[3:01:59.180 --> 3:02:04.300]  all together but then you know how do you promote hillary how do you promote you know i mean you're
[3:02:04.300 --> 3:02:08.060]  obviously not going to promote biden for president you probably have to fall back on hillary so i don't
[3:02:08.060 --> 3:02:12.220]  see that in the cards i think that they really just want to demonize the protesters out there and
[3:02:12.220 --> 3:02:17.980]  make us seem violent uh like rush limbaugh was hoping for for riots in denver i think that is
[3:02:17.980 --> 3:02:25.340]  their main goal to demonize the general population all right let's go to michael in florida michael
[3:02:25.340 --> 3:02:30.940]  you're with us hello hey what's on your mind michael uh yeah i was going to talk about the
[3:02:30.940 --> 3:02:36.700]  dnc um you know with this whole question of obama citizenship i thought that was kind of
[3:02:36.700 --> 3:02:42.300]  interesting ploy what you're talking about whether he's born in kenya and all that sort of thing and
[3:02:42.300 --> 3:02:49.020]  uh i thought it might be a way to challenge the whole situation because uh i think eventually
[3:02:49.020 --> 3:02:53.420]  they're going to say that well maybe we don't need the rule that someone has to be born actually
[3:02:53.420 --> 3:02:59.180]  united states to be a presidential candidate which eventually play into the whole uh well maybe we
[3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:04.620]  can get arnold schwarzneger to run and uh well that was definitely a fear back in 2004 when he was
[3:03:04.620 --> 3:03:08.300]  speaking at the republican national convention and it seemed like they were going to try to either
[3:03:08.300 --> 3:03:14.620]  have a uh... constitutional convention to change that or to try to actually bring a vote to uh to
[3:03:14.620 --> 3:03:19.260]  change our constitution and bill rights it would have been pretty wild it's a definite possibility
[3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:25.500]  i think people woke up to that pretty quickly but you know we love a movie star so right so who
[3:03:25.500 --> 3:03:31.340]  knows i mean we're just so apt to get drawn into this pop culture phenomenon that is the tv and
[3:03:31.340 --> 3:03:35.820]  movies that i don't put anything past them and you know most people still think that arnold's a great
[3:03:35.820 --> 3:03:40.140]  guy right well they're going to get well he's got this california crisis going on now and he's
[3:03:40.140 --> 3:03:44.940]  going to come out of it looking like a superstar and uh and they've made you know maybe they've
[3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:49.020]  manufactured maybe they'll support him who knows how they'll play it but obama's going to be the
[3:03:49.020 --> 3:03:54.380]  test case for him but it won't be about him so then it'll it'll kind of make it look like obama's
[3:03:54.380 --> 3:03:59.740]  the mandate of the people so you got to get this through because you can't let him hang or dangle

[3:08:04.060 --> 3:08:11.660]  watch it was incredible in a in a ten minute period we saw a microcosm of the entire situation
[3:08:11.660 --> 3:08:16.700]  we saw a microcosm of everything we're over there talking about some of the anarchist groups have
[3:08:16.700 --> 3:08:22.220]  been caught hired by foundations to come in and start fights attack the police so there's a pretext
[3:08:22.220 --> 3:08:25.980]  to that attack the peaceful demonstrators so we have the we over to politely talk to some
[3:08:25.980 --> 3:08:30.220]  anarchists about what they really believe they say we're bad they say we're evil they say i'm bad
[3:08:30.220 --> 3:08:34.300]  that i'm trying to you know sell going to my movie tonight even though i donated that
[3:08:34.300 --> 3:08:38.300]  showing to we are changed colorado and i'm not getting one red cent even though i'm showing
[3:08:38.300 --> 3:08:42.700]  it new york in a few weeks on september 11th for the first responders i'm taking not one red cent
[3:08:42.700 --> 3:08:47.980]  i don't need a 14 000 last year for my showing i've been getting 800 people went to so we've
[3:08:47.980 --> 3:08:52.860]  done all this and but we're still able to do they're saying we're racist and that and that and
[3:08:52.860 --> 3:08:56.380]  that you know because we don't want mexico to take over the u.s and then they start bullhorning
[3:08:56.380 --> 3:09:00.620]  me screaming a bullhorn right in my face uh... you know that's one thing about bullhorn a
[3:09:00.620 --> 3:09:04.380]  building or a group they had right at my face i had a shouting match with them and then they came
[3:09:04.380 --> 3:09:08.540]  over and said you've caused a disturbance you're the one making noise get out of here when they
[3:09:08.540 --> 3:09:13.340]  started it and they had the bullhorn that's what they do they're nasty mean petulant people who
[3:09:13.340 --> 3:09:17.500]  lie about us today does my thing all anarchists know there's one group of anarchists that
[3:09:17.500 --> 3:09:20.860]  i guess really want to have our care extreme libertarians but every other anarchist i run
[3:09:20.860 --> 3:09:25.260]  into is really a communist if you really talk to them and then they just say they're an anarchist
[3:09:25.260 --> 3:09:30.300]  because it's been a communist is unpopular today and kind of discredited so these are definitely
[3:09:30.300 --> 3:09:35.340]  foundation people here uh... they all know who i am uh... now most of the crowd loves this great
[3:09:35.340 --> 3:09:39.980]  peace people great you know mainline liberals conservatives ron paul supporters are out here
[3:09:39.980 --> 3:09:45.740]  uh... in fact they're the majority but you just got these vicious mean anarchists that are just so
[3:09:45.740 --> 3:09:51.500]  angry that uh... we exposed months ago not recreate sixty-eight one of their umbrella
[3:09:51.500 --> 3:09:56.460]  group for the ones that's under them was talking about shields and and clubs and and you know
[3:09:56.460 --> 3:09:59.980]  fighting and and violence and things like that and they try to misrepresent that as well we're
[3:09:59.980 --> 3:10:04.460]  not saying that about sixty i'll be clear to subgroup of that uh... it's just absolutely
[3:10:04.460 --> 3:10:08.620]  amazing to be here witnessing this but to see them come over and say you can't speak
[3:10:08.620 --> 3:10:13.180]  shut up i'm on the sidewalk i'm on the edge of their demonstration which they've taken over
[3:10:13.180 --> 3:10:16.940]  it's just the general public marching and people are shaking my hand that you know the general
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:20.860]  public likes of the general protesters and demonstrators like us but they come over and
[3:10:20.860 --> 3:10:26.380]  tell us not the police the police didn't come over and tell us that we didn't that that that we
[3:10:26.380 --> 3:10:31.020]  couldn't be over there it was the anarchist the anarchist came over to us and they told us that
[3:10:31.020 --> 3:10:34.620]  we didn't have a right to be there and started elbowing me but you guys get that when that guy
[3:10:34.620 --> 3:10:38.620]  was elbowing me and he's got her boom boom you know the anarchists are hitting their elbows into
[3:10:38.620 --> 3:10:42.540]  me and telling me i don't have a right to be over there videotaping what they're doing now
[3:10:42.540 --> 3:10:47.260]  do we support the right you know all the big police state surveillance the secret camp all of
[3:10:47.260 --> 3:10:51.660]  that the provocateurs have been caught other cities no and we're criticizing that but the
[3:10:51.660 --> 3:10:56.220]  point is it's because of these anarchists whoever's behind them that are that are demonstrations
[3:10:56.220 --> 3:11:00.860]  and our conventions have been turned into these police states and so no it's not these men in
[3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:05.260]  riot gear behind me with their beanbags and their pepper spray cannons and the rest of it
[3:11:05.260 --> 3:11:09.020]  uh... that are frustrating my first amendment it is the anarchist who physically started bumping
[3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:13.020]  into me and hitting me and telling me get out of there after they came over with a bullhorn
[3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:17.980]  sort of shouting in my face and it's all on video and it all went out live on justin tv right now
[3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:21.580]  it all went out live on info wars dot com and we are changed out of work and people are going to
[3:11:21.580 --> 3:11:26.140]  learn the truth about these folks that at first they told lies about us then they bullhorn me
[3:11:26.140 --> 3:11:30.620]  it is absolutely outrageous jason that this is going on but you know what we now have live
[3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:35.900]  internet video streaming and so they can't stop us not just a syndicated radio show with millions
[3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:39.740]  of listeners out there now we have the video to prove everything this is a great equalizer
[3:11:39.740 --> 3:11:44.540]  with the police with the citizens with the anarchist socialist who poses anarchist
[3:11:44.540 --> 3:11:49.420]  nothing all of them but the leaders this is the equalizer we'll find out who's good is it the police
[3:11:49.420 --> 3:11:54.060]  is it the citizens is it the anarchist this is the great equalizer is the camera in line
[3:11:54.060 --> 3:11:58.620]  and those anarchist over there are dirt they are because they hate this country they said they hate
[3:11:58.620 --> 3:12:03.020]  me because i say i love america and the bill of rights a constitution they want america to come
[3:12:03.020 --> 3:12:07.180]  down they were telling us that they were saying we're evil because we love this country this country
[3:12:07.180 --> 3:12:11.740]  isn't perfect but this country is a lot better than other nations and they told me i couldn't
[3:12:11.740 --> 3:12:17.420]  be over there and they physically started assaulting me not the police the anarchists
[3:12:17.420 --> 3:12:21.260]  and that's who they are they say they're not violent but they were elbowed did he you catch that on

[3:13:56.380 --> 3:14:01.100]  too much for my face people started bumping into me but i didn't want to be distracted then some of
[3:14:01.100 --> 3:14:05.420]  them organizers came over and said you have become a disruption you're being too loud while their guy
[3:14:05.420 --> 3:14:10.460]  is bullhorning in my face i said so i'll try okay i'll leave then they had a victory celebration
[3:14:10.460 --> 3:14:14.700]  because they they're all about driving people out and somebody went this is old man not always

[3:14:36.940 --> 3:14:41.340]  what you saw him do hey man it's very real we have people coming up with bullhorns just bullhorn us
[3:14:41.340 --> 3:14:45.020]  right to our face and then they're going to tell us that we're disrupting an event we were not
[3:14:45.020 --> 3:14:50.780]  disrupting the event people were coming up to us it's a public event it's in a public street right
[3:14:50.780 --> 3:14:54.780]  here in denver in a beautiful city and then people are coming up starting starting arguments
[3:14:55.500 --> 3:14:59.340]  screaming on bullhorns right in our faces and then they say we started a whole incident we're
[3:14:59.340 --> 3:15:02.860]  taking off attention from the main event and it's ludicrous it's crazy you see him bumping
[3:15:02.860 --> 3:15:08.540]  into me i want that on yeah and then i'm gonna have a video recording the whole situation with
[3:15:08.540 --> 3:15:12.060]  alex and the whole conversation with all the anarchists and communists and then you see a guy
[3:15:12.060 --> 3:15:16.460]  basically bump into alex push them out the way and they're just getting very physical and very
[3:15:16.460 --> 3:15:20.140]  uh negative and they're basically just trying to chase us out trying to claim victory that we
[3:15:20.140 --> 3:15:24.380]  had to go back on the radio so it's ludicrous that this is happening it's sad that this is happening
[3:15:24.380 --> 3:15:28.220]  but it's happening live people can make their own judgments america is watching the world is watching
[3:15:28.220 --> 3:15:34.780]  right now go on justin tv uh dot com flat no justin tv uh justin dot tv slash we are changed or we

[3:15:57.020 --> 3:16:01.180]  you're bad and by the end of it five minutes later they were elbowing me bumping into me
[3:16:01.180 --> 3:16:05.660]  saying leave you're causing disturbance and you know what i'm not there to be manipulated by them
[3:16:05.660 --> 3:16:09.980]  into a fight with them you know they haven't really hit me i would always stand up i'm here to cover
[3:16:09.980 --> 3:16:13.420]  this event i'm not gonna end up in a femur cam for the next four or five days and not be able to
[3:16:13.420 --> 3:16:18.220]  cover this i got here directing the radio show the the internet the the the video feeds the film
[3:16:18.220 --> 3:16:22.060]  we're making and then you know the showing i do tonight for the folks are coming out to that
[3:16:22.780 --> 3:16:27.740]  at the oriental hotel uh theater so so all that's happening and these people come up and
[3:16:27.740 --> 3:16:31.500]  scream at me when i'm just quietly doing interviews and being interviewed by the media
[3:16:31.500 --> 3:16:35.740]  and screaming us and when i say okay i'll leave they start bumping into me and get to my face
[3:16:35.740 --> 3:16:39.820]  they're not loving liberals they're not nice people at least these others watching us on the
[3:16:39.820 --> 3:16:44.300]  web say hey i can start back i'm not talking about you i'm not every time i run into these people
[3:16:44.300 --> 3:16:49.580]  the way they act okay if you're not like this then don't act like this jason absolutely and like you
[3:16:49.580 --> 3:16:53.660]  said you know they don't want the great equalizer there they don't want everything to be on camera
[3:16:53.660 --> 3:16:57.900]  that's why they put out in their little pamphlets that they should put throw red paint on people who
[3:16:57.900 --> 3:17:03.740]  had cameras take the cameras smash them they they are trying to create a rift between the citizens
[3:17:03.740 --> 3:17:08.220]  and the police so that the police attack that is their goal and we have to be clear that was a
[3:17:08.220 --> 3:17:12.540]  subgroup not part of recreate 68 they say so i'm gonna take their word on it for what i saw from
[3:17:12.540 --> 3:17:17.260]  them today though was bumping into me you know and they claim it's a recreate 68 event and i'm
[3:17:17.260 --> 3:17:20.940]  already having people physically bump into me who say we're here we're officially not allowed to be
[3:17:20.940 --> 3:17:24.940]  here when it's a little unpermanent little march over here i don't care i'm glad they're having
[3:17:24.940 --> 3:17:29.820]  an unpermanent march my point is i'm here peacefully trying to interview people there's media everywhere
[3:17:29.820 --> 3:17:34.380]  and they come over and start physically assaulting me and that's okay you know to them because they're
[3:17:34.380 --> 3:17:41.180]  not violent you know again i have physically had the whatever these people are liberal oids uh
[3:17:41.180 --> 3:17:44.780]  whatever i hate all these terms and names come over here and do this to me and i'm not whining
[3:17:44.780 --> 3:17:49.260]  old boohoo you know they bumped into me a bunch hard and we're pushing on me that is at the issue
[3:17:49.260 --> 3:17:54.140]  the issue is is that they are very aggressive they're out of control and they attack the first
[3:17:54.140 --> 3:17:58.380]  amendment and they told me to get the hell out of there like a pack of rats basically biting at
[3:17:58.380 --> 3:18:01.820]  my heels and so there wouldn't be a scene because the cops would have known what was going on they
[3:18:01.820 --> 3:18:05.900]  just run across you know when you when these guys were he bumped into me and hit me by to hold off
[3:18:05.900 --> 3:18:09.820]  and weld one of them by the time the cops show up from 50 feet away they wouldn't even know who did
[3:18:09.820 --> 3:18:13.580]  it i'd be going to that damn femacamp so this is what we're talking about here this is a very
[3:18:13.580 --> 3:18:17.980]  dangerous situation with these anarchists as they attack people and start their crap and we're
[3:18:17.980 --> 3:18:21.900]  going to be here dealing with them tracking them videotaping them that's why i came here

[3:23:49.660 --> 3:23:57.580]  info war right here right now nowhere else i just feel privileged to be a part of mainstream media
[3:23:57.580 --> 3:24:02.540]  isn't going to tell you that there is a shell organization called recreate 68 an unconventional
[3:24:02.540 --> 3:24:08.940]  action that want to provoke a tour of violence there so that we don't have our free speech so
[3:24:08.940 --> 3:24:14.220]  that dissent is no longer available to us as an option so that we can no longer peacefully
[3:24:14.220 --> 3:24:18.140]  protest they're trying to gear this thing up they love the anarchists are out there
[3:24:18.140 --> 3:24:23.340]  hiding their identities becoming violent inciting riots this is what they want
[3:24:23.980 --> 3:24:28.940]  all right let's take some more callers let's jump to missy in detroit missy what's on your mind
[3:24:30.300 --> 3:24:36.780]  hello yes hi um i want to ask and this may be more of a question for bow i'm not sure but
[3:24:36.780 --> 3:24:43.900]  to give some perspective because we talk about the economy collapsing and you know bio warfare
[3:24:43.900 --> 3:24:50.860]  and everything that we could possibly be in for but it's not going to happen all at one time on
[3:24:50.860 --> 3:24:56.300]  one day to everybody so but it has already started to happen that's what i mean i mean
[3:24:56.300 --> 3:25:00.940]  you're right it's not going to happen one time one day we already have indy mac going under a big
[3:25:00.940 --> 3:25:05.660]  bank out in san diego we already have people's homes being foreclosed on we already have their
[3:25:05.660 --> 3:25:11.100]  pensions being taken so the incrementalization has already started for that we're already i mean our
[3:25:11.740 --> 3:25:17.260]  our dollar has been devalued by over 40 percent in the last eight years so yeah it's not going to
[3:25:17.260 --> 3:25:22.620]  all happen at once but i could see a large spike happening in one day or one week but continue
[3:25:23.420 --> 3:25:29.180]  well you know the problem i have when i talk to people my friends and family is that they
[3:25:29.740 --> 3:25:33.660]  you know they hear about these things happening on the news and whatever but
[3:25:33.660 --> 3:25:40.140]  they don't have any of the impact themselves they still have jobs they still have homes like
[3:25:40.140 --> 3:25:45.500]  when we talk about food prices they look at me like i'm crazy they say it hasn't gone up for them
[3:25:46.220 --> 3:25:53.500]  so it seems to be you know just not well the haves are always blind until the very end until they
[3:25:53.500 --> 3:25:58.060]  become the have nots and it's going to be it's going to be a real awakening if these people
[3:25:58.060 --> 3:26:01.420]  you're talking about have more than a hundred grand in the bank and the economy just totally
[3:26:01.420 --> 3:26:04.700]  goes under and they can't withdraw their money and then all of a sudden the u.s. dollars not worth
[3:26:04.700 --> 3:26:09.660]  anything i mean we're already on parity with canada canada is actually their currency is a little
[3:26:09.660 --> 3:26:14.380]  bit more you know how scary that is our currency is dominated i understand okay how i understand
[3:26:14.380 --> 3:26:20.540]  like what would happen if a bank did fail you know it has had to keep they take your money
[3:26:20.540 --> 3:26:24.380]  listen if you have that you're insured for a hundred thousand dollars by the federal reserve
[3:26:24.380 --> 3:26:28.940]  banking system that will give you more federal reserve notes for as long as they actually stay
[3:26:28.940 --> 3:26:32.700]  legal tender you're insured on that you have two hundred thousand dollars in the bank your bank
[3:26:32.700 --> 3:26:37.980]  goes under that other hundred thousand dollars is gone it is not insured now if your bank goes under
[3:26:38.860 --> 3:26:43.580]  with say your your mortgage your home loan that then goes to the federal reserve banking system
[3:26:43.580 --> 3:26:47.660]  and more to a centralization of power and you have to pay them and if you can't pay them they
[3:26:47.660 --> 3:26:53.100]  take your house and that is starting to happen is not happening to everybody it's not it's slowly
[3:26:53.100 --> 3:26:57.500]  happening to the lower middle class who were given all these crazy loans that they were never going
[3:26:57.500 --> 3:27:02.460]  to be able to afford and the this was by design i think the upper middle class will be one of the
[3:27:02.460 --> 3:27:08.940]  last to feel this but again when you when you look at the currency situation and canada a
[3:27:08.940 --> 3:27:13.740]  a nation that does not have a strong military does not have that many imports or exports you know
[3:27:13.740 --> 3:27:20.780]  wood and and other natural resources fish and their economy has a strong a currency as strong as
[3:27:20.780 --> 3:27:25.820]  ours we're the number one military superpower in the world it should not be that way and what
[3:27:25.820 --> 3:27:30.780]  they're gearing us up for is a north american union maybe you need to show them uh... the spp
[3:27:30.780 --> 3:27:34.860]  agreements the securities and prosperity's partnership where it goes over this how they're
[3:27:34.860 --> 3:27:40.460]  going to create economic crisis is to bring us more towards canada and even mexico i mean mexico's
[3:27:40.460 --> 3:27:45.660]  peso has only gone up and when it reaches a level where it can be on parity they will propose a new
[3:27:45.660 --> 3:27:50.060]  currency such as an amaro i mean there's a ton of different ways to do it i would suggest that you
[3:27:50.060 --> 3:27:55.340]  show your family perhaps america freedom to fascism to really break down how this financial system
[3:27:55.340 --> 3:28:00.620]  works i thank you for the calm is he we've got to jump to another caller let's go to bill in cali

[3:28:36.780 --> 3:28:41.580]  that we can you know come off of that like get away from them because we can't depend on our

[3:28:46.700 --> 3:28:51.500]  enemy by becoming independent of them of the evil government of the ill in circumstances they

[3:32:53.740 --> 3:32:58.220]  been struck by this economic crisis what is going to happen when they start foreclosing on
[3:32:58.220 --> 3:33:02.540]  homes what is going to happen when banks start closing down i explained to her this is already
[3:33:02.540 --> 3:33:07.500]  in the process of happening it just has not affected the majority of the middle class or the
[3:33:07.500 --> 3:33:11.740]  upper middle class yet it's usually uh the lower middle class who took out loans that they weren't
[3:33:11.740 --> 3:33:16.620]  going to be able to afford on their homes or people who mismanaged their money uh with indy mac
[3:33:16.620 --> 3:33:21.260]  and other banking organizations that just went under why don't you give her a little preview
[3:33:21.260 --> 3:33:28.620]  of where this could go well first of all uh the evidence is prima facie i mean it's everywhere
[3:33:29.740 --> 3:33:37.500]  the real estate market both commercial as well as uh as residential has been upside down for the
[3:33:37.500 --> 3:33:44.860]  last couple of years and because it hasn't been a tremendous drop in the price of someone's home
[3:33:44.860 --> 3:33:52.700]  and and you know the average in the united states is 20 plus over this period of correction and
[3:33:52.700 --> 3:34:01.340]  price and it's going to continue because uh the loans that were made uh subprime they still have
[3:34:01.340 --> 3:34:07.900]  until the end of next june people will be falling out of the loans not resetting so to speak and then
[3:34:07.900 --> 3:34:15.340]  you have uh alta loans which were a slightly better class but they had no documentation
[3:34:15.900 --> 3:34:22.140]  and they're going to go on for a couple of years more and the alta loans a dollar amount
[3:34:22.140 --> 3:34:29.020]  with twice as much as the amount uh dollar wise for the subprimes and then we've got
[3:34:29.020 --> 3:34:37.020]  starting now five years of option arms which are called pick and pay loans and many of these people
[3:34:37.020 --> 3:34:44.860]  anticipated higher home prices which unfortunately for them didn't happen over a longer period
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:52.940]  and they now owe more in their home than when they started and they're going to get payments of
[3:34:52.940 --> 3:34:58.220]  eight to nine thousand dollars a month instead of a thousand on that 1.5 or two million dollar
[3:34:58.220 --> 3:35:05.580]  mention they bought and so we're not anywhere near the end of this thing and i expect probably the
[3:35:05.580 --> 3:35:10.700]  worst is going to be seen over the next two to three years and then we'll bump along the bottom
[3:35:11.260 --> 3:35:16.780]  maybe for five or ten or twenty years who knows uh there's no telling that in the meantime
[3:35:17.580 --> 3:35:22.940]  and we announced this four years ago fannie may and freddy mack a bankrupt and not only
[3:35:24.140 --> 3:35:31.660]  is their losses going to probably be in the city about two trillion dollars on top of that
[3:35:31.660 --> 3:35:40.780]  there's a thing called derivatives and derivatives are insurance and people supposedly were insuring
[3:35:40.780 --> 3:35:48.700]  the value of the bonds that they held in fannie may and freddy mack one in fact people were just
[3:35:48.700 --> 3:35:55.740]  gambling on what they call credit swaps and one of the reasons they have to save fannie and freddy
[3:35:55.740 --> 3:36:02.140]  is not only because they're bankrupt but because all these credit swaps have been made by the major
[3:36:02.140 --> 3:36:06.700]  investment banking houses and brokerage houses and banks and they can't pay off they don't have the
[3:36:06.700 --> 3:36:13.820]  money they were running naked so to speak and so all of this is coming to four uh even the federal
[3:36:13.820 --> 3:36:19.500]  government is talking about 300 banks going over under the next year and a half and in fact for
[3:36:19.500 --> 3:36:24.940]  those of you who want to know uh more about your bank we have three different services we can recommend
[3:36:24.940 --> 3:36:32.620]  it to you if you email us and we'll we'll email them out to you and so those kinds of things are
[3:36:32.620 --> 3:36:40.780]  going on at the same time the qualifications for getting a new loan have been tightened up we're
[3:36:40.780 --> 3:36:50.300]  back to 10 or 20 down in good credit uh good credit would be over 700 and we also have a
[3:36:50.300 --> 3:36:57.500]  minute municipal bond market that's frozen uh we also have a commercial paper market
[3:36:57.500 --> 3:37:04.460]  that's lost about 500 billion dollars because companies can't put up the proper collateral
[3:37:04.460 --> 3:37:11.020]  to borrow more money uh then we have the junk bond market and they haven't been able to sell
[3:37:11.020 --> 3:37:16.940]  any new bonds for the last nine months to a year and you have this tremendous contraction going on
[3:37:16.940 --> 3:37:23.820]  but it's being offset by an increase at m three which is money in credit by the federal reserve
[3:37:23.820 --> 3:37:28.780]  and that's the only thing that's keeping the system going now the fed is lending banks through the
[3:37:28.780 --> 3:37:35.340]  discount window and through the auction procedure that they have and through the repo market more
[3:37:35.340 --> 3:37:40.060]  than 500 billion dollars a month and the european central banks doing the same thing and other
[3:37:40.060 --> 3:37:45.900]  central banks like in england and switzerland and canada they're doing the same thing half the banks
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:51.420]  and half the brokerage houses and investment banks in western europe and the united states a
[3:37:51.420 --> 3:37:58.060]  bankrupt now you don't need more any ammunition than that to worry about where things are going
[3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:04.380]  well i'm with you bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com but some people still seem to
[3:38:04.380 --> 3:38:09.500]  be blinded by this and they don't understand that it it's already occurring the incrementalization
[3:38:09.500 --> 3:38:13.260]  is already there the banks are already pretty much bankrupt they're really just waiting for a
[3:38:13.260 --> 3:38:17.820]  catalyzing event to announce it to the people and take all of their property and that we can't
[3:38:17.820 --> 3:38:22.380]  really predict when that is exactly going to come we can just warn people that they need to get
[3:38:22.380 --> 3:38:26.940]  their assets into hard currency such as silver and gold all right let's take some callers bob in
[3:38:26.940 --> 3:38:33.180]  this final half hour uh... let's go to ryan in california ryan are you with us hi jason how are
[3:38:33.180 --> 3:38:39.340]  you today good man uh... yeah um i actually um have been studying um operation mockingburden
[3:38:39.340 --> 3:38:44.220]  and i really wanted to know more about it and i just started touching up on it i've heard a lot of
[3:38:44.220 --> 3:38:48.140]  well there's two different claims well there's two different versions of mockingburden there's a
[3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:54.300]  hard version and then there is uh... the version in which people uh... spout the same kind of
[3:38:54.300 --> 3:38:59.180]  disinformation that is presented to them unknowingly in other words uh... you know they have a
[3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:03.820]  handler or something like that are getting information from a certain source and then they
[3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:10.300]  are parroting that information on the air uh... you know it's interesting a lot of media have
[3:39:10.300 --> 3:39:16.060]  been exposed to be you know cia fronts or you know fb i assets depending on when they
[3:39:16.060 --> 3:39:21.420]  actually get compromised i mean a good example of this is uh... some years ago al sharpton
[3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:25.820]  was on uh... i think it was that that's sport show on it on each bill was really bizarre but
[3:39:25.820 --> 3:39:31.180]  they had him on because he was fixing games and he was taking drug money and they confronted them
[3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:35.580]  with the yeah it was wild and they confronted with the video and he stormed out he's came back
[3:39:35.580 --> 3:39:41.100]  and he's like look i can explain that you know the fb i um had me as an asset for a while and
[3:39:41.100 --> 3:39:45.900]  blah blah blah blah so a lot of these guys are just guys that get compromised on the low
[3:39:45.900 --> 3:39:50.940]  and you never ever ever hear whether or not they're a part of mockingbird or not now the other
[3:39:50.940 --> 3:39:56.060]  one is kind of shrouded in mystery the harp marking mockingbird i mean they've talked about
[3:39:56.060 --> 3:40:02.780]  putting out this uh... i guess radio wave if you will where it somehow controls people it's very
[3:40:02.780 --> 3:40:09.660]  very very very very very in mystique in mystery it doesn't tell a lot about that program but
[3:40:09.660 --> 3:40:14.940]  you know i i think that mockingbird is just another avenue of say cointel pro uh... people
[3:40:14.940 --> 3:40:19.180]  infiltrating movements and then spouting disinformation let's get bob chapman's take on
[3:40:19.180 --> 3:40:24.940]  uh... on operation mockingbird bob well i think that all you've said is true and these are the
[3:40:24.940 --> 3:40:30.060]  things of a going on for a long time uh... what i was encounter intelligence uh...
[3:40:30.060 --> 3:40:34.380]  that the main focus during the cold war i was the russians and
[3:40:34.380 --> 3:40:40.860]  the east germans and so on and yet uh... from time to time we did counterintelligence operations
[3:40:40.860 --> 3:40:47.340]  against our own allies yeah absolutely and you know what nothing incisive but we did do it
[3:40:47.340 --> 3:40:51.100]  and you know when we started to do it i i said to the people who
[3:40:51.100 --> 3:40:55.580]  were running things uh... look why are we doing this that these people are supposed to be our
[3:40:55.580 --> 3:40:59.340]  friends and they said well that you know what we got to make sure they still are
[3:41:00.380 --> 3:41:06.620]  and then i found out that all the other guys were doing it to us so i didn't feel too bad about it
[3:41:06.620 --> 3:41:13.420]  but the point is that uh... this counterintelligence type of operation goes on all the time this as
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:19.260]  you put it infiltration i mean look back in the nineteen sixties what the fb i was doing
[3:41:19.260 --> 3:41:24.540]  in infiltrating groups i mean they had all kinds of records and they wrote in uh...
[3:41:24.540 --> 3:41:29.900]  all kinds of uh... police departments as a matter of fact uh... my next door neighbor when i lived
[3:41:29.900 --> 3:41:37.180]  in malibu uh... they had to leave the l a p d b it was second in command uh... and uh... because
[3:41:37.740 --> 3:41:43.340]  they weren't supposed to be doing what they were doing spying on people and obviously the people
[3:41:43.340 --> 3:41:48.540]  in beveley hills didn't think too much of that uh... they hired him as police chief but anyway
[3:41:48.540 --> 3:41:53.900]  yeah these guys seem to get into high positions of power i mean exactly they're either the police
[3:41:53.900 --> 3:41:58.220]  chief or they're a city council member around they're on the board or they're a state senator
[3:41:58.220 --> 3:42:01.900]  or they're a local news anchor i mean they they're literally are entrenched
[3:42:01.900 --> 3:42:07.260]  in our society uh... anything else ryan makes it so hard to know who to trust with you know
[3:42:07.260 --> 3:42:11.580]  this georgia and russia stuff and hearing stories from the russian side and the georgian side in
[3:42:11.580 --> 3:42:15.740]  the u.s. side here's how i can i can differentiate for that for you because again i was under that
[3:42:15.740 --> 3:42:19.500]  same thing you know who's who's telling propaganda and who's telling right well
[3:42:19.500 --> 3:42:24.060]  sakas vealy is a very good speaker and he went on glenn beck for over twenty minutes
[3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:27.820]  talked really well talked about how you know georgia was a bastion for freedom
[3:42:27.820 --> 3:42:31.500]  and that the russians were acting very orwellian saying that they had it
[3:42:31.500 --> 3:42:35.580]  they had attacked them and it was a total incomplete live but then he really slips up
[3:42:35.580 --> 3:42:40.940]  at the last part of the interview he literally says that this is about the future of europe
[3:42:40.940 --> 3:42:46.380]  this is about the future of the new world order now this guy is a complete globalist he's been
[3:42:46.380 --> 3:42:52.380]  trying to get into nato now for some time they are the third largest amount of troops into iraq
[3:42:52.380 --> 3:42:57.420]  another thing that people didn't realize and the u.s. was putting in weapons systems both radar
[3:42:57.420 --> 3:43:01.660]  defense and offense in the right months before that now what they didn't tell you is that they
[3:43:01.660 --> 3:43:06.700]  were also running drills in preparation for this attack that's why georgia uh... that's why russia
[3:43:06.700 --> 3:43:10.860]  was able to get on the border of south ossetia because they began right running their own counter
[3:43:10.860 --> 3:43:16.380]  drills now i take the word of the twelve-year-old girl who was on fox who is from san francisco
[3:43:16.380 --> 3:43:20.220]  who stopped shepard smith in the middle of the conversation you can see my blog post over at
[3:43:20.220 --> 3:43:24.540]  loose change nine one dot com it's got both the videos and disgusting on it it's uh... it's called
[3:43:24.540 --> 3:43:28.860]  for those who still don't know and she literally stopped and said look i want to tell you i was
[3:43:28.860 --> 3:43:32.700]  i was in south ossetia it was the georgian troops that attacked us we were stuck in the
[3:43:32.700 --> 3:43:36.700]  basement all night the next day the russian troops actually help us get out of the country and they're
[3:43:36.700 --> 3:43:41.980]  the reason i got a flight back home uh... you know pappy backpap you can and who i would say
[3:43:41.980 --> 3:43:46.380]  is right on about seventy five to eighty percent of the issues has taken this position as well
[3:43:46.380 --> 3:43:51.260]  so yes project market mockingbird does make things difficult but i would i would suggest you check
[3:43:51.260 --> 3:43:56.540]  out those two videos to make a decision thank you ryan you got it all right let's go to dick
[3:43:56.540 --> 3:44:03.180]  in denver dick what's up you still with us thank you for taking my call you got it
[3:44:03.180 --> 3:44:08.780]  uh... you know who said if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of
[3:44:08.780 --> 3:44:15.500]  their money first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up
[3:44:15.500 --> 3:44:21.580]  around those banks will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up
[3:44:21.580 --> 3:44:26.860]  homeless on the continent their father's conquered i want to say that's jefferson let's take
[3:44:26.860 --> 3:44:33.260]  a chat man am i right andrew jackson ho it's thomas jefferson all right now and what a
[3:44:33.260 --> 3:44:41.340]  good what a amazing guy he is to pre-cognizize that it's amazing to me i have if i may just
[3:44:41.340 --> 3:44:47.020]  make a quick little statement i mean you know dividing conquerors the way the military industrial
[3:44:47.020 --> 3:44:52.380]  financial complex has retained power for generations whether the Rothschild and the
[3:44:52.380 --> 3:44:58.060]  napoleonic wars or the federal reserve in the neocon wars this has been the strategy used by
[3:44:58.060 --> 3:45:06.140]  the corporate complex to keep us all in savage servitude from waterloo to bagdad from caracas
[3:45:06.140 --> 3:45:13.500]  to a crack house from south africa to south central l.a from chicago 68 to denver 08 the game
[3:45:13.500 --> 3:45:21.100]  is the same divide and conquer the kings of commerce finance and industry play us like peon
[3:45:21.100 --> 3:45:28.940]  ponds in a chessboard divided up into us versus them and us versus us i will i totally agree with
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:33.260]  you dick i think that's brilliant yeah that was pretty brilliant wasn't i like the caracas to the
[3:45:33.260 --> 3:45:38.300]  crack houses and uh... you know we all know the war on drugs as a sham unfortunately black ops
[3:45:38.300 --> 3:45:44.380]  within this country was shipping in the drugs from south america noriega was a paid cia asset for
[3:45:44.380 --> 3:45:50.300]  years over 20 years 26 plus years until he went rogue and we brought him quote unquote
[3:45:50.300 --> 3:45:54.860]  to justice bob you've been in this game a lot longer than a young guy like myself
[3:45:54.860 --> 3:45:58.060]  you know how do we protect ourselves other than hard currency
[3:45:59.900 --> 3:46:05.580]  well uh... you discussed it earlier on and that is golden silver related assets that that's the
[3:46:05.580 --> 3:46:12.700]  best place to be and for those of you who can't or don't want to be totally in that venue then
[3:46:12.700 --> 3:46:18.220]  you can buy swiss frank government bonds which i think of the soundest government bonds in the
[3:46:18.220 --> 3:46:24.300]  world and uh... and so if you want information on that i can supply it for you and incidentally
[3:46:24.300 --> 3:46:29.500]  we don't get paid by anybody anybody that pays us the people who subscribe to the publication
[3:46:29.500 --> 3:46:34.540]  that's the end of it so if anybody needs help we give it to them that's what we're here for
[3:46:34.540 --> 3:46:39.180]  yeah i know a lot of people have a visions of us in the patriot movement living in like
[3:46:39.180 --> 3:46:44.460]  evangelist type houses and driving around the fanciest of cars that's just not the case folks
[3:46:44.460 --> 3:46:51.180]  i'm driving a 98 integra okay i mean i i don't have gold or diamonds on myself i don't have
[3:46:51.180 --> 3:46:57.420]  riches and wealth we don't do this for the money we do this because our entire way of life depends
[3:46:57.420 --> 3:47:02.940]  on it if we want a constitutional republic in the future if we want to see our bill of rights
[3:47:02.940 --> 3:47:07.900]  and our constitution is something other than a g damn piece of paper we better work at it
[3:47:07.900 --> 3:47:12.140]  we better wake up we better have the will to fight the tyranny and you know that's why
[3:47:12.140 --> 3:47:16.940]  i look up to alex man he made it happen he took thousands of dollars out of his own pocket and
[3:47:16.940 --> 3:47:21.100]  went down to the dnc he's taken thousands of dollars out of his own pocket and going to new
[3:47:21.100 --> 3:47:27.020]  york this year you know these things take money and you know he has one of the largest audiences
[3:47:27.820 --> 3:47:31.420]  in the world right now i mean we're reaching out to celebrities and why is that important
[3:47:31.420 --> 3:47:36.380]  well because people are so obsessed with celebrity they're more apt to listen to charlie sheen roseo
[3:47:36.380 --> 3:47:43.340]  donnell jesse ventura and uh willy nelson rather than steven jones kevin ryan myself alex and bob
[3:47:43.340 --> 3:47:49.100]  chatman and that is the power in that so you know i i hope that people keep spreading the message
[3:47:49.100 --> 3:47:54.380]  you go to the international forecaster dot com you share your prison planet dot tv link you burn
[3:47:54.380 --> 3:47:59.900]  copies of fabled enemies when it comes out you get people to understand the different paradigms
[3:47:59.900 --> 3:48:03.420]  of this thing because it's not something you're going to learn overnight it's not something
[3:48:03.420 --> 3:48:08.780]  that you're going to ingest and and be happy about i'm not happy about this situation i don't wake up
[3:48:08.780 --> 3:48:13.900]  in the morning go on so glad that rogue elements in our government and other nations carried out 9

[3:52:08.620 --> 3:52:13.260]  light bulbs in around the food service children in daycare alex children in daycare but the point
[3:52:13.260 --> 3:52:18.300]  is we didn't come out here at that time but we show up this is the group that says okay we had
[3:52:18.300 --> 3:52:22.700]  some website link and some groups that are part of us that you know that did call for some you
[3:52:22.700 --> 3:52:29.180]  know you know some things but you're liars you should say that then uh i'm over quietly talking
[3:52:29.180 --> 3:52:36.460]  to crowds of people and they come over and start bullhorning me saying i'm not allowed basically
[3:52:36.460 --> 3:52:40.220]  to be there and then i'm a racist and then i hate black people in hispanics just totally
[3:52:40.220 --> 3:52:45.660]  made up classic leftist bull uh you know to to to to neutralize and demonize with all these black
[3:52:45.660 --> 3:52:49.420]  folks and stuff and you know people that knew me were like yay alex jones is a spanish boss
[3:52:49.420 --> 3:52:53.660]  yeah we know alex he's good so they were lying about me and i was countering he's bullhorning
[3:52:53.660 --> 3:53:00.940]  right in my face then people start bumping into me hitting me and they say leave you're disrupting
[3:53:00.940 --> 3:53:05.260]  the demonstration but it's just a public melee and i say look i'm just here talking he's the guy
[3:53:05.260 --> 3:53:08.860]  bullhorning me and they say stop it so they start bumping into me hitting me with their elbows
[3:53:08.860 --> 3:53:15.660]  then i found out that they found out that erin was with info wars dot com 30 minutes before when i
[3:53:15.660 --> 3:53:20.220]  was in a separate area and they came over to him and they said you're with info wars dot com
[3:53:20.220 --> 3:53:24.940]  you talk about about recreate 68 start talking to one of the organizers and they said get out of here
[3:53:24.940 --> 3:53:28.940]  and erin said look i just want to interview the war turkish only said no start hitting his camera
[3:53:28.940 --> 3:53:33.820]  they said you lied and said we're violent get out of here bam wham and start hitting the camera
[3:53:33.820 --> 3:53:37.820]  erin's right here videotaping but for now erin tell them what happened to you yeah that's exactly
[3:53:37.820 --> 3:53:41.980]  what happened i just want a brief statement from war turkish whatever he wanted to say he wouldn't
[3:53:41.980 --> 3:53:46.780]  talk to us and they wouldn't talk to info wars dot com they said not after what he said about
[3:53:46.780 --> 3:53:53.180]  recreate 68 implying that we said they were violent which is other groups but you know we had them on
[3:53:53.180 --> 3:53:57.500]  well don't go to the shieldbook where they call the camera obviously contradicting what they were
[3:53:57.500 --> 3:54:01.260]  trying to prove and that's basically what happened they ran me out of the area and said you're not
[3:54:01.260 --> 3:54:05.020]  welcome here well we had good news is i know we're coming back out in the final segment right now
[3:54:05.020 --> 3:54:09.260]  aren't we uh yeah we should be here on this final so we are on the final segment as we speak we're
[3:54:09.260 --> 3:54:15.740]  in okay well i just want to read the listeners the recreates the eight some of the organizers
[3:54:15.740 --> 3:54:20.620]  folks and so they were in charge came over and bullhorned us told us that we basically couldn't
[3:54:20.620 --> 3:54:25.180]  even be there on the city street then started bumping into us saying leave started hitting me
[3:54:25.180 --> 3:54:29.900]  i mean hard i mean we're throwing elbows into my stomach there were cops across the street
[3:54:29.900 --> 3:54:34.780]  they would have come over and arrested us all so i just left but luke was live streaming on the
[3:54:34.780 --> 3:54:39.900]  web on his we are changed sites so that went out we're now driving around inside the city with
[3:54:39.900 --> 3:54:46.380]  their checkpoints and police we we just drove for a big one before we went live at info wars.com
[3:54:47.100 --> 3:54:53.580]  on the video stream just drove through a big one uh there uh but but weren't going live yet
[3:54:53.580 --> 3:54:57.900]  we're going to continue or a drive back through get out show you the demonstration then in the
[3:54:57.900 --> 3:55:02.060]  anarchists are planning are planning to surround the mint and the feds have said if they touch the
[3:55:02.060 --> 3:55:06.460]  fence they might shoot so that's going to be probably a rest going on there we're going back
[3:55:06.460 --> 3:55:11.500]  to the camp later we have a live event feed it's all the info wars dot com on our justin tv
[3:55:11.500 --> 3:55:16.140]  channel we want the listeners to take all these clips and all these feeds edit them together
[3:55:16.140 --> 3:55:23.580]  post them uh up on info wars dot com on youtube you know go to the live video feed listeners
[3:55:23.580 --> 3:55:27.820]  capture it put it on youtube get it out to everybody to curtain them out of paul watson
[3:55:27.820 --> 3:55:31.180]  help us because we're showing people it's really happening but bottom line people that claim
[3:55:31.180 --> 3:55:36.940]  that they're quote anarchists and recreate 68 told us basically to get out of there we're bumping
[3:55:36.940 --> 3:55:42.380]  into us saying we didn't have free speech and we're being violent so here's another example of us
[3:55:42.380 --> 3:55:46.700]  peacefully being there uh and again i could have stood there and yelled and screamed and
[3:55:46.700 --> 3:55:51.260]  keep getting hit by them the plumber documented they were bumping into us documented what they
[3:55:51.260 --> 3:55:56.380]  were doing documented they were bullhorning us and we just left there they are attacking the
[3:55:56.380 --> 3:55:59.660]  first amendment understand they're screaming at us with bull horns and then they're and then
[3:55:59.660 --> 3:56:04.380]  they're organized for coming over say now it's jones get out of here your cousin problems uh
[3:56:04.380 --> 3:56:08.860]  said and then and then separately with erin slapping his camera going we're not violent

[3:59:15.020 --> 3:59:27.980]  the dnc and challenging these guys on their lives is just uber essential

[3:59:50.460 --> 3:59:55.100]  guys give me some shots out the windows of scenes downtown if you could only see the
[3:59:55.100 --> 3:59:59.740]  checkpoint the riot police shoving people to the ground treating people like cattle but now
[3:59:59.740 --> 4:00:03.420]  we're basically shut down and having trouble getting back over there we're about to be over by
[4:00:03.420 --> 4:00:09.180]  the pepsi center uh so we're just gonna give you some shots out the window uh what's going on out
[4:00:09.180 --> 4:00:14.060]  here and some scenes as we try to get back over the demonstrations right so we're gonna keep
[4:00:14.060 --> 4:00:20.860]  streaming live right now we're all adjusting tv people uh that are watching don't forget we have
[4:00:20.860 --> 4:00:26.940]  the internet stream jason bermas is going to be live for the next hour in overdrive at info wars dot
[4:00:26.940 --> 4:00:33.020]  com taking your calls if you're in denver you want to report something you've seen calling the jason
[4:00:33.020 --> 4:00:42.460]  bermas and um there's just a lot more you can do uh richard you don't have to video take why don't
[4:00:42.460 --> 4:00:51.180]  you give rob a five minute report get shots of that interview richard give me a five minute break
[4:00:53.260 --> 4:00:57.180]  richard uh well it's been definitely an exciting day trying to get the live feed work
[4:00:57.180 --> 4:01:01.180]  it's the first time we've ever used it so we've had to troubleshoot it a bit but we're gonna be
[4:01:01.180 --> 4:01:06.540]  ready to go we've got a a uh car booster battery here that we've got to carry with so we should
[4:01:06.540 --> 4:01:10.620]  be able to stay live the rest of the time that we need to one of you witnesses the witness that
[4:01:10.620 --> 4:01:16.860]  maybe we haven't seen on camera yet uh anything uh well separated yeah so far when we were separated
[4:01:16.860 --> 4:01:22.940]  that kind of put me out of the loop of the activity i was troubleshooting the uh live webcam but the
[4:01:22.940 --> 4:01:26.060]  good news is bottom line is we're going to be able to continue the rest of the day now and then
[4:01:26.060 --> 4:01:33.420]  tomorrow for sure we're going to be able to be up for the whole program if necessary so it's been
[4:01:33.420 --> 4:01:36.860]  quite an exciting time though i can tell you that when we were down there at the makeshift FEMA camp
[4:01:37.660 --> 4:01:43.500]  they uh as most people on dustin tv saw us that they talked to us a little bit but they rapidly
[4:01:43.500 --> 4:01:49.100]  backed off these cameras are the best piece of equipment we have to keep our rights and freedoms
[4:01:49.100 --> 4:01:53.980]  here in the us and so we plan on using them to the fullest and with the technology that we have
[4:01:53.980 --> 4:02:00.060]  right now that uh has been pioneered by a lot of people to stream live on the web and put it out
[4:02:00.060 --> 4:02:04.620]  there for the world to see it's definitely what we got to continue doing and even get better at it
[4:02:04.620 --> 4:02:08.540]  and i think it's going to happen i know it's going to happen Richard anything else you want to add
[4:02:08.540 --> 4:02:14.300]  about the FEMA camp today and then i want you to debrief Rob for five minutes so so Richard you
[4:02:14.300 --> 4:02:18.460]  keep being interviewed anything else you want to add or you take the camera just set the big one
[4:02:18.460 --> 4:02:24.140]  down it's okay and then you interview Rob well to me uh one of the big highlights was that you
[4:02:24.140 --> 4:02:29.100]  actually had a viewer that showed up uh within 30 minutes of going live right within 30 minutes of
[4:02:29.100 --> 4:02:36.620]  going live it was a really big highlight that a listener of alex jones shows up and uh starts to
[4:02:37.260 --> 4:02:42.380]  come up there and be involved with the activities he goes up there and talks to cops so that was
[4:02:42.380 --> 4:02:47.740]  really cool that he showed up and uh that was just the highlight of it for me at that point
[4:02:47.740 --> 4:02:52.140]  knowing that there's an audience out there that's activists like that and i think he's just one of
[4:02:52.140 --> 4:02:56.780]  very uh whole bunch i know a lot of them we're here during the keep going this is a big checkpoint
[4:02:56.780 --> 4:03:01.900]  where the cops are shoving people around is down there so as i pull out try to get a shot okay
[4:03:01.900 --> 4:03:03.900]  let me hand it up to erin erin
[4:03:11.900 --> 4:03:15.580]  all right they're getting outside right now and we'll go back to them in one moment of
[4:03:15.580 --> 4:03:21.100]  course we're taking live stream from the dnc you can see the video if you're a prismplanet.tv
[4:03:21.100 --> 4:03:25.580]  subscriber and we are in overdrive my name is jason bermus you can check out my material over at
[4:03:25.580 --> 4:03:33.580]  loochchange911.com or you can get my latest film fabled enemies over at prismplanet.tv right now
[4:03:33.580 --> 4:03:39.180]  in info wars.com let's go back to the feed because we're looking at some black uniform police officers
[4:03:39.180 --> 4:03:47.180]  they're driving away now let's see the comments
[4:03:47.180 --> 4:04:07.180]  good job guys uh here's some here's some cops on horses
[4:04:07.180 --> 4:04:17.180]  just roaming around we've got them in the black uniforms and helmets on horses over here some of the cops that are not known to the teeth
[4:04:17.180 --> 4:04:21.500]  they're not quite in full right here they've got the police mask on
[4:04:25.500 --> 4:04:31.820]  you know folks the reason that we're covering this is because again it's not about right or left
[4:04:31.820 --> 4:04:36.700]  you know a lot of people are like why aren't you going to the rnc well the dnc is just as important
[4:04:36.700 --> 4:04:41.820]  they have tried to provocateur violence here uh you know as erin just told us they try to get an
[4:04:41.820 --> 4:04:46.780]  interview with warred church hill and what happens i'll tell you what happens the recreate 68 guys
[4:04:46.780 --> 4:04:51.420]  come over and start batting his camera cursing at him telling him to leave and then warred church hill
[4:04:51.420 --> 4:04:59.340]  refuses to give a comment all right let's go back to the live feed
[4:04:59.340 --> 4:05:11.980]  ride by the police forces get a shot of this
[4:05:12.940 --> 4:05:17.980]  so amazing camera work being done by either uh erin brawler richard
[4:05:17.980 --> 4:05:21.980]  and i couldn't tell you where they're right next to these cops right now
[4:05:21.980 --> 4:05:30.620]  so
[4:05:40.460 --> 4:05:48.620]  when you know we have this amount of a police force on the streets of denver to try to stop the
[4:05:48.620 --> 4:05:55.900]  quote unquote riots that are ensuing well those riots are provocateur a lot of those people know
[4:05:55.900 --> 4:06:00.300]  exactly what they're doing that's why they're wearing masks that's why they're acting violent
[4:06:00.300 --> 4:06:05.340]  that's why they don't have a real political stance other than governments are bad and corporate
[4:06:05.340 --> 4:06:10.540]  corruption is bad well no kidding it's bad but you have to have a solution you have to point out
[4:06:10.540 --> 4:06:15.020]  what's wrong and how to fix it see these guys just want you to believe that we can function with no
[4:06:15.020 --> 4:06:20.700]  government it's absolutely ludicrous we can't just function with no government whatsoever
[4:06:21.260 --> 4:06:27.580]  we need some type of order we need some type of semblance and i believe that that is provided to
[4:06:27.580 --> 4:06:33.820]  us under the bill of rights and the constitution but these anarchists are going to tell you that
[4:06:33.820 --> 4:06:38.380]  the bill of rights and constitution are no good and just like alex said many of them are really
[4:06:38.380 --> 4:06:43.900]  communist but it's not hip to use that term at this point all right let's let's clock back in on
[4:06:43.900 --> 4:06:55.180]  the laptop and see what jones and company are up to right now they're really just touring the
[4:06:55.180 --> 4:06:58.940]  streets of denver in the car i'm not sure where they're headed whether they're headed towards the
[4:06:58.940 --> 4:07:05.340]  pepsi center or away from the pepsi center but uh again you can watch the live feed for free at
[4:07:05.340 --> 4:07:09.260]  info wars dot com we're gonna go back into some of the demonstrations in a minute but i want you to
[4:07:09.260 --> 4:07:15.660]  put your camera down rom and i want like five minutes i want a breakdown of the whole trip
[4:07:15.660 --> 4:07:21.500]  of you a rundown you know again i want to run down to the whole trip what happened today i want
[4:07:21.500 --> 4:07:26.300]  robert's perspective on the anarchist what they did and then and then i want robert interviewed
[4:07:26.300 --> 4:07:33.980]  erin after that so here we go okay richard you uh you interview rob just stick up between sit
[4:07:33.980 --> 4:07:41.580]  camera all right let's get over now okay wherever works well this is the first time i've ever been
[4:07:41.580 --> 4:07:46.220]  to denver so i have to say it's one of those beautiful cities i've ever seen the air here is
[4:07:46.220 --> 4:07:54.540]  great it's awesome uh upon arriving uh this morning going to the detention center um basically
[4:07:56.300 --> 4:08:02.380]  oh no and they cut out right as we're i'm gonna try to re reset the stream hopefully they'll be
[4:08:02.380 --> 4:08:07.260]  broadcasting in a moment folks uh it seems like it just cut off my bracket here we go
[4:08:07.260 --> 4:08:13.100]  one we actually went and uh you know wanted to interview some police officers who were there
[4:08:13.100 --> 4:08:20.380]  at the detention center this guy was still slinking around and going into uh parking spots and
[4:08:20.380 --> 4:08:25.900]  pretending like we couldn't see him when he clearly knew we could see him and he could see us so
[4:08:25.900 --> 4:08:32.140]  it was a little on the ridiculous side on behalf of the police um it just seemed like uh sort of
[4:08:32.140 --> 4:08:36.940]  cartoony you know these guys would inch forward as we took a step forward and they'd inch back as
[4:08:36.940 --> 4:08:42.700]  we took a step back or if we aimed the camera that just slowly turned away and then after that uh we
[4:08:42.700 --> 4:08:49.020]  definitely saw what looked like a heat ray weapon or a sound device it's a microwave gun microwave
[4:08:49.020 --> 4:08:54.540]  gun they had the telltale signs uh alex and i both saw it i think erin's erin quite a glimpse of it
[4:08:54.540 --> 4:09:01.180]  was driving by us it was driving by us uh came out of the campus yeah he came out of the camp
[4:09:01.180 --> 4:09:08.380]  he was being dragged this this uh device was being dragged on a toe kind of thing it was a single solid
[4:09:08.380 --> 4:09:15.660]  thing with its own wheels and it had a vehicle ahead of it drawing it you know and so that was uh
[4:09:15.660 --> 4:09:21.260]  you know seeing that confirmed everything that these guys have these weapons here they may be
[4:09:21.260 --> 4:09:27.740]  planning to use them they may not um that all depends on uh you know whatever their arrangement is
[4:09:27.740 --> 4:09:34.060]  with this uh weapon but the fact of the matter is it is present here and these people do plan
[4:09:34.620 --> 4:09:40.620]  perhaps somebody is planning on using it probably on an american susan's right here in a good old
[4:09:40.620 --> 4:09:47.020]  us of a and uh so we go up to the anarchist a few hours later we go up to the anarchist
[4:09:47.020 --> 4:09:54.780]  demonstration you know it seems peaceful enough until these people uh we go up to him this guy
[4:09:54.780 --> 4:09:59.820]  took a bullhorn out and said to alex if you could bullhorn then i could bullhorn i think the
[4:09:59.820 --> 4:10:04.140]  difference between alex's bullhorn and this guy's bullhorn is alex usually bullhorns into a wide
[4:10:04.140 --> 4:10:11.100]  open area into uh basically an audience of people who are either listening or not listening this guy
[4:10:11.100 --> 4:10:17.100]  took a bullhorn out and put it directly into alex's face turned up the volume screamed right on him and
[4:10:17.100 --> 4:10:24.220]  that was nice though up we lost it again folks man that the buffering on this it's we're not losing
[4:10:24.220 --> 4:10:31.660]  it on the outside video feed for some reason but we we are losing it on the uh on the uh audio feed
[4:10:31.660 --> 4:10:36.780]  from the laptop i'm going to refresh and hopefully we'll get back to rob jacobson and his account of
[4:10:36.780 --> 4:10:44.620]  everything going down at the dnc let's see now we're not broadcasting all right this is a live
[4:10:44.620 --> 4:10:50.940]  guerrilla radio we may wrap it up at half past the hour and go into uh the beginning of the show
[4:10:50.940 --> 4:10:54.780]  in the beginning of the show was jam packed i mean alex joined us straight up from the dnc it wasn't
[4:10:54.780 --> 4:10:59.420]  long before we actually got to the detention camps we had alan wad of cutting through the matrix
[4:10:59.420 --> 4:11:04.540]  dot com on and i'm a big fan of alan wad i'd like to book him for a later in the week really i'd
[4:11:04.540 --> 4:11:10.460]  like to get him on again he is very insightful and he had a lot of great information on quigley and
[4:11:10.460 --> 4:11:18.300]  the roundtable group among other things today now it's important that people repost this stuff
[4:11:18.300 --> 4:11:23.660]  uh why is it important because it shows the provocateur nature of these anarchists it's
[4:11:23.660 --> 4:11:29.180]  important to show these detention facilities why because most people still think these detention
[4:11:29.180 --> 4:11:37.020]  facilities don't exist it's important to emphasize these microwave guns um why is it important because
[4:11:37.020 --> 4:11:43.740]  this is weaponry that is being used against the people rendering us almost powerless in any physical
[4:11:43.740 --> 4:11:47.260]  sense i mean it literally cripples you right there you feel like you're on fire you're gonna drop
[4:11:47.260 --> 4:11:54.220]  whatever you have you're gonna run away so you know they really are highlighting their new police
[4:11:54.220 --> 4:12:02.060]  state technology here at the dnc at another reason to be there you know i again denver is a beautiful
[4:12:02.060 --> 4:12:07.500]  place i've only been out there once it was of february of this year i was completely impressed by it
[4:12:08.060 --> 4:12:13.500]  and i really just would hate to see things get out of control there you know alex and company are
[4:12:13.500 --> 4:12:19.900]  there to cover the news i encourage them to keep covering the news to keep at it to keep
[4:12:19.900 --> 4:12:26.620]  showing people the truth i mean it it's essential it's essential we break down these barriers
[4:12:27.260 --> 4:12:33.660]  that really we've set for ourselves from slothfulness from laziness from the willingness
[4:12:33.660 --> 4:12:40.300]  to do nothing to be apathetic to not care what's going on and you know since we're not broadcasting
[4:12:40.300 --> 4:12:44.140]  right now are we broadcasting no we're still not on the loop all right we're gonna i think i'm gonna
