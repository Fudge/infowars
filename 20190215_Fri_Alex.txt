[00:00.000 --> 00:16.480]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:16.480 --> 00:40.480]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:46.480 --> 00:52.800]  Well I told you back in October that Trump needed a declared emergency and I told you
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.040]  a month ago that I thought he was going to do it in the shutdown because that was what
[00:57.040 --> 01:03.280]  the word was and now he's done it just minutes ago we'll play that speech parts of it here
[01:03.280 --> 01:08.760]  in a moment and all of it here in the next hour and he just concluded and then you've
[01:08.760 --> 01:18.360]  got ABC Empire actor staged attack that's what police believe he used two of his confederates
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.760]  that reportedly worked with him other actors and stage the attack that's that's where this
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.880]  is all leading and of course he staged the attack of course he did I mean I'm going to
[01:30.880 --> 01:40.280]  say it again 99% of racial attacks are staged I'm a newshound it's all I do for 25 years
[01:40.280 --> 01:48.160]  24 years and everybody knows that and by the way you'll hear about some white woman you
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.040]  know two black men raped her and carved honky in her back and turns out that's not true
[01:52.040 --> 02:00.200]  either most of these things are staged like most firefighters are great people but in a
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.480]  lot of towns and cities when they keep having arson and they notice that it's done particularly
[02:04.480 --> 02:10.320]  well they start investigating and surveilling firefighters and about a third of the time
[02:10.320 --> 02:17.680]  it's a firefighter a good portion of the time it's a minority of the time but it's still
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.320]  a portion of it when they keep finding pipe bombs on the side of the road and then they're
[02:23.320 --> 02:27.520]  the hero bomb squad guy keeps finding them and keeps well they start following that guy
[02:27.520 --> 02:35.280]  and catch him doing it I mean it happens over and over and over again but I'm the bad guy
[02:35.280 --> 02:43.280]  for questioning Sandy Hook because Hillary brought it up years after I had the internet
[02:43.280 --> 02:49.760]  had not believed it because people don't know what to believe anymore because so many times
[02:49.760 --> 02:56.600]  things are staged now some of the anomalies people raised about hook turned out to not
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.320]  be accurate and I looked at those parents on TV and what they were saying and looked
[03:02.320 --> 03:08.880]  real but the minute before I was ever sued or threatened with suit the minute I said
[03:08.880 --> 03:16.560]  I thought it happened it was lawsuit which shows very interesting psychology and so if
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.880]  Sandy Hook didn't kill the second amendment it's killing the first I've talked to top
[03:21.880 --> 03:28.200]  lawyers that have been at the biggest events in the country some on record some off record
[03:28.200 --> 03:31.200]  and we had a lot of lawyers here the last two weeks deciding what I'm going to do I'm
[03:31.200 --> 03:37.720]  going to sue to have to fight back and they're at these big conferences and point blank they
[03:37.720 --> 03:42.240]  go oh we're getting rid of the first amendment for the general public and it's going to be
[03:42.240 --> 03:48.120]  the Alex Jones doctrine the Alex Jones statue it's being called that and they're getting
[03:48.120 --> 03:52.320]  all the lawyers together and they're saying this is how it is we're going to get rid
[03:52.320 --> 03:56.720]  of anybody we say is fake news just the media corporate media will say it and then you don't
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.120]  have first amendment protections but then the superclass they will and there's big debates
[04:02.120 --> 04:09.240]  at the Texas Supreme Court at the Texas bar at the Connecticut bar New York bar top debates
[04:09.240 --> 04:17.000]  are this is going to end up getting everybody and so now there's top level meetings they're
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.960]  like you need to drop these Sandy Hook lawsuits on Jones because it's it's it's rigged I
[04:21.960 --> 04:30.360]  mean 100% railroad job right into shutting down him for worse in fact the lawyers involved
[04:30.360 --> 04:34.080]  say that we're going to shut him down that's what we're going to do and then they misrepresent
[04:34.080 --> 04:41.400]  all the facts it's it's crazy but it's so evil and so diabolical and so on American
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.720]  that there's been a big turn in the American bar association the highest levels they're
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.160]  like we're really going to get rid of due process in the first amendment in this whole deal
[04:50.160 --> 04:54.200]  and crackdown on media I mean America's going authoritarian and I've been chosen as the
[04:54.200 --> 05:12.960]  test case we'll be right back stay with us by leaps and by bounds the number one best
[05:12.960 --> 05:19.280]  selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.760]  riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.000]  you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects we have
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.360]  developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout
[05:35.360 --> 05:41.680]  and beyond system in the world there's nothing else like it must experience it it is a total
[05:41.680 --> 05:46.560]  game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water whatever
[05:46.560 --> 05:51.520]  you'd like warning though it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half packet the
[05:51.520 --> 05:55.320]  first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take
[05:55.320 --> 06:17.680]  you into overdrive turbo force and enforce live comm
[06:17.680 --> 06:26.880]  morrow's news today waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[06:26.880 --> 06:47.360]  front lines of the info war well president trump just minutes ago declared a national
[06:47.360 --> 07:00.720]  emergency taking back executive power from the usurper and see policy and a bc's empire
[07:00.720 --> 07:07.080]  star is very close to being criminally charged they've already got who they believe were
[07:07.080 --> 07:12.800]  his accomplices in staging the event in a city like chicago under total surveillance
[07:12.800 --> 07:20.000]  jesse mullet i'm sorry small it staged attack that's what the police believe well of course
[07:20.000 --> 07:37.160]  he did west point the marine corps training facilities the army training facilities all
[07:37.160 --> 07:43.520]  of them have the exact same staged event in the barracks and at the vending machines
[07:43.520 --> 07:54.120]  saying no in words allowed and it's all done under orders of the whole network of the democratic
[07:54.120 --> 08:00.680]  party they are encouraged to do it and now that they've demonized me in the nose i'm
[08:00.680 --> 08:07.280]  gonna talk about this later not because it's about me because it's so illustrative john
[08:07.280 --> 08:17.840]  ronston i've known 20 years and who acts all nice and friendly but then every time doesn't
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.400]  deliver on what he says he'll do super manipulative and i told him i said i know you're manipulating
[08:21.400 --> 08:34.400]  people but i'll i'll go on your npr show because it does have 5 million listeners and they
[08:34.400 --> 08:41.160]  have been camped out in rockwall texas where i'm from i guess for months off and on canvassing
[08:41.160 --> 08:54.920]  everybody and then they get me on the interview that they're in a couple weeks and literally
[08:54.920 --> 09:01.080]  make up whole cloth and stories and i would guess what i know ronston learned the truth
[09:01.080 --> 09:07.960]  i've got his text messages they might make a mini documentary out of this he's like oh
[09:07.960 --> 09:11.720]  it's like wow all that's pretty incredible stuff pretty incredible stories and i'm like
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.160]  oh so you did go talk to people i'm not bragging i don't live back in high school couldn't
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.720]  wait to go to high school i didn't particularly dislike it i was just i had college friends
[09:19.720 --> 09:27.440]  i guess i'm already getting to the story and ronston was working on this theory that
[09:27.440 --> 09:33.800]  i was this loner and unhappy and that's why i'm this bad person and you know like psychopaths
[09:33.800 --> 09:40.760]  i guess have bad you know up rings or whatever he's written a book about that associate pastor
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.120]  was trying to understand themselves and they project it on to you and at the end of the
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.440]  interview he goes i know this has been traumatic i apologize alex i i know your your childhood
[09:52.440 --> 09:59.960]  was traumatic and it's okay if you need to call me and you need to break down or anything
[09:59.960 --> 10:07.080]  but i know they're gonna edit it so i i recorded the whole thing with video audio everything
[10:07.080 --> 10:13.200]  i told him that as well i don't think he was listening at the end i go you know i recorded
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.280]  this he goes you did alex so i'm gonna get to that later on the national emergency and
[10:18.280 --> 10:25.160]  all the big news it's just i never do mainstream interviews but i have this thing for people
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.280]  i've known a long time and ronston is a smart and interesting guy but come on alex you're
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.680]  such a powerful and important person please do the interview it's it's very it's very
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.480]  nice the story it's actually uplifting and wild wild west and i mean i've got all the
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.360]  text messages and i'm like dude you're manipulating me telling me i'm powerful and i'm important
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.000]  i said there's no way you're gonna tell any of the real stories because they make me look
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.920]  like john wane and my bragging it's just you know it was very rough high school a lot
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.720]  of people started fights and i was in hundreds of fights but people attacked me going starting
[11:01.720 --> 11:07.920]  on fifth grade hundreds of times kids that were two or three grades you know out of school
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.840]  and like i said when i was in sixth grade there were a lot of kids with mustaches they
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.640]  go around and beat people up to school do nothing because if they were minorities that
[11:17.640 --> 11:22.640]  means god and so the white kids all got to be beaten up and say that's why i'm the bad
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.800]  racist you see i'm the person that's been racially attacked let's not exaggerate a hundred
[11:27.800 --> 11:37.640]  times and they didn't pick any of the racial attacks they picked a fight with a i guess
[11:37.640 --> 11:45.520]  the term would be redneck or roper they picked one of those fights and then totally misrepresented
[11:45.520 --> 11:52.320]  what happened to make me the villain and then made up some other wild story and the reason
[11:52.320 --> 11:59.760]  i bring this up is it's like being raped when these people pretend to be journalists and
[11:59.760 --> 12:08.800]  then they just completely make up whatever they want completely make up whatever they
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.080]  want and they use props people that are like well alex shows a villain alex shows a bad
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.600]  guy so we'll say you were swastika shoes that was an eoc complaint no proof that dropped
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.160]  totally false i mean if you ever catch me wearing swastika shoes that's what you need
[12:24.160 --> 12:31.520]  to shoot me hitler was a horrible loser he destroyed europe he killed 20 million germans
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.880]  not to mention 27 million russians and millions of jews and people i mean i'm just so sick
[12:36.880 --> 12:44.640]  of hitler and i'm sick of hearing i'm associated with hitler and i'm sick of all the racist
[12:44.640 --> 12:49.440]  minorities pointing their finger at white people and saying we're the bad people it's disgusting
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.080]  and the left are the ones fueling it the average quote minority just wants to live their life
[12:54.080 --> 13:02.720]  they're good people but i just i knew exactly what cabinon red cabinon felt like but they
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.360]  were saying that he raped women and then all these other women came out later when they got charged
[13:07.360 --> 13:14.400]  said okay i just made it up you know it's political the truth is i know people that no cabinon i
[13:14.400 --> 13:23.120]  checked into it they go dude that dude was a virgin when he got married ultra super nerd mr first in
[13:23.120 --> 13:35.680]  class every test mr study 20 hours for every test i know the type it's not a bad type my son is
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.400]  obsessed with making a perfect grant on the sat i mean he's not cabinon level you know uh
[13:41.840 --> 13:45.760]  leave it to beaver but he's close i'm like my god my son's like leave it to beaver this is wonderful
[13:45.760 --> 13:50.400]  he wins all the speech awards he he's very outgoing he takes girls out on dates but
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.800]  you know he's he's gonna you know kiss him or anything till he gets serious in college and i'm
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.320]  like well i'm gonna you know 30 years ago i said that guy's a wimp i'd say man i'm proud of my son
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.680]  the point is imagine cabinon where he's all about his whole life a straight lace his whole life is
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.080]  executing by the book and that's his whole value and then these people come along and just make all
[14:12.080 --> 14:22.080]  this crap up and they sit there knowing it's made up knowing the truth
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.720]  knowing the truth and they don't want anything to do with it it's like louis gomer congressman
[14:28.720 --> 14:39.440]  from texas told sundar pachai he said you wouldn't know the light if you saw it because you've never
[14:39.440 --> 14:48.160]  seen it he's don't know what light is now i was wild i was out of control i was a a hellion i wasn't
[14:48.160 --> 14:53.280]  like a criminal but i was a hellion and thank god i made it out of about 16 and a half but the point
[14:53.280 --> 15:00.880]  is they don't want any of that truth they just want to make stuff up and and again i know everyone
[15:00.880 --> 15:11.280]  knows it but until you experience the premeditated lying i mean take megan kelly she says it's not
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.040]  about sandy hook i want to know about you're so interesting and about your family and about your

[15:42.640 --> 15:49.920]  going to lie because that's who they are it's what they do they can't do anything else

[21:55.680 --> 22:02.160]  and showtime characters and comedy central characters saying it's me playing clips of me
[22:02.160 --> 22:08.720]  on the shows and i walk down the street and people go it's homeland man it's homeland demand
[22:08.720 --> 22:16.080]  i've had national reporters in the studio and they look they're looking for the fake news command
[22:16.080 --> 22:23.600]  base with the hundred people typing lies that's the new york times not us of course the public
[22:23.600 --> 22:28.880]  didn't buy sandy hook because they don't know what to buy you've got the police saying they believe
[22:29.520 --> 22:35.920]  that the empire star on abc staged the attack with two of his associates his assistants
[22:35.920 --> 22:38.720]  fellow actors
[22:42.080 --> 22:50.160]  that's abc news babies and incubators that never died but we went to war and millions died
[22:50.160 --> 22:59.280]  and now in albright like a big fat swollen tick a blunt drunk demon tells 60 minutes to cue that
[22:59.280 --> 23:05.920]  up if you can 500 000 dead iraqi kids are a good price to pay close quote
[23:12.160 --> 23:18.400]  but she's a good person i'm the bad man because i question these groups and these organizations
[23:18.400 --> 23:24.080]  and you're not supposed to do that america you're supposed to roll over and you're supposed to let
[23:24.080 --> 23:28.480]  them take your children and take your country and take your guns and take your property and take
[23:28.480 --> 23:36.160]  your god well i'm not rolling over to it and and let me tell you in the last 24 hours i have had
[23:36.160 --> 23:44.960]  incredibly good news that i'm not at liberty to get to on multiple fronts multiple fronts i mean
[23:44.960 --> 23:51.760]  very good news and i know people want good news and so q you know gives you this good news and
[23:51.760 --> 23:56.800]  everybody's in on the q thing and the little breadcrumbs and they're smart and they know it's real
[23:56.800 --> 24:07.040]  it's like a fortune cookie this is the real world i told you trump was going to win i got on the
[24:07.040 --> 24:12.960]  front line to get people mobilized to do it you did it as well i told you the national emergency
[24:12.960 --> 24:20.400]  was coming i told you they were going to fire assassins and i keep telling you everything
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.840]  that's going to happen and so we can fight the bad stuff and hope it does it and then
[24:25.840 --> 24:30.560]  the few times we actually stop something bad people go oh it didn't happen and then we find
[24:30.560 --> 24:36.640]  out they tried to do it and that's really my message everybody here is we can win this fight
[24:41.840 --> 24:48.080]  but we have to let it burn into our brains real good and real hard myself included like why in
[24:48.080 --> 24:58.400]  hayes why in the river stitch why in the night circle why in the gates of hell
[25:02.320 --> 25:04.080]  why in the old serpents arse
[25:06.880 --> 25:08.480]  did i give npr interview
[25:08.480 --> 25:17.200]  because you go back one more time thinking someday they'll tell the truth someday but
[25:17.200 --> 25:25.120]  they won't because they are frauds they are fiction writers living in the real world
[25:25.120 --> 25:31.040]  trying to be wizards and control people's outlook and manipulate reality into what they
[25:31.040 --> 25:36.560]  want reality to be instead of us just pointing out how god made things and the natural order
[25:36.560 --> 25:43.680]  that feels good works good blesses you and takes us back beyond the stars we're going beyond the stars
[25:46.400 --> 25:49.840]  that's why they're not even into space exploration anymore because they figured that out their life
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.840]  space exploration how about dimensional exploration
[25:58.080 --> 26:01.680]  so we're going to go to break and then i'll play the national emergency speech in the Pelosi
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.720]  and her fascist uniform and they keep calling her the president though she's really the president
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.400]  i told you that was coming because they want to impeach trump using russia garbage that'll
[26:10.400 --> 26:19.760]  get pence out as well and then third in succession is madame subika who they're building up like she's
[26:19.760 --> 26:33.360]  a god now she's wearing space captain outfits i mean this is really a joke we can't beat this thing
[26:35.120 --> 26:43.840]  but i've gotten some calls the last 24 hours by household names and let me just tell you something
[26:43.840 --> 26:47.760]  well i'm not at liberty to tell you
[26:51.760 --> 26:52.560]  let's just say this
[26:54.960 --> 27:01.200]  trump's a good guy but trump isn't what brought us here he he wrote in on the on the wave
[27:01.920 --> 27:07.840]  and like i said bigger waves are coming and the EU's going down china's going down
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.480]  down the globalists are going down
[27:14.880 --> 27:23.600]  and it's a very exciting time to be alive but the next few years are going to be real rough
[27:24.720 --> 27:25.520]  but the globalist
[27:29.520 --> 27:31.040]  the globalists have given up
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.200]  the globalists have given up it doesn't mean they're not going to keep stealing and you know
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.320]  have tens of trillions and and try to start more wars manipulate but they
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.080]  know they're behind the eight ball now i'm gonna i'm gonna be more circumscript and more focused
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.840]  when we come back i just have been polaxed by the good the bad the ugly less really 48 hours
[27:54.640 --> 28:03.120]  and boy pulling my see that pulling my bicep is not good excuse me anyways that it's the old body
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.200]  it's something else isn't it amazing thing god gave us but when it breaks it's not fun by the way

[33:28.320 --> 33:35.360]  oh we heard that vicious white men screaming make america great again put a news around
[33:35.360 --> 33:40.320]  the empire star's neck and called him gay and didn't mean thanks to him and now
[33:41.600 --> 33:47.760]  two nigerian brothers could be charged in jesse sumlet attack and of course the police believe
[33:47.760 --> 33:53.760]  that he hired them they worked for him and they staged the event nigerians involved in scams come
[33:53.760 --> 34:02.720]  on that's only their national pastime you know i have had two associates four or five people i know
[34:02.720 --> 34:12.000]  and someone in my family actually two people in my family give money to the nigerians
[34:14.000 --> 34:21.200]  and you know my uh my my my my grandmother my mother's mother god bless her gave everything
[34:21.200 --> 34:26.400]  she had her entire life to charity even though she had an oil field in west texas she lives
[34:26.400 --> 34:34.880]  in south austin in a i think they when they moved from a high park nicer area austin because
[34:34.880 --> 34:39.520]  they wanted to give everything to the church i think it was something like a 30 thousand dollar
[34:39.520 --> 34:44.160]  house the house i think is worth like 80 thousand dollars now i mean that's in austin that's
[34:44.160 --> 34:49.440]  i mean that gives you an idea uh she basically moved to the barrio she liked her your neighbors
[34:49.440 --> 35:01.840]  are nice people um they all loved her but the point is is that i found out that she was giving
[35:01.840 --> 35:06.640]  most of her money to african charities and some of them were good some of them were bad but the
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.160]  time she got to be about 89 or so she was kind of out of it a little bit they were still calling her
[35:10.160 --> 35:20.240]  at the nursing home at the time she moved out of her house and then someone even closer to me started
[35:20.240 --> 35:29.040]  giving money to the nigerians last year and i threw a fit and i'm just really stuck in nigerians
[35:29.040 --> 35:38.960]  right now god oh my i'm so sick of people staging crap and running scams oh my god my grandmother
[35:38.960 --> 35:46.160]  her until she died i had no idea how much money she'd had over the years chubb i remember i started
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.720]  giving her money about 10 years ago if my grandfather died because i'd go over there and
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.840]  the food she was getting was like the cheapest low-grade whatever and she was clipping out
[35:55.840 --> 36:09.440]  coupons and it turns out she'd given millions and millions everything she had away over the years
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.160]  we stopped her from giving her buy to science my grandfather did but i just you take people that
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.040]  good i mean she was really good my grandfather was really that good they they were really
[36:21.040 --> 36:30.480]  really good people i'm like a devil compared to them and i remember my grandfather on sundays
[36:31.040 --> 36:38.320]  even when it was football season even when tomlandry stilk was coached else cowboys
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.360]  i used to go there a lot of sundays once i moved down here in high school and tomlandry would call
[36:43.360 --> 36:52.320]  they would pray on the phone together because he was roommates with him at ut and they were
[36:52.320 --> 36:57.840]  both the army air corps but the point is is that that's what built america was people like that
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.440]  they were so moral and so good it wasn't an act they were good people
[37:06.640 --> 37:12.160]  but see i'm not i'm not an evil person but i know how evil operates and i won't take it from
[37:12.160 --> 37:22.640]  these people and i'm sick of it because they were all good people but they were blind
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.320]  they projected onto other people their goodness when other people weren't good
[37:29.200 --> 37:35.680]  but my dad's mother she was different she didn't believe a damn thing anybody said and she was the
[37:35.680 --> 37:46.480]  smartest of all of them and i just i know there's a heaven because i'm gonna see those people again
[37:47.920 --> 37:53.120]  but i get scared really scared for my kids because let me tell you there are not a lot of people
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.920]  like that anymore you don't run into those people anymore and you know what 20 30 40 50 years ago
[37:59.920 --> 38:07.280]  you couldn't swing a stick in the dark and not hit somebody that was really good and let me tell
[38:07.280 --> 38:15.600]  you why they hate to show they know you're good they know you love god and i'm so sick of watching
[38:15.600 --> 38:32.240]  them up on tv exercising evil against us in front of everybody i mean do you understand
[38:33.680 --> 38:38.480]  that the proper response to the governor of virginia saying we keep babies alive and they
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.560]  take their organs you know what the proper response is now in this weird screwed up world
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.520]  i'm not calling for violence and i'm not going to go pump you know a couple rounds into his head
[38:50.480 --> 38:56.880]  and but but what about the baby see it's okay to say you're gonna kill babies after they're
[38:56.880 --> 39:02.480]  already born that's okay that's son of a piece of garbage can sit up there and say that to the
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.520]  whole world and exercise that evil in front of you and rub it in on purpose and get you ready
[39:07.520 --> 39:16.480]  for more evil that's what he's doing he's breaking you but if you talk about shoving a 357 magnum
[39:16.480 --> 39:22.320]  in his mouth and blowing the back of his head off which i'm not saying do that oh oh god oh god
[39:22.320 --> 39:29.680]  i was shows called for violence he's a full grown man he's talking about killing little babies
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.200]  like it's no big deal and putting in our face and it's okay because i love their babies
[39:35.200 --> 39:40.400]  their babies because we're all intimidated just like this oh don't talk about slitting the governor's
[39:40.400 --> 39:44.480]  throat don't talk about taking a freaking meat flavor to his fingers first chaining down and just
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.720]  going whack whack whack all the way up to the wrist and going and up to the arm how's that feel
[39:49.440 --> 39:55.040]  you think those babies like getting chopped up now i'm gonna slit your throat let's see how you like
[39:55.040 --> 40:04.400]  that you think about that you think about that long and hard where they're all smiling governor
[40:04.400 --> 40:11.040]  Cuomo signed the bill to do it because he thinks you're weak he thinks you're broke back he thinks
[40:11.040 --> 40:18.480]  he can pick on children but the last thing we want they had to stage this themselves there's
[40:18.480 --> 40:24.160]  somebody to roll in a ammonium nitrate bomb up in front of the your governor Cuomo's house we don't
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.880]  want that we want to sue him we want to take his money we want to destroy his name we want to confront
[40:30.880 --> 40:35.520]  him but more importantly we want to convict people's hearts and souls that that's evil
[40:35.520 --> 40:40.800]  and that's wrong and that we should stand against him we should pray to god to bring judgment against
[40:40.800 --> 40:46.480]  the governor of virginia and the governor of new york because now they've got other states
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.880]  i got it in my stack here i mean to get to that start of the show i didn't do it that's what's
[40:50.880 --> 40:55.680]  being raised for the show two other states have governors i can't remember which one's now i gotta
[40:55.680 --> 41:01.280]  dig it out two other states have all bills on the governor's desk to kill babies after they're born
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.680]  but see it's radical to even talk about
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.520]  the idea of those governors strung up a piano wire
[41:18.240 --> 41:23.520]  which i don't want to happen at a at a at a literal level i'm not calling for that the media will
[41:23.520 --> 41:30.240]  cut that out and say no no i'm saying how are we so conditioned to say it's not good to kill men
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.720]  saying we're going to kill babies after they're born who laugh about it and sign death execution
[41:34.720 --> 41:42.720]  warrants on children but if you just talk about them in that position that's bad because we are
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.400]  cowards and we are trained about out of these people now i want to be clear

[46:09.280 --> 46:12.840]  cures. I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.960]  great it is. I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill? What is the top?
[46:16.960 --> 46:20.920]  Tumor is the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory, and what's the best lab
[46:20.920 --> 46:23.880]  in the country? Okay, they're the highest rate. I'm like, you're only 50%
[46:23.880 --> 46:27.560]  curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still
[46:27.560 --> 46:32.440]  incredible, sir. I'm like, what's the hottest you could do a month later? 90, 95%
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.240]  no one's ever done that. I said, how much that cost for a bottle? That cost $10.
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.800]  No one's ever done that, sir. The average competitors, 3 to 5%,
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.240]  you're the top brands, 50%. I'm like, we're gonna have 95% curcuminoid. I mean,
[46:44.240 --> 46:47.680]  you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive. Our fish oil, I
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.160]  go out and I get the cleanest, the best. My children take it. You think I'm gonna
[46:52.160 --> 46:56.320]  give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul? You think I'm gonna
[46:56.320 --> 47:01.800]  screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers? Never in Foreswear.com.
[47:01.800 --> 47:20.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.000 --> 47:39.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.960]  So Governor Northam trying to sign a death warrant in Virginia to kill
[47:45.960 --> 47:53.000]  children after they're born. And the governor of New York's done it. Democrats
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.240]  are getting passed into Mexico, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia
[47:56.240 --> 48:02.880]  right now. They're on two governor's desk and pending in two other states. That's
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.280]  signing death warrants on children. And I don't wish any violence against these
[48:07.280 --> 48:10.880]  sacks of garbage. These turn themselves into victims. But if Tim McVeigh,
[48:10.880 --> 48:14.600]  supposedly, which it was a staged event, obviously, bombed the daycare center,
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.840]  some of them were newborn babies, he got charged with deaths of those babies. So
[48:18.840 --> 48:28.600]  those babies matter, but other babies don't. Now think about that. So if you
[48:28.600 --> 48:34.520]  have the post-birth abortion, now where a man stabbed his fiancee to death
[48:34.520 --> 48:39.240]  because he was pregnant, they're gonna keep the baby. And they said, New York,
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.960]  we're not gonna charge him for killing the baby because it's not a human. Even
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.320]  though the woman decides it is and wants to keep it. So that's where we are, is a
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.280]  culture. And I keep hammering on that because they're out in the open pushing
[48:51.280 --> 48:53.600]  all this.
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.120]  All right, let's shift gears. A lot of people are probably asking, wow, Alex,
[49:00.120 --> 49:03.640]  you predicted in October the national emergency when no one else did. And then
[49:03.640 --> 49:06.160]  you said a month ago, you thought it was about to be signed, but Trump did the
[49:06.160 --> 49:10.360]  wrong thing and let them kill $2 billion a week out of the economy and act like
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.040]  they're grandstandings that are just absolutely devastating and right up front
[49:13.040 --> 49:17.960]  and take control of the border. Well, why should we even play the clip? I mean,
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.520]  you get next year's news today here. Kind of like a time machine. I'm not bragging,
[49:23.520 --> 49:26.040]  that's why they want us off the air. Because these academics and these
[49:26.040 --> 49:29.360]  globalists, they don't really do much work. They kind of agree and go play golf
[49:29.360 --> 49:33.320]  and go take drugs and do whatever and then steal money and then worry about
[49:33.320 --> 49:36.760]  what trips they're gonna go on. But none of them are happy, though,
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.600]  statistically, because they're not doing anything real. See, I actually, I'm
[49:40.600 --> 49:44.680]  not bragging, I actually can't stop learning how all this works. So they
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.720]  tune into these shows and they're like, this dude knows stuff that CIA director
[49:48.720 --> 49:52.360]  knows and that's about it. How does he know it? I had the FBI call up and say,
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.600]  how did you predict the day of the event, Las Vegas? Well, that's how can I throw
[49:57.600 --> 50:03.520]  bullseye at 20 feet if I don't think about it twice in a row. Everybody knows
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.960]  that that's what that is. You can't control it, you guys got to go with it.
[50:07.960 --> 50:12.520]  And they're getting mad because the older I get, the more I know, I just go with
[50:12.520 --> 50:22.120]  my gut now. It's never scared me wrong. That's what wisdom is, is going with
[50:22.120 --> 50:25.960]  discernment, going with God. God's already navigating for you. And if you've got a
[50:25.960 --> 50:29.680]  relationship with God, it's gonna get stronger and stronger and stronger and
[50:29.680 --> 50:32.880]  stronger and stronger and stronger. I used to sit there at church and hear about
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.760]  Christians in the Bible saying, God, we don't want to die, but we're
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.280]  ready to come home and be with you forever. And we just can't wait to be
[50:40.280 --> 50:44.400]  with you. And I'm thinking, man, I don't want to die. I've got time to go see God.
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.800]  And I don't want to die now. I never commit suicide, but I just, I want to
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.080]  be with God. The reason I've got my personal experiences, this experience is
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.480]  what the enemy doesn't like. Now the other side of me is, you know, I want to stay
[50:58.480 --> 51:02.200]  here and take care of my kids. That means take care of you. We're all in this
[51:02.200 --> 51:07.600]  together. You've got to take care of me. We've got to stand up against totally
[51:07.600 --> 51:21.040]  sold out, soulless mummies, narcissistic mannequins like Nancy Pelosi who don't
[51:21.040 --> 51:36.080]  have any connection to God. No connection. She enjoys power, but does she look like
[51:36.080 --> 51:44.880]  she has any power? You know who's got power? It's a single mother who just worked
[51:44.880 --> 51:48.320]  12 hours, picked her kids up, made them dinner, went home, gets the flu, and she's
[51:48.320 --> 51:51.440]  up all night while that baby, all that five-year-olds, peeping their guts out,
[51:51.440 --> 51:59.160]  and she takes care of them. And then she goes back to work the next day instead of
[51:59.160 --> 52:04.520]  just ignoring her kid and slamming the door and driving off down the road. That's
[52:04.520 --> 52:11.400]  what power is, Pelosi. It's dedication and billions of man-hours of people
[52:11.400 --> 52:14.520]  committed to doing the right thing to bring us where we are. And then you
[52:14.520 --> 52:21.760]  people hijack it, and you sit up there like demonic parrots chirping, and you
[52:21.760 --> 52:25.600]  have no leadership, you have no power, doesn't matter how much power you get,
[52:25.600 --> 52:31.680]  or doesn't matter if you're wearing $5,000 dresses, you will always be a soulless
[52:31.680 --> 52:37.200]  sack of garbage. You will always be filth. You will always be what's wrong with
[52:37.200 --> 52:47.040]  the world. And we don't take pleasure in how low she is, but we need to
[52:47.040 --> 52:58.120]  recognize that she's lower than anything on this planet. And she is being
[52:58.120 --> 53:03.120]  replaced by even more soulless people like Cortez. So sure, I'll get to the
[53:03.120 --> 53:08.440]  emergency. Sure, why not? But notice what she's threatening is martial law. In
[53:08.440 --> 53:12.000]  fact, here's the name of this segment. Nancy Pelosi threatens martial law
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.640]  gun confiscation. I mean, that's what she's doing. That's what happens under
[53:16.640 --> 53:30.000]  real high-level martial law. Is that confiscating the firearms? And so she's
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.840]  saying, hey, watch out, you don't declare an emergency on our border, which is in
[53:33.840 --> 53:38.040]  the Constitution, which is the president's duty, not his right. You will do it,
[53:38.040 --> 53:45.080]  Trump! You will do it, and you get to it. We have to stop laying down. You think I
[53:45.080 --> 53:50.480]  want to puff up and get all wrapped up against these killers? I have to, folks.
[53:50.480 --> 53:56.800]  We need to stop kissing their asses. We have to stop being afraid of them and
[53:56.800 --> 54:03.240]  stop being blown away by their $5,000 dresses. Don't California my Texas is
[54:03.240 --> 54:06.720]  the shirt I'm wearing, or don't California my USA. We also want to
[54:06.720 --> 54:09.200]  don't California my Texas. We're gonna have a new income now. This is Don't
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.560]  Venezuela, my USA, InfoWarsTour.com. Pay for the broadcast, that's how you fund the
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.920]  broadcast and everything else, so please support us. But let's, I keep saying I'm
[54:18.920 --> 54:23.040]  gonna go to Stuart Roses and studio next hour. He's a constitutional lawyer. We
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.960]  always forget that, I'm just a veteran. You know, why is it cool? Because old
[54:27.960 --> 54:31.720]  sturdies have a glass eye. I remember about three or four years ago, you probably
[54:31.720 --> 54:34.560]  remember this. I said, hey man, nothing wrong with the fact you lost your eye in the
[54:34.560 --> 54:39.720]  army. It's kind of cool. Everybody instinctively likes a male with one
[54:39.720 --> 54:46.040]  eye. What does it mean? That person's been through something. It's like a sign.
[54:46.040 --> 54:50.360]  It's like scars you get. They become your friends. They're memories of what
[54:50.360 --> 54:55.760]  happened. The victories and defeats and wars.
[54:56.840 --> 55:02.680]  Do you respect somebody that gave something up like Odin to get the true
[55:02.680 --> 55:08.120]  vision and to give it one of the eyes? You have to give up focusing on the petty
[55:08.120 --> 55:14.200]  and the world in front of you before the big eye opens up. And then when you've
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.640]  got that one eye, it sees all. That's how powerful humans are. It's a symbol of the
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.560]  one eye. You go, oh my gosh, that's a Luminati. No, it's not. They steal all the
[55:23.560 --> 55:31.000]  symbols. The all-seeing eye is God's eye. The devil and Google trying to be all
[55:31.000 --> 55:42.680]  seeing, that's not God. You in communion with God, that's all-seeing. But see,
[55:42.680 --> 55:46.880]  Snake Plissken, as much as I love Kurt Russell, didn't really lose his eye. And
[55:46.880 --> 55:52.480]  that's the whole point. And it's not like Stuart Rhodes wears his eye patch now
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.520]  because it's in fashion. It's like men going bald. So what? Go bald. It's just
[55:57.520 --> 56:01.160]  your man. What are you worried about? You lost your eye in the army. Wear a damn
[56:01.160 --> 56:07.080]  patch. Let him know you did it. Don't cover it up with a nice blue marble.
[56:08.280 --> 56:15.040]  Those scars are sacrifices. Those scars are payment. And even if you did those
[56:15.040 --> 56:18.920]  things and were deceived and were even carrying out evil, God judges the heart
[56:18.920 --> 56:22.240]  like King David, did horrible things, and then later realized it was wrong,
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.480]  didn't do it for the wrong reason, and repented, and it was real. And God said,
[56:26.480 --> 56:36.640]  that's a man after my own heart right there. Those scars are our medals. Those
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.960]  emotional scars, those physical scars, those aren't how we're weak and we
[56:41.960 --> 56:46.400]  revel in being victims and how we revel in pissing on ourselves and all the bad
[56:46.400 --> 56:50.360]  things that happened, the bad things that happened to me. I'm not a masochist. I
[56:50.360 --> 56:56.720]  don't like pain, but let me tell you, in the journey, I'm way stronger than I ever
[56:56.720 --> 57:00.120]  would have been if I was sitting there playing video games all day on my
[57:00.120 --> 57:06.040]  ass instead of giving the living hell beat out of me by horrible racist gangs of
[57:06.040 --> 57:13.680]  blacks. And I thank them for that now, because I'm not going to be racist and
[57:13.680 --> 57:20.320]  fallen like they are, and they're a lot of great black people. I appreciate that.
[57:20.320 --> 57:26.600]  My head being slammed into concrete, I made it through it, and I became strong
[57:26.600 --> 57:30.800]  and later the people that slammed my head in the concrete got tracheotomies. And
[57:30.800 --> 57:36.520]  I'm sad for that too, but that's the full circle of earth. It's how God delivers
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.440]  the real balance. All right, I'm gonna stop. I'll play the clips. There's two
[57:39.440 --> 58:01.080]  roads coming in. Stay with us, newswars.com, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[59:51.280 --> 59:57.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:17.120]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. Please listen to me
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.040]  very carefully because this is beyond key. Everyone already knows it. I'm just
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.800]  saying things you already know. We have to say it aloud. Those of us that are
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:32.320]  confident tend to be quiet. We can't be quiet anymore. We have to take action. If
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.160]  you won't ever take action in the information war, you'll never take action
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.560]  in the physical war. We're trying to override and avert and circumnavigate
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.360]  physical war. But God, would the physical war be easier? Aren't we so much more
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.280]  built for that? It's like putting on old pair of boots you've worn so many times
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.880]  before, even though many of you genetically have never physically done
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:59.080]  it in this lifetime. But your guts have done it. Your genetics have done it. Your
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.440]  family history, your earth suit that's made up of all your ancestors, not the
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.240]  incarnation or reincarnation they talked about. Your soul's new, your soul's
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.840]  original, your soul's in this body. But the body is your family. How cool is God?
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:19.360]  Who could come up with that? So awesome, man. Our body suit is all of our
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.640]  ancestors and their memories, that's like heads up display, way cooler than the
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:35.080]  internet, man. I'm sorry, let me just say this now. This is the key. The governor
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.480]  of Virginia says we're gonna legalize killing babies after they're born
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.640]  because he's running major medical units that's come out and been confirmed
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.920]  that are harvesting organs. They need to keep them alive because then they can
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.800]  keep them alive a week or so and then get back bigger prices in the bidding
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.200]  system that they've got. They've got private bidding systems for those organs.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.800]  I said a hundred thousand dollars, you know, you just got them right there, you
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:03.600]  get a lot more than that. And it's the same thing with Pelosi. She comes out and
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:10.720]  says look out, you declare an emergency for the border that's in the
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.920]  Constitution, that's just default the president does, that's his job.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.480]  It's not like all these other fake emergencies, other presidents have had,
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.560]  most of them have been unconstitutional. This was totally cut and dry, bona fide.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.680]  So, like Trump went with it, it's just cut and dry. You'll have lower courts throw
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:29.120]  it out, the Supreme Court will affirm it. A five-year-old could affirm it.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.400]  But see, she's not really threatening a civil emergency, she's threatening
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:44.000]  martial law and gun confiscation. Let that sink in. Nancy Pelosi is threatening
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.280]  martial law. Not her own declaration of emergency, what Democrat gets in,
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.560]  meaning her or later they remove Trump with the whole Russiagate thing.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.720]  She's third in succession. See, it's some people like oh, she threatens her own
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.640]  emergency. No, she's threatening martial law. See, the governor is just saying
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.760]  we're going to kill babies after they're born.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.160]  He's saying we're going to take their organs because that's what we do, is we
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.240]  give you the goal, what they're really doing, because they never
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.760]  say what it really is. It's always oh, we'll have our own emergency on guns.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.560]  Well, what does that mean? You mean confiscating them, lady, and a whole
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.040]  civil war, because that would start it. And you're just crazy enough to do it.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.240]  And so that's how we're two minutes to midnight right now.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:31.040]  This woman is so disconnected from reality, she takes our restraint as weakness,
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.040]  which, let me explain something to you. Our restraint
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.480]  is because we are going to wrap around you like a giant python.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.800]  And we're going to make sure that when we take your system down, which we're
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.560]  doing all over the world, that we are assured of it.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.720]  And then these snakes always think if they attack
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.400]  the leading edge of the knife, that we'll back down like we're them.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.360]  We've already been thrown like a hatchet. It's already, the arrow's been loosed.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.800]  The trajectory's already confirmed. I've already run you through, Pelosi.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.680]  Our audience is already, we already exited. I meant to splatter up against the wall behind
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.480]  you and fall down on the ground. I'm a torpedo. I'm a weapon.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.240]  There isn't just evil in the world, woman. There's good. Learn what it's like.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.040]  Here she is when we go to break. Here it is. She's threatening martial law.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.080]  The Republicans have some unease about it, no matter what they say,
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.920]  because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:42.080]  as an emergency, an illusion that he wants to convey, just think of what a president
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.760]  with different values can present to the American people.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.320]  You want to talk about a national emergency? Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary

[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:17.200]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:37.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:53.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump has declared a national emergency,
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.640]  and unlike the other national emergencies that were done by globalist presidents
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.760]  to give trillions of dollars of foreign banks and things like Bush did,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.520]  W did, this is a national emergency in the Constitution, where the border's being overrun
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.880]  by giant caravans and diseases pouring over, and the Democrats trying to break the back of our very
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:17.520]  existence under a UN plan that's admitted chain migration, migration replacement, world government,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.320]  all of it. And now Pelosi comes out in a chilling statement we're going to play here,
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.720]  and says that, well, look out, another president with other values could do it on the Second
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.320]  Amendment, which is the New York Times headline, time to repeal the Second Amendment,
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:39.280]  but she means by executive operation. Pelosi warns GOP, next president could declare national
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:47.840]  emergency on guns and confiscate them. That's where we are in 2019, even though the Washington
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.760]  Post has to admit, I couldn't believe they told the truth yesterday on Valentine's Day,
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:59.520]  most Americans incorrectly think gun murder rates have gotten worse, not better. Think about that.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.400]  The peak of crime was 1990.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:12.160]  Let me tell you, I was living in Dallas then, and it was just like six, seven murders a day,
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.000]  stabbings, robbings, nice neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, it was crazy.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.000]  But here's Nancy Pelosi literally introducing that martial law here at us.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.640]  Have some unease about it, no matter what they say, because the president can declare an
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:35.920]  emergency on something that he has created as an emergency, an illusion that he wants to convey.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.120]  Just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.680]  You want to talk about a national emergency? Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.560]  of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:09:00.000]  emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.320]  So, you just heard Nancy Pelosi,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:29.920]  crowd balloon, beta test, market test, preview, showcase, display, roll out, premiere,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:37.760]  martial law and gun confiscation. You just heard it. Oh, we don't want your guns. Just every city
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:44.560]  we control, we take your guns. Oh, we don't want martial law. Lady, if Congress won't act,
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.480]  and our borders being overrun by 10, 15,000 people a day, if they admit the highest numbers ever,
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.240]  I mean, even Bortrow says it, it was highest ever. They go, no, it's not, you're a liar,
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:59.920]  fact check. Snoop says, well, if a porn star and a dude and a fat lady and a cat said it,
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.520]  it's not true. We don't listen to the ICE or the border patrol and the actual numbers,
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.640]  where they're on the line and they do something wrong, they get sued or arrested,
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.960]  very professional. No, it's not. We don't listen to them. We listen to Snoop's.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:19.360]  Snoop says there's no caravan. Remember, Cuomo and CNN, there's no caravan. Acosta,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:26.640]  there's no caravan. There's no caravan. As Beto says, we got 2000 a day coming across,
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:33.120]  we're getting it done. Do you like my Vermont accent? And again, I love Vermont. It's beautiful.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.680]  I was in Vermont like 25 years ago in fall. It was so beautiful. I thought I was in the
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:45.200]  Hobbit Shire. I'm not against Vermonters. But do I go to Vermont and talk like this to you? No,
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:55.920]  I don't do it. It sounds like some type of character from Warner Brothers cartoons. Oh, God, help me.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:11.680]  You just heard Nancy Pelosi. You just heard her say, we'll declare martial law and take your guns.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:22.080]  When, since the 1976 change, which they always point to, there's been 37 declarations of emergency
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:32.240]  every year and a half or so on all sorts of stuff, usually about swindling us and selling us out and
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.880]  giving our money to foreign countries. Trump comes in and finally declares the national
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:44.560]  emergency when the damn border is collapsing. And she acts like that's taking your guns.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.560]  Trump isn't signing some order, take them the First Amendment or the Second Amendment or the
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.320]  Tenth Amendment or the Ninth Amendment or the Seventh Amendment or the Fourth. No.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.480]  He's signed, he's signing a declaration of emergency because he's got control of the Pentagon
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.760]  money and so much more. And Obama gave trillions of dollars of foreign banks under an emergency.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:12.640]  Trump's just trying to get four or five billion dollars because they're trying to break our border.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.480]  And they turn that into, you better watch out.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:30.880]  I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming. Santa Claus, Santa Claus is coming to town.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:37.440]  He'll put you in a FEMA camp. He'll take your guns away. He'll teach your three-year-old to
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:43.920]  get blowjobs. And that's just today. It's the Satanic New World Order. We'll abort your baby
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.560]  after they're born. We'll teach your kids to take ketamine and dance at gay bars when they're 11.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:59.840]  I guess Satan Claus is coming to town. And Pelosi's up there in her black outfit.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.080]  Just like, listen, you want to declare emergencies and even tell the...
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.840]  Because usually when a president declares an emergency, I was watching it once live on
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:16.880]  Seastown where it happened. They march into the house and they say, we have a message here
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.920]  as a herald of the president of the United States declaring an emergency to the Congress.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.920]  And they list the Congress. And the Congress says, we are ready to receive the emergency.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.360]  Then they have a vote, although they're going to oppose the emergency. And it's never on the news.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:39.120]  But now, when the country's really under attack and it's all happening, we're not allowed to discuss
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.400]  it. We're not allowed to know about it in the past. But now we're supposed to all be told about it
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.480]  and told how it's martial law and how Pelosi could take your boom-boots, your bang-bangs.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.000]  That's how far we've gone.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.880]  But I do feel good energetically because we're on the march, the empires will run.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.440]  Let's go ahead and play part of Trump and we'll play more in the next segment.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.120]  And Stuart Rhodes is going to join us in studio.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:12.800]  Today, I'm announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.240]  problem that we have right here at home. We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away, wars that we
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.640]  should have never been in, in many cases. But we don't control our own border.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.360]  So we're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.040]  And we're going to do it one way or the other. We have to do it.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.960]  Not because it was a campaign promise, which it is. It was one of many, by the way, not my only one.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.680]  We're rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before. You look at other
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.600]  economies, they're doing terribly and we're doing phenomenally. The market is up tremendously today.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.480]  Not that there's anything but, you know, because I'll go back in and they'll say,
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.040]  oh, the market just went down. But the market is getting close to the new.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.240]  They pause on that. When he acts like the president and America's open for business and he acts,
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.760]  it goes straight up. When it looks like the chai comms are back in control, it goes straight down.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.960]  People want action, Trump. They want it. They want it. And this is beautiful.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.120]  So if Pelosi thinks she's going to take our guns, we should give Nancy Pelosi a helicopter ride.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.680]  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't, I don't mean like Pinochet did
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:31.200]  in Chile. I mean to Venezuela. Take her and Alexandria, Cortez and all these other
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:37.040]  dumbasses who want to go along with the takedown of the country and just, just fly them all down there
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.680]  with the other dumb ass commies. We're going to come back with the rest of this straight ahead,

[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.360]  we're not really covering the emergency a lot because we told you it was coming, right? Sure.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.800]  We told you first, it's on record.

[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.760]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:20.320]  is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.120]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.440]  and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.200]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:41.040]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.920]  easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though,
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.160]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack at the first time you take it
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.760]  because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive. Turbo Force

[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.840]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.440]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.520]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.000]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.760]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible. Now,
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.560]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.000]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.480]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:52.240]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:57.600]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:03.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:40.320]  So President Trump
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.840]  has declared a national emergency and the media is not going to act like it's totally illegal,
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:51.920]  it's evil, it's martial law. But it's one of the few national emergencies a president can actually do.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:57.280]  The border's collapsing, the UN's running a migrant invasion to overwhelm the courts,
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:04.560]  disease is pouring in, that's as standard as it gets other than like a, let's say a meteorite,
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:17.200]  the size of a blue whale comes in and hits, say, in Kansas. It's going to be the equivalent
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:24.720]  of a 50 megaton hydrogen bomb. You're going to have most people dead in the state,
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.560]  you're going to have dust in the air, you're going to have fires raging all over the cut,
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:32.400]  all over the middle of the country. Let's say it's a, I mean, you're out a mile long
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.000]  and maybe a half mile wide. Oh, well now you're talking about
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.800]  couple years of freezing temperatures, dust in the air, mostly US destroyed.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:52.960]  I mean, you know that a meteorite, say a nickel meteorite or an iron ore meteorite
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.720]  or even a stony, if it's the size of a school bus, made the crater in Arizona
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:11.280]  and it would take a lot of hydrogen bombs to do that. So that's why we have emergencies,
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.640]  depressions, wars, collapsing borders, meteorites, nuclear war.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.480]  And the president
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.280]  has now announced it. So what's the headline for this, this, this segment? We're live right now,
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:33.440]  we'll post it to m4s.com. Man who predicted Trump declares emergency, responds to emergency,
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.880]  I mean, I don't know what you say, but let's talk about when we come back to Stuart Rhodes,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.840]  he's a little late in traffic. What he thinks is coming next, he's a smart guy.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.000]  Stuart's such a stickler, you know, he's a Yale educated lawyer, used to work for Ron Paul,
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.840]  but he goes, I haven't been practicing law the last few years. Well, he helped us win a case
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.120]  with Rob Do in the police in Cleveland. He's calling up the one, well, I'm not currently
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.120]  practicing law, so don't send a constitutional lawyer. Dude, you got a law degree, you practice law,
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.160]  he's such a good guy though, see that's the stickling, compared to like leftists that just lie
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.640]  about everything. He's a constitutional lawyer, he's not currently practicing, that's all, but
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:16.240]  that's a patriot versus leftists that just constantly lie. A patriot talks themselves down
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:23.360]  instead of up, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but we have to stop worrying about if our
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:30.640]  boots are shined in this fight. We're in a war, period, and we're taking action. Let's go back
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:35.760]  to the president, here he is about an hour ago, declaring the national emergency. Down. But the
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:42.960]  market is getting close to the new highs that we created. We have all the records, we have every
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.680]  record, but we're getting close to that point again, where we'll create new records. So our
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:53.680]  country is doing very well economically, and we've done a lot, but one of the things they
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.440]  said I have to do, and I want to do it. He knows they're trying, let's start all over,
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.200]  they're trying to kill the economy, and ensure it's fiat and it's a bubble, but he's actually
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.600]  trying to get some jobs and factories back because we don't have that. If we're going to have a war,
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:10.000]  he's got to get the factories back. And believe me, the globalists want wars, we don't want wars.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.920]  He's trying to pull troops out, we don't need them to get the money to actually build high-tech
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:20.800]  weapons to then be a deterrent from a war. Peace through strength. Very pragmatic. Let's continue.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:28.720]  No, the market just went down. But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.400]  We have all the records, we have every record, but we're getting
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.520]  close to that point again, where we'll create new records. So our country is doing very well
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.680]  economically, and we've done a lot. But one of the things I said I have to do, and I want to do,
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.200]  is border security. Because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country,
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:56.560]  much of it coming from the southern border. When you look and when you listen to politicians,
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.440]  in particular certain Democrats, they say it all comes through the
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:08.400]  port of entry. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's just a lie. It's all a lie. They say walls don't work.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.960]  Walls work a hundred percent. I'm about to hit pause.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:21.520]  You know they've got a bunch of synthetic heroin that's a hundred times stronger.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.360]  It's got different names out of China. China officially mails that in in mass, and it gets
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.320]  shipped in, and it's a war. They execute you in China if you even have that stuff.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.560]  Because they went through, they were taken down when, when opium got imported
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.040]  through the fake drug war and all the rest of it in the Boxer Rebellion. But that's that's history
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:52.000]  hundreds of years ago. They're hitting us with heroin, synthetic heroin, 100 times stronger.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.200]  Let's continue. Walls work a hundred percent. Whether it's El Paso, I really
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.920]  was smiling because the other night I was in El Paso, we had a tremendous crowd
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.880]  and a tremendous crowd. And I asked the people, many of whom were from El Paso, but they came
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:23.280]  from all over Texas. And I asked them, I said, let me ask you the, as a crowd, when the wall went
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:29.840]  up, was it better? You, you were there, some of you. It was not only better, it was like
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:36.720]  a hundred percent better. You know what they did. But that's only one example. There are so many
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:44.080]  examples. In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:49.120]  Oh yeah, let's stop right there. The media says Trump made it up that, that, that, that El Paso
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.920]  used to be really dangerous. El Paso is under martial law. It's been under martial law since
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:01.440]  Pennsylvania. And the police, they're dealing with the cartels over the years. If you kill somebody,
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:08.400]  they just kill you and bury you. And I'm not saying that's a good thing. But the idea that it's safe
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.880]  will be, yeah, because it's under unofficial martial law. Right over the border, it's not
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:18.480]  2,000 murders. Trump, they found tens of thousands of graves. Back in Texas Monthly was a real
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.040]  magazine. I was a kid reading about all the mass graves across the border in El Paso and
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.280]  the severed heads. I mean, nobody, everybody knows about Mexico. But the idea that the Snopes Fat
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:33.760]  Checkers say that it's the safest city in the country. Yeah, El Paso is pretty safe because
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:41.120]  the police will kill you like that. And the U.S. armies and Joint Task Force Six is there.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.000]  They have thousands of army hit men in the city. And anyone that's had family in the military knows
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  that. And the cartels are crazy. They'll still keep trying to kill people and kidnap. And when
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.800]  they do, the U.S. military kills them. Let's continue. The other side of the wall. And they
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:07.040]  had 23 murders. It's a lot of murders. But it's not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:14.960]  side of the wall in Mexico. So everyone knows that walls work. And there are better examples
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.720]  than El Paso, frankly. You just take a look almost everywhere. Take a look at Israel. They're
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:27.920]  building another wall. Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me. 99.9 percent. That's
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.800]  what it would be with us, too. The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:39.920]  wall. They go around the wall and in. Okay? That's what it is. Very simple. And Saudi Arabia doesn't
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:48.880]  take one glorious Palestinian or glorious Somali lecturing us how much we suck. But they're battling
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.520]  to get in the country. All right. Stuart Rose is about to get here. He's coming to the studio.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:29:10.960]  We're going to play more Trump's speech. National emergency.

[01:32:52.800 --> 01:33:03.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:25.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:42.160]  You can look to the left and look to the right, but you won't live in danger tonight.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:51.440]  When the enemy comes, he will never be heard, and hold your mind and not say a word.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:34:04.400]  You can look to the left and look to the right, but you won't live in danger tonight.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:18.400]  You can look to the left and look to the right, but you won't live in danger tonight.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.120]  You already know half the black people in this country never get out of their mother's womb,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.000]  their heads are rolling.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.360]  Whatever it thinks about that, you think we're safe when children aren't safe,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.040]  and I get calls from media like, you're against the KKK, you're against supporting black babies,
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:42.880]  but you talk about racist black gangs attacking people. Yeah, I'm against racist black people,
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:49.680]  I'm against racist white people. It's not like I'm on some team, I'm on team humanity.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.840]  We're going to go back to Trump, this trip rose a little bit late in traffic,
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.640]  we'll be here in the next segment.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.320]  Thunder Wealth Keepers, constitutional lawyer, patriot.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.880]  We're going to be talking to him about this national emergency. He'd been pushing forward
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.400]  hard, so have I. We're going to open the phones up next hour as well on this Thursday,
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:14.240]  Friday edition, my goodness, Thursday, Friday, February 15, 2019. Time is certainly flying.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.680]  But before I go back to Trump, I planned every segment today to wear a different T-shirt,
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.960]  and I just get too focused on the news and don't do it. But if you're a TV viewer,
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:32.240]  you can see it, it's Don't California My USA, and it's got infowars.com on the right hand
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.520]  shoulder with the American flag. And again, a lot of TV viewers are like,
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.080]  why are you always telling us what we're seeing? Our main audience is still radio,
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:51.360]  so I have to describe it. Don't California My USA, infowars.com, and the American flag.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:58.560]  And does this one have something on the back? Oh, I guess it's got the infowars symbol as well.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.720]  They're on the left shoulder. The right shoulder gives the American flag.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.320]  And we've got a bunch of other just amazing shirts. And when you purchase them,
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.920]  you find the operation. There's no reviews of this shirt because it just came in. It's brand new.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.960]  And without you funding us, we will not be here. And again, even if you're not a big T-shirt person,
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.440]  we have some for women as well. Gold foil, Moe and Lobby shirts that women love. We have some more
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.760]  shirts for women. Women have really been requesting it. But these shirts are all unisex,
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:31.440]  which will make the leftist happy. But we have some for the, you know, more of the female cut.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.760]  They're quite nice. And my wife likes to wear them around. And it's kind of choose your own
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.560]  adventure. And I've tried to explain this before. You were a big, in your face,
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.520]  red infowars shirt. In fact, click on that one right there, the red infowars.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.880]  That's about as obnoxious as you're going to get. And you're going to meet a lot of friends and a
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:58.000]  lot of cool people. Look at that. It's got a bunch of reviews, five stars, 100% review, American
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.600]  flag and fours.com and fours.com on the front things on the back to look at the back. That shirt
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:09.360]  is the best seller. And that's for people that really want to, you know, go out and exercise
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:16.480]  the First Amendment. But if you wear just an IW hat, only patriots know what that is.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:20.880]  And then you're just getting the love, not the hate. Or if you wear a mall on lobby,
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.840]  you don't think leftist can speak Latin or know that means come and take it.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.240]  No, I mean, they, they, all they do is talk about how smart they are and listen to the NPR
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.240]  and a little snake voices all day. We've got over a hundred t-shirts. Some are steadfast.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:40.560]  One design I made 20 years ago, 22 years ago now. Mass murderers agree, gun control works.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:45.520]  I sat there on Photoshop, but Hitler, Stalin and Mao buy each other on the back. It says,
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.120]  politicians love disarmed peasants, which I got from a bumper sticker.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.080]  Then we've got all these great designer shirts for George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on them.
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:59.760]  So we've got high end shirts that are great. You know, it'd be 50 bucks at the mall. They're 25
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:07.200]  bucks a year. We've got other shirts. They're as low as 9.95. It's all there. It's all there.
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:17.600]  Trump 2020. Won't tread on me. Re-elect 45. Bill Clinton's a rapist. Hey, show him the
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.600]  George Washington. That's really good, soft, high quality fabric. That's one of my favorite shirts I
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:30.320]  wear is the George Washington. And it's, it's him from his before friction in war when he was a
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:39.600]  a colonial scout expanding the frontiers. And as a scientist and as an engineer, he was out there
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.400]  surveying. And so that's, that's kind of the George Washington without the Tomahawk and a
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:51.360]  musket in his hand. A great shirt. And like I said, the fabric's so good and so high quality.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.800]  I think the shirt costs like seven, eight bucks. And so for 1995, it is a great deal. The point is,
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.640]  you don't buy the products. We don't spread the word. We lose. You get them. We win. But I mean,
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:09.600]  it's an adventure. Don't California at my USA. Who would want to wear a shirt like that? Or Alexandria
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:16.800]  Cortez as the dog that she is. I mean, as it's insulting our canine friends. But, you know,
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.960]  she said, we'll have you subpoenaed or arrested Donald Trump Jr. because you said,
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:25.120]  socialists eat their dogs, capitalist walked them. So I said, okay, well, we'll just put that shirt
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.560]  on. And I predicted to be a best seller. It is. And this, I've done two runs. This is the last run.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.440]  We're going to come out with a new variant of a Cortez shirt. But this limited edition is about
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.720]  to go the way of the goonie bird, which means extinct. So if you want it, info or store.com or
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:47.600]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And please don't forget, if you're listening
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.000]  on local AM and FM stations or watching on TV, it is vital you tell people about it
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.760]  and that you text message folks and that you email. That's where the center still can't block you.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.400]  And I'm not complaining like, please do this, please do that. It's the animating joyful joy of war,
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.320]  joy of fighting back with the truth, standing up for the unborn, standing up for the Second
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.840]  Amendment, standing up for sovereignty and realizing they want to bully us. They want to
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.640]  intimidate us. They want to shut us up. And we're just not going to do it.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.920]  Two big specials in this Sunday because we're low on brain force plus our
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.400]  neutropic. It's our best selling overall. It's not our most profitable, but it is the best
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:28.400]  selling. We sell more bottles than anything else of a brain force, 50% off partnered for 33%
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:36.640]  off together with turbo force. Brain force plus is a neutropic and is amazing focus, clarity.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:44.720]  But then turbo force is everything and it's long, delivered, healthy, natural energy with
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.800]  the vitamins, with the minerals, with the amino acids, other co-factors that deliver it through the
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:56.160]  blood brain barrier and into the body. So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, but just viewer
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.120]  discretion advised, you need to take probably a half packet the first time you take it because I set
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:06.560]  out to make the strongest, healthy beyond energy drink, beyond pre-workout and that's turbo force.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:14.400]  So you get it by itself, 33% off, 33% off with turbo force, with brain force plus 50% off
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:21.760]  and now it's very simple. The average high-end energy bar cost them over a dollar to produce.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:28.000]  They sell them in Whole Foods for five or six or seven dollars. We went to top manufacturers,
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.200]  top developers and said we want the very best, high quality, organic, best tasting. We did a
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.120]  bunch of beta testing different companies with the crew and others even did some focus groups.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:47.760]  We came up with protein bar from infowarslife and it's in the vanilla coconut, which is my favorite
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.960]  and also like the chocolate peanut butter, but I mean I'm not a big peanut butter guy, I don't
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:55.360]  hate peanut butter, it's just not my thing. They're both excellent people go my god, I've never had a
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.960]  protein bar that's good, I'm like I know. We went out and said what's the top rated bars in the country
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.400]  and how do we top them and then cut the price? So they come in 12 packs, there's no reviews yet,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.440]  but believe me the reviews are really amazing. If you'll just buy your coffee and buy your protein
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.720]  bars and buy your toothpaste from us, it's all high quality, it's all high-end, it's all really good
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.200]  and it stands the way of the global. So I'm done plugging for the sour, but infowarsore.com,
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.320]  infowarslife.com or AAA 2533139 and I want to again thank the listeners because I know they're
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.240]  trying to shut us down, trying to block us everywhere, but you, it's like literally I'm
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:38.000]  Houdini in a tank chained up, only you can screw the top off of the thing and get me out of here and
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.240]  by getting me out you get yourself out because Lord knows we beat Hillary, Lord knows we relaunched
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:48.720]  1776 World Live, Lord knows you did it and now they want my head in the basket. Well they're not
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.800]  gonna get it without a big old fat juicy fight. We've already had some big victories, but I think
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:43:06.400]  we've got some even bigger ones coming. Keep me in the game.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:12.720]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:18.720]  is energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.600]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.800]  hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research the most
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:35.520]  powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.800]  like it, you must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use,
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.840]  packets to mix in with fruges or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though, it's very very strong,
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:50.400]  it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it because turbo force
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.840]  is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive. Turbo force and enforce life.com.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.520]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:06.000]  my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my children.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.120]  Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned,
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.240]  but not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your word's going forever,
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:18.560]  but now they're even better getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier to
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:24.800]  burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:30.080]  my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize I've done right and
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.400]  the long as the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:39.600]  yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.200]  then takes place, the transcend space and time. When you commit the word of mouth or to pray for us
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:50.640]  or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:56.080]  commit to support Info Wars however you can and realize your provision to Info Wars is your own
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:06.160]  provision. Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights. It's about who wants it,
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.680]  who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage. We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:16.400]  We stopped her. We got a national stand. Nationalists are getting elected all over the
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.840]  world right now. We are winning, but those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.920]  spear are under unprecedented attack. So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.920]  is a war of attrition. This is about who wants it most and you know the persecution, the censorship,
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.480]  the sponsors, they've taken everything. I am in your hands. You are in my hands. I need financial
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:43.520]  support and I got products you and your family need. It's that simple. Thousands of great products,

[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.840]  great products because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands and your support is beyond critical.
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.560]  Thank you. Our grandparents, the great grandparents know that they can't food during the fall so
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:07.600]  they have it during the winter. And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:13.920]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply on the top, most respected
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:20.160]  companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:25.120]  all their other distributors aren't able to do. But I want to be a market leader and I want you
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.000]  to have storeable food so it's a total win-win. We have those incredible sell prices back
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.280]  at InfoWarsHore.com. On InfoWars Select, storeable foods, they've got special diet foods, they've
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.320]  got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies, they've got so many great
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:44.720]  products there, maybe you got a three-year supply. If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:50.400]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient. You're buying war bonds, bringing great products and together
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.920]  with God's help, we are unstoppable. InfoWarsHore.com and InfoWars Select, high-quality storeable foods,
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.720]  powered by my patriot supply.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:26.720]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:44.320]  It's just now pulling up to be in the next segment. I think it's here right now.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.080]  And I want to open the phones up next hour. On any issue you want to cover, but really I think the
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:57.440]  main thing I guess we're going to have is the constitutional emergency, the national emergency,
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.800]  what's happening on the border, the president's absolutely authorized and just the, everyone
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:10.320]  overuses the term bombshell. But it's bombshell when the governor of Virginia says we're going to kill
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  babies after the war and the different states are signing the laws we speak. New York's already done it.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.840]  And it's bombshell to use that term from World War I.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.480]  Explosive. The Pelosi said, hey, watch out, Democrats might declare an emergency and take the guns.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:36.000]  She said that in some Black Darth Vader outfit today. I already played it. We're playing against
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.920]  stewards here. And see, we kind of just get punch-shrunked to this. Like, what? Kill babies
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:47.280]  after they're born now? And, you know, seven, eight, nine, 10-year-old kids, three-year-old
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:55.920]  kids are putting money in G-strings of fat dudes at gay bars. And vice versa. And it's just like,
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.160]  it's like, you're like, yeah, that Jones is crazy, Howard Stern said. He says little kids are gay bars
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.640]  dancing for men. And they all laugh about it. And they don't tell you, no, that's actually
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:16.640]  happening. I'm not the crazy ones. Like, yeah, Jones is crazy. He says that the British government
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.120]  worked with Jimmy Savelle and he raped hundreds of dead children and also killed children, but
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:26.800]  they'd have sex with the kids at parties at the hospital. And then people go, look it up,
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:33.280]  they go, my God, that's true. Yeah. See, I'm not the weirdo. I'm not taking the DMT and the Iowaska
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.800]  in San Francisco and at military bases, and I'm not talking to aliens. I've never done that.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.560]  They think they are. And these aliens tell them, hey, go murder children and we'll give you more
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:55.120]  power. Now, I think of that as a demon, don't you? But I mean, I'm not the one in contact with Mescalito.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.880]  I'm not the one doing this. I'm reporting what's going on. I know it's insane.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.400]  It's like Senator Menendez says,
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:14.080]  people that are here illegally that drunk drive, they're not, they're not criminals.
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:20.160]  They're like, so drunk driving isn't a criminal act now? And being here illegally?
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:23.600]  You didn't know? No, it's not. We played the clip. You're like, well, that doesn't make sense.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:29.200]  That's just crediting. No, they're overriding logic. They're overriding judgment. They're
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.200]  breaking our will. They're doing it on purpose because they're taking over. They're engaged in
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:43.760]  criminal activity. It doesn't make any sense. Yeah, today, Trump highlighted angel moms
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:49.440]  as Gemma Costa claims border crisis manufactured and there is no caravan. He did it again.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.920]  So let's go back to the president declaring the national emergency that we told you about back
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:51:01.440]  in October next year's news today. Here it is. Go around the wall and in. Okay, that's what it is.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:06.880]  Very simple. And a big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads, don't go through
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.080]  ports of entry. They can't go through ports of entry. You can't take big loads because you have
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:17.440]  people. We have some very capable people. The border patrol law enforcement looking.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:24.000]  You can't take human traffic, women and girls. You can't take them through ports of entry. You
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.160]  can't have them tied up in the back seat of a car or truck. They open the door. Back it up 10
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:37.120]  seconds. Thanks. Remember just last week seems like 100 years ago. Was it last week or was it
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:47.040]  Monday? The state of the union? Was it Tuesday? What day was the union? It already seems like 100
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:52.880]  years ago. It's a couple of days ago. You've got Cortez and you've got Harris. You've got Pelosi
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:58.560]  not standing up when he says we busted 3000 women that have been kidnapped and hundreds of kids.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:04.400]  We freed them and they wouldn't stand up. They looked all pissed because these people want to kill
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:08.480]  babies for their organs. They're getting money from the cartels. Even mainstream news is now
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.760]  reporting the Democrats are getting money from the Mexican mafia and MS-13. They have no bottom.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:25.680]  They will destroy this country. Even Amos International reports 80% of women coming from
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.920]  Central America through Mexico get raped. We're always hearing about how bad American culture is
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:34.080]  and I'm not even attacking Mexico. It has good Christian people there but there's a certain
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:40.640]  percentage of the public that thinks raping women is normal. So if the Muslims are doing it they're
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:44.480]  good. If the Mexicans are doing it they're good. If we're not raping statistically very much in
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:52.000]  the U.S. we're all rapists. In fact Gillette says and feminists say if you say hey ma'am you're very
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.360]  attractive are you some of the last person who are you talking to a woman is rape.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:06.160]  But if you rape them or cut their genitals off as long as you go and we're a hood over
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:09.840]  your head everything's okay. You're a suicide bomber then it's cool. It's like oh god you're
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:16.320]  blowing your kids up. My god you're a Palestinian. You blow your kids up with TNT wrapped around them.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:22.480]  Man oh my oh you're such a good person. Teach me how I can be an Islam please right now. Can I
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:29.040]  learn about suicide bombing right now. Sorry let's go back to the president. Girls you can't take them
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.200]  through ports of entry. You can't have them tied up in the back seat of a car or a truck
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.200]  or a van. They open the door. They look they can't see three women with tape in their mouth or three
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:47.360]  women whose hands are tied. They go through areas where you have no wall. Everybody knows that Nancy
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:54.560]  knows it. Chuck knows it. They all know it. It's all a big lie. It's a big con game. You don't have
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:54:05.680]  to be very smart to know. You put up a barrier. The people come in and that's it. They can't do
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:10.800]  anything unless they walk left or right and they find an area where there's no barrier and they come
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:17.920]  into the United States. Welcome. We've detained more people. Our border agents are doing such
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:28.400]  incredible work. Our military has been incredible. We put up barbed wire on top of certain old
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.520]  walls that were there. We fixed the wall and we loaded up with barbed wire. It's very successful
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.120]  but our military has been fantastic. I don't want to thank them.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:43.520]  It is very necessary. We've broken up two caravans that are on their way. They just
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.200]  are breaking. They're in the process of breaking up. We have another one that we
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:52.160]  haven't been able to break up yet. We've been actually working with Mexico much better than
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:57.840]  ever before. I want to thank the president. I want to thank Mexico. They have their own problems.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.720]  They have the largest number of murders that they've ever had in their history. Almost 40,000
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:09.280]  murders. 40,000. 200,000. They got to straighten that out and I think they will. But I just want
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:14.720]  to thank the president because he's been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:22.000]  coming up. We had one that was up to over 15,000 people. It's largely broken up. Others have gotten
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.200]  through and in Tijuana you have a lot of people staying there. If we didn't have the wall up and
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:32.080]  if we didn't have the wall secured and strengthened they would have walked right through. They'd be
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:39.200]  welcomed to the United States. One of the things we'd save tremendous, just a tremendous amount on
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.160]  would be sending the military. If we had a wall we don't need the military because we'd have a wall.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:54.080]  So I'm going to be signing a national emergency and it's been signed many times before.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:56:02.800]  It's been signed by other presidents from 1977 or so. It gave the presidents the power.
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:10.400]  There's rarely been a problem. They signed it. Nobody cares. I guess they weren't very exciting.
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:15.360]  But nobody cares. They signed it for far less important things in some cases, in many cases.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.960]  We're talking about an invasion of our country
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.240]  We have some of the greatest people I know. They've been with me from the beginning of
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.280]  my campaign, almost from the first week, the angel moms. Unfortunately, we have new angel moms.
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:43.120]  One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who we're talking about killed
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.200]  in the year of 18. I said, I haven't seen you before. She said, no, I'm new. I said, that's too bad.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:57.760]  It's too bad. It's so sad. Stand up just for a second. Show how beautiful your girl was.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:02.160]  And Jim Acosta says this doesn't exist. Nobody's getting killed in Mexico.
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:09.520]  Thank you. I have such respect for these people. Angel moms, angel dads, angel families have great
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:16.560]  respect for these people. These are great people. These are great people. They're fighting for their
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:20.000]  children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.760]  And by the way, more and more of the drug gangs are the shadow army, the Democrats,
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  but more importantly, Antifa is the Portland city just voted to kick the FBI out of the city,
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.160]  which normally would say, well, that states rights, but because the FBI is investigating
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:39.760]  Antifa attacking and killing people because a lot of the city council employees are Antifa.
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:46.080]  They are a criminal group. So they are now the city openly backing a paramilitary brown shirt force.

[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:54.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:14.960]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:24.320]  Angel moms, angel dads, angel families have great respect for these people. These are great people
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:32.160]  that they're fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:41.120]  this country and the press doesn't cover them. They don't want to incredibly and they're not
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:44.960]  treated the way they should be. They're fighting for other people because they don't want what
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:54.400]  happened to their children or husband or anybody. We have one young lady whose husband, please
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:02.800]  stand up. Your husband was just killed in Maryland. Incredible man just killed.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:12.000]  Beautiful children won't be seeing their father again. These are brave people. These are people
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.400]  that they don't have to be here. They don't have to be doing this. They're doing it for other people.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:20.480]  So I just want to thank all of you for being by the way, what Trump's doing here is really
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.880]  important. He's humanizing. The media will never cover people killed by illegal aliens.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:30.720]  Stuart Rose, we're going to get to more of his declaration a few hours ago. And of course,
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.760]  you're a constitutional law grad who would have practiced law, but you've dedicated yourself
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:41.040]  down to oathkeepers that you founded. But specifically as a veteran, a patriot, you want
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:47.920]  to Trump declare an emergency, but you're saying he didn't have to do it through the 70s law?
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:55.520]  No, he didn't have to use the 1976 Declaration of Emergencies Act. He could have just pointed to
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:59.680]  his responsibilities as the commander in chief. In fact, he didn't have to declare emergency at
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.720]  all. All he had to do is issue the orders to the military to go to the border and secure them
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:10.000]  against the military enemies. The cartels are unconventional warfare. Yeah, the president
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.680]  doesn't need authorization if the Chinese launch ICBMs. So if the border is being overrun, he doesn't
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:20.400]  have to go. Well, yeah, and the cartels are international terrorists. They use the force
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.360]  and the threat of force to control terrain inside of Mexico. They're very much like Pancho Villa was.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.920]  These terror. Yeah, they used terror. And inside the United States along the border,
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.000]  along the entire border, there are towns that are half illegal alien. Just the other day,
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  it was down in Eagle Pass and Marine Corps veteran and law enforcement veteran there
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.240]  gave us a tour and let us know that half the citizens, half of their are illegal aliens.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:47.680]  20,000 American citizens, another 20,000 illegal aliens, and the cartel runs that town.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:52.320]  They control everything. And so they use force through the force to control behavior and control
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.880]  politicians. That's the current definition in federal law of terrorism. And they are
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.040]  international. So they're international terrorist organization. He should say they are just like
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.680]  ISIS, just like al-Qaeda. They are international terrorists in the war on terror, global war on
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:10.720]  terror and their unconventional warfare, four generation warfare military opponents in the
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:15.200]  United States. We're taking over territory in Mexico and in the United States. And by the way,
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:21.200]  you and I have been big opponents of creeping mission creep, martial law, police state.
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:27.120]  This is the opposite. Letting cartels take over is the definition of a foreign terroristic police
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.320]  state. It's the duty of the executive branch and the president to stop it. It's the primary
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.520]  function of government is to preserve life, liberty and property and to guaranteed our
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:41.760]  posterity, blessings of liberty. National defense is the most important function
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:46.320]  of our government and the most important function of the president, commander-in-chief.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.720]  That's why in article two, it says he will be the commander-in-chief of the armed forces
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.560]  and of the militia. That's us when called into service, period. And he has obligation and duty
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:00.880]  to carry out all the guarantees, including guaranteeing each state, republican form of
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:05.360]  government. It says there that the national government will guarantee to each state a republican
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:10.800]  form of government. If you have the cartels taking over your counties and towns and your
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.080]  sheriff departments and your police chiefs, how is that a republican form of government?
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:18.720]  You know, for 10 years, Arizona 30, 40, 50 miles in has signs saying do not go down.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.080]  We're talking concrete roads in some cases. This is controlled by cartels.
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.000]  Exactly. We can't guarantee your safety. We advise you not to camp here.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.880]  So the U.S. has been for over a decade giving up continental United States territory.
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:36.480]  Precisely. And it's exactly a direct parallel to 1916 when you had Poncho Villa,
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:40.400]  there was a civil war in Mexico after the Mexican Revolution. Hold on, let's recap it.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:45.680]  The Stuart Rhodes, who again has his law degree and is an expert, let's also work in Congress
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:48.880]  to get into where we currently are with the president he's due next. But I think this is a
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:51.760]  big step in the right direction. I don't want to give the president too much heat for this.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:56.560]  Be the right, it's not even an emergency, it's his duty.
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:11.600]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:17.600]  is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:22.480]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:27.280]  hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed, hands down from our research,
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:33.040]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:38.880]  There's nothing else like it, must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:43.760]  easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though,
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.000]  it's very very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.880]  because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.720]  Turbo Force and m4slife.com
[02:05:54.720 --> 02:06:10.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:44.080]  Stuart Rose founder, O Keepers Army Veteran, good friend of mine,
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:47.360]  I've known him probably 16, 17 years since he started the organization.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:50.880]  Of course Yale law graduate, used to practice law, don't do that anymore, full time.
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:58.560]  I was going on at the nation fighting fruit survival and some stations don't carry the
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:02.240]  last five minutes, so let's recap this. We're not criticizing the president.
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:07.280]  Overall, I think what you're saying is we're defending what he's done, but he doesn't need
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:13.520]  this 1970s law to declare this emergency when the continental country's being threatened
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:19.040]  and the UN's running it and things are collapsing. He got drug cartels taking over major towns all
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:24.880]  over the Southwest. He better be doing what he's doing. Yeah, he needs to do it as the commander
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:30.960]  in chief though. Instead of putting it only in the box of fighting crime and drugs and human
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:36.960]  trafficking, he needs to articulate the reality that the cartels are military enemies and the
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:42.400]  direct parallel, which is very important, is Poncho Villa and Poncho Villa and his bandits
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:46.720]  took over northern Mexico. Mexico City could not stop and could not control them. Just like today,
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:51.440]  Mexico City can't stop the cartels and Poncho Villa. If they don't play games and stuff,
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:56.240]  he's wiped them out. Well, yeah, Poncho Villa raided into Texas and killed 18 Americans. The
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:02.320]  cartel has killed far more than that, obviously. Yeah, thousands. And so Wilson, President Wilson,
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:07.680]  1916 responded to this situation by sending the U.S. military down a National Guard down on the
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.960]  border to secure the border. And then he said, then he sent General Blackjack Pershing into Mexico
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:17.920]  to take it to Poncho Villa and go hunt him down. So that's what they did back then. It was a
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:22.160]  military defense of the nation. And again, it's a defense. We're not even, it's not a technical
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:26.720]  invasion to take the country. You have to go into the base and take it out. Well, yeah, because
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:32.960]  Mexico City couldn't, the nominal leader of Mexico at the time, the president of Mexico,
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:38.080]  could not control his own territory, could not control Mexico. And so the U.S. Army had to go
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:43.040]  do it. And we're in a similar situation. Mexico City does not control northern Mexico. The cartels
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:48.560]  do. Mexico is a fallen state. It's a fallen narco state, a failed narco state. I mean,
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:53.200]  we just heard in the El Chapo trial that the prior president of Mexico got a hundred million
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:58.080]  dollar bribe. So you could even say that right now, Mexico is being run by the cartels. Much like
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:02.720]  the Taliban took over Afghanistan, the cartels are taking over Mexico. But if you want to give
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.720]  respect to the Mexican government, you say, well, look, either you got to fix this or we will.
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:11.440]  And they have failed to do it. And so we could. Let's be clear. We don't want to invade Venezuela.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:16.800]  We don't want to invade Mexico. But we can't fight it on our border. If there failed collapse states,
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:22.320]  it's like building a seawall from the Gulf of Mexico. It's like we have to go in there and stop
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:27.920]  it. You may have to. I think President Trump, and especially given the reality of the absurdity
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:34.240]  of the courts in the United States interpreting the asylum laws to allow anybody who sets foot on
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.960]  U.S. soil to be automatically processed for asylum and then cut and release in the United States,
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:43.760]  he may have no choice but to go into Mexico to stop them there and to take it to the cartels
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.200]  to prevent them from getting on U.S. soil. But even if he doesn't do that right now,
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.440]  he should articulate this. He shouldn't say, I'm going to go, you know, try to find a scrounge
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:56.240]  of money that's discretionary as the as the president to enforce the laws. What he should
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:00.880]  say is as commander in chief, I'm going to use that massive military budget we have of trillion,
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:06.560]  what 1.3 trillion dollars. And I'm going to use that just like I do in Korea. We guard the DMZ
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:10.720]  in Korea. We guard the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We can't guard our own border.
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:14.400]  We can't guard our own border. It makes no sense at all. We used to have the army on the border
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.480]  that before there was a border patrol. It was the obligation and duty of the U.S. Army. There
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:23.440]  are forts every 50 miles along the border staffed by army soldiers. That's what we have to get back
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:27.280]  to because that's what it's going to take. And by the way, there were a couple of million illegal
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:31.440]  aliens here. It was out of control. It was what they were doing. And Eisenhower in like a month
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:36.960]  rounded them all up. I mean, back in the 50s, it wasn't a joke. It was just like, yeah, he did it.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:41.200]  And so, you know, I think President Trump, I think what he's he's trying to do the right thing,
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:46.000]  but my suspicion is, as we all know, is he is surrounded by deep state agents. We just we just
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.320]  learned of a temporary coup to use the 25th Amendment. And I'm sure he still has people like
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:54.480]  that. And how crazy like used to that be a huge story. Now it's like, oh, yeah, there was a 25th
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:59.200]  Amendment coup. And they try to do this. And yeah, you know, they're on the payroll, the Chinese,
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:03.200]  the government. I mean, it's like, wow, we are so sold out. Exactly. And as you know, as Alan
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.320]  Dershowitz said last time, Tucker Carlson, that was clearly a coup. It's, you know, the constitutional
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:13.360]  remedy we believe the president is committing felonies is to go and impeachment. Right.
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:17.840]  impeachment. That's constitutional remedy. The 25th Amendment is all about incapacity.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.160]  Is the president injured? Like the breaking was shot? Is he able to? Yeah, that's only one degree
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.240]  away from blowing the president's head off when you're trying to use 25th Amendment and all that.
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.320]  Sure. Well, they're removing him through an unconstitutional means, and they're doing it by
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:37.760]  collusion in the DOJ and his own legal counsel and the FBI behind his back. It's like seven days
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:40.560]  in May. I want to get to that in the next segment because that's really big. And I'm glad you brought
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.240]  that up because we just get punch-drunked at the insane times we live in. That's valid. Everything
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.320]  we've been warning of, everything we talked about. We were always used to having a globalist in
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:52.880]  office. It's the weird juxtapositive. We've got a quasi, you know, got Ryan in there and he's
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.960]  under siege. We're under siege, but we're winning in many ways because just because we've kind of
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:01.440]  fought him with stalemate. And then you've got the paradox, though, of the Democrats not standing
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.960]  when Trump says we save 3,000 women and hundreds of kids in sex slavery and, you know, we're stopping
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.040]  child pornographers and then they won't stand up for that. It shows. And then, oh, MS-13 are God's
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:18.240]  children. I know Democrats locally in Austin. They all run illegal immigration chains. They're
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.800]  dealing drugs. They're feeding on the poor underclass they're bringing in. But I mean, we have to
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:29.360]  understand the Democratic Party has fully converted to an insane mafia. It's like mass gas lighting.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.800]  They're doing all these things right in front of your face. And then they tell you, that's not
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.320]  happening. There's no crime on the border. There's just no way to be murdered on the board. Like,
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.560]  today during the... Apostates. Right. These are real mothers holding up their dead kids and
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.080]  causes. It doesn't exist. There's no crime there, even though they're right in front of him. So it's
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.440]  like... Well, let him actually go down the border for real and not just walk around behind a wall
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:52.560]  and then see how much crime there is. Oh, absolutely. Well, that's the problem, is that
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:56.720]  the president has gone down to the border. But what he needs to do is, what we did yesterday,
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.040]  what we did about a month ago, fly along the border. He should do a live stream. Here's the
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:05.040]  border. He should go interview ranchers on the border. He should take the time to go down there
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.240]  and put that up on the border. He should meet the ranchers. And we'll talk about that in our
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:11.600]  attempted killing against Trump. Which, again, we talk about it so much now that they just all
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:14.800]  confirm. We're like, hey, we told you this. Now, it's confirmed. But here's the deal.
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:21.120]  I'm anti-police state. I want due process here in America. And I push for that. But on your border
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:28.160]  and in a war, we never want a war playing games with a bunch of lawyers. And we win wars carpet
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:33.280]  bombing people. And Mexico's already being carpet bombed by the cartels. We're already collapsing
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.760]  into this. So I just don't know with such a leftist press, spying on the military and our police,
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:44.000]  I don't know how we're supposed to smash the cartels for once and for all and ever win that.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.840]  I mean, we have to smash them. We have to exterminate them or it's going to keep coming back.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:54.080]  Well, he has to recognize that we are facing really a perfect storm of an invasion and an
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:14:00.080]  insurrection against our laws by their inside the gates, chairs of the Constitution, the sovereign
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:05.360]  of the sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. And all on the border, you have compliant Democrat
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:10.720]  politicians through in the back pocket of the cartels and also like the Laraza types are ideologically
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:16.800]  motivated to it's a terrorist narco state that's basically brown KKK. Absolutely. I mean, I mean,
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:20.880]  their group is for those in the race, everything those outside the race, nothing. Right. So you
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.200]  see, you have little Hitler stuff. So you have the you have the cartels in allegiance with radical
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:29.120]  Marxist and globalist who wanted to destroy the United States and radical Muslims. It's like
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.640]  Marxist, racist drug cartels in league with Muslims. Precisely. All of them have the same common
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:39.840]  enemy, which is Western civilization, and they want to destroy the borders and tear down sovereignty.
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.280]  So how do we counter this witch's brew? That's what I'm saying is we're already under attack.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:48.400]  And I think people want Trump to take the gloves off. Well, he has to. But he has to do it constitutionally.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.080]  So he could call forth the militia, which include the National Guard and all of us
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.960]  as the militia to suppress the insurrection. He can call us forward to execute the law.
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.280]  How do you vet that and stop infiltrators? Well, you have your military veterans and your
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:04.400]  police officers first step up. Yeah, you have to go. People have a background because I mean,
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.920]  look at the Trump rallies. They send in guys screaming racist stuff every time they're done.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:12.080]  Right. I mean, sure. I'm not against the militia, but they're going to infiltrate a classic militia.
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.720]  Right. So you what you do is this is 1776 when the British were somewhat honorable and didn't do
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.480]  stuff like that. And we didn't do it. Right. That was still false flagging. Well, I think I think
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:24.560]  whether it's governed Abbott here or President President Trump could fall, call the militia
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:28.240]  and call the military veterans and police officers first. And of course, you're watching,
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:31.360]  you can do background checks. You can go through, watch their social media and see where they're
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:35.600]  at. You can weed out your, your, your actual white nationalist or your radical leftist.
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:37.680]  And you'll find out who they are real quick. Yeah, you can find out.
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:40.720]  Find out. Let's talk about that. Cause listen, more caravans are coming.
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.480]  Five million told Gallup. They're coming. The country's under attack. Europe's already collapsed.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:47.840]  We're not talking about militias and martial law for a joke. Pelosi says
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:51.760]  she'll threaten martial law and confiscate guns. We'll talk about that when we come back.

[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:32.000]  over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.320]  the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.160]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:02.800]  claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:09.760]  foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:16.160]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?

[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:10.800]  future. So, you support us and get creative and get fired up. We won't just be here 100 years,
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:15.360]  we'll be here forever. We'll turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.240]  bases, and God knows what, are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:25.600]  And that's really where this goes. But God's got a big war for you ready. And so, if you can't face
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:29.920]  George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:35.440]  to face the other stuff? Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.200]  are also ready to fight. You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.960]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future. I mean, all I know is,
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.480]  I want to go with the master built. I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:53.040]  that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being a
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:20:08.960]  tomb. I want life. I want Jesus. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:36.160]  All right, Stuart Rhodes, founder of O Keepers, a Yale law graduate, Patriot. You share with us. And
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:41.200]  you know, I get mad at myself because I tell this story almost every week because it's so critical
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:45.680]  to understand the globalist. And as I got older, I realized it was true. It's like 10, 12 years ago,
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:51.920]  I was on a first class airline flight, American Airlines. And one of the heads of one of the big
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:56.480]  three banks was there and I said, oh, you don't fly on private jet. And he goes, no, too much
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.480]  hassle. I was visiting my dad, a retired general in San Antonio. I'm kind of like, you know who it is.
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:03.680]  You know, they're still being off record. He goes, this is off record, Alex.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:09.920]  And he goes, the public's dumb and you'd be best just to join us because they're going to adapt to
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:15.360]  being slaves. He goes, you don't adapt and overcome. You adapt to what we're doing. And the public,
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:20.000]  you know, basically just as much idiots as I deserve it. And I thought, well, that's later
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.480]  as I watch things, I'm adapting to governors on TV saying they kill babies after they're born.
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:29.520]  I mean, I don't like it, but I'm still just getting comfortable with that.
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:33.680]  They slap in the face, you know, hearing these evils. And then now, like you said,
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:37.200]  Mexico's hundreds of thousands dead, not 40,000 dead, like Trump said,
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:40.640]  hundreds of thousands. That's the State Department's own numbers. It's most areas are lawless,
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:44.400]  super dangerous. If you have any money, you're kidnapped very quickly. 80% of women coming
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:49.600]  through there are raped. That's Amos International. It's a hellhole. And we're just here calmly
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:54.400]  talking about McCabe and then planning a 25th Amendment coup of the president, which confirms
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:22:00.080]  everything we knew was going on. And it's just like, don't people get that we're this close
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:05.360]  to there being no rule of law and then things just unravel very quickly that Western cultures are
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:10.560]  rich and powerful because we know we're corrupt. We try to keep it in check. Once you put a bunch
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:15.840]  of clicks in, it's over. This country will unravel. It will fall apart like third world
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:20.320]  countries can't build nuclear reactors. They can't upkeep them. Art reactors will start melting
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.560]  down. I'm not trying to scare people. Places like Venezuela can't run nuclear power plants,
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:30.240]  folks. They can't wipe their ass. And they were smart 50 years ago. They get lazy. They get done.
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:33.840]  Everyone gives up because there's no excellence. There's no leadership. So I'm ranting here.
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:39.280]  It's just that as a father, a four year father, a six gut level, historic level, everything,
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:44.720]  we have put up with far too much. And I know they're trying to break my will,
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:49.360]  even though I'm fighting hard, imagine people that aren't even conscious. Let's get into
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:52.720]  the fact that they're currently trying to coup the president. They're admitting they're doing it.
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:57.840]  And then as you said, play the clip in a moment, Pelosi, you said it's not martial law. It's just
[02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:03.680]  dictatorship. She says, we'll declare an emergency and take your guns. And now we're going, oh,
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:08.320]  well, they want our guns. They should deny it 10 years ago. Now the New York Times says, ban the
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:16.160]  guns, take them. And that's what I mean is they've radicalized so far that here's the problem.
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:19.840]  People said, well, we'll just submit. We'll just, we'll just give it. They'll never stop pushing.
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:25.600]  There will be a bloody civil war. I don't want it, but they're not going to stop. And a certain
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.400]  percentage of Americans are not going to let the schools like Jocelyn Elders wanted to do 20 years
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:33.840]  ago. Now it's made, you know, take your two year old and have the teachers sit there and,
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:38.320]  you know, sexually abuse them. I mean, these people are freaks and there's no limit to what
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:44.400]  they'll do is what I'm saying is Stuart, you can smell the blood in the air. We're going down a
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:50.480]  road of just death. Right. And a couple of things. Well, one is, in a way, it's good that they're
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:56.000]  going so over the top and jumping in the shark like Cortez with all her open articulation that
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.680]  will any Latino can come into the United States, you know, there's no such thing as a border.
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:04.240]  We should just, we should just set everything free. Everyone. So the letting you know what their
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:09.280]  plan is, their plan is, is in, you know, of course, you understand that I come from an Hispanic
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:14.080]  background myself. My family came from Mexico originally on my mother's side, but they came
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:20.160]  here and assimilated, became Americans. What Cortez is articulating is the weather underground
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:27.040]  identity politics strategy of... It's a Marxist ethos. Sure. Turning Americans who are Hispanic,
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:31.520]  trying to, against their own country. Of course, there were at least a quarter of the crowd in
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:36.000]  El Paso at the Trump rally was Hispanic, which was really nice to see. Those are patriotic
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  Tejanos who believe in... I noticed the media didn't want to show the crowd. No, they don't,
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.080]  and they won't. So that's part of their gaslighting. They don't want you to believe that there's
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:48.000]  anybody out there who supports Trump except for white people. The next inferences, well,
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.880]  they're all racist. At the same time, they want to bring in more people. They can't successfully
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:57.760]  brainwash all minorities. Many, you know, on the walkway movement is a testament to this.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:02.640]  Well, statistically, blacks and Hispanics are turning towards capitalism and America.
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:07.600]  Right. They failed to brainwash them and use them. They try to use them.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:12.000]  And that's why they want the very lowest IQ, dumbest in the third world. Hurry, get in here.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.960]  Already pre brainwashed at UN camps to make sure they're vetted.
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.120]  Well, they want to bring in people who don't have our same history and our same culture,
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:24.480]  who are easier to manipulate. Absolutely right. Come from socialist countries. They want someone
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:29.600]  from Venezuela or Honduras or Guatemala who they think will vote Democrat. Now, whether they will
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.600]  or not, it could be a battle. But the best way to stop it is prevent them from doing what they
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:37.760]  want to do, which is flood us with people. And at the same time, they're instructing them not to
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:43.040]  assimilate. They're articulating in them, you know, fly your own flag. Be proud of where you're from.
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:46.240]  The United States is oppressive. You're right to be here because this is Chicano territory,
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:49.760]  et cetera, et cetera. That's right. America sucks, but get up here and get free stuff.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:53.200]  Yeah. America sucks to help us destroy it. Basically, it's what they're doing.
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:57.440]  So what we have to do is realize the reality of that and make sure Trump also realizes it.
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:03.440]  He came close today in his press conference. He almost said this is a effort by the Democratic
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.360]  Party to bring in new voters. He should have said it because it's true. But at the same time,
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:11.920]  we should focus on the cartels. We have a chance with him right now to fix this peacefully,
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:17.200]  relatively peacefully, but he has to be aggressive. He needs to purge out the neocons
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:21.760]  and the deep staters in his own cabinet. First of all, to protect himself against
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:25.920]  the 25th Amendment coup. And then he also needs to purge out and clean out his DOJ,
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:29.200]  so they'll go out there and ask him. He must do it. He must. He has to. But here's the thing.
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:33.600]  In my 13, these people are so brainwashed, they love going to prison. And I'm not somebody that's,
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:36.880]  you know, we need to bring back the death penalty and it needs to be, it needs to be due process,
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:40.800]  but done quickly because these people need to be killed. I mean, people that, you know, you know,
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:44.880]  when I'm in my 13 likes to kill little kids and rituals for the devil. And that's part of their
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.320]  whole thing. So people that are into torturing and killing kids, we don't need to put them in
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:52.400]  prison and let them out in five years when they've committed a murder. They need to be killed.
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:55.120]  And I'm not a bloodthirsty person, but we need to kill these people.
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:59.520]  Well, I mean, if you're waging war against them using the US military on the border,
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:04.000]  a bit different paradigm, so it could get quite a bit more messy.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.520]  And I'm not trying to sound big boss here. I'm just saying when you're faced with people that
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:12.080]  worship the Grand Reaper and torture children, you have to take the gloves off.
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:14.880]  Well, there's mass graves full of women and children in Mexico.
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:21.440]  You know, they, once they use them up as sex slaves, they kill them. They don't,
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:26.560]  there's no retirement home for sex slaves in Mexico. They're just killed and put in mass grave.
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:30.800]  But what I was referring to though is what Trump should be doing is prosecuting the
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:36.880]  leftist NGOs and the politicians who are in his face violating federal law.
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:40.240]  And that's the key when we come back. That's what they flipped out and threatened to take
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.440]  blue dogs off the air when he had the head of judicial watch on going.
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:48.480]  We give billions to USA that gives it to Soros to form these. It's public.
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:51.280]  And they went, oh my God, take him off because that's it. Just cut the funding.
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.520]  Well, prosecute them for aiding and abetting illegal aliens and harboring them.
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:58.880]  No, I agree. You're right. We've got to push it with prosecution.
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:01.200]  And then we get the cutting the money off. Exactly.
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.520]  Right. Well, the money's being, you can use Rico for that.
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:08.640]  Why doesn't Trump do that? I mean, he has a DOJ that's controlled by
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:11.600]  deep staters as we now know that they tried to do a coup against him.
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:15.840]  His own deputy attorney general was plotting to use it. Ron Rosenstein.
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.480]  Right. Yeah. You could take one look at that guy and then his background. I mean, who?
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.560]  I mean, what's come? Exactly. So he was plotting and it's not just him being a,
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:30.800]  you know, an outlier. It was him and the deputy director of the FBI.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.240]  Okay. Right. And who knows who else on his cabinet? We don't know.

[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:32.000]  info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:40.400]  Suggesting Mr. President there's a military plot to take over the government. This may occur
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:47.200]  sometime this coming Sunday. There are some who will say it can never happen here. But this is
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:54.160]  the story of how it could happen in seven days of intrigue, a blackmail of terror and eternity
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:34:00.080]  of suspense. This is the astounding story of a military plot to overthrow the government of
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:05.120]  the United States, which if successful would change the fate of every American.
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:21.840]  You're a night crawler, Colonel. A peddler. You sell information. Are you sufficiently up on your
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:29.040]  Bibles to know who Judas was? Yes, I know who Judas was. He was a man I worked for and admired
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:36.240]  to be disgraced to four stars on his uniform. Seven days in May, the first day when a Marine
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:46.880]  Colonel wondered who was inciting screaming mobs in Madison Square Garden. The second day
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:52.720]  that uncovered secret meetings in Washington's back alleys. The third day when unknown men
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:58.240]  prepared to kidnap the president from his private vacation resort. The fourth day that brought a
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:03.600]  secret presidential messenger to death in a plane crash in Spain. The day a senator of the United
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:12.720]  States was held against his will. The fifth day when a woman found her past being used for blackmail.
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:17.600]  Look, Ellie, if I could tell you why... I'll tell you something. I was a stupid,
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:22.880]  impressionable female who let an Air Force general use her like his personal airplane.
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:28.560]  The sixth day, the discovery of a desert base for an airborne task force kept secret even from
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:39.040]  the president of the United States. The seventh day when the head of the joint chiefs of staff
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.920]  dared the president of the United States to stop the conspiracy that couldn't be proved.
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:49.120]  You're not a weak sister, Mr. President. You're a criminally weak sister. You say I've duped the
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:53.760]  people, General. I've built them. I've misled them. I've stripped them naked and made them defenseless.
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:59.120]  You accuse me of having lost their faith deliberately and criminally. Shut my ears to the
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:06.640]  national voice. I do. Well, where the hell have you heard that voice, General? In freight elevators
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:11.360]  and dark alleys and secret places in the dead of night? How did that voice seep into a locked
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:16.640]  room full of conspirators? That's not why you hear the voice of the people, General, not in this
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:22.080]  republic. And I will not resign voluntarily. I'm going to fight you. And then we'll see which
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:24.560]  one of us the United States is willing to follow.
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:46.320]  We're searching war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:54.000]  of the Info War. Not since the founding of this nation or the civil war has this country been in
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.880]  more danger and the whole world's in danger because Europe's run by total tyrants. China's run by
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:01.920]  people even more soulless than Hitler.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:12.320]  And Stuart Rhodes, constitutional lawyers here with us, founder of Oath Keepers, working hard.
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:16.720]  It's really important. Operations are in Texas. You can't get into on air. He'll be co-hosting
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:24.400]  some next week. But you mentioned this. I thought I'd pull a few news articles where we can put up
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:29.520]  on screen for TV viewers. Just type in 25th Amendment coup in full wars.com and then click
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:35.840]  Google News or Google Web. And you'll get hundreds of articles we wrote last year. Hundreds.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  Rosenstein is plotting deep state coup against Trump. Point of the amendment. Let's move on.
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:44.800]  Coup d'etat now live deep state policy for the amendment planned to remove Trump.
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:49.760]  Now, now you know why they want to solve air. Why New York Times story about Rosenstein coup
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:54.880]  attempt is a setup. So now Alan Dershowitz is on Fox News last night. You mentioned it.
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:58.320]  Alan Dershowitz, Harvard lawyer, highly respected. He says the deep state is
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:01.520]  coming from the amendment to Alistair Trump is clearly an attempt at a coup d'etat.
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:06.080]  So next year is Tuesday. They don't want to solve the year because we're lying.
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:10.240]  They want to solve the year because we're over the target. Yeah, exactly right.
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:16.560]  And I do think there's a chance that part of why it's coming out now is that they want to condition
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:21.040]  the public just like conditioning you to accept infanticide. They want to condition people to
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:26.160]  say, well, you know, they did a 25th Amendment coup attempt and no one's prosecuted. And so it's on
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:30.960]  the table. And if it happens down the road, it happens. And a lot of the leftists are still
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:37.600]  talking about using it right now, openly. And I remember they had full page ads a year and a
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:42.320]  half ago, the New York Times saying Alistair and 25th Amendment coup. When I talked about it,
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:46.000]  they had articles and Jones made it up. It's not the New York Times. And I had family
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:53.280]  read that. And then Alex, we believe you, but I had family go to places that have newsstands.
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:59.760]  They went, son, it's my mom had family come and they go, son, it's full page. Why would they say
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:04.480]  on the news? It's not in there. What is that military tactic of a dark side military where
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:09.440]  I guess it's gaslighting. But what's the point when it's in million, I think there's five million
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:13.520]  papers that they put out. It was in all five million people had to deliver to their doorsteps
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:18.800]  by fed family, literally go. I want to say who in the family, but they're like, I got a call and
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:22.640]  they go, they're saying that's not in the New York Times. Why are you saying that?
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:27.520]  Well, it's right out of 1984, right? Like Orwell's 1984. Everyone knows they're in
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.920]  dictatorship, but it's the Ministry of Love and Big Brother loves you. And even though you know
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:36.320]  your neighbor's been disappeared. So at the same time as they reveal to you, here's what's going
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:41.520]  to happen to you. If you get in our way, they also gaslight you. Don't see what's in front of your
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:46.080]  face. Don't see the tyranny right in front of you. Exactly. But if you're informed, the tactic is
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:50.080]  that it makes you upset or I guess people aren't as dogged as we are. I'm not bragging. I guess
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:53.600]  they kind of give up or because there's got to be a reason they do this tactic. Like, yeah,
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:57.920]  if that's what it is, it's the ones who are awakened aware, they want them to become so
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:03.760]  demoralized that they just give up and hide or they join forces, you know, come over the dark side.
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:09.200]  Go. You were told or the ones who are willfully ignorant and don't want to see it. They have
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:12.960]  an easy way to ignore what's in front of their face. I got a couple calls yesterday and I'm not
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:20.080]  going to say who buy, but some big people. And one of them was a major CEO and they just said,
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:25.600]  listen, it was so they as off records. I can't say who they go. This is your road to redemption,
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.080]  Alex. You're going to get destroyed. We don't want it to happen. It's not as bad as you think.
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:36.240]  There's a road for your redemption. Right. And so now they're saying just fly to San Francisco.
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.960]  We have your road to redemption. Like, I can't even entertain selling out. Right. I mean,
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:47.360]  if it wasn't pedophilia driven and radical Islam driven and so evil, I mean, I'd make deals
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:50.400]  because I don't want to be destroyed, but I'm not making a deal with these people. No, you can't
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:54.400]  because your soul is more important than anything else. Right. I just don't get how most men and
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:59.120]  I'm not trying to act like I don't get how most men have been so like kept in a fishbowl their whole
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:04.160]  life because they don't even know. They just think you kiss other powerful men's ass and you move up.
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:08.560]  They don't even, they don't even know. It's like Louis Gomert said to the head of Google,
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:12.160]  we said, you just lie to us. I never, like, like, but maybe you're not lying. Maybe you,
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.960]  you've lived in the dark so long, you don't know what the light is. I just like,
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.880]  because they're like, well, why aren't you going to sell it? We're going to destroy it.
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:26.400]  And like, sell out to destroy everything. Right. Sell out to jumping off a cliff.
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:30.640]  It's like, there's nothing to sell out to. Right. Right. What are you going to do? You're going
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:35.600]  to live a few more years longer in peace and quiet and then give over your children and your
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:41.200]  children's children to slavery? Of course you won't. Can't do that. But man, the average,
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:45.440]  average guys, you know, the success was polishing their Porsche, messing with their trophy wife.
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:49.840]  And they just, I want to kick their ass. They're the people I really don't like.
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.600]  It's not that I'm playing golf or, you know, having a good time, but these guys think not
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:58.880]  caring is like a shield. You see these strong, smart, good-looking guys might not be able to kick
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:03.040]  my ass, have a higher IQ, but they don't have a spirit. Right. And they, and I want to knock
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:07.840]  their teeth out. I don't blame you. Another reason why the GOP is just doing what it did
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.880]  yesterday. They sold the American people down the river and they gave the president what I think
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:19.200]  is a big bag of turd, frankly. No, I agree. I like the emergency, but this whole docket thing,
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:23.600]  Trump's starting to go sideways and it really worries me. Well, there's a provision in there
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:30.320]  that allows the communities on the border to say no to a wall. So you have these democrat-controlled,
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:35.520]  cartel-controlled communities, like I was just down at Eagle Pass the other day and I asked
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:38.720]  our guide there, the Marine Guide, I said, Hey, what's what's the deal with the sheriff here?
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.320]  He said, Well, he used to be a board patrol agent. So that's good. So he's in favor of the
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:46.480]  wall. Oh, no. He's a democrat. He's opposed to the wall. It's obvious he's in the back pocket of
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.960]  the cartels. So you have these guys all live in million dollar houses. By the way, down on the
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:57.200]  board, that's like a 10 million dollar house. We'll be right back. For those looking for the

[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:04.000]  research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:11.360]  is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:17.840]  in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:23.760]  get so butt hurt when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:30.080]  remember what political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to

[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:35.760]  All right, let's recap all this because we're going to host 30 minutes the next hour
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:40.560]  and then best-selling author, former Navy SEAL, the smart guy Matt Brackett's taken over. He's been
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:45.440]  hosting a lot. You're going to be guest hosting a show next week. Stuart Rhodes here in Texas
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:51.440]  getting a lot done with Gary Haven and other great patriots. We're not up here trying to be dramatic
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.280]  and that's my problem and I keep going back to this mentally to the audience.
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:48:04.320]  Everything we ever warned of basically has happened and now it's almost like, okay,
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:09.200]  it's real. Let's just all just sit back and see what goes on. No folks, people need to be focused.
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:13.120]  They need to be involved. They need to be diligent and I'm not here saying it's like work
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:15.760]  and I'm not complaining to the audience either. It's just that
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:21.840]  we have to take action because I want you to give your view on this as a smart guy, a
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:26.480]  historian, lawyer, veteran, you're a smart guy and I mean that for the list we're shooting in.
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:33.760]  What's the world look like if they win versus if we can hold them back and at least push them
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:37.840]  back some because evil is an ongoing problem. We're not offering utopia like Cortez does.
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.160]  You don't have to work or everything's free and there's pie in the sky and chicken in every pot
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:47.200]  but a good world if we become moral again and get engaged versus where we're going.
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:53.440]  It would look like like Orwell said, vision of the future is the boot stamping on the human
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:49:01.120]  face forever and you can look at northern Mexico and the absolute demonic mass murder
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:05.360]  that's happening and oppression in the Mexican people by the cartels and that's your future.
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:10.160]  That's your future in a communist dictatorship. It's your future in a narco state too, a cartel
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:13.520]  run narco state and you're going to get a combination of those two things and your
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:18.480]  future is also what you saw in the caliphate with ISIS. That's your future as well. In fact,
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.280]  all three of those elements are at work in this country right now. You have all three
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:30.240]  demonic possessed totalitarian elements working together to overthrow our constitutional republic.
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:34.720]  Why does Christianity, real Christianity produce so much incredible wealth like
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:39.200]  Tootsies and Hooties, the Christian groups, less than 10% they have almost all the wealth
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:44.240]  because Christianity allowed them to not kill each other and produce wealth. Beyond IQ,
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:52.000]  some high IQ, some low, it's the Christian, real Christian ethos that creates fabulous wealth.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.280]  You have the sanctity of the human soul, the sanctity of human life, and the belief that you
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:03.840]  have a self-determination that the only person you have to answer to is God, that there's no
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:10.160]  man-god over you. Communism has a man-god over you, so does the caliphate, and so does the cartel.
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:16.160]  I remember being a little young and jealous or envious of things. The only thing I'm still
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:22.400]  jealous of every time is women. That's genetic, but I was never like mad. The neighbor got a
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:29.280]  new motorcycle, she'd got a better motorcycle than I did or better golf clubs, but it's so freeing
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:34.960]  now to not get mad that some guy's got a gorgeous wife or a bunch of great kids or more money than
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:40.800]  me or a private jet. I mean, it's so freeing that, I mean, material's fine. I like to be successful
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:44.160]  and take care of my family, but it means nothing at the end of the day compared to ideas. But then
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:49.520]  I still run to most adults and they're just seized up with envy and like, well, your house is a little
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:54.160]  bigger, your pool, and it's like, not that any of those things are bad, but to them, it's like,
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:59.040]  that's what they're shooting for, and they're so empty. Right. Well, it's what the Bible
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:06.000]  talks about when it says that, you know, a wealthy man will get into heaven, much, much more easier
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:11.680]  or harder than putting it on the needle. Right. Because if you're worshiping just success and
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:16.480]  you're constantly grasping for more, you'll never be satisfied, but really counts as you're everlasting
[02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:20.000]  soul. That's what really counts. And of course, if you really go to the Bible, the historian's
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:24.880]  Christ was pointing at the Jerusalem wall. It was called the eye of the needle. The thing is a camel
[02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:28.080]  and that they had to get on your knees. It was a very small opening. So the point was you got to
[02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:32.000]  get on, you had to be humble. Right. You can be rich, but you've got to get on your knees
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:37.920]  and not to God. You can't put the money top. And that's why I think Christianity is so hated
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:44.160]  is because that was the bedrock root of the conviction of our founding fathers to fight
[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:49.840]  and bleed. They fear the conviction that we serve God, not man. Right. No king but Jesus.
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:54.000]  And they're willing to give their life up. And you had wealthy men who willing, you know,
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.760]  deal Hancock, for example, who willing to give up their fortune and risk all in George Washington
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:05.200]  is wealthy as well. These are wealthy men. Where are the modern versions of Hancock and Washington
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:09.760]  and Jefferson? And as you know, the Brits were able to beat the boars after a long war by grabbing
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:13.280]  their families. Many of the founders had their families taken to put on slave ships, start to
[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:17.600]  death. And they just let their family, they're like, we're sad, but, you know, they started
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:22.880]  this. Well, if you have a conviction that your what really counts is doing what's right,
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:26.800]  and that you're willing to give your life and even your family's lives because, you know,
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:31.200]  it really counts as your souls, then you don't give in. And imagine being in Boston or New York
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:36.400]  and looking out at ships a mile out and knowing your sons are on that ship being starved to death
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:42.640]  and you can't give up. Right. You can't. Well, because if you do, then everyone loses everything.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:47.200]  Even if you want to talk about just here on earth, you're still talking about posterity.
[02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:54.080]  So why did the founders do that? Literally let their families starve to death instead of giving
[02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:59.600]  up. That's powerful. Right. Because they knew that they had to preserve the sanctity of the human
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:05.280]  conscience and the human soul, your ability to say yes or no. And someone can kill you,
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:11.120]  but they can't submit, make you submit to them unless you submit yourself. So let me ask you
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:16.080]  this, Stuart, where are we going? Because Pelosi comes out and threatens to become a dictator.
[02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:20.800]  And, well, here, let's play the clip. Cue up Pelosi. I mean, you talk about a monstrous person
[02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:26.800]  in her fascist dress. Here it is. Republicans have some ease about it, no matter what they say,
[02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:33.680]  because the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:38.880]  and an illusion that he wants to convey. Just think of what a president,
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:43.520]  what's different values can present to the American people. You want to talk about a
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:49.680]  national emergency? Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:55.920]  of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that
[02:53:55.920 --> 02:54:01.280]  emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would. Even though gun crimes lay down, what do you make of
[02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:07.040]  that, Stuart? Well, it's a scare tactic. What she's trying to say is that, you know, hey, you can't do
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:10.880]  this. And Republicans should oppose the president because he's opening the door for all kinds of
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:14.880]  problems. And I've even heard conservatives say, this is a problem. You shouldn't do this because
[02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:19.040]  they could do this down the road. If they're advocating something unconstitutional, like gun
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:23.040]  confiscation, then they can't do it under the Constitution. It doesn't matter what Trump does
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:26.720]  regarding something that's perfectly constitutional. This is why, you know, self-defense of the nation
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:31.360]  and our borders repelling an invasion is squarely constitutional. It's one of his duties. So I don't
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.840]  really give much concern for this being a bad precedent for down the road. If they go and try
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:43.360]  to use a national emergency, you know, so-called to confiscate firearms, it's unconstitutional,
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:48.000]  and then we just fight. Well, I'm about to say, but let's expand on that. The left is spoiling
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:52.880]  for some weird war and all these anti-families. Can they imagine if they do start a war and the
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:58.640]  veneer of civilization peels away in seconds? Do they understand that everything conservatives
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:02.000]  and Christians have done to build businesses and to serve their country and their family,
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:08.320]  that people have already, the public's already scattered everything out. And they don't want
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:12.400]  to do this, but everybody's going to know the moment. And then I don't think these leftists
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:16.880]  realize what's going to happen to them. No, they don't. And I don't want to stress that I don't
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:21.280]  want that. Like right now, being smeared by media matters, trying to say that, you know, we talked
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:27.360]  about murdering leftists on a show prior, you know, and sure, what we talked about is that if
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:31.920]  there's a civil war, they'll lose and they'll force us to have to fight. And they hate
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:36.640]  that. Right. So they make sure that, so a lot of them, I think, know it. I think the elites
[02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:40.880]  understand they can't go too far too fast. So what they're trying to do is condition us and
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:44.640]  they're waiting until one of them is commander-in-chief. They're not going to try something like this
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:48.560]  while Trump's in. They would prefer if they're going to have an outright fight with us, they want
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:53.120]  to make sure that one of them is commander-in-chief. So that's why you got to watch out for a future
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:57.120]  Democrat as commander-in-chief under those conditions. Like with Hillary, if Hillary had won,
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:00.960]  I think all bets were off. They were going over the censorship of everything. In fact,
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:04.880]  they're going ahead with it as if she had won. But here's the thing. I'm not an authoritarian,
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:12.320]  but when you're faced with authoritarianism, then what do you do? Because the Democratic
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:16.160]  Party is not an American party. They're a globalist anti-American party. They say America was never
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:20.160]  great, will never be great. We shouldn't have borders. They're allied with foreign governments.
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:27.600]  I don't think they qualify as a party that could even be in the electoral system.
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:33.120]  Well, what the president can do is he can use the Constitution to suppress the insurrection.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:37.760]  He has an open insurrection in the entire state of California. The elected officials there,
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.080]  with their sanctuary state, they're an open rebellion against the laws of the union.
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:47.600]  And the clearest law of the union that's very constitutional is a law against illegal immigration
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.160]  and harboring illegals. They're committing felonies. So what Trump could do is he could
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:56.960]  prosecute them for the DOJ, but he could also call the militia to go and suppress the insurrection.
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:00.240]  It's happening right now in California. He could do that. It's constitutional power.
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:04.800]  Well, I know everybody I know that lives in California, especially Southern California,
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:09.040]  they say we're all trying to get out. I mean, it is a freaking hellhole.

[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.440]  come back and play part of this Alan Dershowitz interview on Tucker Carlson last night in case
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:27.920]  you didn't know that they really are trying to 25th Amendment Coug as the president. That's now
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:31.520]  mainstream news. I mean, he shows the emergency was coming. We told you this was going on.
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:34.640]  We broke it almost a year ago, but now it's all confirmed.

[02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:51.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:51.120 --> 03:00:05.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:22.560]  We got some big breaking news the start of the next segment. Lawmakers in Texas have introduced
[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:28.560]  legislation for $2.5 billion to build a wall right here in Texas, so the states are taking action.
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:33.280]  Very, very exciting. Stuart Rose is with us. We've got of course Matt Bracken taking over the bottom
[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:36.720]  of the hour. I'm going to take your phone calls starting the next segment, but I want to play,
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:40.160]  since Stuart mentioned it, because you kind of pinch yourself. I got some people in October,
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:43.760]  Trump's declared an emergency, and then I said he would a month ago, and now he's done it,
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:47.360]  but we got into the 25th Amendment coup plan against the president specifically
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  and how it was being planned. And I'm just pointing out they want us off air because it breaks
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:57.840]  about how accurate we are, but here's liberal Harvard law professor, but very respected,
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:01.040]  one of the biggest winning records, you know, you're a lawyer out there out there,
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:07.360]  you know, on all sorts of fronts, Alan Dershowitz pointing out that this is an attempted coup against
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:13.600]  the president. We're living in amazing times, folks, so here is Alan Dershowitz, infowars.com,
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:19.680]  newswars.com. I should also again point out, everybody should visit oathkeepers.org. Here is
[03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:25.200]  Alan Dershowitz. 60 Minutes interview, McCabe admits that his attempt to undermine the president
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:31.600]  began almost immediately after his boss Jim Comey was fired, and it was, of course, due to Russia.
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:39.360]  I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency and won the election for the presidency,
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:48.720]  and who might have done so with the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:53.200]  adversary on the world stage, and that was something that troubled me greatly.
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:59.280]  How long was it after that that you decided to start the obstruction of justice?
[03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:02.800]  Look at that sanctum on his turds of investigations involving the president.
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:07.360]  I think the next day I met with the team investigating the Russia cases,
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:15.440]  and I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine where are we with these
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:20.400]  efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward. Alan Dershowitz has retired
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:23.840]  Harvard Law School professor, he's the author of the book The Case Against the Democratic House
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:29.840]  in Peaching, Trump, and he joins us. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So now the
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:35.360]  suspicions that many are confirmed by one of the players in it, the Department of Justice
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:40.000]  discussed trying to remove the president using the 25th Amendment. What's your reaction to that?
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:48.000]  Well, if that's true, it is clearly an attempted coup d'etat. Relating to what your former guest
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:53.280]  said, let's take the worst case scenario. Let's assume the president of the United States was
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:59.200]  in bed with the Russians, committed treason, committed obstruction of justice. The 25th Amendment
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:05.520]  simply is irrelevant to that. That's why you have an impeachment provision. The 25th Amendment is
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:12.080]  about Woodrow Wilson having a stroke. It's about a president being shot and not being able to
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:17.760]  perform his office. It's not about the most fundamental disagreements. It's not about impeachable
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:24.560]  offenses. And any Justice Department official who even mentioned the 25th Amendment in the context
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:31.040]  of President Trump has committed a grievous offense against the Constitution. The framers
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:37.440]  of the 25th Amendment had in mind something very specific. And trying to use the 25th Amendment
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:45.120]  to circumvent the impeachment provisions or to circumvent an election is a despicable act of
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.400]  unconstitutional power grabbing. And you were right when you said it reminds me of what happens
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:54.640]  in third world countries. Look, these people may have been well intentioned. They may believe
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:59.520]  that they were serving the interests of the United States, but you have to obey the law. And the law
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:07.120]  is the Constitution. And the 25th Amendment is as clear as could be in capacity, unable to perform
[03:04:07.120 --> 03:04:12.160]  office. That's what you need. That's why you need two thirds of the House and two thirds of the Senate
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:18.240]  agreeing. And it has to be on the basis of a medical or psychological incapacity, not on the
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:22.640]  basis of even the most extreme crimes, which there's no evidence we're committed. But even
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:26.560]  if they were, that would not be a basis for invoking the 25th Amendment. So this is not
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:32.560]  simply right. And I challenge any left wing person to get on television and to defend the
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:38.400]  use of the 25th Amendment. I challenge any of my colleagues who are in the get Trump at any cost
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:45.280]  camp to come on television and justify the use of the 25th Amendment other than for physical or
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:49.520]  psychiatric incapacity. I bet they're doing that right now. But this is an attack on our system,
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:53.360]  I would say, not just on them. Thank you very much. We'll be back. Stay with us.

[03:06:03.760 --> 03:06:21.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:40.800]  All right, we're going to take phone calls for a couple seconds of Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers.
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:45.920]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and then we're going to turn the baton over to the rest of the broadcast
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:49.600]  and the war room starts to Matt Bracken. And of course, Matt likes Stuart Rhodes, so they may
[03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:55.280]  talk a little bit in the next segment as well. Don't forget OathKeepers.org. You're doing a
[03:06:55.280 --> 03:06:59.520]  membership drive. People can also buy t-shirts there to support the great work you're doing, Stuart,
[03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:05.280]  as a constitutional, you know, Yale law graduate and as a veteran of patriots doing
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:09.600]  Yeoman's work. And people always get these comments and talk about the membership drive.
[03:07:09.600 --> 03:07:13.360]  There's paradox. They go, oh, you and Stuart Rhodes, they'll bring you up. They go, you claim
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:17.680]  you're against the police state. Now, you want trips on the border and you want to go out the
[03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:23.520]  cartel. Yeah, we don't want checkpoints in the middle of Kansas or New York randomly. When you've
[03:07:23.520 --> 03:07:29.440]  got a collapsing border and Narco terrorists outlaw radical Islam attacking hundreds of thousands of
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:35.520]  dead in Mexico and the Democrats working with MS-13, that's constitutional. That's what the
[03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:39.600]  military and police are supposed to do. They're not supposed to be asked to be in my pants too
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:44.880]  dark in my car. They're supposed to be dealing with criminals. Well, they have to defend the nation.
[03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:49.360]  The primary purpose of the military is national defense, which is defending our country.
[03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:53.840]  Anyone in article one, section eight articulates the three reasons the president can call forth
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:59.360]  the militia, which includes us, is to repel invasions, suppress insurrections and execute the laws of
[03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:03.760]  the union. And ever since the Civil War in particular, there's been a series of statutes that
[03:08:03.760 --> 03:08:07.760]  give the president the authority to even use the armed forces for those purposes. I wouldn't want
[03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:11.600]  to see them use internally. I think it's actually unconstitutional to use the army internally.
[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:16.320]  Posse comatose. Yeah, it's the militia. That's just the Posse comatose, the U.S. Constitution.
[03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:20.480]  It's the militia that's tasked with suppressing insurrections. It should be like civil defense,
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:23.920]  this militia. Well, no, suppressing insurrections, executing the laws of the union. There should
[03:08:23.920 --> 03:08:28.880]  be no FBI, frankly. It should be the militia who execute the laws of the union under the
[03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:32.640]  command of the president. As Dr. Evan Vieira has pointed out many times in a series of books,
[03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:37.280]  recommend them. Oh, we need a professionals. What, like the FBI? No, exactly. Look at the
[03:08:37.280 --> 03:08:42.160]  corrupt they are. I mean, point tell pro back in the day. You can go back to what they did.
[03:08:42.160 --> 03:08:45.520]  And people never get that. So who commands the constitutional militia? It's not just
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:49.520]  like it's random, you know, every man's in it, but it's picked, it's selected.
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:54.240]  Well, no, it's the governors of the state command the militias unless they're called into
[03:08:54.240 --> 03:08:58.000]  federal service and they're called into federal service for only three legitimate purposes.
[03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:03.040]  One is to suppress insurrections and call forth by the president of the United States.
[03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:06.560]  Two, to execute the laws of the union. And the third is to repel invasions.
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:09.840]  They can also use the standing army and Marine Corps to repel invasions. Of course,
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:12.720]  that's what that's what a Marine Corps, that's what the Army Marine Corps for
[03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:15.760]  and the US Navy and Air Force, you can repel invasions using the military.
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:19.600]  Therefore, what's happening now? Right on the border. So you could use all of those.
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:23.200]  You could use the Army and Marine Corps Air Force, you know, the standing military,
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:25.200]  and you could also use the National Guard, which is.
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:28.880]  I just want to explain that in the classical thing, 18 to 45 or whatever.
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:32.880]  Under the under the governors, it's almost like the state guard. It's former police military
[03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:37.120]  or people that are vetted. I get every able-bodied man's in it. But obviously nowadays,
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:40.000]  able-bodied men don't want to be involved. We're not just going to randomly grab some
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:44.080]  out the street and hand him a machine gun. Well, the president could call up every able-bodied,
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:49.360]  still in federal statutes, every able-bodied male between 18 and 45 is in the militia.
[03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:53.760]  There's also a statute that says for military veterans up to age 65,
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:56.640]  I think we called it by the President of the United States. So even though the states have
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:00.640]  not formed militias, which they should, the president can call us up as the militia.
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:05.120]  And there should be militias for firefighting and floods. It's for any crisis.
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:08.160]  Sure. Well, yeah, just like the National Guard does disaster relief, the militia would do this.
[03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:11.520]  Well, I was in the civil air patrol. Right. And, you know, we were flying around doing drills
[03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:14.720]  when I was a kid looking for submarines in old Mexico. It didn't mean we're all paranoid.
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:18.080]  I think that's just what you do. Sure. And you still, in this state here,
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:21.520]  you still have your National Guard, which is your remnant of the militia,
[03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:26.240]  but you also have your state defense force. The Texas State Guard is a state defense force that
[03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:30.560]  cannot be called into federal service and sent overseas, which is good. So what government
[03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:36.400]  Abbott could do and should do is fill that with patriotic Texans and train the Texans.
[03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:40.960]  And that's with prior military service. What we should do is take the responsibility of training
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:46.000]  our fellow veterans, our fellow citizens here in Texas, for example, and make sure you train them
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:49.840]  all up. So they're a train pool of people, preferably under the command of the governor
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:55.360]  formally in the Texas State Guard. But then Trump could call them up and the crisis, the governor's
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:11:00.800]  line up on the president. Sure. So you now have a bill in front of your legislature in Texas to
[03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:05.120]  build the wall. Yeah, let's talk about that. Absolutely. Here is two Texas lawmakers call
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:10.480]  for $2.5 billion state funds for the border at Houston Chronicle. And that's a brilliant solution
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:15.120]  because that gets right around if the president does sign this monstrosity of a funding bill,
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:18.960]  which I think he should not. If he does, there's provisions in there that allow
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:22.720]  border counties to say no to a wall, which is ludicrous, but they're all controlled by the
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:28.400]  cartels and controlled by their Democratic allies. So what the governor of Texas is going to do,
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:32.320]  hopefully, is sign this bill, which would give Texas the authority to go down there and use
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:37.680]  eminent domain and pay the landowners for the taking of their property, build the wall under
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:42.480]  Texas statutes. The federal government can't touch it. The future Democratic president can't tear
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:47.040]  it back down. That's exactly what should happen because Texas has, what, at least half the border
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:51.760]  is in Texas. So you take care of that. God bless Texas. You guys fix it. And you should call up
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:59.600]  every Texan to step up like in the Alamo and go and serve as a Texas State Guard and go and patrol
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:03.520]  that wall. Oh, I guarantee you the governor called for that. He'd get 100,000 volunteers in a month.
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:07.840]  He should. We asked him to do that several years ago when he was first elected. We tried to reach
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:12.080]  him. His staff played, played blockage with him. So we hope that he'll hear the message
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:16.000]  and go ahead and call up Texans. All of the calls, Stuart Rhodes,
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:20.880]  Oathkeepers, but it's clear that the UN is running this and trying to break our border.
[03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:25.360]  They didn't want the number of beds to take care of anything. They don't want judges. They want it
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:31.840]  broken. Oh, absolutely. They want this. This is a, this is Cloward Piven on a global scale
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:36.560]  to destroy Western civilization. And I know Matt Bracken has been talking about this for years
[03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:41.040]  and he's been a complete spot on. That's what's happening in Europe. It's been, we already see
[03:12:41.040 --> 03:12:44.480]  where we're going. What's happened to Europe is not happening in the United States. They're using
[03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:49.280]  the central and South American countries. They admit it's the plan. Yeah. That's what's
[03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:54.240]  so frustrating is this is all admit it. People like, Oh, Alex Jones or Stuart Rhodes, it's admitted.
[03:12:54.240 --> 03:13:00.160]  Well, so I'm glad court, what's the name? AOC Cortez. I'm glad she's coming out and saying,
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:04.160]  we shouldn't even have a border because every Hispanic, anybody with Latino blood has a right
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:07.760]  to be here because it's indigenous territory. I'm glad she's saying that because she's now
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:13.040]  making it very clear. This is what she wants to do. She is a La Raza. She's a La Raza fanatic.
[03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:17.760]  She's a communist fanatic who happens to come from, from, from New York. Doesn't she look like
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:22.880]  she's on methamphetamine too? Well, I think she's a radical Marxist and, and you know,
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:26.640]  that means her, she's batshit, you know, crazy. So, but that's, that's from her Marxism.
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:32.240]  She hates this country and she's been indoctrinated. But I love how she wears like $5,000 outfits.
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:37.120]  What is it about leftists? They're always like in luxury multi-million dollar apartments,
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:43.440]  they're wearing $5,000 outfits. Well, they see themselves as the vanguard of, of the revolution,
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:48.080]  right? So the vanguard always gets the best. They always get the caviar and the, and the Mercedes and,
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:51.200]  you know, the limousine liberals. So as long as they're in charge, it's okay.
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:58.720]  Man, these people are sick. We got Eustace. And then we've got so many other callers.
[03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:00.880]  Eustace in Missouri, you're on the air with Stuart Rhodes. Go ahead.
[03:14:01.440 --> 03:14:04.320]  How's it going, Stuart? Alex, thank you for fighting, man.
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:11.440]  Years ago, Stuart, I put you in touch with Kevin Vanio up there to help Ren in Montana.
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:18.160]  And the FBI does need to be dismantled and there's a good website. You could just Google,
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:23.360]  I hate the FBI. But the reason I'm calling is I attended a speech last night from a gentleman
[03:14:23.360 --> 03:14:29.440]  that was a 31 year CIA agent. And he spoke at the College of the Ozarks here in Missouri,
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:35.440]  and I recorded it. And he tells them that they asked him about Snowden. He said Snowden's a
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:40.240]  traitor. He asked him about the investigation on Trump. And he told the young kids that they
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:45.680]  should continue to investigate Trump till they get to the bottom of it. He said Putin is a killer.
[03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:52.240]  And he told him how great it is to lie and that the CIA has a faith. And I would suggest everyone
[03:14:52.240 --> 03:14:59.840]  go listen to it. It's at Lone Star 1776. And they also advocate for the so-called domestic terrorist
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:03.360]  Francis Schaefer Cox. And he's up for re-sentencing and we're calling for a trial.
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:06.960]  Well, let's be clear. These politicians in the CIA, the CIA is a big organization.
[03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:11.280]  They're just globalist operatives that have used the National Security Act to pick the country over.
[03:15:11.280 --> 03:15:14.800]  But yeah, they've got the CIA domestically involved now. They've legalized that eight years ago.
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:22.800]  Obama did. And they don't need to defend the CIA. They're not CIA. They're globalist collaborators
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:28.080]  in U.S. intelligence agencies all over the country preaching this anti-Americanism.
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:29.840]  And they're very dangerous. Want to say something about that, Stuart?
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:35.840]  Uh, no. It's no surprise. I mean, look, the CIA has been part of the deep state since its inception.
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:38.960]  That's the problem. This is what Eisenhower warned about. It's part of the military industrial
[03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:43.120]  complex that came after World War II. And he didn't like them because he was just totally,
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:46.640]  he was just doing what they wanted. I mean, it's like, you're under Congress' control.

[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:37.120]  here that you have to talk about the operating system of the Democrats, who they are, why they're
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:43.280]  so crazy, why they hate the country, what powers them, how they go on television and celebrate
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:48.880]  killing babies after they're born, why they say America was never great. They run the country
[03:20:49.920 --> 03:20:55.680]  but why do they have an existential hatred? Well, Matt Bracken, Stuart Rhodes, quick question for
[03:20:55.680 --> 03:21:00.720]  both of you and we'll go back to calls and we can talk to the callers. Matt Bracken, enemies
[03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:06.160]  far and domestic.com. You're with oathkeepers.org or with info wars.com. And remember folks,
[03:21:06.160 --> 03:21:09.440]  only your word of mouth gets those websites out now. The total citizenship's here. So your word
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:14.400]  of mouth is what Trump's with the enemies doing. So please remember that. Why? What is the Democrat?
[03:21:14.400 --> 03:21:19.440]  What is the globalist operating system, Matt Bracken? And why? I'll put words in your mouth.
[03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:24.320]  I think you agree. Do they have such existential hatred for the West? Is it the Christian ethos?
[03:21:24.320 --> 03:21:32.800]  What is it? Yeah, definitely. They say that they're atheists but they're actually very religious.
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:38.400]  They're hyper-religious in the same way that Islamists believe in forcing the Koran.
[03:21:39.040 --> 03:21:47.440]  They believe in Marxism. And part of Marxism is just like with Islam. They have socialist
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:54.480]  taquia where because the ends justify the means, including pogroms in Russia or China or Cambodia,
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:22:00.640]  it certainly means that if they're willing to hurt people in Gulag and machine guns on them,
[03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:07.360]  they're certainly willing to lie to our faces. The great reporter so-called,
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:13.520]  who was considered the most trusted man in America, he was Walter Cronkite. He didn't
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:18.960]  until he retired from television did he admit he was a leader of the World Federalist Society.
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:24.640]  He hid that. He pretended to be a patriot. He was there for all the rocket launches,
[03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:29.440]  but he was all the while acting like a termite. He was the guy that said in 68,
[03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:33.520]  Tet proves we've lost in Vietnam when it was actually a wipeout of the Viet Cong.
[03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:40.720]  But he was all the way a termite hiding it, pretending to be a patriot, while secretly
[03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:46.240]  his religion really was globalism. And he didn't reveal this until much later.
[03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:51.920]  And I would expect on their deathbeds, there are many acting, serving generals, senators, etc.
[03:22:51.920 --> 03:22:56.800]  that say, yeah, I gotta pretend to be an American, but I'm a globalist. I'm a global,
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:22:59.600]  secular status. I worship the state.
[03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:02.960]  Yeah, that's it. So how did they do is justified.
[03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:06.640]  How did they then, how did Trump get in then? Because he definitely is making it mad. And
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:10.880]  he's not perfect, but he's trying to be the president. I think that's what makes him mad.
[03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:15.200]  Hey, what makes the leftist tick? What makes the globalist tick? And then how is Trump the wild
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:22.160]  carter? How does Trump fit in? Well, as Matt Bracken said, they're devout Marxist. And they do
[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:28.640]  see it as a multi-generational commitment. That's why they're willing to play the long game.
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:33.840]  And they did the long march through the institutions. This started way back in the late 1800s.
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:37.680]  And they did that. They successfully took over academia, the legal system.
[03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:41.760]  But they're rich and are always tax exempt and fly around in helicopters.
[03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:49.360]  Sure. But ultimately, they believe, and to them it's not a conflict. The Vanguard always,
[03:23:49.360 --> 03:23:54.720]  like in Soviet Union, people at the very top in the party had the villas on the Black Sea,
[03:23:54.720 --> 03:23:58.960]  had their mistresses, the best-looking women. They had all the eight caviar, etc.
[03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:02.480]  So it's like Orwell said. That's why he wrote what he wrote in the Animal Farm,
[03:24:02.480 --> 03:24:05.280]  that all animals are pretty equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
[03:24:05.280 --> 03:24:07.360]  He'd been a communist and believed it till he got into it.
[03:24:07.360 --> 03:24:11.760]  He saw what happened in the Soviet Union. This is why he wrote. Those are all warnings.
[03:24:11.760 --> 03:24:16.240]  Of course, the modern left takes those as playbooks. That's why you have face crime
[03:24:16.240 --> 03:24:20.000]  and hat crime. You wear a maggot hat. That's hat crime. That's what he missed.
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:24.080]  But we talked about face crime. The wrong expression on your face could get you punished.
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:28.320]  That's where we are now in this country. So these people are just calling what they are.
[03:24:28.320 --> 03:24:33.680]  They are Marxist ideologues and Marxist religious zealots. That is the religion.
[03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:37.520]  And that's why, like I was at Yale Law School, one of my fellow students was a
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:44.160]  community organizer from New York and a union activist. And she said that the excesses of
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:48.640]  Stalin were our fault. Because the United States intervened and supported the white
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:53.360]  Russians against the regime. That that is why we had Stalin. So no matter what happens,
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:58.240]  they'll never admit that communism itself is demonic and flawed. They'll always say,
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:02.080]  it's the wrong. People were in charge. Once we've extinguished capitalism.
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:06.240]  Yeah. It was records from the capitalists who went in there and screwed up the revolution.
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:10.640]  So Matt, now that what we talked about a year ago is confirmed, the attempted coup
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:15.600]  of 25th Amendment against the president, Stalin, Fox News, CNN. CNN thinks it's a great idea.
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:21.440]  Where do we go from here knowing there's a fifth column that hasn't been prosecuted?
[03:25:21.440 --> 03:25:27.040]  I'm glad the president declared an emergency, but it's a dereliction of duty if Whitaker or this
[03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:30.320]  new deep state attorney general doesn't start indicting these people.
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:37.120]  Yeah. If William Barr turns out to be just another guy like Mueller Rosenstein McCabe,
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:43.520]  I mean, he goes back to the same CIA origins. He's one of these blue ribbon commission guys.
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:51.200]  You can count on to cover up like a, you know, a TWA 800 or Waco or Ruby Ridge. He's one of those
[03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:57.040]  guys that has the patina of sincere objectivity and, you know, professionalism. But really,
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:02.320]  I think to the bone, he's a deep state operative. And that'll be a big tell right there. If all of
[03:26:02.320 --> 03:26:07.760]  this gets swept under the rug, we'll know. But going back to why did Trump get elected?
[03:26:07.760 --> 03:26:13.040]  It's because he did promise to build the wall. And at a gut level, at a litmus test,
[03:26:13.040 --> 03:26:19.280]  AB level, people understand the globalists, the Democrats, they want to flood the country,
[03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:28.240]  clowered Piven and the entire country and turn every state into Kalazuela. And Americans get it.
[03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:35.840]  And the Democrats, I think, are set up for a wipeout in 2020. I hope if we can pin open borders
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:41.520]  and population replacement. I agree with you. I think Peter Schiff's wrong. I think their rage has
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:47.200]  made them be precipitous, be honest with who they are. And all their horrible frame ups and the
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:51.840]  Covington kids and everything. I think if we just hold the line and get more aggressive
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:57.120]  in the info war, I think we win. But Trump has got to, I mean, he should have someone like
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:27:01.280]  Evan Vieira as attorney general. He should go pick a real patriot who has proven.
[03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:04.320]  Yeah, what does he think going and getting establishment people does?
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:11.120]  Nothing. I mean, he's been convinced and Barra is going to, he'll advocate for a red flag. If Trump
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:16.160]  signs a red flag law, a national red flag law, his goose is cooked because gunners across the
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:20.880]  country will stay home and will not vote for him. And so he's being set up, I think, to be pushed
[03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:28.640]  to push through a red flag law. And when he does that, at least 10% of his base agree 100% red flags
[03:27:28.640 --> 03:27:35.120]  are going to be a red line because you can imagine a red flag. Matt, some losers might not want a
[03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:40.080]  red flag. Well, where they'll, they'll say that, you know, you shouldn't have a firearm in your
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:44.320]  house because somebody has a domestic violence warning against you, something like that,
[03:27:44.320 --> 03:27:50.720]  which is boilerplate for lawyers in a, in a, in a 90% of the voices they tell the
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:55.040]  wife, get a restraining order. Well, this is worse. Right. This is taking that same problem
[03:27:55.040 --> 03:27:59.440]  and making it so that your local police chief or your corrupt local official or someone doesn't
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:03.680]  like you and local activists and like your bumper sticker can call the cops and say that
[03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:07.520]  you're a threat and you'll never even know it until the cops come to your door because there's
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:12.560]  an ex parte hearing, which means you're not there. You have no, no, no opportunity to confront your
[03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:16.640]  accusers, no evidence on your behalf. So they have a star chamber event. This is what Bloomberg's
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:20.880]  pushing. They just take your guns. Right. And you already had a death in Maryland. A man got
[03:28:20.880 --> 03:28:24.880]  an argument with his adult sister who doesn't even live with him, not even a domestic violence
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:29.360]  situation. She called the cops on him. They came to his door because he went for his gun. They
[03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:36.080]  killed him. But why were they there in the first place? All right, we're going to take some phone
[03:28:36.080 --> 03:28:42.720]  calls. I promise one after the other. We'll come back in a few minutes. We're going to go to Nicky

[03:31:54.400 --> 03:32:00.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in
[03:32:00.240 --> 03:32:05.520]  Lailania states, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[03:32:05.520 --> 03:32:12.640]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[03:32:12.640 --> 03:32:19.440]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
[03:32:19.440 --> 03:32:24.800]  alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:31.280]  metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[03:32:31.280 --> 03:32:37.120]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[03:32:37.120 --> 03:32:43.760]  optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water,
[03:32:43.760 --> 03:32:49.360]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.360 --> 03:32:53.520]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:53.520 --> 03:33:04.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:23.520 --> 03:33:38.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from Austin, Texas,
[03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:46.480]  broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. All right, Matt Bracken is here with us. I'm Alex Jones,
[03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:50.240]  comment during the sour Matt knows that he appreciates it. We appreciate him doing a great job.
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:55.520]  We've got Stuart Rose. O keepers here with us enemies for domestic.com. O keepers.org Matt
[03:33:55.520 --> 03:34:01.280]  Bracken's here. And we have an active shooter in Chicago. We're getting the details right now.
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:07.600]  Aurora police respond active shooter report at manufacturing company at Chicago NBC five will
[03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:11.120]  be covering it as an unfolds. You guys are having some great discussions during the break. We got
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:17.200]  to go to calls. These are great folks. You're also making fantastic points. We're not here dreaming
[03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:23.360]  of civil war or martial law or civil unrest. Europe and the US is being put into this by
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:29.440]  the globalists. Their own admissions prove it. And so we have to realize the moment we're in
[03:34:30.320 --> 03:34:34.560]  and the globalists are panicking because even in their skewed polls, Trump is gaining support
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:40.400]  and capitalism is gaining support Matt Bracken and Stuart. So what would you call Stuart and
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:44.320]  then Matt Bracken were going to calls the historic point we're in right now? I think we're
[03:34:44.320 --> 03:34:50.160]  in the middle of an insurrection against the Constitution. I think the left are domestic
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:54.400]  enemies of the Constitution. They're Marxist enemies of the Constitution and they're this is
[03:34:54.400 --> 03:35:00.000]  their end game to I mean, but you're not just saying that you're your constitutional lawyer,
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:05.600]  you're a veteran, you're a smart guy. People who aren't evil look at a thing happening and can't
[03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:10.480]  believe it because they judge it by their own morals. Historically, we have trader collaborators
[03:35:10.480 --> 03:35:15.360]  working with multinationals and the chai comms in Hollywood to collapse and conquer and vertically
[03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:20.560]  integrate the nation. I mean, that's, that's what it is. We are under globalist attack with
[03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:28.160]  insurrection traders Matt Bracken. Yeah, absolutely. What Stuart said is correct. And it's time now
[03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:36.160]  to blow past the smoke of socialist Takia. Remember, they lie just like Islamists will say,
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:42.000]  no, no, we're not trying to bring Sharia. They lie. So we have to judge them by their actions
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:47.600]  and their results. If a guy just is pretending to be an open borders, fatally altruistic,
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:52.240]  you know, do-gooder that thinks that bringing in, you know, 10,000 more Somalis to Maine or
[03:35:52.240 --> 03:35:58.400]  Minnesota, we can't accept that and go, well, he's misguided, but and stupid and destructive.
[03:35:58.400 --> 03:36:03.440]  But he has good intentions. We've got to blow past their lies and face fake.
[03:36:03.440 --> 03:36:07.120]  And realize they're following a program. I used to listen to you years ago, even before you were
[03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:11.920]  on and you would break down what they would do. This new Somali congresswoman we've got.
[03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:16.480]  I watched like a 30 minute interview she did a few years ago and she starts out saying, oh,
[03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:22.160]  radical Islam, Boko Haram isn't good. And by the end of it, she's defending attacks on the
[03:36:23.680 --> 03:36:30.800]  Kenyan shopping malls. And I shat there and literally had a visceral, not responsive hatred.
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:36.080]  My gut was, this is an enemy. Why is she even here? I couldn't help it. I was,
[03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:41.440]  I don't know how to describe it. It's beyond rage. It's beyond, it's like, I'm feeling bad
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:47.120]  that she's, that I'm, I mean, she's literally gloating over dead people at a shopping mall
[03:36:47.120 --> 03:36:53.200]  in Africa. Yeah. Sometimes they're masked real quick point. Sometimes they're masked slips.
[03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:58.320]  And right now, since winning the midterms, they're overconfident. And this, like the green,
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:03.840]  the green new deal and wide open borders, you know, reception centers for the entire world to
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:09.040]  come in, their mask is slipping and the American people are going to see it for what it is, I hope.
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:15.840]  Yeah. We're going to phone calls right now, but I mean, we cannot stress how insane this is.
[03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:18.400]  Let me ask you all a 10 second question and we're going to go to calls.
[03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:25.200]  Is the free society turned the corner? Are we winning or are we just fighting for our lives?
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:28.640]  I mean, I think at a gut level, it's like we're awake now shows we're starting to win. It doesn't
[03:37:28.640 --> 03:37:33.760]  mean we've won the war, but I think we're on the right foot. We're in the middle of it.
[03:37:33.760 --> 03:37:38.080]  It's an open window that can go either way. As you pointed out before, this is an open window
[03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:42.400]  that can go either way. We have to push and make sure we don't get complacent or apathetic.
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:49.280]  We got to keep pushing on our side. I think Trump is a reprieve. I think Trump is a reprieve.
[03:37:49.280 --> 03:37:56.400]  He's not an antidote and he's bought us time. It's sort of like after Czechoslovakia before Poland
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:01.440]  and leading up to the Second World War. We're in that period. We bought some time, you know,
[03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:06.320]  a Dunkirk, but we're still leading towards a civil war because the Bolsheviks, the Communists,
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:11.680]  the Socialists, Demsox, they would push us straight to the USSR if they had the power.
[03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:15.600]  The reason they can't is the Second Amendment. Let me ask you about what he knows. We don't want
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:19.520]  him to stay exactly where you're going. I don't want any violence. I'm not calling for it, but
[03:38:20.160 --> 03:38:24.480]  not a false flag to make him be victims, but a real bloody nose. I don't think they even have
[03:38:24.480 --> 03:38:31.280]  any sense in them. I don't think they're being dropped out of helicopters into the Atlantic
[03:38:31.280 --> 03:38:40.320]  Ocean. I don't think they're going to wake up. The way I put it is those who know what it means
[03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:48.240]  to zero a rifle should not instigate a civil war with those who do and have. I mean, they literally
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:54.640]  are in a green dream, utopian fantasy, and they're going against people who have studied
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:39:00.720]  communist revolution to the to the nth degree and understand every phase that's coming out towards
[03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:06.080]  us. So it's an irresistible force going to meet an immovable object. It's going to be like the
[03:39:06.080 --> 03:39:11.920]  tsunami hit the seawall. Exactly. That's the bottom line is we have globalist funded. We're in the
[03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:19.600]  middle of a Marxist revolution. Right. But one potential silver lining is the walkaway movement.
[03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:24.720]  As you said earlier, increasingly blacks and Hispanics, like when I was at that rally in El Paso,
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:29.440]  about a quarter of the audience were Hispanic patriots. And so there are Americans who are
[03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:34.000]  waking up and so we can't throw them, you know, maybe out of the bathwater. The died in the wall
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  and zealot leader can't be reformed. You're going to change your mind with the bullet.
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:44.880]  But the their followers a lot of times can be reached because they're going so crazy because
[03:39:44.880 --> 03:39:48.640]  they're like you got you got you have what's her name, the one from Minnesota you're just talking
[03:39:48.640 --> 03:39:55.360]  about. Oh my gosh. She's saying that she wants Ellison now to investigate the powerlifting community
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:40:00.480]  because they're not because they're protesting against men who have been transgender males.
[03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:05.280]  But but you know, they're actually chromosome males competing against women and she wants to
[03:40:05.280 --> 03:40:10.960]  make that a crime. She wants to fuss if there is a lot of gays are killed. Right. So in the
[03:40:10.960 --> 03:40:14.560]  countries where she champions there, they're turned to blind out of their abuse of people's
[03:40:14.560 --> 03:40:21.280]  rights, a transgender male be killed. Exactly. And yet here she's trying to go ahead. Yeah,
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:26.800]  eventually their cognitive dissonance will cause the pot to boil over. You know, the identity
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:33.920]  politics, which is totally sexual. Eventually it explodes. It can only hold together while they
[03:40:33.920 --> 03:40:38.080]  have the glue of political correctness to tamp down any kind of and I think you said that we're not
[03:40:38.080 --> 03:40:42.800]  calling for violence. I just think it's critical if they kick things off, cut the head off the
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:47.200]  same. And I think that's the point is their leadership is decapitated. They fade away very
[03:40:47.200 --> 03:40:51.440]  quickly. I think the global's are going to find with us decapitating leadership. I don't think
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:56.720]  they should do anything. No. And the president can right now suppress the insurrection in California
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:01.760]  and in all of the sanctuary cities by prosecuting them for violations of federal law. And that
[03:41:01.760 --> 03:41:05.920]  wouldn't be martial law, which is not constitutional. That'd be executing the laws of the union.
[03:41:05.920 --> 03:41:12.720]  I agree. But does the establishment understand that patriots or high IQ have an operating system
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:17.360]  based on the Western civilization? You don't cut heads off snakes with us. No. In fact,
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:21.840]  that triggers a response. But the left, these are literally zombies who don't have their own
[03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:28.800]  operating system. Yeah. You get your private Murphy will step up and take over. Okay. So it
[03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:32.960]  doesn't make a difference. You'll find out that private Murphy is way more talented
[03:41:32.960 --> 03:41:39.120]  than Captain Rupert Poindexter. Exactly. Yeah. Let's take a quick call. Private Murphy steps up,
[03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:43.920]  then should happen. Really? Audie Murphy comes out of the ground. You know?
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:46.800]  Donald and Marilyn, you're on the air. Donald, go ahead.
[03:41:48.960 --> 03:41:55.520]  What's up taking the knee today? The nasty Pelosi and Chuck Puma and making this concession speech
[03:41:55.520 --> 03:42:00.640]  and green is the new red, where they let all the muscles in with the, uh, to take over the
[03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:06.080]  United States and people fell down. Trump, he just flopped for everybody.
[03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:11.600]  I think what you're saying, Donald, is we're seeing open treason and
[03:42:11.600 --> 03:42:16.560]  I'm surprised Trump isn't being carried on people's shoulders. You know, I actually call him
[03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:21.040]  watermelons fears back because he's right. Green is the new red, the green on the outside and the
[03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:26.480]  red on the inside. It's the new technique along with the Danny politics. Just the next way to
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:31.200]  try to convince people. Donald, anything else? Chuck Puma, we thought you said about Chuck taking
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:38.000]  a knee, making that concession speech and turning it as hard. And he said that it was a bad deal
[03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:45.600]  with Obama that he signed with Iraq and with, um, uh, Canada and Mexico. The deal he signed today
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:50.720]  is worse. No, I hear you. This new thing Trump's signing on to. Let's talk about that when we come
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:43:06.480]  back. Thanks, Donald. More calls right ahead. By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling

[03:46:41.040 --> 03:46:50.080]  in public. Hashtag Alex Jones. That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:46:50.080 --> 03:47:05.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:20.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:21.280 --> 03:47:26.480]  Hi. Four cops have been shot and reportedly are fighting for their lives, along with citizens
[03:47:26.480 --> 03:47:31.600]  in Chicago and Aurora. We'll be following that on the war room coming up three o'clock
[03:47:31.600 --> 03:47:36.160]  central though in Shroyer and others. I said I'd go to your calls. I'm being a bad person,
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:40.320]  not getting to them. So I'm going to go to them right now. Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:44.320]  George and then Nikki and others. George in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:48.800]  How's it going, Alex? It's good to talk to you again.
[03:47:48.800 --> 03:47:55.840]  Good talk to you. Man, it was about time that Trump would call it a national emergency.
[03:47:55.840 --> 03:48:02.320]  Like I've been talking to you about it most of the time where we have a problem with the
[03:48:02.320 --> 03:48:07.280]  legal kind of drugs and everything. Yeah, this country is an emergency.
[03:48:08.640 --> 03:48:14.160]  And what I find most incredible is the fact that we also have a homeless problem, but people
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:20.560]  are rather take care of the immigrants and the people who they serve the country and are now
[03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:26.720]  homeless trying to get food and trying to get help. You know, that's a great point and I appreciate
[03:48:26.720 --> 03:48:33.440]  your call. Matt Bracken and, of course, Stuart Rhodes, why is the homeless population, they admit
[03:48:33.440 --> 03:48:39.440]  ballooning, especially in blue cities? Well, it's just the poverty that that has been caused
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:44.080]  in the cities in particular by the Democrat policies, you know, and they don't really care
[03:48:44.080 --> 03:48:48.320]  about those people. That's the problem. They've gotten, they've used them up and gotten what
[03:48:48.320 --> 03:48:54.320]  they want out of them. And so now their focus is on new voters, period. And these people don't
[03:48:54.320 --> 03:48:59.360]  have families most of the time. It's mental illness. It's it's what do you think's happening, Matt?
[03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:06.320]  Well, I think that the Kalazuel, a model, is proving to be a resounding success for the
[03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:12.240]  Demsox. And they would like to see that repeated in every state. They don't care if there's needles
[03:49:12.240 --> 03:49:16.560]  and feces on the sidewalks. If there's homeless camps, you know, when right around the corner
[03:49:16.560 --> 03:49:23.600]  from Rodeo Drive, as long as they're in power, they are happy to rule the ruins. So importing
[03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:28.720]  masses of foreign illiterates that will vote Democrat for welfare, that's what we have to
[03:49:28.720 --> 03:49:34.160]  expose. That's the big litmus test going forward. The people that are for open borders are for
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:40.400]  replacing Americans with welfare voters, period. And again, we're not helping these people when
[03:49:40.400 --> 03:49:44.160]  we bring them here. It was about a year and a half ago. I don't get to hike a lot, but
[03:49:44.160 --> 03:49:49.920]  I was on Barton Creek in a wealthy area of Austin, a few miles from my house.
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:55.120]  And I've learned to recognize Central Americans versus, you know, different groups. And then
[03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:59.840]  they were Guatemalans. And I asked, you Guatemalan, they said, yeah, there was a Guatemalan family
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:08.000]  of like a middle-aged man, his wife, and four or five kids. And they had coke cans with strings
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:15.040]  on them, catching bass out of Barton Creek. And they had a fire going. And now I go where I've
[03:50:15.040 --> 03:50:22.400]  been going for 25 years on the green belt, and there's shanty towns up in the hills. And there's
[03:50:22.400 --> 03:50:27.520]  like Guatemalans and stuff. And there's Guatemalans right down the street from here. I mean, it's like,
[03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:32.720]  what is, I mean, I'm not even against these people. I'm not, but how did we like end up with
[03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:38.560]  Guatemalan shanty towns and people eating out of the creek? I mean, what is going on?
[03:50:38.560 --> 03:50:44.400]  Same way you ended up with Somalia being transplanted to Minneapolis.
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:45.440]  Oh, they've totally done it.
[03:50:45.440 --> 03:50:48.640]  Right. So it's the same model. And it's not helping them. I mean,
[03:50:48.640 --> 03:50:52.720]  they've destabilized, the globalist destabilized entire regions of the world
[03:50:52.720 --> 03:50:58.640]  and then cause a, you know, dysphoria into the West. And that's meant to swamp the West
[03:50:58.640 --> 03:51:02.720]  at a greater rate that can be assimilated and kill the co-examination.
[03:51:02.720 --> 03:51:06.240]  These were, I had to respect the family. I wasn't like, I couldn't even videotape it.
[03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:10.960]  I was so like, they were like, you know, had the little woven hats and they were like almost in Mayan
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:16.560]  attire. You know, it's almost like Peruvian. Yeah. And I was like, I was like, you Guatemalan,
[03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:20.480]  yes. And you know, Guatemalan, like you live here in the Barton Creek.
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:26.560]  Yeah. And I have compassion for them. I really do. But we need to bring people.
[03:51:26.560 --> 03:51:31.440]  But I mean, I'm going to be searched by the TSA when I fly. I'm under all the surveillance
[03:51:31.440 --> 03:51:34.240]  and there's Guatemalans living in Austin on the side of the creek.
[03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:37.920]  Right. And they're being, they're being used as a weapon. And you know, that's the problem is that
[03:51:38.640 --> 03:51:42.400]  even the innocent ones who are coming here for just for a better life and actually love this
[03:51:42.400 --> 03:51:47.520]  country are being used as a weapon against us as well. But, but they're being conditioned to not
[03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:50.720]  assimilate along with that. I mean, it's just twilight zone. And they're like, oh, take your
[03:51:50.720 --> 03:51:54.320]  vaccines. And I mean, while they bring the illegals and then have the diseases, it's insane.
[03:51:54.320 --> 03:52:00.240]  George in California. Go ahead. Yeah. And the other point that I wanted to make is
[03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:05.920]  there is a good amount of people that bring a lot to the country. Don't get me wrong,
[03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:09.120]  because I'm not going to be a hypocrite. My parents were illegal immigrants,
[03:52:09.760 --> 03:52:14.640]  but they need to do what my parents did and assimilate. Consider this as learning the language,
[03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:20.320]  pay the taxes and be the voters and actually hear their voice out.
[03:52:20.320 --> 03:52:26.320]  So that's the point is we don't need the Democrats and the media in indoctrinating them
[03:52:26.320 --> 03:52:29.680]  into America hate when I get here. That's why it has to be stopped.
[03:52:30.400 --> 03:52:33.520]  Well, what's what's happening though, is that they're being brought here and they're being taught
[03:52:33.520 --> 03:52:37.680]  not to assimilate. I mean, I think it's, what's his name? Victor David Hanson has a pretty good
[03:52:37.680 --> 03:52:43.440]  book about this, about how he grew up in California, where the ethos was, you come here and assimilate,
[03:52:43.440 --> 03:52:48.080]  you become Americans like my relatives did, reminds my descendants or ancestors. I mean,
[03:52:48.080 --> 03:52:52.800]  they came here and they learn a language. My mom wouldn't even teach us Spanish,
[03:52:52.800 --> 03:52:56.240]  and everyone served in the military. And he became Americans and you, you know,
[03:52:56.240 --> 03:53:00.640]  slew the flag and the national anthem. Now they're being taught to fly the Mexican flag or even
[03:53:00.640 --> 03:53:04.400]  more is to fly the communist flag and they hate this country. And they're in the left.
[03:53:04.400 --> 03:53:08.160]  But it's obvious if you're going somewhere, because you think it's better, you become that
[03:53:08.160 --> 03:53:11.920]  and you add to it. You don't like how it used to be, but it's not obvious anymore.
[03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:16.320]  They're being told, you know, the columns on these caravans are flying the,
[03:53:16.320 --> 03:53:21.840]  you know, the Honduran flag or the Guatemalan flag. And they're being told by the leftist that,
[03:53:21.840 --> 03:53:26.080]  yes, you have a right to be here. As Cortez just said, you have a right to be here,
[03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:29.680]  because this is actually indigenous people's lands. That's straight out of the weather
[03:53:29.680 --> 03:53:34.800]  underground prairie fire. Straight out of victim ideology, liberation ideology.
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:40.640]  Yeah. And that's garbage because there were no Mexicans or anybody else that was pushed out of
[03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:50.880]  America after the Treaty of Guadalupe, Guadalupe. Yeah, that, that is a fiction. The Spanish
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:56.560]  citizens who lived in, you know, in the Southwest became Americans. There's nobody from Mexico.
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:03.520]  Mexico bagged the Scots and Irish and everybody out of Alabama and Tennessee down here because
[03:54:03.520 --> 03:54:08.800]  they couldn't beat the Comanche. And that's Texas. And then as soon as we wiped out the Comanche,
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:12.720]  then they moved in. They're like, oh, now that you've killed the Comanche that we're killing
[03:54:12.720 --> 03:54:17.040]  everybody, the Comanche were not nice folks. I got a little bit of Comanche in me. I'm not,
[03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:20.960]  I'm not ashamed of it. I'm not proud of it. The point is, is that was the real war that went on.
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:26.320]  Let's take another call here real quick. Max in Wisconsin. Max, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:34.080]  Hi, Stuart. Hi, Alex. Hi, Matt. I'm huge fans, huge fan, Stuart. I was wondering,
[03:54:34.080 --> 03:54:42.160]  I wanted to give you a little tip for 2020 election. I think you guys can be very effective in turning
[03:54:42.160 --> 03:54:51.280]  blue areas red in urban areas such as Milwaukee, Chicago. There is a huge population of African
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:57.600]  American and Slavic people who are very into the gun rights and are unaware of a gun grab
[03:54:57.600 --> 03:55:03.680]  occurring in front of them. For us, it's very in front of our face, but for the average TV people,
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:08.320]  it's not very. No, I agree. Pelosi's saying we'll use an emergency to take your guns.
[03:55:08.320 --> 03:55:12.320]  The House saying we have the votes to ban all semi-autos. I think we make guns the big issue
[03:55:12.320 --> 03:55:16.160]  because they are. Well, certainly. I mean, it's one of the big issues. The two biggest issues that
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:22.160]  got Donald Trump elected was borders and guns, borders, jobs and guns. Those are the three things
[03:55:22.160 --> 03:55:26.560]  people in this country care most about and their religious freedom, too. And again,
[03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:30.240]  it's like we're obsessed with guns. It's like we get like, I'm a good person. I'm a free person.
[03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:35.520]  I have a right to have a gun. You have a right in obligation and duty to defend your family and
[03:55:35.520 --> 03:55:40.400]  self-preservation, but also we understand that if we are disarmed, we'll go look at Venezuela right
[03:55:40.400 --> 03:55:45.680]  now, moving shot in the streets openly by the by the by the secret police. So we have a duty
[03:55:45.680 --> 03:55:51.760]  in France. In France, they're using these exploding projectiles and they're supposed to be fired at
[03:55:51.760 --> 03:55:57.440]  people's feet. They're blowing off hands and eyes with them. So that this is in disarmed France. I
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:01.920]  mean, in the United States, the police would never do that because there would be a different kind
[03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:07.120]  of return fire. Enemies, fire and domestic.com. Find his books there. Great job to everybody.
[03:56:07.120 --> 03:56:10.160]  The war room is about to start. Stuart Rhodes, you're welcome. Both of you guys are going there.
[03:56:10.960 --> 03:56:14.960]  If he wants to have you, I'm sure he wants to have you. Just a few minutes about to start with
[03:56:14.960 --> 03:56:21.440]  Owen Schroder. I'm out of time. I apologize. Lyle, Embry, Brad, James, Frank, Nicky and Nick,
