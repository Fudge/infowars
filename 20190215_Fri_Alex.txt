[00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.920]  We've got it.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.444]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.827]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:18.430]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:31.047]  You've got it.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.702]  Well, I told you back in October that Trump needed to declare an emergency.
[00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:56.724]  And I told you a month ago that I thought he was going to do it in the shutdown.
[00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:58.965]  That was what the word was.
[00:00:58.965 --> 00:00:59.765]  And now he's done it.
[00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:06.568]  Just minutes ago, we'll play that speech, parts of it here in a moment, and all of it here in the next hour.
[00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.388]  He just concluded.
[00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:12.570]  And then you've got ABC Empire actor staged attack.
[00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.533]  That's what police believe.
[00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:23.195]  He used two of his confederates that reportedly worked with him, other actors, and staged the attack.
[00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:25.115]  That's where this is all leading.
[00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.736]  And of course he staged the attack.
[00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:28.316]  Of course he did.
[00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:34.937]  I mean, I'm gonna say it again.
[00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.557]  99% of racial attacks are staged.
[00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:38.798]  I'm a newshound.
[00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.258]  It's all I do for 25 years, 24 years.
[00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:42.914]  And everybody knows that.
[00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:53.157]  And by the way, you'll hear about some white woman, you know, two black men raped her and carved honky in her back, and it turns out that's not true either.
[00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:56.318]  Most of these things are staged.
[00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:59.880]  Like, most firefighters are great people.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.722]  But in a lot of towns and cities, when they keep having arson, and they notice that it's done particularly well, they start investigating and surveilling firefighters.
[00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:11.083]  And about a third of the time, it's a firefighter.
[00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:28.570]  A good portion of the time, it's a minority of the time, but it's still a portion of it, when they keep finding pipe bombs on the side of the road and then the hero bomb squad guy keeps finding them and keeps, well they start following that guy and catch him doing it.
[00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.333]  I mean, it happens over and over and over again.
[00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:36.495]  But I'm the bad guy for questioning Sandy Hook.
[00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:46.380]  Because Hillary brought it up years after the internet had not believed it.
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.285]  Because people don't know what to believe anymore because so many times things are staged.
[00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:59.030]  Now some of the anomalies people raised about Hook turned out to not be accurate.
[00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.593]  And I looked at those parents on TV and what they were saying and it looked real.
[00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:11.718]  The minute, before I was ever sued or threatened with suit, the minute I said I thought it happened, it was lawsuit.
[00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:16.141]  Which shows very interesting psychology.
[00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:20.923]  And so if Sandy Hook didn't kill the second amendment, it's killing the first.
[00:03:20.923 --> 00:03:25.645]  I've talked to top lawyers that have been at the biggest events in the country.
[00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.147]  Some on record, some off record.
[00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:31.068]  And we had a lot of lawyers for the last two weeks deciding what I'm going to do.
[00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:31.708]  I'm going to sue.
[00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:32.629]  It's time to fight back.
[00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.953]  And they're at these big conferences and point blank, they go, oh, we're getting rid of the First Amendment for the general public.
[00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:46.616]  And it's going to be the Alex Jones doctrine, the Alex Jones statute.
[00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:47.716]  It's being called that.
[00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:51.638]  And they're getting all the lawyers together and they're saying, this is how it is.
[00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:58.081]  We're going to get rid of anybody who says fake news, just the media, corporate media will say it, and then you don't have First Amendment protections.
[00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:59.722]  But then the super class, they will.
[00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.492]  And there's big debates at the Texas Supreme Court, at the Texas bar, at the Connecticut bar, New York bar.
[00:04:08.492 --> 00:04:21.978]  Top debates are, this is going to end up getting everybody, and so now there's top-level meetings that are like, you need to drop these Sandy Hook lawsuits on Jones, because it's rigged.
[00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:28.181]  I mean, 100% railroad job right into shutting down InfoWars.
[00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:30.862]  In fact, the lawyers involved say that.
[00:04:30.862 --> 00:04:31.983]  They go, we're going to shut him down.
[00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:32.783]  That's what we're going to do.
[00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:34.704]  And then they misrepresent all the facts.
[00:04:34.704 --> 00:04:36.665]  It's crazy.
[00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:45.631]  But it's so evil and so diabolical and so un-American that there's been a big turn in the American Bar Association to highest levels.
[00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:51.394]  They're like, we're really going to get rid of due process and the First Amendment and this whole deal and crack down on media?
[00:04:51.394 --> 00:04:53.275]  I mean, America's going authoritarian.
[00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.116]  And I've been chosen as the test case.
[00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:55.657]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.657 --> 00:04:55.977]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:18.636]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:28.724]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:37.271]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:39.433]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:40.594]  You must experience it.
[00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:42.535]  It is a total game changer.
[00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:47.577]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.098]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.579]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:57.283]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:05:57.283 --> 00:05:58.764]  TurboForce at EnforcedLife.com.
[00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:17.599]  InfoWars.
[00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.184]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:23.849]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:29.057]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:59.291]  Well, President Trump just minutes ago declared a national emergency, taking back executive power from the usurper, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:05.835]  And ABC's Empire Star is very close to being criminally charged.
[00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:11.899]  They've already got who they believe were his accomplices in staging the event in a city like Chicago under total surveillance.
[00:07:12.984 --> 00:07:18.329]  Jesse Smollett staged attack.
[00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:19.250]  That's what the police believe.
[00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.994]  Well, of course he did.
[00:07:23.994 --> 00:07:26.296]  West Point.
[00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:29.579]  The Marine Corps.
[00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:34.163]  Training facilities.
[00:07:34.163 --> 00:07:35.485]  The Army training facilities.
[00:07:37.162 --> 00:07:46.945]  All of them have the exact same staged event in the barracks and at the vending machines, saying no N-words allowed.
[00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:54.488]  And it's all done under orders of the whole network of the Democratic Party.
[00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:58.609]  They are encouraged to do it.
[00:07:58.609 --> 00:08:03.711]  And now that they've demonized me in the news, I'm going to talk about this later, not because it's about me, because it's so illustrative.
[00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:19.383]  John Ronson, I've known 20 years, and who acts all nice and friendly, but then every time doesn't deliver on what he says he'll do.
[00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:20.223]  Super manipulative.
[00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:31.006]  When I told him, I said, I know you're manipulating people, but I'll go on your NPR show, because it does have 5 million listeners.
[00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:45.157]  And they have been camped out in Rockwall, Texas, where I'm from, I guess for months off and on, canvassing everybody.
[00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:58.767]  And then they get me on the interview that they're doing in a couple weeks and literally make up whole cloth stories.
[00:08:58.767 --> 00:08:59.587]  And guess what?
[00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:01.148]  I know Ronson learned the truth.
[00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:01.949]  I've got his text messages.
[00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:07.404]  I think I'm gonna make a mini-documentary out of this.
[00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:11.487]  He's like, oh, it's like Wild Wild West, pretty incredible stuff, pretty incredible stories.
[00:09:11.487 --> 00:09:13.488]  And I'm like, oh, so you did go talk to people.
[00:09:13.488 --> 00:09:16.010]  I'm not bragging, I don't live back in high school.
[00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:23.014]  Couldn't wait to get out of high school, I didn't particularly dislike it, I was just, I had college friends.
[00:09:23.014 --> 00:09:31.360]  I guess I'm already getting into the story, and Ronson was working on this theory that I was this loner, and unhappy, and that's why I'm this bad person,
[00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:35.576]  You know, like psychopaths, I guess, have bad, you know, upbringings or whatever.
[00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.816]  He's written a book about that.
[00:09:37.816 --> 00:09:44.338]  It's like, sociopaths are always trying to understand themselves.
[00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:46.579]  Then they project it on to you.
[00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:49.219]  And at the end of the interview, he goes, I know this has been traumatic.
[00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:50.280]  I apologize, Alex.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:58.202]  I, I know your, your childhood was traumatic and it's okay if you need to call me and you need to break down or anything.
[00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:02.181]  And I know they're going to edit it.
[00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:05.905]  So I recorded the whole thing.
[00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.146]  With video, audio, everything.
[00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:08.608]  And I told him that as well.
[00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:12.091]  I don't think he was listening.
[00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:13.352]  At the end I go, you know I recorded this.
[00:10:13.352 --> 00:10:15.014]  He goes, you did Alex.
[00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.356]  So I'm looking for that letter.
[00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:18.818]  I'm looking for the National Emergency and all the big news.
[00:10:20.618 --> 00:10:26.200]  It's just, I never do mainstream interviews, but I have this thing for people I've known a long time.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:33.181]  Emerson is a smart and interesting guy, but... Come on, Alex, you're such a powerful and important person.
[00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:35.362]  Please do the interview.
[00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:36.762]  It's very nice, the story.
[00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:39.803]  It's actually uplifting and wild, wild west.
[00:10:39.803 --> 00:10:43.284]  I mean, I've got all the text messages.
[00:10:43.284 --> 00:10:46.425]  And I'm like, dude, you're manipulating me, telling me I'm powerful and I'm important.
[00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:49.586]  I said, there's no way you're going to tell any of the real stories.
[00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:54.093]  Because they make me look like John Wayne.
[00:10:54.093 --> 00:10:57.775]  And my bragging is just, you know, it was a very rough high school.
[00:10:57.775 --> 00:10:59.236]  A lot of people started fights.
[00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:00.217]  And I was in hundreds of fights.
[00:11:00.217 --> 00:11:03.860]  People attacked me, growing certainly in fifth grade, hundreds of times.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:10.304]  Kids that were two or three grades, you know, out of school.
[00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:13.806]  Like I said, when I was in sixth grade, there were a lot of kids with mustaches.
[00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:14.967]  They'd go around and beat people up.
[00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:17.569]  The school would do nothing because they were minorities.
[00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:18.309]  That means God.
[00:11:19.642 --> 00:11:21.722]  And so the white kids all got to be beaten up.
[00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.583]  And see, that's why I'm the bad racist, you see.
[00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:30.044]  I'm the person that's been racially attacked, let's not exaggerate, a hundred times.
[00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:32.985]  And they didn't pick any of the racial attacks.
[00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:41.507]  They picked a fight with a, I guess the term would be redneck or roper.
[00:11:41.507 --> 00:11:46.088]  They picked one of those fights and then totally misrepresented what happened
[00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:51.953]  To make me the villain and then made up some other wild story.
[00:11:51.953 --> 00:12:05.618]  And the reason I bring this up is it's like being raped when these people pretend to be journalists and then they just completely make up whatever they want.
[00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:09.700]  Completely make up whatever they want.
[00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:11.874]  And they use props.
[00:12:11.874 --> 00:12:13.435]  People are like, well, Alex Jones is a villain.
[00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:14.975]  Alex Jones is a bad guy.
[00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:17.336]  So we'll say you wear swastika shoes.
[00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:18.456]  That was an EEOC complaint.
[00:12:18.456 --> 00:12:18.976]  No proof.
[00:12:18.976 --> 00:12:19.616]  Got dropped.
[00:12:19.616 --> 00:12:21.337]  Totally false.
[00:12:21.337 --> 00:12:26.418]  I mean, if you ever catch me wearing swastika shoes, that's when you need to shoot me.
[00:12:26.418 --> 00:12:28.158]  Hitler was a horrible loser.
[00:12:28.158 --> 00:12:29.899]  He destroyed Europe.
[00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:35.560]  He killed 20 million Germans, not to mention 27 million Russians and millions of Jews and people.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.561]  I mean, I'm just so sick of Hitler.
[00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:43.385]  And I'm sick of hearing I'm associated with Hitler.
[00:12:43.385 --> 00:12:48.086]  And I'm sick of all the racist minorities pointing their finger at white people and saying we're the bad people.
[00:12:48.086 --> 00:12:49.527]  It's disgusting!
[00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:52.188]  And the left are the ones fueling it.
[00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.129]  The average quote minority just wants to live their life.
[00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:57.090]  They're good people.
[00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.791]  But I just, I knew exactly what...
[00:12:59.898 --> 00:13:02.479]  Kavanaugh, Brett Kavanaugh felt like.
[00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:08.701]  But they were saying that he raped women, and then all these other women came out later when they got charged, said, okay, I just made it up.
[00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:11.742]  You know, it's political.
[00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:14.423]  The truth is, I know people that know Kavanaugh.
[00:13:14.423 --> 00:13:15.123]  I checked into it.
[00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:20.505]  They go, dude, that dude was a virgin when he got married.
[00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:22.225]  Ultra super nerd.
[00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:24.586]  Mr. first in class every test.
[00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:26.907]  Mr. study 20 hours for every test.
[00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:27.547]  I know the type.
[00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:35.255]  It's not a bad type.
[00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:37.375]  My son is obsessed with making a perfect grade on the SAT.
[00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:43.197]  I mean, he's not Cavanaugh level, you know, leave it to Beaver, but he's close.
[00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.917]  I'm like, my God, my son's like, leave it to Beaver.
[00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:45.937]  This is wonderful.
[00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:55.040]  He wins all the speech awards, he's very outgoing, he takes girls out on dates, but, you know, he's not even gonna, you know, kiss them or anything until he gets serious in college, and I'm like,
[00:13:55.782 --> 00:13:58.924]  Well, 30 years ago, I'd say, that guy's a wimp.
[00:13:58.924 --> 00:14:00.185]  I'd say, man, I'm proud of my son.
[00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:09.512]  The point is, imagine Kavanaugh, where he's all about his whole life is straight-lace, his whole life is executing by the book, and that's his whole value.
[00:14:09.512 --> 00:14:18.119]  And then these people come along and just make all this crap up, and they sit there knowing it's made up, knowing the truth.
[00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:27.714]  Knowing the truth, and they don't want anything to do with it.
[00:14:27.714 --> 00:14:41.423]  It's like Louie Gohmert, Congressman from Texas, told Sundar Pichai, he said, you wouldn't know the light if you saw it because you've never seen it.
[00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.484]  He's don't know what light is.
[00:14:43.484 --> 00:14:44.485]  Now I was wild.
[00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:45.565]  I was out of control.
[00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:47.947]  I was a hellion.
[00:14:47.947 --> 00:14:49.608]  I wasn't like a criminal, but I was a hellion.
[00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:52.975]  And thank God I made it out of it by about 16 and a half.
[00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:56.176]  But the point is, they don't want any of that truth.
[00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:59.278]  They just want to make stuff up.
[00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:07.103]  And again, I know everyone knows it, but until you experience the premeditated lying,
[00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.787]  I mean, take Megyn Kelly.
[00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:12.748]  She says, it's not about Sandy Hook.
[00:15:12.748 --> 00:15:16.792]  I want to know about you're so interesting and about your family and about your divorce, what you've gone through.
[00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:17.333]  She gets here.
[00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.694]  It's all about Sandy Hook.
[00:15:18.694 --> 00:15:20.035]  I say Sandy Hook happened.
[00:15:20.035 --> 00:15:24.339]  She edits it to have me say it happened so they can sue me.
[00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:26.100]  She's a damn lawyer.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:35.349]  And I'm just saying, folks, you don't understand the level until you experience the premeditated fraud of these people.
[00:15:36.664 --> 00:15:45.930]  Until you experience the fact that you give an interview to the New York Times, ABC News, NPR, they're going to lie because that's who they are.
[00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.451]  It's what they do.
[00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:53.315]  They can't do anything else!
[00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:55.617]  And we have to get it through our head.
[00:15:55.617 --> 00:15:56.958]  These people are the enemy.
[00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:01.085]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:04.306]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:05.927]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:05.927 --> 00:16:08.748]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:09.408]  Awesome!

[00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:42.792]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:45.594]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.

[00:17:04.204 --> 00:17:09.267]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:16.451]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:21.014]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:25.137]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:28.360]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.002]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[00:17:31.002 --> 00:17:32.503]  Get sober now.

[00:19:41.912 --> 00:19:44.534]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:17.622]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:17.622 --> 00:20:21.123]  Tell me I'm alive tonight, out on the streets again.
[00:20:21.123 --> 00:20:26.625]  Turn me on, I'm high tonight, something you'll never forget.
[00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:44.581]  You better turn me loose.
[00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:48.204]  You better set me free.
[00:20:48.204 --> 00:20:51.526]  A little bit better than I used to be, because I'm alive.
[00:20:51.526 --> 00:20:53.308]  Livewire!
[00:20:53.308 --> 00:20:54.449]  Woo!
[00:20:54.449 --> 00:20:55.169]  Come on, baby!
[00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:58.572]  You gotta play with me.
[00:20:58.572 --> 00:20:59.953]  I'm your livewire.
[00:20:59.953 --> 00:21:02.195]  I'm glad Trump declared the emergency.
[00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:03.676]  That's a big win.
[00:21:03.676 --> 00:21:07.319]  But Pelosi is planning, coming out with the Second Amendment.
[00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:08.600]  Listen to this little bit of guitar right here.
[00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:16.901]  Most Americans incorrectly think gun murder rates have gotten worse.
[00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:17.321]  Not better.
[00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:19.202]  The Washington Post told the truth.
[00:21:19.202 --> 00:21:31.671]  Blind Hog signs Akron.
[00:21:31.671 --> 00:21:33.092]  Oh, we gotta stop the music.
[00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:35.193]  Thank you.
[00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.314]  Oh, boy.
[00:21:36.314 --> 00:21:37.315]  I'm just trying to...
[00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:40.192]  Process everything.
[00:21:40.192 --> 00:22:03.019]  But when you run into solid walls of liars, like Brett Kavanaugh did, consciously trying to destroy you by just making things up, and then they turn it around and create HBO characters, and Showtime characters, and Comedy Central characters, saying it's me, playing clips of me on the shows,
[00:22:04.534 --> 00:22:07.675]  And I walk down the street and people go, it's Homeland Man!
[00:22:07.675 --> 00:22:12.137]  It's Homeland Man!
[00:22:12.137 --> 00:22:18.560]  I've had national reporters in the studio and they're looking for the fake news command base with a hundred people typing lies.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.641]  That's the New York Times, not us!
[00:22:22.682 --> 00:22:27.186]  Of course the public didn't buy Sandy Hook, because they don't know what to buy.
[00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:42.321]  You've got the police saying they believe that the Empire star on ABC staged the attack with two of his associates, his assistants, fellow actors.
[00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:43.422]  That's ABC News.
[00:22:45.336 --> 00:23:12.388]  Babies in incubators that never died, but we went to war and millions died, and now an Albright, like a big, fat, swollen tick, a blood-drunk demon, tells 60 Minutes, in fact, cue that up if you can, 500,000 dead Iraqi kids are a good price to pay, close quote.
[00:23:12.388 --> 00:23:13.349]  But she's a good person.
[00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:20.284]  I'm the bad man because I question these groups and these organizations, and you're not supposed to do that in America.
[00:23:20.284 --> 00:23:31.973]  You're supposed to roll over, and you're supposed to let them take your children and take your country and take your guns and take your property and take your God!
[00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:33.454]  Well, I'm not rolling over to it.
[00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:42.122]  And let me tell you, in the last 24 hours, I have had incredibly good news that I'm not at liberty to get to on multiple fronts.
[00:23:43.274 --> 00:23:44.554]  Multiple fronts.
[00:23:44.554 --> 00:23:47.295]  I mean, very good news.
[00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:56.959]  And I know people want good news and so Q, you know, gives you this good news and everybody's in on the Q thing and the little breadcrumbs and they're smart and they know what's real.
[00:23:56.959 --> 00:24:01.640]  It's like a fortune cookie.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.441]  This is the real world.
[00:24:04.441 --> 00:24:06.242]  I told you Trump was going to win.
[00:24:06.242 --> 00:24:08.923]  I got on the front line to get people mobilized to do it.
[00:24:08.923 --> 00:24:09.603]  You did it as well.
[00:24:11.687 --> 00:24:14.289]  I told you the national emergency was coming.
[00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:18.572]  I told you they were going to fire Sessions.
[00:24:18.572 --> 00:24:22.955]  And I keep telling you everything that's going to happen.
[00:24:22.955 --> 00:24:25.597]  And so we can fight the bad stuff and hope it doesn't.
[00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:30.080]  And then the few times we actually stop something bad, people go, oh, it didn't happen.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.282]  And then later we find out they tried to do it.
[00:24:33.282 --> 00:24:36.745]  And that's really my message to everybody here is we can win this fight.
[00:24:42.056 --> 00:24:46.819]  But we have to let it burn into our brains real good and real hard, myself included.
[00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:51.242]  Like, why in Hades?
[00:24:51.242 --> 00:24:54.544]  Why in the River Styx?
[00:24:54.544 --> 00:24:57.245]  Why in the Ninth Circle?
[00:24:57.245 --> 00:25:02.428]  Why in the gates of hell?
[00:25:02.428 --> 00:25:07.071]  Why in the old serpent's arse?
[00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:08.452]  Did I give NPR an interview?
[00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:16.346]  Because you go back one more time thinking, someday they'll tell the truth.
[00:25:16.346 --> 00:25:21.968]  Someday, but they won't because they are frauds.
[00:25:21.968 --> 00:25:33.250]  They are fiction writers living in the real world, trying to be wizards and control people's outlook and manipulate reality into what they want reality to be.
[00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:40.872]  Instead of us just pointing out how God made things and the natural order that feels good, works good, blesses you and takes us beyond the stars.
[00:25:42.466 --> 00:25:46.587]  We're going beyond the stars.
[00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:49.348]  That's why they're not even into space exploration anymore, because they figured that out.
[00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:50.848]  They're like, space exploration?
[00:25:50.848 --> 00:25:51.308]  Ha ha!
[00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:58.250]  How about dimensional exploration?
[00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:06.952]  So we're going to go to break, and then I'll play the national emergency speech, and then Pelosi in her fascist uniform, and they keep calling her the president, though she's really the president.
[00:26:06.952 --> 00:26:10.313]  I told you that was coming, because they want to impeach Trump using Russia garbage.
[00:26:10.313 --> 00:26:11.293]  That'll get Pence out as well.
[00:26:12.847 --> 00:26:22.873]  Third in succession is Madame Moussa Beaker, who they're building up like she's a god.
[00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:30.178]  Now she's wearing space captain outfits.
[00:26:30.178 --> 00:26:31.619]  I mean, this is really a joke.
[00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:35.301]  We can't beat this thing.
[00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:39.504]  But I've gotten some calls the last 24 hours by household names.
[00:26:41.096 --> 00:26:46.720]  And let me just tell you something.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.903]  Well, I'm not at liberty to tell you.
[00:26:51.903 --> 00:26:55.065]  Let's just say this.
[00:26:55.065 --> 00:26:56.807]  Trump's a good guy.
[00:26:56.807 --> 00:26:59.688]  But Trump isn't what brought us here.
[00:26:59.688 --> 00:27:01.289]  He rode in on the wave.
[00:27:01.289 --> 00:27:04.532]  And like I said, bigger waves are coming.
[00:27:04.532 --> 00:27:07.013]  And the EU's going down.
[00:27:07.013 --> 00:27:07.834]  China's going down.
[00:27:11.457 --> 00:27:21.407]  The globalists are going down, and it's a very exciting time to be alive.
[00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:24.871]  But the next few years are going to be real rough.
[00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:31.057]  But the globalists, the globalists have given up.
[00:27:33.697 --> 00:27:35.259]  The globalists have given up.
[00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:43.390]  It doesn't mean they're not going to keep stealing and, you know, have tens of trillions and try to start more wars and manipulate, but they know they're behind the eight ball now.
[00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:47.575]  I'm going to be more circumscript and more focused when we come back.
[00:27:47.575 --> 00:27:51.360]  I just have been poleaxed by the good, the bad, and the ugly the last, really, 48 hours.
[00:27:55.129 --> 00:27:57.990]  Boy, pulling my, see that?
[00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.991]  Pulling my bicep is not good.
[00:27:59.991 --> 00:28:01.771]  Excuse me.
[00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:03.212]  Anyways, that is the old body.
[00:28:03.212 --> 00:28:04.072]  It's something else, isn't it?
[00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:07.093]  Amazing thing God gave us, but when it breaks, it's not fun.
[00:28:07.093 --> 00:28:10.394]  By the way, if you're a TV viewer, if you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:28:10.394 --> 00:28:12.355]  RadioLizard.info.com.
[00:28:12.355 --> 00:28:20.698]  This is inspired by a tweet by Donald Trump Jr., where he said, you know, capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[00:28:22.025 --> 00:28:22.225]  I don't
[00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:43.387]  When this sells out, that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:43.387 --> 00:28:45.889]  But we'll have a new version with her as a dog on the front.
[00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:48.910]  But if you want to trigger leftists, this is their god.
[00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.332]  So infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:52.332 --> 00:28:57.334]  The name of the shirt is Capitalists Walk Their Dogs, Socialists Eat Them.

[00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:05.247]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:32:05.247 --> 00:32:07.049]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:08.790]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.632]  Now, I can make them strong.

[00:32:14.016 --> 00:32:14.997]  But not once I'm gone.
[00:32:15.097 --> 00:32:20.220]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:25.823]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:32:25.823 --> 00:32:29.465]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:32:29.465 --> 00:32:34.447]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:32:34.447 --> 00:32:41.231]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:45.092]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:32:45.092 --> 00:32:52.734]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:32:52.734 --> 00:33:02.777]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:33:02.777 --> 00:33:05.438]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:28.641]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:31.243]  Oh, we heard that vicious white men
[00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.331]  That's only their national pastime.
[00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:36.592]  You know, I have had two associates
[00:34:01.755 --> 00:34:14.240]  Four or five people I know, and someone in my family, actually two people in my family, give money to the Nigerians.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:23.664]  And, you know, my grandmother, my mother's mother, God bless her, gave everything she had her entire life to charity.
[00:34:23.664 --> 00:34:29.346]  Even though she had an oil field in West Texas, she lived in South Austin in a
[00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:36.864]  I think they, when they moved from Hyde Park, nicer area, Austin, because they wanted to give everything to church.
[00:34:36.864 --> 00:34:40.907]  I think it was something like a $30,000 house.
[00:34:40.907 --> 00:34:42.068]  The house, I think, is worth like $80,000.
[00:34:42.068 --> 00:34:43.909]  I mean, that's in Austin.
[00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.491]  That gives you an idea.
[00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:48.652]  She basically moved to the barrio.
[00:34:48.652 --> 00:34:49.573]  She liked her neighbors.
[00:34:49.573 --> 00:34:51.214]  They're nice people.
[00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:52.835]  They all loved her.
[00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:58.819]  But the point is, is that I found out
[00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:05.174]  That she was giving most of her money to African charities.
[00:35:05.174 --> 00:35:06.656]  And some of them were good, some of them were bad.
[00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the time she got to be about 89 or so, she was kind of out of it a little bit.
[00:35:09.378 --> 00:35:13.281]  They were still calling her at the nursing home by the time she moved out of her house.
[00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:23.628]  And then someone even closer to me started giving money to the Nigerians last year.
[00:35:23.628 --> 00:35:27.291]  And I threw a fit.
[00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.513]  And I'm just really sick of Nigerians right now.
[00:35:31.488 --> 00:35:37.831]  God Almighty, I'm so sick of people staging crap and running scams.
[00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:39.032]  Oh my God, my grandmother.
[00:35:39.032 --> 00:35:43.874]  Until she died, I had no idea how much money she'd had over the years.
[00:35:43.874 --> 00:35:49.857]  So, I remember I started giving her money about 10 years ago after my grandfather died.
[00:35:49.857 --> 00:35:56.981]  Because I'd go over there and the food she was getting was like the cheapest low-grade whatever, and she was clipping out coupons.
[00:36:01.519 --> 00:36:11.807]  And it turns out, she'd given millions and millions, everything she had away, over the years.
[00:36:11.807 --> 00:36:24.558]  We stopped her from giving her body to science, my grandfather did, but I just, you take people that good, I mean she was really good, my grandfather was really that good, they were really good people, I'm like a devil compared to them.
[00:36:28.973 --> 00:36:38.020]  I remember my grandfather on Sundays, even when it was football season, even when Tom Landry still was coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.484]  So I used to go over there a lot of Sundays once I moved down here in high school.
[00:36:42.484 --> 00:36:50.030]  And Tom Landry would call, they would pray on the phone together.
[00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:54.034]  Because he was roommates with him at UT, and they were both in the Army Air Corps.
[00:36:54.034 --> 00:36:57.657]  But the point is, is that that's what built America, was people like that.
[00:36:59.261 --> 00:37:02.161]  They were so moral and so good, it wasn't an act.
[00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:06.802]  They were good people!
[00:37:06.802 --> 00:37:08.643]  But see, I'm not.
[00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:13.623]  I'm not an evil person, but I know how evil operates, and I won't take it from these people.
[00:37:13.623 --> 00:37:19.604]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:24.985]  Because they were all good people, but they were blind.
[00:37:24.985 --> 00:37:28.386]  They projected onto other people their goodness when other people weren't good.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.321]  My dad's mother, she was different.
[00:37:32.321 --> 00:37:44.087]  She didn't believe a damn thing anybody said and she was the smartest of all of them.
[00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:48.109]  And I just, I know there's a heaven because I'm going to see those people again.
[00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:54.812]  But I get scared, really scared for my kids because let me tell you, there's not a lot of people like that anymore.
[00:37:54.812 --> 00:37:56.253]  You don't run into those people anymore.
[00:37:57.554 --> 00:37:59.234]  And you know what?
[00:37:59.234 --> 00:38:04.076]  20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, you couldn't swing a stick in the dark and not hit somebody that was really good.
[00:38:04.076 --> 00:38:08.777]  And let me tell you why they hate this show.
[00:38:08.777 --> 00:38:11.558]  They know you're good.
[00:38:11.558 --> 00:38:14.398]  They know you love God.
[00:38:14.398 --> 00:38:20.860]  And I'm so sick of watching them up on TV, exercising evil against us in front of everybody.
[00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:42.766]  Do you understand that the proper response to the Governor of Virginia saying we keep babies alive and they take their organs, you know what the proper response is.
[00:38:42.766 --> 00:38:49.551]  Now in this weird screwed up world, I'm not calling for violence and I'm not going to go pump a couple rounds into his head.
[00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.611]  But what about the babies?
[00:38:52.611 --> 00:38:57.616]  See, it's okay to say you're gonna kill babies after they're already born.
[00:38:57.616 --> 00:38:58.837]  That's okay!
[00:38:58.837 --> 00:39:08.507]  That son of a piece of garbage can sit up there and say that to the whole world and exercise that evil in front of you and rub it in on purpose and get you ready for more evil.
[00:39:08.507 --> 00:39:09.308]  That's what he's doing.
[00:39:09.308 --> 00:39:10.269]  He's breaking you!
[00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:21.309]  But if you talk about shoving a .357 Magnum in his mouth and blowing the back of his head off, which I'm not saying do that.
[00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.969]  Oh God!
[00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:22.470]  Oh God!
[00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.131]  Alex Jones called for violence!
[00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:27.592]  He's a full grown man!
[00:39:27.592 --> 00:39:30.854]  He's talking about killing little babies!
[00:39:30.854 --> 00:39:35.356]  Like it's no big deal and putting it in our face and it's okay because I love their babies!
[00:39:35.356 --> 00:39:35.856]  Their babies!
[00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:37.377]  It's because we're all intimidated, that's what it is.
[00:39:38.874 --> 00:39:40.995]  Oh, don't talk about slitting the governor's throat.
[00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:47.979]  Don't talk about taking a frickin' meat cleaver to his fingers first, chaining him down and just going, whack, whack, whack, all the way up to the wrist and going, and up to the arm.
[00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:48.840]  How's that feel?
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.282]  Do you think those babies like getting chopped up?
[00:39:52.282 --> 00:39:54.263]  Now I'm gonna slit your throat!
[00:39:54.263 --> 00:40:01.047]  Let's see how you like that!
[00:40:01.047 --> 00:40:06.270]  You think about that, you think about that long and hard where they're all smiling when Governor Cuomo signed the bill to do it.
[00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:14.736]  Because he thinks you're weak, he thinks you're brokeback, he thinks he can pick on children!
[00:40:14.736 --> 00:40:15.899]  But the last thing we want...
[00:40:17.273 --> 00:40:23.734]  They had to stage this themselves, as somebody had to roll an ammonium nitrate bomb up in front of the Governor Cuomo's house.
[00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:25.434]  We don't want that!
[00:40:25.434 --> 00:40:26.715]  We want to sue him.
[00:40:26.715 --> 00:40:28.255]  We want to take his money.
[00:40:28.255 --> 00:40:29.995]  We want to destroy his name.
[00:40:29.995 --> 00:40:31.456]  We want to confront him.
[00:40:31.456 --> 00:40:37.897]  But more importantly, we want to convict people's hearts and souls that that's evil and that's wrong, and that we should stand against him.
[00:40:37.897 --> 00:40:44.238]  We should pray to God to bring judgment against the Governor of Virginia and the Governor of New York.
[00:40:44.878 --> 00:40:46.659]  Because now they've got other states.
[00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:47.580]  I've got it in my stack here.
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.621]  I meant to get to that at the start of the show.
[00:40:49.621 --> 00:40:50.722]  I didn't do it.
[00:40:50.722 --> 00:40:52.683]  That's what gets me enraged for the show.
[00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.745]  Two other states have governors.
[00:40:54.745 --> 00:40:55.605]  I can't remember which ones now.
[00:40:55.605 --> 00:40:56.946]  I've got to dig it out.
[00:40:56.946 --> 00:41:05.572]  Two other states have bills on the governor's desk to kill babies after they're born.
[00:41:05.572 --> 00:41:11.216]  But see, it's radical to even talk about the idea
[00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:22.293]  Of those governors strung up by piano wire, which I don't want to happen at a literal level.
[00:41:22.293 --> 00:41:23.114]  I'm not calling for that.
[00:41:23.114 --> 00:41:25.154]  The media will cut that out and say, no, no, no.
[00:41:25.154 --> 00:41:35.858]  I'm saying, how are we so conditioned to say it's not good to kill men saying we're going to kill babies after they're born who laugh about it and sign death execution warrants on children?
[00:41:38.376 --> 00:41:44.440]  But if you just talk about them in that position, that's bad because we are cowards.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.881]  And we are trained to bow down to these people.
[00:41:45.881 --> 00:41:48.563]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:41:48.563 --> 00:41:50.184]  We have the moral high ground.
[00:41:50.184 --> 00:41:51.224]  We need to expose them.
[00:41:51.224 --> 00:41:53.065]  And the public is so ignorant, they don't get this.
[00:41:53.065 --> 00:42:00.690]  So, even though under God's law, murdering children is the death penalty, premeditated murder is the death penalty.
[00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.973]  But this is a metaphysical war.
[00:42:04.973 --> 00:42:05.994]  And when I go to Congress,
[00:42:07.284 --> 00:42:09.066]  There's no patriots in the hallways.
[00:42:09.066 --> 00:42:11.168]  There's leftist scum running around.
[00:42:11.168 --> 00:42:16.573]  If everyone in America, when Congress was in session, just one week out of the year, if you just went to D.C.
[00:42:16.573 --> 00:42:22.038]  as your, quote, vacation, maybe saw some museums, took your wife out to dinner, you know, you deserve some time off, but you know what?
[00:42:22.038 --> 00:42:23.240]  Those kids deserve to be safe.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:31.467]  And if you just went and visited your congressman or woman, or you went to some of the press conferences, and you just showed up and said your mind, you'd reach millions of people, and they would do something.
[00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:36.177]  But, oh, it's the Capitol, it's big, it's a... Oh, Senator!
[00:42:36.177 --> 00:42:38.498]  Oh, they're so powerful!
[00:42:38.498 --> 00:42:45.640]  And they're nothing but a bunch of dirty, stinking, chicken-neck, ass-kissing lawyers!
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.840]  They're nothing but scum!
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.441]  They're nothing but cowards!
[00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:51.041]  They're nothing but filth!
[00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:53.542]  And God is gonna destroy them!
[00:42:53.542 --> 00:42:57.883]  In the name of Jesus Christ, God is gonna put cancer in every damn one of them!

[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.921]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[00:46:09.921 --> 00:46:13.583]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all great it is.
[00:46:13.583 --> 00:46:16.324]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[00:46:16.324 --> 00:46:17.425]  What is the top tumor?
[00:46:17.425 --> 00:46:19.566]  It's the bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[00:46:19.566 --> 00:46:21.487]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[00:46:21.587 --> 00:46:22.648]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[00:46:22.648 --> 00:46:24.590]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.333]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:31.356]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[00:46:31.356 --> 00:46:31.616]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[00:46:31.616 --> 00:46:33.097]  No one's ever done it.
[00:46:33.097 --> 00:46:34.979]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:35.920]  It costs $10.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.441]  No one's ever done that.
[00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:40.144]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[00:46:40.144 --> 00:46:40.944]  The top brand's 50%.
[00:46:40.944 --> 00:46:42.766]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[00:46:44.107 --> 00:46:47.029]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive.
[00:46:47.029 --> 00:46:47.629]  Our fish oil.
[00:46:47.629 --> 00:46:50.171]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:51.232]  My children take it.
[00:46:51.232 --> 00:46:55.575]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[00:46:55.575 --> 00:46:58.577]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[00:46:58.577 --> 00:46:59.057]  Never!
[00:46:59.057 --> 00:47:03.801]  Enforcedware.com.
[00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:06.483]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.896 --> 00:47:25.738]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:47:25.738 --> 00:47:40.445]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.445 --> 00:47:48.549]  So Governor Northam is trying to sign a death warrant in Virginia to kill children after they're born.
[00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:50.030]  And the Governor of New York's done it.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.022]  Democrats are getting it passed in New Mexico, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia right now.
[00:47:58.022 --> 00:48:02.724]  They're on two governors' desks and pending in two other states.
[00:48:02.724 --> 00:48:05.585]  That's signing death warrants on children.
[00:48:05.585 --> 00:48:08.206]  And I don't wish any violence against these sacks of garbage.
[00:48:08.206 --> 00:48:09.327]  These turn themselves into victims.
[00:48:09.327 --> 00:48:18.551]  But if Tim McVeigh supposedly, which it was a staged event obviously, bombed the daycare center, some of them were newborn babies, he got charged with death for those babies.
[00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:21.592]  So those babies matter, but other babies don't.
[00:48:23.922 --> 00:48:27.845]  Now think about that.
[00:48:27.845 --> 00:48:46.236]  So, if you have the post-birth abortion, now where a man stabbed his fiancée to death, because she was pregnant and going to keep the baby, and they said in New York we're not going to charge him for killing the baby because it's not a human, even though the woman decides it is and wants to keep it.
[00:48:46.236 --> 00:48:51.660]  So that's where we are as a culture, and I keep hammering on that because they're out in the open pushing all this.
[00:48:56.522 --> 00:48:58.344]  All right, let's shift gears.
[00:48:58.344 --> 00:49:15.058]  A lot of people are probably asking, wow, Alex, you predicted in October the national emergency when no one else did, and then you said a month ago you thought it was about to be signed, but Trump did the wrong thing and let them kill $2 billion a week out of the economy and act like they're grandstanding instead of just absolutely devastating them right up front and take control of the border.
[00:49:15.058 --> 00:49:17.820]  Well, why should we even play the clip?
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.882]  I mean, you get next year's news today here.
[00:49:21.254 --> 00:49:22.875]  Kind of like a time machine.
[00:49:22.875 --> 00:49:24.855]  I'm not bragging, that's why they want us off the air.
[00:49:24.855 --> 00:49:27.757]  Because these academics and these globalists, they don't really do much work.
[00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:32.379]  They kind of agree and go play golf and go take drugs and do whatever, and then steal money.
[00:49:32.379 --> 00:49:34.940]  And then worry about what trips they're going to go on.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.361]  But none of them are happy though, statistically.
[00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:39.682]  Because they're not doing anything real.
[00:49:39.682 --> 00:49:44.423]  See, I actually, I'm not bragging, I actually can't stop learning how all this works.
[00:49:44.423 --> 00:49:49.866]  So they tune into these shows and they're like, this dude knows stuff that CIA director knows and that's about it.
[00:49:49.866 --> 00:49:50.386]  How does he know it?
[00:49:51.257 --> 00:49:56.700]  I had the FBI call up and say, how did you predict the day of the event, Las Vegas?
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:03.004]  Well, that's how can I throw a bullseye at 20 feet, if I don't think about it, twice in a row.
[00:50:03.004 --> 00:50:05.446]  Everybody knows that that's what that is.
[00:50:05.446 --> 00:50:06.326]  You can't control it.
[00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:08.928]  You guys got to go with it.
[00:50:08.928 --> 00:50:15.412]  And they're getting mad because the older I get, the more I know I just go with my gut now.
[00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:17.974]  It's never scared me wrong.
[00:50:17.974 --> 00:50:19.715]  That's what wisdom is, is
[00:50:21.539 --> 00:50:23.820]  Going with discernment, going with God.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.541]  God's already navigating for you.
[00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:31.543]  And if you've got a relationship with God, it's going to get stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger.
[00:50:31.543 --> 00:50:38.386]  I used to sit there at church and hear about, you know, Christians in the Bible saying, you know, God, we don't want to die, but we're ready to come home and be with you forever.
[00:50:38.386 --> 00:50:40.927]  And we just, we just can't wait to be with you.
[00:50:40.927 --> 00:50:42.968]  And I'm thinking, man, I don't want to, I don't want to die.
[00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:44.468]  I've got time to go see God.
[00:50:44.468 --> 00:50:45.429]  And I don't want to die now.
[00:50:45.429 --> 00:50:50.291]  I never commit suicide, but I just, I, I, I want to be with God.
[00:50:51.249 --> 00:50:54.992]  The reason about my personal experience is, this experience is what the enemy doesn't like.
[00:50:54.992 --> 00:50:59.895]  Now the other side of me is, you know, I wanna stay here and take care of my kids.
[00:50:59.895 --> 00:51:01.737]  That means take care of you.
[00:51:01.737 --> 00:51:03.318]  We're all in this together, you gotta take care of me.
[00:51:03.318 --> 00:51:11.284]  And we gotta stand up against totally sold out, soulless mummies.
[00:51:11.284 --> 00:51:18.369]  Narcissistic mannequins, like Nancy Pelosi,
[00:51:20.663 --> 00:51:25.787]  Who don't have any connection to God.
[00:51:25.787 --> 00:51:30.791]  No connection.
[00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:35.455]  She enjoys power.
[00:51:35.455 --> 00:51:41.600]  But does she look like she has any power?
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.381]  You know who's got power?
[00:51:43.615 --> 00:51:55.466]  There's a single mother who just worked 12 hours, picked her kids up, made them dinner, one of them gets the flu, and she's up all night while that baby, all that five-year-old's puking their guts out, and she takes care of them.
[00:51:55.466 --> 00:51:58.929]  And then she goes back to work the next day.
[00:51:58.929 --> 00:52:04.415]  Instead of just ignoring her kid and slamming the door and driving off down the road.
[00:52:04.415 --> 00:52:06.917]  That's what power is, Pelosi.
[00:52:06.917 --> 00:52:08.579]  It's dedication.
[00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:21.516]  And billions of man hours of people committed to doing the right thing, to bring us where we are, and then you people hijack it, and you shit up there, like demonic parrots, chirping.
[00:52:21.516 --> 00:52:29.820]  And you have no leadership, you have no power, doesn't matter how much power you get, or doesn't matter if you're wearing $5,000 dresses.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.662]  You will always be a soulless sack of garbage.
[00:52:33.662 --> 00:52:35.583]  You will always be filth.
[00:52:35.583 --> 00:52:37.684]  You will always be what's wrong with the world.
[00:52:43.922 --> 00:52:56.492]  And we don't take pleasure in how low she is, but we need to recognize that she's lower than anything on this planet.
[00:52:56.492 --> 00:53:01.877]  And she is being replaced by even more soulless people like Cortez.
[00:53:01.877 --> 00:53:03.838]  So, sure, I'll get to the emergency.
[00:53:03.838 --> 00:53:05.099]  Sure, why not?
[00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:07.001]  But notice what she's threatening is martial law.
[00:53:08.462 --> 00:53:10.102]  In fact, here's the name of this segment.
[00:53:10.102 --> 00:53:13.203]  Nancy Pelosi threatens martial law gun confiscation.
[00:53:13.203 --> 00:53:15.924]  I mean, that's what she's doing.
[00:53:15.924 --> 00:53:26.347]  That's what happens under real, high-level martial law.
[00:53:26.347 --> 00:53:27.527]  Is they confiscate the firearms.
[00:53:28.928 --> 00:53:31.670]  And so she's saying, hey, watch out.
[00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:37.133]  You don't declare an emergency on our border, which is in the Constitution, which is the President's duty, not his right.
[00:53:37.133 --> 00:53:38.754]  You will do it, Trump!
[00:53:38.754 --> 00:53:40.335]  You will do it!
[00:53:40.335 --> 00:53:42.496]  And you did do it!
[00:53:42.496 --> 00:53:44.778]  We have to stop playing down.
[00:53:44.778 --> 00:53:47.980]  You think I want to puff up and get all ramped up against these killers?
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.222]  I have to, folks.
[00:53:51.222 --> 00:53:53.343]  We need to stop kissing their asses.
[00:53:55.695 --> 00:54:00.959]  Stop being afraid of them and stop being blown away by their $5,000 dresses.
[00:54:00.959 --> 00:54:04.602]  Don't California, my Texas is the shirt I'm wearing.
[00:54:04.602 --> 00:54:06.263]  Or don't California, my USA.
[00:54:06.263 --> 00:54:08.165]  We also want Don't California, my Texas.
[00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:10.947]  We're going to have a new one coming out, it says Don't Venezuela, my USA.
[00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:12.068]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:54:12.068 --> 00:54:16.791]  That's how you find the broadcast and everything else, so please support us.
[00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:22.055]  But let's, I keep saying I'm going to go to Stuart Rose's studio next hour.
[00:54:22.055 --> 00:54:24.137]  He's a constitutional lawyer, we always forget that, I'm just a veteran.
[00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.523]  You know, why is it cool?
[00:54:27.523 --> 00:54:29.044]  Because old Stewart used to have a glass eye.
[00:54:29.044 --> 00:54:34.848]  I remember about three or four years ago, he probably doesn't even remember this, I said, hey man, nothing wrong with the fact you lost your eye in the army.
[00:54:34.848 --> 00:54:40.632]  It's kind of cool, everybody instinctively likes a male with one eye.
[00:54:40.632 --> 00:54:41.172]  What does it mean?
[00:54:41.172 --> 00:54:45.275]  It means that person's been through something.
[00:54:45.275 --> 00:54:48.037]  It's like a sign, it's like scars you get.
[00:54:48.037 --> 00:54:51.519]  They become your friends, they're memories of what happened.
[00:54:51.519 --> 00:54:53.901]  Victories and defeats and wars.
[00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:05.619]  See, we respect somebody that gave something up like Odin to get the true vision and to give up one of the eyes.
[00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:13.725]  You have to give up focusing on the petty and the world in front of you before the big eye opens up.
[00:55:13.725 --> 00:55:17.587]  And then when you've got that one eye, it sees all.
[00:55:17.587 --> 00:55:18.788]  That's how powerful humans are.
[00:55:18.788 --> 00:55:20.029]  It's a symbol of the one eye.
[00:55:20.029 --> 00:55:21.590]  And you go, oh my gosh, that's Illuminati.
[00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:22.451]  No, it's not.
[00:55:22.451 --> 00:55:23.952]  They steal all the symbols.
[00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:28.729]  The all-seeing eye is God's eye.
[00:55:28.729 --> 00:55:35.894]  The devil and Google trying to be all-seeing, that's not God.
[00:55:35.894 --> 00:55:42.400]  You, in communion with God, that's all-seeing.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.863]  But see, Snake Plissken, as much as I love Kurt Russell, didn't really lose his eye.
[00:55:46.863 --> 00:55:47.684]  And that's the whole point.
[00:55:50.339 --> 00:55:53.961]  And it's not like Stuart Rhodes wears his eye patch now because it's in fashion.
[00:55:53.961 --> 00:55:55.402]  It's like men going bald.
[00:55:55.402 --> 00:55:56.303]  So what?
[00:55:56.303 --> 00:55:57.323]  Go bald?
[00:55:57.323 --> 00:55:58.924]  It's just your man.
[00:55:58.924 --> 00:55:59.585]  What are you worried about?
[00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:00.805]  You lost your eye in the army.
[00:56:00.805 --> 00:56:01.646]  Wear a damn patch.
[00:56:01.646 --> 00:56:02.767]  Let them know you did it.
[00:56:02.767 --> 00:56:09.190]  Don't cover it up with a nice blue marble.
[00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:11.632]  Those scars are sacrifices.
[00:56:11.632 --> 00:56:12.913]  Those scars are payment.
[00:56:14.051 --> 00:56:19.836]  And even if you did those things and were deceived or even carrying out evil, God judges the heart like King David.
[00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:22.418]  Did horrible things and then later realized it was wrong.
[00:56:22.418 --> 00:56:25.880]  Didn't do it for the wrong reason and repented and it was real!
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.883]  And God said, that's a man after my own heart right there.
[00:56:29.883 --> 00:56:36.548]  Those scars are our medals.
[00:56:36.548 --> 00:56:37.629]  Those emotional scars.
[00:56:38.735 --> 00:56:47.277]  Those physical scars, those aren't how we're weak and we revel in being victims, and how we revel in pissing on ourselves and all the bad things that happen.
[00:56:47.277 --> 00:57:06.423]  The bad things that happen to me, I'm not a masochist, I don't like pain, but let me tell you, in the journey, I'm way stronger than I ever would have been if I was sitting there playing video games all day on my ass, instead of getting the living hell beat out of me by horrible racist gangs of blacks.
[00:57:07.935 --> 00:57:12.080]  And I thank them for that now.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.562]  Because I'm not going to be racist and fall in like they are.
[00:57:14.562 --> 00:57:19.027]  And there are a lot of great black people.
[00:57:19.027 --> 00:57:21.349]  I appreciate that.
[00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:23.732]  My head being slammed into concrete.
[00:57:23.732 --> 00:57:24.373]  I made it through it.
[00:57:25.916 --> 00:57:26.736]  And I became strong.
[00:57:26.736 --> 00:57:30.738]  And later, the people that slammed my head in the concrete got tracheotomies.
[00:57:30.738 --> 00:57:32.719]  And I'm sad for that, too.
[00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:35.280]  But that's the full circle of Earth.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.641]  It's how God delivers the real balance.
[00:57:37.641 --> 00:57:38.661]  All right, I'm gonna stop.
[00:57:38.661 --> 00:57:39.262]  I'll play the clips.
[00:57:39.262 --> 00:57:40.642]  The Stuart Rhodes coming in.
[00:57:40.642 --> 00:57:41.182]  Stay with us.
[00:57:41.182 --> 00:57:42.223]  Newswars.com.
[00:57:42.223 --> 00:57:43.323]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:43.323 --> 00:57:44.344]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:57:58.553 --> 00:58:07.518]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.518 --> 00:58:17.644]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:58:17.644 --> 00:58:26.189]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.028 --> 00:58:28.349]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:29.511]  You must experience it.
[00:58:29.511 --> 00:58:31.473]  It is a total game changer.
[00:58:31.473 --> 00:58:36.518]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.518 --> 00:58:38.040]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.522]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:39.522 --> 00:58:46.209]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.209 --> 00:58:47.711]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:58.231]  And Infowars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[00:58:58.231 --> 00:59:11.600]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.503]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[00:59:16.503 --> 00:59:20.066]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[00:59:20.646 --> 00:59:29.773]  We're gonna go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:29.773 --> 00:59:32.515]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.

[00:59:39.721 --> 00:59:42.843]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[00:59:42.843 --> 00:59:49.368]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:53.280 --> 01:00:03.385]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.385 --> 01:00:14.209]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:16.470]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:19.192]  Please listen to me very carefully because this is beyond key.
[01:00:20.253 --> 01:00:21.815]  And everyone already knows it.
[01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:23.076]  I'm just saying things you already know.
[01:00:23.076 --> 01:00:24.917]  We have to say it aloud.
[01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:28.341]  Those of us that are confident tend to be quiet.
[01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:29.422]  We can't be quiet anymore.
[01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:30.363]  We have to take action.
[01:00:30.363 --> 01:00:36.228]  If you won't ever take action in the information war, you'll never take action in the physical war.
[01:00:36.228 --> 01:00:40.132]  We're trying to override and avert and circumnavigate physical war.
[01:00:42.088 --> 01:00:44.470]  But God, would the physical war be easier?
[01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:45.891]  Aren't we so much more built for that?
[01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:56.099]  It's like putting on an old pair of boots you've worn so many times before, even though many of you genetically have never physically done it in this lifetime.
[01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:57.940]  But your guts have done it.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.001]  Your genetics have done it.
[01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:00.102]  Your family history.
[01:01:00.102 --> 01:01:01.343]  Your Earth suit.
[01:01:01.343 --> 01:01:02.524]  It's made up of all your ancestors.
[01:01:04.144 --> 01:01:07.007]  Not the incarnation or reincarnation they talked about.
[01:01:07.007 --> 01:01:10.230]  Your soul's new, your soul's original, your soul's in this body.
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:13.052]  But the body is your family.
[01:01:13.052 --> 01:01:14.033]  How cool is God?
[01:01:14.033 --> 01:01:15.575]  Who could come up with that?
[01:01:15.575 --> 01:01:17.096]  So awesome, man.
[01:01:17.096 --> 01:01:21.921]  Our body suit is all of our ancestors and their memories.
[01:01:21.921 --> 01:01:23.963]  That's like heads up display.
[01:01:23.963 --> 01:01:27.386]  Way cooler than the internet, man.
[01:01:27.386 --> 01:01:28.447]  I'm sorry, let me just say this now.
[01:01:34.571 --> 01:01:44.237]  The Governor of Virginia says we're going to legalize killing babies after they're born because he's running major medical units, it's come out and been confirmed, that are harvesting organs.
[01:01:44.237 --> 01:01:50.441]  They need to keep them alive because then they can keep them alive a week or so and then get bigger prices in the bidding system that they've got.
[01:01:50.441 --> 01:01:54.143]  They've got private bidding systems for those organs.
[01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:58.006]  Plus at $100,000, you know, you just gut them right there, you get a lot more than that.
[01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:01.228]  And it's the same thing with Pelosi.
[01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:11.338]  She comes out and says, look out, you declare an emergency for the border that's in the Constitution.
[01:02:11.338 --> 01:02:13.439]  That's just default the President does.
[01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:14.080]  That's his job.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.822]  It's not like all these other fake emergencies other Presidents have had.
[01:02:16.822 --> 01:02:18.143]  Most of them have been unconstitutional.
[01:02:18.143 --> 01:02:20.544]  This was totally cut and dry Bonifidi.
[01:02:20.544 --> 01:02:21.965]  That's why Trump went with it.
[01:02:21.965 --> 01:02:22.906]  It's just cut and dry.
[01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:23.947]  He'll have lower courts throw it out.
[01:02:23.947 --> 01:02:26.248]  The Supreme Court will affirm it.
[01:02:26.248 --> 01:02:27.229]  A five-year-old could affirm it.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.901]  But see, she's not really threatening a civil emergency.
[01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:39.761]  She's threatening martial law and gun confiscation.
[01:02:39.761 --> 01:02:41.242]  Let that sink in.
[01:02:41.242 --> 01:02:50.683]  Nancy Pelosi is threatening martial law, not her own declaration of emergency, which the Democrat gets in, meaning her later they remove Trump with the whole Russiagate thing.
[01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:52.924]  She's third in succession.
[01:02:52.924 --> 01:02:55.184]  See, some people are like, oh, she threatens her own emergency.
[01:02:55.184 --> 01:02:57.445]  No, she's threatening martial law.
[01:02:57.445 --> 01:02:59.965]  See, the governor isn't just saying we're going to kill babies after they're born.
[01:03:01.923 --> 01:03:03.464]  He's saying we're going to take their organs.
[01:03:03.464 --> 01:03:06.205]  That's what we do, is we give you the goal.
[01:03:06.205 --> 01:03:09.227]  What they're really doing, because they never say what it really is.
[01:03:09.227 --> 01:03:11.928]  It's always, oh, we'll have our own emergency on guns.
[01:03:11.928 --> 01:03:12.749]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:03:12.749 --> 01:03:17.692]  You mean confiscating them, lady, and a whole civil war, because that was started.
[01:03:17.692 --> 01:03:21.914]  And you're just crazy enough to do it.
[01:03:21.914 --> 01:03:25.456]  And so that's how we're two minutes to midnight right now.
[01:03:25.456 --> 01:03:27.817]  This woman is so disconnected from reality.
[01:03:27.817 --> 01:03:28.618]  She takes our
[01:03:29.648 --> 01:03:31.109]  Restraint is weakness.
[01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:33.950]  Which, let me explain something to you.
[01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:48.656]  Our restraint is because we are going to wrap around you like a giant python and we're going to make sure that when we take your system down, which we're doing all over the world, that we are assured of it.
[01:03:48.656 --> 01:03:51.537]  And then these snakes always think if they attack
[01:03:52.884 --> 01:03:56.466]  The leading edge of the knife that will back down like we're them.
[01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:59.148]  We've already been thrown like a hatchet.
[01:03:59.148 --> 01:04:02.410]  It's already, the arrow's been loosed.
[01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.871]  The trajectory's already confirmed.
[01:04:04.871 --> 01:04:08.394]  I've already run you through, Pelosi.
[01:04:08.394 --> 01:04:11.395]  Our audience is already, we already exited.
[01:04:11.395 --> 01:04:16.459]  I meant to splatter up against the wall behind you and fall down on the ground.
[01:04:16.459 --> 01:04:17.919]  I'm a torpedo.
[01:04:17.919 --> 01:04:18.540]  I'm a weapon.
[01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:21.861]  There isn't just evil in the world, woman.
[01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:22.281]  There's good.
[01:04:23.297 --> 01:04:24.438]  Learn what it's like.
[01:04:24.438 --> 01:04:25.458]  Here she is when we go to break.
[01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:25.859]  Here it is.
[01:04:25.859 --> 01:04:26.559]  She's threatening martial law.
[01:04:54.288 --> 01:04:54.768]  Hey, pause.
[01:04:54.768 --> 01:04:55.849]  I'm gonna come back with this.
[01:04:55.849 --> 01:05:06.115]  You see her smirking about, about, uh... For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the Brain Synergy Combo is here.

[01:06:15.441 --> 01:06:28.505]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:06:28.505 --> 01:06:34.747]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:48.863 --> 01:06:53.264]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump has declared a national emergency.
[01:06:53.264 --> 01:07:14.589]  And unlike the other national emergencies that were done by globalist presidents to give trillions of dollars to foreign banks and things like Bush did, W did, this is a national emergency in the Constitution where the border is being overrun by giant caravans and diseases pouring over and the Democrats trying to break the back of our very existence under a UN plan that's admitted.
[01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:17.590]  Chain migration, migration replacement, world government,
[01:07:18.795 --> 01:07:19.595]  All of it!
[01:07:19.595 --> 01:07:30.740]  And now Pelosi comes out in a chilling statement we're going to play here and says that, look out, another president with other values could do it on the Second Amendment, which is the New York Times headline.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.461]  Time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:07:32.461 --> 01:07:36.223]  But she means by executive operation.
[01:07:36.223 --> 01:07:43.346]  Pelosi warns GOP next president could declare a national emergency on guns and confiscate them.
[01:07:43.346 --> 01:07:44.787]  That's where we are.
[01:07:46.081 --> 01:07:58.928]  In 2019, even though the Washington Post has to admit, I couldn't believe they told the truth yesterday on Valentine's Day, most Americans incorrectly think gun murder rates have gotten worse, not better!
[01:07:58.928 --> 01:08:02.190]  Think about that!
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.510]  The peak of crime was 1990.
[01:08:07.153 --> 01:08:15.480]  Let me tell you, I was living in Dallas then, and it was just like six, seven murders a day, stabbings, robbings, nice neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.562]  It was crazy.
[01:08:17.562 --> 01:08:21.766]  But here's Nancy Pelosi literally introducing martial law.
[01:08:21.766 --> 01:08:22.006]  Here it is.
[01:08:23.217 --> 01:08:23.357]  I think?
[01:08:46.784 --> 01:08:51.908]  Of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America.
[01:08:51.908 --> 01:08:53.549]  That's a national emergency.
[01:08:53.549 --> 01:08:56.251]  Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?
[01:08:56.251 --> 01:09:00.094]  I wish you would.
[01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:11.263]  So, you just heard Nancy Pelosi.
[01:09:11.263 --> 01:09:13.824]  Trial balloon, beta test.
[01:09:14.747 --> 01:09:18.250]  Market test.
[01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.591]  Preview.
[01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:24.094]  Showcase.
[01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:27.196]  Display.
[01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:29.338]  Rollout.
[01:09:29.338 --> 01:09:31.640]  Premiere.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.861]  Martial law and gun confiscation.
[01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:35.923]  You just heard it.
[01:09:35.923 --> 01:09:37.344]  Oh, we don't want your guns.
[01:09:37.344 --> 01:09:40.026]  Just every city we control, we take your guns.
[01:09:40.026 --> 01:09:42.208]  Oh, we don't want martial law.
[01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:42.468]  Lady.
[01:09:43.504 --> 01:09:50.551]  If Congress won't act, and our border's being overrun by 10,000-15,000 people a day, they admit the highest numbers ever.
[01:09:50.551 --> 01:09:52.773]  I mean, even Borkville says it's the highest ever.
[01:09:52.773 --> 01:09:53.754]  They go, no it's not!
[01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:54.314]  You're a liar!
[01:09:54.314 --> 01:09:55.115]  Fact check!
[01:09:55.115 --> 01:09:56.657]  Snopes says!
[01:09:56.657 --> 01:10:00.621]  Well, if a porn star and a dude and a fat lady and a cat said it, it's not true.
[01:10:01.755 --> 01:10:08.781]  We don't listen to the ICE, or the Border Patrol, and the actual numbers, where they're on the line, and if they do something wrong, they get sued or arrested.
[01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:10.242]  Very professional.
[01:10:10.242 --> 01:10:11.223]  No, it's not.
[01:10:11.223 --> 01:10:12.004]  We don't listen to them.
[01:10:12.004 --> 01:10:13.805]  We listen to Snopes.
[01:10:13.805 --> 01:10:15.386]  Snopes says there's no caravan.
[01:10:15.386 --> 01:10:17.248]  Remember Cuomo on CNN?
[01:10:17.248 --> 01:10:18.849]  There's no caravan.
[01:10:18.849 --> 01:10:20.471]  Acosta, there's no caravan.
[01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:24.334]  There's no caravan, as Beto says.
[01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.796]  We got 2,000 a day coming across.
[01:10:26.796 --> 01:10:28.237]  We're getting it done.
[01:10:28.237 --> 01:10:29.999]  Do you like my Vermont accent?
[01:10:31.092 --> 01:10:32.592]  And again, I love Vermont!
[01:10:32.592 --> 01:10:33.212]  It's beautiful!
[01:10:33.212 --> 01:10:36.653]  I was in Vermont like 25 years ago in the fall.
[01:10:36.653 --> 01:10:38.594]  It was so beautiful, I thought I was in the Hobbit Shire.
[01:10:38.594 --> 01:10:40.474]  I'm not against Vermonters.
[01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:44.935]  But do I go to Vermont and, you know, and talk like this to you?
[01:10:44.935 --> 01:10:47.236]  No, I don't do it.
[01:10:47.236 --> 01:10:52.857]  It sounds like some type of character from Warner Brothers cartoons.
[01:11:02.034 --> 01:11:05.257]  You just heard Nancy Pelosi.
[01:11:05.257 --> 01:11:14.003]  You just heard her say, we'll declare martial law and take your guns.
[01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:25.092]  When since the 1976 change, which they always point to, there's been 37 declarations of emergency.
[01:11:25.092 --> 01:11:26.353]  Every year and a half or so.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:35.181]  On all sorts of stuff, usually about swindling us and selling us out and giving our money to foreign countries.
[01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:44.683]  Trump comes in, and he finally declares the national emergency when the damn border is collapsing, and she acts like that's taking your guns.
[01:11:44.683 --> 01:11:52.245]  Trump isn't signing some order, taking the First Amendment, or the Second Amendment, or the Tenth Amendment, or the Ninth Amendment, or the Seventh Amendment, or the Fourth.
[01:11:52.245 --> 01:11:52.345]  No.
[01:11:54.525 --> 01:12:02.647]  He's signing a declaration of emergency because he's got control of the Pentagon money and so much more.
[01:12:02.647 --> 01:12:05.888]  And Obama gave trillions of dollars to foreign banks under an emergency.
[01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:10.930]  Trump's just trying to get four or five billion dollars!
[01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:15.911]  Because they're trying to break our border!
[01:12:15.911 --> 01:12:18.472]  And they turned that into, you better watch out.
[01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:22.051]  I'm telling you why.
[01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:25.394]  Santa Claus is coming.
[01:12:25.394 --> 01:12:27.135]  Santa Claus.
[01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:32.199]  Santa Claus is coming to town!
[01:12:32.199 --> 01:12:34.240]  He'll put you in a FEMA camp.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.122]  He'll take your guns away.
[01:12:36.122 --> 01:12:40.425]  He'll teach your three-year-old to get blowjobs, and that's just today.
[01:12:40.425 --> 01:12:42.827]  It's the Satanic New World Order.
[01:12:42.827 --> 01:12:45.008]  We'll abort your baby after they're born.
[01:12:45.008 --> 01:12:48.591]  We'll teach your kids to take ketamine and dance at gay bars when they're eleven.
[01:12:55.233 --> 01:12:57.937]  Because Satan Claus is coming to town.
[01:12:57.937 --> 01:13:01.401]  And Pelosi's up there in her black outfit.
[01:13:01.401 --> 01:13:06.108]  Just like, listen, you want to declare emergencies and even tell the public.
[01:13:06.108 --> 01:13:10.634]  Because usually when a president declares an emergency, I was watching it once live on C-Span where it happened.
[01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:22.068]  They march into the House, and they say, we have a message here as a herald of the President of the United States, declaring an emergency to the Congress.
[01:13:22.068 --> 01:13:23.629]  And they list the Congress.
[01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:27.972]  And the Congress says, we are ready to receive the emergency.
[01:13:27.972 --> 01:13:32.375]  Then they have a vote on whether they're going to oppose the emergency, and it's never on the news.
[01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:37.759]  But now, when the country's really under attack, and it's all happening, we're not allowed
[01:13:38.865 --> 01:13:52.648]  We're not allowed to discuss it, we're not allowed to know about it in the past, but now we're supposed to all be told about it and told how it's martial law and how Pelosi can take your boom-booms, your bang-bangs.
[01:13:52.648 --> 01:13:57.248]  That's how far we've gone.
[01:13:57.248 --> 01:14:01.089]  But I do feel good energetically because we're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:14:01.089 --> 01:14:03.730]  Let's go ahead and play part of Trump and we'll play more in the next segment.
[01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.170]  Stuart Rhodes is going to join us in the studio.
[01:14:07.455 --> 01:14:15.363]  Today I'm announcing several critical actions that my administration is taking to confront a problem that we have right here at home.
[01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:21.108]  We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away, wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.
[01:14:21.108 --> 01:14:24.552]  But we don't control our own border.
[01:14:24.552 --> 01:14:29.336]  So we're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.
[01:14:30.604 --> 01:14:32.225]  And we're going to do it one way or the other.
[01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:33.146]  We have to do it.
[01:14:33.146 --> 01:14:35.648]  Not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.
[01:14:35.648 --> 01:14:38.049]  It was one of many, by the way.
[01:14:38.049 --> 01:14:39.110]  Not my only one.
[01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.411]  We're rebuilding the military.
[01:14:40.411 --> 01:14:43.133]  Our economy is thriving like never before.
[01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:45.114]  You look at other economies.
[01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:47.336]  They're doing terribly, and we're doing phenomenally.
[01:14:47.336 --> 01:14:49.777]  The market is up tremendously today.
[01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:55.021]  Not that that's anything but, you know, because I'll go back in and they'll say, oh, the market just went down.
[01:14:55.021 --> 01:14:57.362]  But the market is getting close to the new high.
[01:14:57.362 --> 01:14:57.943]  Pause on that.
[01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:03.628]  When he acts like the president, and America's open for business, and he acts, it goes straight up.
[01:15:03.628 --> 01:15:06.968]  When it looks like the Chi-Coms are back in control, it goes straight down.
[01:15:06.968 --> 01:15:08.709]  People want action, Trump.
[01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:09.449]  They want it.
[01:15:09.449 --> 01:15:10.069]  They want it.
[01:15:10.069 --> 01:15:12.309]  And this is beautiful.
[01:15:12.309 --> 01:15:20.751]  So, if Pelosi thinks she's gonna take our guns, we should give Nancy Pelosi a helicopter ride.
[01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:22.351]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:25.071]  I don't mean like Pinochet did in Chile.
[01:15:25.071 --> 01:15:26.892]  I mean to Venezuela.
[01:15:26.892 --> 01:15:28.332]  Take her and Alexandria.
[01:15:29.673 --> 01:15:41.180]  Cortez and all these other dumbasses who want to go along with the takedown of the country and just fly them all down there with the other dumbass commies.
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.841]  We're going to come back with the rest of this straight ahead.
[01:15:43.841 --> 01:15:47.824]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:15:47.824 --> 01:15:49.104]  I mean, it really is Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:15:49.104 --> 01:15:53.027]  I mean, we're not really covering the emergency a lot because we told you it was coming, right?
[01:15:53.027 --> 01:15:53.567]  Sure.
[01:15:53.567 --> 01:15:54.408]  We told you first.
[01:15:54.408 --> 01:15:54.848]  It's on record.
[01:15:57.536 --> 01:15:58.797]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.797 --> 01:16:00.098]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.098 --> 01:16:03.821]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:04.922]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.922 --> 01:16:06.743]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.743 --> 01:16:08.444]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:17.251]  Bold statement?

[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:33.342]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.342 --> 01:16:36.362]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:42.304]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.304 --> 01:16:46.085]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.085 --> 01:16:47.345]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.345 --> 01:16:48.685]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.685 --> 01:16:54.887]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.887 --> 01:16:56.327]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.272]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.272 --> 01:17:04.575]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:06.157]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.157 --> 01:17:14.523]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.523 --> 01:17:20.207]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:24.492]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.492 --> 01:17:28.878]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:31.081]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:18:07.577 --> 01:18:09.898]  By leaps and by bounds.
[01:18:09.898 --> 01:18:16.580]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:26.642]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.642 --> 01:18:35.185]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:36.025 --> 01:18:37.366]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.366 --> 01:18:38.527]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.527 --> 01:18:40.469]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:18:40.469 --> 01:18:45.533]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.533 --> 01:18:47.054]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.054 --> 01:18:48.535]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.535 --> 01:18:55.220]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:18:58.123 --> 01:19:07.411]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.411 --> 01:19:10.274]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.274 --> 01:19:16.320]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:23.244]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.244 --> 01:19:29.527]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.527 --> 01:19:36.471]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:39.233]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:16.343 --> 01:20:18.404]  So, President Trump,
[01:20:42.503 --> 01:20:47.067]  Has declared a national emergency, and the media is now going to act like it's totally illegal, it's evil, it's martial law.
[01:20:47.067 --> 01:20:53.653]  But it's one of the few national emergencies a president can actually do.
[01:20:53.653 --> 01:20:58.997]  The border's collapsing, the UN's running a migrant invasion to overwhelm the courts, disease is pouring in.
[01:20:58.997 --> 01:21:10.247]  That's as standard as it gets, other than like a, let's say a meteorite, the size of a blue whale.
[01:21:12.406 --> 01:21:16.248]  Comes in and hits, say, in Kansas.
[01:21:16.248 --> 01:21:22.710]  It's going to be the equivalent of a 50 megaton hydrogen bomb.
[01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:24.931]  You're going to have most people dead in the state.
[01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:26.292]  You're going to have dust in the air.
[01:21:26.292 --> 01:21:30.273]  You're going to have fires raging all over the middle of the country.
[01:21:30.273 --> 01:21:34.855]  Let's say it's a meteorite a mile long and maybe a half mile wide.
[01:21:34.855 --> 01:21:36.096]  Oh, well, now you're talking about
[01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:42.427]  Couple years of freezing temperatures, dust in the air, mostly U.S.
[01:21:42.427 --> 01:21:42.907]  destroyed.
[01:21:42.907 --> 01:22:02.773]  I mean, you know that a meteorite, say a nickel meteorite, or an iron ore meteorite, or even a stony, if it's the size of a school bus, made the crater in Arizona.
[01:22:02.773 --> 01:22:07.414]  And it would take a lot of hydrogen bombs to do that.
[01:22:09.309 --> 01:22:11.410]  So, that's why we have emergencies.
[01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:19.894]  Depressions, wars, collapsing borders, meteorites, nuclear war.
[01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:24.317]  And the President has now announced it.
[01:22:24.317 --> 01:22:26.738]  So, what's the headline for this segment?
[01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:27.418]  We're live right now.
[01:22:27.418 --> 01:22:30.360]  We'll post it to Infowars.com.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.481]  Man who predicted Trump declares emergency, responds to emergency.
[01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:37.063]  I mean, I don't know what you say, but let's talk about when we come back with Stuart Rhodes.
[01:22:37.063 --> 01:22:37.884]  He's a little late in traffic.
[01:22:38.832 --> 01:22:40.053]  What he thinks is coming next.
[01:22:40.053 --> 01:22:41.854]  He's a smart guy.
[01:22:41.854 --> 01:22:42.835]  Stuart's such a stickler.
[01:22:42.835 --> 01:22:44.657]  You know, he's a Yale-educated lawyer.
[01:22:44.657 --> 01:22:46.258]  He used to work for Ron Paul.
[01:22:46.258 --> 01:22:48.079]  But he goes, I haven't been practicing law the last few years.
[01:22:48.079 --> 01:22:53.163]  Well, he helped us win a case with Rob Doo in the police in Cleveland.
[01:22:53.163 --> 01:22:57.486]  He's calling up going, well, I'm not currently practicing law, so don't send a constitutional lawyer.
[01:22:57.486 --> 01:22:58.567]  Dude, you got a law degree.
[01:22:58.567 --> 01:23:00.008]  You practice law.
[01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.029]  He's such a good guy, though.
[01:23:01.029 --> 01:23:04.752]  See, that's the stickling compared to, like, leftists that just lie about everything.
[01:23:07.674 --> 01:23:08.594]  He's a constitutional lawyer.
[01:23:08.594 --> 01:23:09.575]  He's not currently practicing.
[01:23:09.575 --> 01:23:10.215]  That's all.
[01:23:10.215 --> 01:23:14.556]  But that's a patriot versus leftists that just constantly lie.
[01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:17.737]  A patriot talks themselves down instead of up.
[01:23:17.737 --> 01:23:24.759]  And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but we have to stop worrying about if our boots are shined in this fight.
[01:23:24.759 --> 01:23:28.140]  We're in a war.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.621]  Period.
[01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:30.361]  And we're taking action.
[01:23:30.361 --> 01:23:31.541]  Let's go back to the President.
[01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:33.422]  Here he is about an hour ago declaring a national emergency.
[01:23:34.198 --> 01:23:35.579]  Down.
[01:23:35.579 --> 01:23:40.301]  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
[01:23:40.301 --> 01:23:42.562]  We have all the records.
[01:23:42.562 --> 01:23:43.422]  We have every record.
[01:23:43.422 --> 01:23:47.404]  But we're getting close to that point again where we'll create new records.
[01:23:47.404 --> 01:23:50.505]  So our country is doing very well economically.
[01:23:52.025 --> 01:23:58.267]  We've done a lot, but one of the things they said I have to do, and I want to do... He knows they're trying... Let's start all over.
[01:23:58.267 --> 01:23:59.567]  They're trying to kill the economy.
[01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:03.968]  And sure, it's fiat and it's a bubble, but he's actually trying to get some jobs and factories back, because we don't have that.
[01:24:03.968 --> 01:24:07.649]  If we're going to have a war, he's got to get the factories back.
[01:24:07.649 --> 01:24:09.329]  And believe me, the globalists want wars.
[01:24:09.329 --> 01:24:10.229]  We don't want wars.
[01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:17.911]  He's trying to pull troops out where we don't need them to get the money to actually build high-tech weapons to then be a deterrent from a war.
[01:24:17.911 --> 01:24:19.232]  Peace through strength.
[01:24:19.232 --> 01:24:20.432]  Very pragmatic.
[01:24:20.432 --> 01:24:20.872]  Let's continue.
[01:24:21.961 --> 01:24:24.123]  The market just went down.
[01:24:24.123 --> 01:24:28.847]  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
[01:24:28.847 --> 01:24:35.973]  We have all the records, we have every record, but we're getting close to that point again where we'll create new records.
[01:24:35.973 --> 01:24:41.438]  So our country is doing very well economically and we've done a lot.
[01:24:41.438 --> 01:24:49.285]  But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country.
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.361]  Much of it coming from the southern border.
[01:24:53.361 --> 01:25:02.966]  When you look, and when you listen to politicians, in particular certain Democrats, they say it all comes through the port of entry.
[01:25:02.966 --> 01:25:03.726]  It's wrong.
[01:25:03.726 --> 01:25:04.226]  It's wrong.
[01:25:04.226 --> 01:25:05.427]  It's just a lie.
[01:25:05.427 --> 01:25:06.628]  It's all a lie.
[01:25:06.628 --> 01:25:08.529]  They say walls don't work.
[01:25:08.529 --> 01:25:09.129]  Walls work 100%.
[01:25:17.515 --> 01:25:21.476]  You know they've got a bunch of synthetic heroin that's a hundred times stronger.
[01:25:21.476 --> 01:25:23.716]  It's got different names out of China.
[01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:29.998]  China officially mails that in en masse and it gets shipped in and it's a war.
[01:25:29.998 --> 01:25:33.418]  They execute you in China if you even have that stuff.
[01:25:33.418 --> 01:25:40.120]  Because they went through, they were taken down when opium got imported through the fake drug war and all the rest of it and the Boxer Rebellion.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.440]  But that's history hundreds of years ago.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.681]  They're hitting us with heroin
[01:25:47.372 --> 01:25:59.037]  Synthetic heroin 100 times stronger.
[01:25:59.037 --> 01:26:01.218]  Let's continue.
[01:26:01.218 --> 01:26:03.639]  Work 100%.
[01:26:03.639 --> 01:26:08.801]  Whether it's El Paso, I really was smiling because the other night I was in El Paso.
[01:26:08.801 --> 01:26:09.942]  We had a tremendous crowd.
[01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:13.226]  And tremendous crowd.
[01:26:13.226 --> 01:26:19.091]  And I asked the people, many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.
[01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:25.416]  And I asked them, I said, let me ask you, as a crowd, when the wall went up, was it better?
[01:26:25.416 --> 01:26:28.118]  You were there, some of you.
[01:26:28.118 --> 01:26:32.381]  It was not only better, it was like 100% better.
[01:26:32.381 --> 01:26:34.983]  You know what they did.
[01:26:34.983 --> 01:26:36.144]  But that's only one example.
[01:26:36.144 --> 01:26:37.325]  There are so many examples.
[01:26:38.615 --> 01:26:44.356]  In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.
[01:26:44.356 --> 01:26:45.517]  Oh yeah, let's stop right there.
[01:26:45.517 --> 01:26:50.838]  The media says Trump made it up that El Paso used to be really dangerous.
[01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.878]  El Paso is under martial law.
[01:26:52.878 --> 01:26:55.859]  It's been under martial law since Pancho Villa.
[01:26:55.859 --> 01:27:03.100]  And the police there, dealing with the cartels and things over the years, if you kill somebody, they just kill you and bury you.
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.581]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing, but the idea
[01:27:07.006 --> 01:27:08.527]  That it's safe.
[01:27:08.527 --> 01:27:11.989]  Well, yeah, because it's under unofficial martial law.
[01:27:11.989 --> 01:27:14.491]  Right over the border, it's not 2,000 murders, Trump.
[01:27:14.491 --> 01:27:17.433]  They found tens of thousands of graves.
[01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:23.897]  Back when Texas Monthly was a real magazine, I was a kid reading about all the mass graves across the border in El Paso and the severed heads.
[01:27:23.897 --> 01:27:31.562]  I mean, nobody, everybody knows about Mexico, but the idea that the Snopes fact checkers say that it's the safest city in the country.
[01:27:31.562 --> 01:27:35.985]  Yeah, El Paso is pretty safe because the police will kill you
[01:27:37.608 --> 01:27:38.749]  Like that.
[01:27:38.749 --> 01:27:39.309]  And the U.S.
[01:27:39.309 --> 01:27:42.031]  Army and Joint Task Force 6 is there.
[01:27:42.031 --> 01:27:46.114]  They have thousands of Army hitmen in the city.
[01:27:46.114 --> 01:27:50.577]  And anyone that's had family in the military knows that.
[01:27:50.577 --> 01:27:51.917]  And the cartels are crazy.
[01:27:51.917 --> 01:27:53.859]  They'll still keep trying to kill people and kidnap.
[01:27:53.859 --> 01:27:55.180]  And when they do, the U.S.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.221]  military kills them.
[01:27:57.221 --> 01:27:57.781]  Let's continue.
[01:27:57.781 --> 01:28:00.643]  The other side of the wall.
[01:28:00.643 --> 01:28:02.064]  And they had 23 murders.
[01:28:02.064 --> 01:28:02.865]  That's a lot of murders.
[01:28:04.548 --> 01:28:10.392]  But it's not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other side of the wall in Mexico.
[01:28:10.392 --> 01:28:13.154]  So everyone knows that walls work.
[01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:16.377]  And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.
[01:28:16.377 --> 01:28:19.819]  You just take a look almost everywhere.
[01:28:19.819 --> 01:28:22.642]  Take a look at Israel, they're building another wall.
[01:28:22.642 --> 01:28:24.443]  Their wall is 99.9% effective, they told me, 99.9%.
[01:28:24.443 --> 01:28:25.564]  That's what it would be with us too.
[01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.407]  The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.
[01:28:33.407 --> 01:28:36.749]  They go around the wall and in.
[01:28:36.749 --> 01:28:37.530]  Okay?
[01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:38.150]  That's what it is.
[01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:38.951]  Very simple.
[01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:50.319]  And Saudi Arabia doesn't take one glorious Palestinian or glorious Somali lecturing us how much we suck, but they're battling to get in the country.
[01:28:50.319 --> 01:28:52.580]  All right, Stuart Rose is about to get here.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.661]  He's coming to the studio.
[01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.502]  We're going to play more Trump speech.
[01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:56.123]  National Emergency.
[01:28:57.329 --> 01:29:00.911]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[01:29:00.911 --> 01:29:04.473]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.

[01:32:39.774 --> 01:32:42.416]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.685 --> 01:33:24.509]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:24.509 --> 01:33:26.310]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:33.656]  Look to the left and look to the right.
[01:33:33.656 --> 01:33:39.881]  But you will live in danger tonight.
[01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:47.167]  When the enemy comes, you will never be heard.
[01:34:15.663 --> 01:34:18.244]  Some heads are gonna roll!
[01:34:18.244 --> 01:34:27.446]  Well, we already know half the black people in this country never get out of their mother's womb, their heads are rolling.
[01:34:27.446 --> 01:34:33.248]  Whoever thinks about that, you think we're safe when children aren't safe?
[01:34:33.248 --> 01:34:40.330]  And I get calls from media like, you're against the KKK, you're against aborting black babies, but you talk about racist black gangs attacking people.
[01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:44.651]  Yeah, I'm against racist black people, I'm against racist white people.
[01:34:45.811 --> 01:34:48.413]  It's not like I'm on some team.
[01:34:48.413 --> 01:34:49.453]  I'm on Team Humanity.
[01:34:49.453 --> 01:34:50.654]  We're going to go back to Trump.
[01:34:50.654 --> 01:34:51.935]  This shirt rose a little bit late in traffic.
[01:34:51.935 --> 01:34:53.896]  It'll be our next segment.
[01:34:53.896 --> 01:34:58.479]  Founder of Oath Keepers, constitutional lawyer, patriot.
[01:34:58.479 --> 01:35:00.140]  We're going to be talking to him about this national emergency.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:08.066]  He'd been pushing for it hard, so have I. We're going to open the phones up next hour as well on this Thursday, Friday edition.
[01:35:08.066 --> 01:35:09.787]  My goodness, Thursday, Friday.
[01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:10.447]  Friday, February 15, 2019.
[01:35:10.447 --> 01:35:11.068]  Time is certainly flying.
[01:35:16.107 --> 01:35:24.413]  Before I go back to Trump, I planned every segment today to wear a different t-shirt, and I just get too focused on the news and don't do it.
[01:35:24.413 --> 01:35:25.674]  But if you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[01:35:25.674 --> 01:35:29.297]  It's Don't California My USA.
[01:35:29.297 --> 01:35:36.602]  And it's got Infowars.com on the right-hand shoulder with the American flag.
[01:35:36.602 --> 01:35:40.245]  And again, a lot of TV viewers are like, why are you always telling us what we're seeing?
[01:35:40.245 --> 01:35:43.047]  Our main audience is still radio, so I have to describe it.
[01:35:44.395 --> 01:35:52.162]  Don't California, MyUSA, Infowars.com, and the American flag.
[01:35:52.162 --> 01:35:53.743]  And does this one have something on the back?
[01:35:53.743 --> 01:36:01.269]  Oh, I guess it's got the Infowars symbol as well there on the left shoulder.
[01:36:01.269 --> 01:36:04.912]  The right shoulder is the American flag.
[01:36:04.912 --> 01:36:06.954]  And we've got a bunch of other just amazing shirts.
[01:36:06.954 --> 01:36:08.395]  And when you purchase them,
[01:36:10.612 --> 01:36:11.352]  You fund the operation.
[01:36:11.352 --> 01:36:13.453]  There's no reviews of this shirt because it just came in.
[01:36:13.453 --> 01:36:14.853]  It's brand new.
[01:36:14.853 --> 01:36:17.374]  And without you funding us, we will not be here.
[01:36:17.374 --> 01:36:20.795]  And again, even if you're not a big t-shirt person, we have some for women as well.
[01:36:20.795 --> 01:36:23.156]  Gold foil Moen lobby shirts that women love.
[01:36:23.156 --> 01:36:24.397]  We have some more shirts for women.
[01:36:24.397 --> 01:36:26.277]  Women have really been requesting it.
[01:36:26.277 --> 01:36:29.198]  But these shirts are all unisex, which will make the leftist happy.
[01:36:29.198 --> 01:36:31.719]  But we have some for the, you know, more of the female cut.
[01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:32.339]  They're quite nice.
[01:36:32.339 --> 01:36:34.420]  You know, my wife likes to wear them around.
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.361]  And it's kind of choose your own adventure.
[01:36:36.361 --> 01:36:37.421]  And I've tried to explain this before.
[01:36:38.723 --> 01:36:43.945]  You wear a big, in-your-face, red InfoWars shirt.
[01:36:43.945 --> 01:36:46.645]  In fact, click on that one right there, the red InfoWars.
[01:36:46.645 --> 01:36:49.726]  That's about as obnoxious as you're gonna get.
[01:36:49.726 --> 01:36:51.707]  And you're gonna meet a lot of friends and a lot of cool people.
[01:36:51.707 --> 01:36:57.729]  Look at that, it's got a bunch of reviews, five stars, 100% review.
[01:36:57.729 --> 01:37:00.870]  American flag, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com on the front.
[01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:03.191]  Things on the back too, let's look at the back.
[01:37:03.191 --> 01:37:04.371]  That shirt is the best seller.
[01:37:06.516 --> 01:37:10.077]  And that's for people that really want to, you know, go out and exercise the First Amendment.
[01:37:10.077 --> 01:37:14.218]  But, if you wear just an I.W.
[01:37:14.218 --> 01:37:17.499]  hat, only patriots know what that is.
[01:37:17.499 --> 01:37:20.360]  And then you're just getting the love, not the hate.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.622]  Or if you wear a Molon Labe, you don't think leftists can speak Latin or know that means come and take it.
[01:37:25.622 --> 01:37:25.942]  No.
[01:37:25.942 --> 01:37:30.203]  I mean, all they do is talk about how smart they are and listen to NPR and little snake voices all day.
[01:37:31.172 --> 01:37:33.253]  We've got over 100 t-shirts.
[01:37:33.253 --> 01:37:35.634]  Some are steadfast.
[01:37:35.634 --> 01:37:38.615]  One design I made 20 years ago.
[01:37:38.615 --> 01:37:39.675]  22 years ago now.
[01:37:39.675 --> 01:37:41.676]  Mass murderers agree gun control works.
[01:37:41.676 --> 01:37:45.317]  I sat there on Photoshop and put Hitler, Stalin, and Mao by each other.
[01:37:45.317 --> 01:37:50.079]  On the back it says, politicians love disarmed peasants.
[01:37:50.079 --> 01:37:52.080]  Which I got from a bumper sticker.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.241]  Then we've got all these great designer shirts from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on them.
[01:37:56.241 --> 01:37:58.022]  So we've got high-end shirts that are great.
[01:37:58.022 --> 01:37:59.283]  You know, it would be 50 bucks at the mall.
[01:37:59.283 --> 01:38:00.203]  They're 25 bucks here.
[01:38:02.674 --> 01:38:04.695]  We got other shirts that are as low as $9.95.
[01:38:04.695 --> 01:38:06.576]  It's all there.
[01:38:06.576 --> 01:38:07.356]  It's all there.
[01:38:07.356 --> 01:38:11.278]  Trump 2020.
[01:38:11.278 --> 01:38:13.759]  Won't tread on me.
[01:38:13.759 --> 01:38:14.499]  Re-elect 45.
[01:38:14.499 --> 01:38:17.141]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:18.321]  Hey, show them the George Washington.
[01:38:18.321 --> 01:38:20.762]  That's really good, soft, high-quality fabric.
[01:38:20.762 --> 01:38:23.604]  That's one of my favorite shirts I wear.
[01:38:23.604 --> 01:38:25.324]  Is the George Washington.
[01:38:25.324 --> 01:38:30.407]  And it's him from his... Before the French and Indian War, when he was a...
[01:38:31.977 --> 01:38:41.972]  Colonial Scout expanding the frontiers and as a scientist and as an engineer he was out there surveying.
[01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:47.933]  And so that's kind of the George Washington without the tomahawk and a musket in his hand.
[01:38:47.933 --> 01:38:49.194]  A great shirt.
[01:38:49.194 --> 01:38:51.417]  And like I said, the fabric's so good and so high quality.
[01:38:51.417 --> 01:38:54.179]  I think the shirt cost like seven, eight bucks.
[01:38:54.179 --> 01:38:56.381]  And so for $19.95, it is a great deal.
[01:38:56.381 --> 01:39:01.186]  The point is, you don't buy the products, we don't spread the word, we lose.
[01:39:01.186 --> 01:39:02.287]  You get them, we win.
[01:39:02.287 --> 01:39:04.229]  But I mean, it's an adventure.
[01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:05.931]  Don't California my USA.
[01:39:07.435 --> 01:39:09.055]  Who wouldn't want to wear a shirt like that?
[01:39:09.055 --> 01:39:14.357]  Or Alexandria Cortez as the dog that she is.
[01:39:14.357 --> 01:39:23.479]  I mean, that's insulting our canine friends, but she said, we'll have you subpoenaed or arrested, Donald Trump Jr., because you said socialists eat their dogs, capitalists walk them.
[01:39:23.479 --> 01:39:25.420]  So I said, OK, well, we'll just put that shirt on.
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:27.260]  And I predict it to be a bestseller.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:27.600]  It is.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.481]  And I've done two runs.
[01:39:29.481 --> 01:39:30.281]  This is the last run.
[01:39:30.281 --> 01:39:33.802]  We're talking about the new variant of a Cortez shirt.
[01:39:33.802 --> 01:39:36.843]  But this limited edition is about to go the way of the Goonie Bird.
[01:39:37.697 --> 01:39:39.159]  Which means extinct.
[01:39:39.159 --> 01:39:40.862]  So if you want it, InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:39:46.383 --> 01:39:54.329]  And please don't forget, if you're listening on local AM and FM stations or watching on TV, it is vital you tell people about it, and that you text message folks, and that you email.
[01:39:54.329 --> 01:39:56.691]  That's where the censors still can't block you.
[01:39:56.691 --> 01:39:59.333]  And I'm not complaining like, please do this, please do that.
[01:39:59.333 --> 01:40:12.704]  It's the animating, joyful, joy of war, joy of fighting back with the truth, standing up for the unborn, standing up for the Second Amendment, standing up for sovereignty, and realizing they want to bully us, they want to intimidate us, they want to shut us up, and we're just not going to do it.
[01:40:14.397 --> 01:40:19.939]  Two big specials in this Sunday, because we're low on Brain Force Plus, our nootropic.
[01:40:19.939 --> 01:40:22.759]  It's our best-selling overall, it's not our most profitable, but it is the best-selling.
[01:40:22.759 --> 01:40:26.641]  We sell more bottles than anything else of Brain Force.
[01:40:26.641 --> 01:40:31.862]  50% off, partnered for 33% off, together with Turbo Force.
[01:40:31.862 --> 01:40:35.403]  Brain Force Plus is a nootropic, and it's amazing.
[01:40:35.403 --> 01:40:36.664]  Focus, clarity.
[01:40:38.103 --> 01:40:41.047]  But then, turbo force is everything.
[01:40:41.047 --> 01:40:46.593]  And it's long-delivered, healthy, natural energy with the vitamins, with the minerals, with the amino acids.
[01:40:46.593 --> 01:40:50.818]  Now, there are co-factors that deliver it through the blood-brain barrier.
[01:40:50.818 --> 01:40:52.820]  And into the body.
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:57.226]  So, infowarrestore.com, infowarslife.com, but just viewer discretion advised.
[01:40:58.618 --> 01:41:06.682]  You need to take probably a half packet the first time you take it, because I set out to make the strongest, healthy, beyond energy drink, beyond pre-workout, and that's TurboForce.
[01:41:06.682 --> 01:41:08.884]  So you get it by itself at 3% off.
[01:41:08.884 --> 01:41:14.607]  Get it 33% off with TurboForce, with BrainForce+, 50% off.
[01:41:14.607 --> 01:41:18.649]  And now, it's very simple.
[01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:22.691]  The average high-end energy bar cost them over a dollar to produce.
[01:41:22.691 --> 01:41:25.213]  They sell them at Whole Foods for five or six or seven dollars.
[01:41:26.201 --> 01:41:32.381]  We went to top manufacturers, top developers, and said we want the very best, high quality, organic.
[01:41:34.403 --> 01:41:44.508]  Best tasting, we did a bunch of beta testing, different companies, with the crew and others, even did some focus groups, and we came up with Protein Bar from InfoWars Life.
[01:41:44.508 --> 01:41:53.033]  And it's in the vanilla coconut, which is my favorite, and I also like the chocolate peanut butter, but I mean, I'm not a big peanut butter guy, I don't hate peanut butter, it's just not my thing.
[01:41:53.033 --> 01:41:53.973]  They're both excellent.
[01:41:53.973 --> 01:41:56.675]  People go, my God, I've never had a protein bar that's good.
[01:41:56.675 --> 01:41:57.195]  I'm like, I know.
[01:41:57.195 --> 01:42:00.977]  We went out and said, what's the top rated bars in the country?
[01:42:03.141 --> 01:42:06.202]  And how do we top them and then cut the price?
[01:42:06.202 --> 01:42:07.742]  So they come in 12 packs.
[01:42:07.742 --> 01:42:09.963]  There's no reviews yet, but believe me, the reviews are gonna be amazing.
[01:42:09.963 --> 01:42:20.405]  If you'll just buy your coffee and buy your protein bars and buy your toothpaste from us, it's all high quality, it's all high-end, it's all really good, and it stands in the way of the global.
[01:42:20.405 --> 01:42:25.907]  So I'm done plugging for this hour, but InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:25.907 --> 01:42:30.308]  And I wanna, again, thank the listeners because I know they're trying to shut us down, trying to block us everywhere, but you,
[01:42:31.747 --> 01:42:34.448]  It's like literally I'm Houdini in a tank.
[01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:35.108]  Chained up.
[01:42:35.108 --> 01:42:37.529]  Only you can screw the top off of the thing to get me out of here.
[01:42:37.529 --> 01:42:39.549]  And by getting me out, you get yourself out.
[01:42:39.549 --> 01:42:41.450]  Because Lord knows we beat Hillary.
[01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:43.991]  Lord knows we relaunched 1776 Worldwide.
[01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:44.991]  Lord knows you did it.
[01:42:44.991 --> 01:42:47.952]  And now they want my head in the basket.
[01:42:47.952 --> 01:42:51.393]  Well, they're not gonna get it without a big ol' fat juicy fight.
[01:42:51.393 --> 01:42:54.834]  We've already had some big victories, but I think we've got some even bigger ones coming.
[01:42:54.834 --> 01:42:55.594]  Keep me in the game.
[01:43:06.584 --> 01:43:15.547]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.547 --> 01:43:25.669]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:34.212]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.032 --> 01:43:36.392]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.392 --> 01:43:37.553]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.553 --> 01:43:39.473]  It is a total game changer.
[01:43:39.473 --> 01:43:44.534]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.534 --> 01:43:46.055]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.055 --> 01:43:47.535]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.535 --> 01:43:54.237]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.237 --> 01:43:55.717]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:43:57.162 --> 01:44:02.586]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:44:02.586 --> 01:44:04.367]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:44:04.367 --> 01:44:06.128]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[01:44:06.128 --> 01:44:07.969]  Now, I can make them strong.
[01:44:07.969 --> 01:44:09.610]  Now, I can instruct them.
[01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.351]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:44:11.351 --> 01:44:12.332]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:44:12.452 --> 01:44:17.575]  You think in this digital age, your words go on forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:44:17.575 --> 01:44:23.159]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:44:23.159 --> 01:44:26.801]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:44:26.801 --> 01:44:31.785]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:44:31.785 --> 01:44:38.569]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:42.432]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:44:42.432 --> 01:44:50.079]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:44:50.079 --> 01:44:58.727]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:44:58.727 --> 01:45:03.651]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[01:45:04.913 --> 01:45:10.835]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[01:45:10.835 --> 01:45:12.435]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:12.435 --> 01:45:12.935]  We stopped her.
[01:45:12.935 --> 01:45:15.116]  We got a nationalist in.
[01:45:15.116 --> 01:45:17.317]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:45:17.317 --> 01:45:19.077]  We are winning.
[01:45:19.077 --> 01:45:24.619]  But those of us who are at the very front line, at the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented attack.
[01:45:24.619 --> 01:45:29.680]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.801]  This is about who wants it most.
[01:45:32.242 --> 01:45:35.785]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[01:45:35.785 --> 01:45:37.906]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:45:37.906 --> 01:45:41.129]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[01:45:41.129 --> 01:45:42.250]  It's that simple.
[01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:43.671]  Thousands of great products.
[01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:49.835]  Whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWareShore.com.

[01:45:57.922 --> 01:45:58.222]  Thank you.
[01:45:58.842 --> 01:46:04.865]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.865 --> 01:46:07.806]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:46:07.806 --> 01:46:12.369]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[01:46:13.433 --> 01:46:22.564]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.564 --> 01:46:27.930]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:41.381]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.381 --> 01:46:42.942]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.942 --> 01:46:44.923]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.923 --> 01:46:47.445]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.445 --> 01:46:52.448]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.448 --> 01:46:57.851]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:47:00.743 --> 01:47:04.004]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.004 --> 01:47:28.294]  And it all crashes down And you break your crown And you put your finger But there's no one around Just one one thing That's a blade of king But the castles crumble And you're left with just a thing Where's your crown king?
[01:47:28.294 --> 01:47:28.814]  Nothing!
[01:47:37.782 --> 01:47:42.184]  Stuart Rhodes, Patriot, head of Oath Keepers, is just now pulling it up.
[01:47:42.184 --> 01:47:43.084]  He'll be in the next segment.
[01:47:43.084 --> 01:47:47.506]  I think he's here right now.
[01:47:47.506 --> 01:47:50.328]  And I want to open the phones up next hour.
[01:47:50.328 --> 01:48:05.735]  On any issue you want to cover, but really I think the mainstay with the guests we're going to have is the constitutional emergency, the national emergency, what's happening on the border, the President's absolutely authorized, and just the... everyone overuses the term bombshell.
[01:48:07.233 --> 01:48:12.034]  But it's bombshell when the governor of Virginia says we're going to kill babies after they're born.
[01:48:12.034 --> 01:48:15.654]  And then different states are signing that into law as we speak.
[01:48:15.654 --> 01:48:18.195]  New York's already done it.
[01:48:18.195 --> 01:48:29.117]  And it's bombshell, to use that term, from World War I, explosive, that Pelosi said, hey, watch out, Democrats might declare an emergency and take the guns.
[01:48:29.117 --> 01:48:34.718]  She said that in some black Darth Vader outfit today.
[01:48:34.718 --> 01:48:35.518]  I already played it.
[01:48:35.518 --> 01:48:36.458]  We'll play it again with Stewart's here.
[01:48:38.007 --> 01:48:41.368]  And see, we kind of just get punch-drunk to this, like, what?
[01:48:41.368 --> 01:48:42.788]  Kill babies after they're born now?
[01:48:42.788 --> 01:48:54.932]  And, you know, 7, 8, 9, 10-year-old kids, 3-year-old kids are putting money in G-strings of fat dudes at gay bars?
[01:48:54.932 --> 01:48:55.532]  And vice versa?
[01:48:55.532 --> 01:49:00.074]  And it's just like, it's like, they're like, yeah, that Jones is crazy, Howard Stern said.
[01:49:00.074 --> 01:49:04.495]  He says little kids are at gay bars dancing for men.
[01:49:05.964 --> 01:49:09.687]  And they all laugh about it and they don't tell you, no, that's actually happening.
[01:49:09.687 --> 01:49:10.547]  I'm not the crazy one.
[01:49:10.547 --> 01:49:14.630]  It's like, yeah, Jones is crazy.
[01:49:14.630 --> 01:49:25.738]  He says that the British government worked with Jimmy Savelle and he raped hundreds of dead children and also killed children, but they'd have sex with the kids at parties at the hospital.
[01:49:25.738 --> 01:49:28.479]  And then people go look it up and they go, my God, that's true.
[01:49:28.479 --> 01:49:29.020]  Yeah.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:30.901]  See, I'm not the weirdo.
[01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:33.223]  I'm not taking the DMT and the ayahuasca.
[01:49:36.115 --> 01:49:41.720]  In San Francisco, at military bases, and I'm not talking to aliens, I've never done that.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.440]  They think they are.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:48.225]  And these aliens tell them, hey, go murder children and we'll give you more power.
[01:49:48.225 --> 01:49:50.527]  Now, I think of that as a demon, don't you?
[01:49:50.527 --> 01:49:58.694]  But, I mean, I'm not the one in contact with Mescalito.
[01:49:58.694 --> 01:50:00.096]  I'm not the one doing this.
[01:50:00.096 --> 01:50:01.757]  I'm reporting what's going on.
[01:50:01.757 --> 01:50:02.638]  I know it's insane.
[01:50:06.917 --> 01:50:10.540]  It's like Senator Menendez says.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:15.744]  People that are here illegally, that drunk drive, they're not criminals.
[01:50:15.744 --> 01:50:19.728]  They're like... So drunk driving isn't a criminal act now?
[01:50:19.728 --> 01:50:20.788]  And being here illegally?
[01:50:20.788 --> 01:50:21.769]  No, no, it's not.
[01:50:21.769 --> 01:50:22.310]  We played the clip.
[01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:24.411]  You're like, well that doesn't make sense, that's discrediting.
[01:50:24.411 --> 01:50:24.912]  No.
[01:50:24.912 --> 01:50:27.214]  They're overriding logic.
[01:50:27.214 --> 01:50:29.075]  They're overriding judgment.
[01:50:29.075 --> 01:50:30.216]  They're breaking our will.
[01:50:30.216 --> 01:50:31.617]  They're doing it on purpose.
[01:50:31.617 --> 01:50:32.798]  Because they're taking over.
[01:50:32.798 --> 01:50:34.960]  They're engaged in criminal activity.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.881]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:50:41.155 --> 01:50:48.598]  Yeah, today Trump highlighted angel moms as Jim Acosta claims border crisis manufactured and there is no caravan.
[01:50:48.598 --> 01:50:50.799]  He did it again.
[01:50:50.799 --> 01:50:54.861]  So let's go back to the president declaring the national emergency that we told you about back in October.
[01:50:54.861 --> 01:50:56.902]  Next year's news today, here it is.
[01:50:56.902 --> 01:51:00.184]  I go around the wall and in.
[01:51:00.184 --> 01:51:00.984]  Okay?
[01:51:00.984 --> 01:51:03.265]  That's what it is, very simple.
[01:51:03.265 --> 01:51:07.747]  And a big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads, don't go through ports of entry.
[01:51:09.226 --> 01:51:10.786]  They can't go through ports of entry.
[01:51:10.786 --> 01:51:18.708]  You can't take big loads, because you have people, you have some very capable people, the border patrol, law enforcement, looking.
[01:51:18.708 --> 01:51:28.150]  You can't take human traffic, women and girls, you can't take them through ports of entry, you can't have them tied up in the back seat of a car or a truck.
[01:51:28.150 --> 01:51:30.150]  Back it up ten seconds.
[01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:32.131]  Thanks.
[01:51:32.131 --> 01:51:36.452]  Remember just last week, seems like a hundred years ago?
[01:51:36.452 --> 01:51:37.592]  Was it last week or was it Monday?
[01:51:38.854 --> 01:51:40.455]  The State of the Union?
[01:51:40.455 --> 01:51:41.115]  Was it Tuesday?
[01:51:41.115 --> 01:51:46.078]  What day was State of the Union?
[01:51:46.078 --> 01:51:47.439]  It already seems like 100 years ago.
[01:51:47.439 --> 01:51:48.100]  It was a couple days ago.
[01:51:49.127 --> 01:51:58.750]  You've got Cortez, and you've got Harris, and you've got Pelosi not standing up when he says we busted 3,000 women that had been kidnapped and hundreds of kids.
[01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:59.870]  We freed them.
[01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:00.751]  And they wouldn't stand up.
[01:52:00.751 --> 01:52:02.311]  They looked all pissed.
[01:52:02.311 --> 01:52:05.852]  Because these people want to kill babies for their organs.
[01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:07.653]  They're getting money from the cartels.
[01:52:07.653 --> 01:52:12.314]  Even mainstream news is now reporting the Democrats are getting money from the Mexican mafia and MS-13.
[01:52:12.314 --> 01:52:13.855]  They have no bottom!
[01:52:19.178 --> 01:52:21.839]  They will destroy this country.
[01:52:21.839 --> 01:52:27.943]  Even Amnesty International reports 80% of women coming from Central America through Mexico get raped.
[01:52:27.943 --> 01:52:30.864]  We're always hearing about how bad American culture is.
[01:52:30.864 --> 01:52:32.505]  And I'm not even attacking Mexico.
[01:52:32.505 --> 01:52:38.688]  It has good Christian people there, but there's a certain percentage of the public that thinks raping women is normal.
[01:52:38.688 --> 01:52:41.149]  So if the Muslims are doing it, they're good.
[01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:42.350]  If the Mexicans are doing it, they're good.
[01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:45.852]  If we're not raping, statistically, very much in the U.S., we're all rapists.
[01:52:46.843 --> 01:52:54.635]  In fact, Gillette says, and feminists say, if you say, hey, ma'am, you're very attractive or you're a very nice person, who are you?
[01:52:54.635 --> 01:52:57.399]  Talking to a woman is rape.
[01:52:59.565 --> 01:53:07.610]  But if you rape them, or cut their genitals off, as long as you go, and wear a hood over your head, everything's okay.
[01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:09.150]  You're a suicide bomber, then it's cool.
[01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:10.971]  It's like, oh God, you're blowing your kids up.
[01:53:10.971 --> 01:53:12.652]  My God, you're a Palestinian, you're wonderful.
[01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:16.434]  You blow your kids up with TNT wrapped around them.
[01:53:16.434 --> 01:53:19.856]  Man, oh my, oh, you're such a good person.
[01:53:19.856 --> 01:53:22.058]  Teach me how I can be an Islam, please, right now.
[01:53:22.058 --> 01:53:25.239]  Can I learn about suicide bombing right now?
[01:53:25.239 --> 01:53:26.120]  Sorry, let's go back to the president.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:30.141]  Girls, you can't take them through ports of entry.
[01:53:30.141 --> 01:53:34.702]  You can't have them tied up in the back seat of a car or a truck or a van.
[01:53:34.702 --> 01:53:35.543]  They open the door.
[01:53:35.543 --> 01:53:36.223]  They look.
[01:53:36.223 --> 01:53:42.845]  They can't see three women with tape in their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.
[01:53:42.845 --> 01:53:46.006]  They go through areas where you have no wall.
[01:53:46.006 --> 01:53:46.986]  Everybody knows that.
[01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:48.787]  Nancy knows it.
[01:53:48.787 --> 01:53:49.627]  Chuck knows it.
[01:53:49.627 --> 01:53:51.368]  They all know it.
[01:53:51.368 --> 01:53:52.228]  It's all a big lie.
[01:53:52.228 --> 01:53:54.089]  It's a big con game.
[01:53:54.089 --> 01:53:55.009]  You don't have to be
[01:53:57.023 --> 01:53:59.344]  Very smart to know.
[01:53:59.344 --> 01:54:05.268]  You put up a barrier, the people come in and that's it.
[01:54:05.268 --> 01:54:08.630]  They can't do anything unless they walk left or right.
[01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:12.072]  And they find an area where there's no barrier and they come into the United States.
[01:54:12.072 --> 01:54:13.853]  Welcome.
[01:54:13.853 --> 01:54:15.814]  We've detained more people.
[01:54:15.814 --> 01:54:18.836]  Our border agents are doing such incredible work.
[01:54:18.836 --> 01:54:23.779]  Our military has been incredible.
[01:54:23.779 --> 01:54:25.280]  We put up barbed wire.
[01:54:26.539 --> 01:54:32.283]  On top of certain old walls that were there, we fixed the wall, and we loaded up with barbed wire.
[01:54:32.283 --> 01:54:34.564]  It's very successful.
[01:54:34.564 --> 01:54:38.787]  But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.
[01:54:38.787 --> 01:54:40.468]  And it's very necessary.
[01:54:40.468 --> 01:54:42.730]  We've broken up two caravans that are on their way.
[01:54:42.730 --> 01:54:44.211]  They just are breaking.
[01:54:44.211 --> 01:54:46.412]  They're in the process of breaking up.
[01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:48.674]  We have another one that we haven't been able to break up yet.
[01:54:48.674 --> 01:54:53.357]  We've been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.
[01:54:53.357 --> 01:54:54.717]  I want to thank the president.
[01:54:54.717 --> 01:54:55.278]  I want to thank
[01:54:56.232 --> 01:54:57.893]  Mexico, they have their own problems.
[01:54:57.893 --> 01:55:01.755]  They have the largest number of murders that they've ever had in their history.
[01:55:01.755 --> 01:55:03.176]  Almost 40,000 murders.
[01:55:03.176 --> 01:55:03.296]  40,000!
[01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:06.318]  It's 200,000.
[01:55:06.318 --> 01:55:08.800]  They got to straighten that out and I think they will.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:15.864]  But I just want to thank the president because he's been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.
[01:55:15.864 --> 01:55:18.505]  We had one that was up to over 15,000 people.
[01:55:18.505 --> 01:55:21.267]  It's largely broken up.
[01:55:21.267 --> 01:55:22.348]  Others have gotten through.
[01:55:23.852 --> 01:55:26.173]  And in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.
[01:55:26.173 --> 01:55:35.555]  If we didn't have the wall up, and if we didn't have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through, they'd be welcome to the United States.
[01:55:35.555 --> 01:55:41.377]  One of the things we'd save tremendous, just a tremendous amount on, would be sending the military.
[01:55:41.377 --> 01:55:43.277]  If we had a wall, we don't need the military.
[01:55:43.277 --> 01:55:46.518]  Because we'd have a wall.
[01:55:46.518 --> 01:55:48.219]  So, I'm gonna be signing a
[01:55:49.671 --> 01:55:52.273]  National emergency.
[01:55:52.273 --> 01:55:55.515]  And it's been signed many times before.
[01:55:55.515 --> 01:56:04.301]  It's been signed by other presidents from 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power.
[01:56:04.301 --> 01:56:06.323]  There's rarely been a problem.
[01:56:06.323 --> 01:56:08.805]  They signed it, nobody cares.
[01:56:08.805 --> 01:56:11.326]  I guess they weren't very exciting, but nobody cares.
[01:56:11.326 --> 01:56:16.770]  They signed it for far less important things in some cases, in many cases.
[01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:18.992]  We're talking about an invasion of our country.
[01:56:21.670 --> 01:56:29.096]  With drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.
[01:56:29.096 --> 01:56:30.837]  We have some of the greatest people I know.
[01:56:30.837 --> 01:56:35.541]  They've been with me from the beginning of my campaign, almost from the first week, the angel moms.
[01:56:35.541 --> 01:56:38.664]  Unfortunately, we have new angel moms.
[01:56:38.664 --> 01:56:44.749]  One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who we're talking about killed in the year of 18.
[01:56:44.749 --> 01:56:47.371]  I said, I haven't seen you before.
[01:56:47.371 --> 01:56:48.312]  She said, no, I'm new.
[01:56:48.312 --> 01:56:50.333]  I said, that's too bad.
[01:56:50.333 --> 01:56:50.934]  It's too bad.
[01:56:52.768 --> 01:56:54.869]  It's so sad.
[01:56:54.869 --> 01:56:56.110]  Stand up just for a second.
[01:56:56.110 --> 01:56:58.691]  Show how beautiful your girl was.
[01:56:58.691 --> 01:57:00.973]  And Jim Acosta says this doesn't exist.
[01:57:00.973 --> 01:57:03.474]  Nobody's getting killed in Mexico.
[01:57:03.474 --> 01:57:04.075]  Thank you.
[01:57:04.075 --> 01:57:05.816]  I have such respect for these people.
[01:57:05.816 --> 01:57:09.137]  Angel moms, angel dads, angel families.
[01:57:09.137 --> 01:57:10.538]  I have great respect for these people.
[01:57:10.538 --> 01:57:12.259]  These are great people.
[01:57:12.259 --> 01:57:13.280]  These are great people.
[01:57:15.345 --> 01:57:20.449]  They're fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
[01:57:20.449 --> 01:57:26.254]  And by the way, more and more of the drug gangs are the shadow army of the Democrats, but more importantly, Antifa is.
[01:57:26.254 --> 01:57:36.543]  The Portland city just voted to kick the FBI out of the city, which I'm normally going to say, well, that's state's rights, but because the FBI is investigating Antifa attacking and killing people.
[01:57:37.486 --> 01:57:40.512]  Because a lot of the city council employees are Antifa.
[01:57:40.512 --> 01:57:42.677]  They are a criminal group.
[01:57:42.677 --> 01:57:46.124]  So they are now the city openly backing a paramilitary brownshirt force.
[01:57:48.058 --> 01:57:55.001]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the Brain Synergy Combo is here.

[01:58:13.690 --> 01:58:19.854]  With this combo, you can have energy wherever you need it.

[01:58:48.452 --> 01:58:53.416]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3.
[01:58:53.416 --> 01:58:58.300]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:02.283]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[01:59:02.283 --> 01:59:03.684]  This is high end.
[01:59:03.684 --> 01:59:06.946]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[01:59:06.946 --> 01:59:11.030]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[01:59:11.630 --> 01:59:20.514]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[01:59:20.514 --> 01:59:22.955]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:22.955 --> 01:59:23.355]  It's simple.
[01:59:23.355 --> 01:59:28.958]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[01:59:29.438 --> 01:59:30.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:10.681]  You found it.
[02:00:10.681 --> 02:00:12.702]  The tip of the spear.
[02:00:12.702 --> 02:00:18.845]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:18.845 --> 02:00:23.567]  Angel moms, angel dads, angel families have great respect for these people.
[02:00:23.567 --> 02:00:25.288]  These are great people.
[02:00:25.288 --> 02:00:28.350]  These are great people.
[02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:34.813]  They're fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
[02:00:34.813 --> 02:00:37.054]  And the press doesn't cover them.
[02:00:37.054 --> 02:00:37.715]  They don't want to.
[02:00:37.715 --> 02:00:38.395]  Incredibly.
[02:00:40.109 --> 02:00:42.570]  And they're not treated the way they should be.
[02:00:42.570 --> 02:00:50.554]  They're fighting for other people because they don't want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.
[02:00:50.554 --> 02:00:55.336]  We have one young lady whose husband, please stand up.
[02:00:55.336 --> 02:00:59.998]  Your husband was just killed in Maryland.
[02:00:59.998 --> 02:01:06.801]  Incredible man, just killed.
[02:01:06.801 --> 02:01:07.682]  Beautiful children.
[02:01:08.499 --> 02:01:10.682]  By the way, what Trump's doing here is really important.
[02:01:10.682 --> 02:01:11.163]  He's humanizing.
[02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:12.945]  The media will never cover people killed by illegal aliens.
[02:01:26.104 --> 02:01:27.224]  Americans.
[02:01:27.224 --> 02:01:30.405]  Stuart Rose, we're going to get to more of his declaration a few hours ago.
[02:01:30.405 --> 02:01:36.747]  And of course, you're a constitutional law graduate, have practiced law, but you've dedicated yourself down to Oath Keepers that you founded.
[02:01:36.747 --> 02:01:47.010]  But specifically, as a veteran and a patriot, you wanted Trump to declare an emergency, but you're saying he didn't have to do it through the 70s law.
[02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:54.293]  No, he didn't have to use the 1976 Declaration of Emergencies Act.
[02:01:54.293 --> 02:01:58.255]  He could have just pointed to his responsibilities as the Commander-in-Chief.
[02:01:58.255 --> 02:02:00.337]  In fact, he didn't have to declare an emergency at all.
[02:02:00.337 --> 02:02:06.100]  All he had to do was issue the orders to the military to go to the border and secure them against military enemies.
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:09.502]  The cartels are unconventional warfare.
[02:02:09.502 --> 02:02:13.485]  Yeah, the President doesn't need authorization if the Chinese launch ICBMs.
[02:02:13.485 --> 02:02:16.147]  And so if the border is being overrun, he doesn't have to go...
[02:02:16.747 --> 02:02:19.008]  Well, yeah, and the cartels are international terrorists.
[02:02:19.008 --> 02:02:23.849]  They use the force and the threat of force to control terrain inside of Mexico.
[02:02:23.849 --> 02:02:25.470]  They're very much like Pancho Villa was.
[02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:26.510]  They use terror.
[02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:27.951]  Yeah, they use terror.
[02:02:27.951 --> 02:02:33.552]  And inside the United States, along the border, along the entire border, there are towns that are half-illegal alien.
[02:02:33.552 --> 02:02:42.095]  Just the other day, I was down in Eagle Pass, and a Marine Corps veteran and law enforcement veteran there gave us a tour and let us know that half the citizens, half the people there, are illegal aliens.
[02:02:42.615 --> 02:02:45.816]  20,000 American citizens and another 20,000 illegal aliens.
[02:02:45.816 --> 02:02:47.877]  And the cartel runs that town.
[02:02:47.877 --> 02:02:49.077]  They control everything.
[02:02:49.077 --> 02:02:53.338]  And so they use force through the force to control behavior and control politicians.
[02:02:53.338 --> 02:02:56.599]  That's the current definition in federal law of terrorism.
[02:02:56.599 --> 02:02:57.639]  And they are international.
[02:02:57.639 --> 02:02:59.960]  So they're an international terrorist organization.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:02.720]  You should say they are just like ISIS, just like Al Qaeda.
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.962]  They are international terrorists in the war on terror, global war on terror, and their unconventional warfare.
[02:03:09.143 --> 02:03:14.887]  We're taking over territory in Mexico and in the United States.
[02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:21.411]  And by the way, you and I have been big opponents of creeping, mission creep, martial law, police state.
[02:03:21.411 --> 02:03:22.692]  This is the opposite.
[02:03:22.692 --> 02:03:27.776]  Letting cartels take over is the definition of a foreign terroristic police state.
[02:03:27.776 --> 02:03:31.639]  It's the duty of the executive branch and the president to stop it.
[02:03:31.639 --> 02:03:35.962]  It's the primary function of government is to preserve life, liberty, and property.
[02:03:36.662 --> 02:03:39.144]  And to guarantee to our posterity the blessings of liberty.
[02:03:39.144 --> 02:03:46.509]  National defense is the most important function of our government and the most important function of the President as Commander-in-Chief.
[02:03:46.509 --> 02:03:51.672]  That's why in Article 2 it says he will be the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and of the militia.
[02:03:51.672 --> 02:03:54.794]  That's us, when called into service, period.
[02:03:54.794 --> 02:04:01.419]  And he has obligation and duty to carry out all the guarantees, including guaranteeing each state a Republican form of government.
[02:04:01.419 --> 02:04:06.262]  It says there that the national government will guarantee to each state a Republican form of government.
[02:04:06.722 --> 02:04:14.784]  If you have the cartels taking over your counties and towns and your sheriff departments and your police chiefs, how is that a Republican form of government?
[02:04:14.784 --> 02:04:22.165]  And as you know, for 10 years, Arizona, 30, 40, 50 miles in has signs saying, do not go down, we're talking concrete roads in some cases, this is controlled by cartels.
[02:04:22.165 --> 02:04:22.786]  Exactly.
[02:04:22.786 --> 02:04:24.166]  We can't guarantee your safety.
[02:04:24.166 --> 02:04:26.126]  We advise you not to camp here.
[02:04:26.126 --> 02:04:26.887]  So the U.S.
[02:04:26.887 --> 02:04:28.487]  has been, for over a decade, giving up
[02:04:29.207 --> 02:04:31.028]  Continental United States Territory.
[02:04:31.028 --> 02:04:31.548]  Precisely.
[02:04:31.548 --> 02:04:36.371]  And it's exactly a direct parallel to 1916 when you had Pancho Villa.
[02:04:36.371 --> 02:04:39.133]  There was a civil war in Mexico after the Mexican Revolution.
[02:04:39.133 --> 02:04:40.693]  Hold on, let's recap it.
[02:04:40.693 --> 02:04:48.058]  Stuart Rhodes, who again has his law degree and is an expert and has also worked in Congress, to get into where we currently are, what the President needs to do next.
[02:04:48.058 --> 02:04:50.079]  But I think this is a big step in the right direction.
[02:04:50.079 --> 02:04:52.480]  I don't want to give the President too much heat for this to be the right.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.841]  It's not even an emergency, it's his duty.
[02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:14.467]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.467 --> 02:05:24.549]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:33.072]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:33.912 --> 02:05:35.253]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.253 --> 02:05:36.413]  You must experience it.
[02:05:36.413 --> 02:05:38.374]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:05:38.374 --> 02:05:43.417]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.417 --> 02:05:44.938]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:44.938 --> 02:05:46.419]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:46.419 --> 02:05:53.102]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.102 --> 02:05:54.603]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:06:02.654 --> 02:06:04.497]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:04.497 --> 02:06:08.883]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:41.618 --> 02:06:47.583]  Stuart Rose, founder of Oath Keepers, Army veteran, good friend of mine, known him probably 16, 17 years since he started the organization.
[02:06:47.583 --> 02:06:51.686]  Of course, Yale Law graduate, used to practice law, don't do that anymore, full-time.
[02:06:51.686 --> 02:06:52.867]  What's going on at, uh...
[02:06:55.051 --> 02:07:00.754]  This is the nation fighting for its survival, and some stations don't carry the last five minutes, so let's recap this.
[02:07:00.754 --> 02:07:03.355]  We're not criticizing the president.
[02:07:03.355 --> 02:07:16.562]  Overall, I think what you're saying is we're defending what he's done, but he doesn't need this 1970s law to declare this emergency when the continental country's being threatened, and the UN's running it, and things are collapsing.
[02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:19.924]  You've got drug cartels taking over major towns all over the Southwest.
[02:07:21.294 --> 02:07:23.376]  He better be doing what he's doing.
[02:07:23.376 --> 02:07:25.858]  Yeah, he needs to do it as the Commander-in-Chief, though.
[02:07:25.858 --> 02:07:36.726]  Instead of putting it only in the box of fighting crime and drugs and human trafficking, he needs to articulate the reality that the cartels are military enemies.
[02:07:36.726 --> 02:07:40.409]  And the direct parallel, which is very important, is Pancho Villa.
[02:07:40.409 --> 02:07:46.274]  When Pancho Villa and his bandits took over northern Mexico, Mexico City could not stop them, could not control them.
[02:07:46.274 --> 02:07:48.936]  Just like today, Mexico City can't stop the cartels.
[02:07:48.936 --> 02:07:49.977]  Pancho Villa raided them.
[02:07:50.137 --> 02:07:52.960]  If you don't play games and stuff, you just wipe them out.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:58.985]  Well, yeah, when Pancho Villa raided into Texas and killed 18 Americans, the cartel has killed far more than that, obviously.
[02:07:58.985 --> 02:07:59.446]  Thousands.
[02:07:59.446 --> 02:08:00.487]  Yeah, thousands.
[02:08:00.487 --> 02:08:05.912]  And so, Wilson, President Wilson, in 1916, responded to this situation by sending the U.S.
[02:08:05.912 --> 02:08:15.581]  military down, a National Guard, down to the border to secure the border, and then he sent General Blackjack Pershing into Mexico to take it to Pancho Villa and go hunt him down.
[02:08:16.261 --> 02:08:17.621]  So that's what they did back then.
[02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:19.642]  It was a military defense of the nation.
[02:08:19.642 --> 02:08:20.942]  Again, it's a defense.
[02:08:20.942 --> 02:08:23.823]  It's not a technical invasion to take the country.
[02:08:23.823 --> 02:08:25.863]  You have to go into the base and take it out.
[02:08:25.863 --> 02:08:36.485]  Well, yeah, because Mexico City, the nominal leader of Mexico at the time, the president of Mexico, could not control his own territory, could not control Mexico.
[02:08:36.485 --> 02:08:37.506]  And so the U.S.
[02:08:37.506 --> 02:08:38.706]  Army had to go do it.
[02:08:38.706 --> 02:08:39.906]  And we're in a similar situation.
[02:08:39.906 --> 02:08:42.447]  Mexico City does not control northern Mexico.
[02:08:42.447 --> 02:08:43.267]  The cartels do.
[02:08:43.567 --> 02:08:45.909]  That's right, Mexico is a fallen, failed state.
[02:08:45.909 --> 02:08:48.451]  It's a fallen narco state, a failed narco state.
[02:08:48.451 --> 02:08:54.596]  I mean, we just heard in the El Chapo trial that the prior president of Mexico got a hundred million dollar bribe.
[02:08:54.596 --> 02:08:57.958]  So you could even say that right now Mexico is being run by the cartels.
[02:08:57.958 --> 02:09:02.141]  Much like the Taliban took over Afghanistan, the cartels have taken over Mexico.
[02:09:02.141 --> 02:09:06.945]  But if you want to give respect to the Mexican government, you can say, well look, either you got to fix this or we will.
[02:09:06.945 --> 02:09:08.326]  And they have failed to do it.
[02:09:08.326 --> 02:09:09.287]  And so we could.
[02:09:09.287 --> 02:09:11.609]  Let's be clear, we don't want to invade Venezuela.
[02:09:11.609 --> 02:09:13.010]  We don't want to invade Mexico.
[02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:15.392]  But we can't fight it on our border.
[02:09:15.392 --> 02:09:20.537]  If they're failed collapsed states, it's like building a seawall from the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:09:20.537 --> 02:09:22.960]  It's like we have to go in there and stop it.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:23.921]  You may have to.
[02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:28.425]  I think President Trump, especially given the reality of the absurdity of the
[02:09:29.466 --> 02:09:34.669]  Courts in the United States interpreting the asylum laws to allow anybody who sets foot on U.S.
[02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:45.095]  soil to be automatically processed for asylum and then cut and released in the United States, he may have no choice but to go into Mexico to stop them there and to take it to the cartels to prevent them from getting on U.S.
[02:09:45.095 --> 02:09:45.295]  soil.
[02:09:45.615 --> 02:09:48.677]  But even if he doesn't do that right now, he should articulate this.
[02:09:48.677 --> 02:09:56.001]  He shouldn't say, I'm going to go, you know, try to find and scrounge up money that's discretionary as the President to enforce the laws.
[02:09:56.001 --> 02:10:05.807]  What he should say is, as Commander-in-Chief, I'm going to use that massive military budget we have of $1.3 trillion, and I'm going to use that, just like I do in Korea.
[02:10:05.807 --> 02:10:09.829]  We guard the DMZ in Korea, we guard the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[02:10:09.829 --> 02:10:10.850]  But we can't guard our own border.
[02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:11.690]  We can't guard our own border.
[02:10:11.690 --> 02:10:12.511]  It makes no sense at all.
[02:10:12.751 --> 02:10:14.832]  We used to have the Army on the border.
[02:10:14.832 --> 02:10:17.954]  Before there was a border patrol, it was the obligation and duty of the U.S.
[02:10:17.954 --> 02:10:18.435]  Army.
[02:10:18.435 --> 02:10:22.637]  There were forts every 50 miles along the border, staffed by Army soldiers.
[02:10:22.637 --> 02:10:25.379]  That's what we have to get back to, because that's what it's going to take.
[02:10:25.379 --> 02:10:27.960]  And by the way, there were a couple million illegal aliens here.
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.142]  It was out of control, what they were doing.
[02:10:30.142 --> 02:10:32.123]  And Eisenhower, in like a month, rounded them all up.
[02:10:33.307 --> 02:10:34.407]  Right, back in the 50s.
[02:10:34.407 --> 02:10:37.128]  It wasn't a joke, it was just like... Yeah, he did it.
[02:10:37.128 --> 02:10:45.851]  And so, you know, I think President Trump, I think he's trying to do the right thing, but my suspicion is, as we all know, is he is surrounded by deep state agents.
[02:10:45.851 --> 02:10:50.732]  We just learned of an attempted coup to use the 25th Amendment, and I'm sure he still has people like that.
[02:10:50.732 --> 02:10:52.993]  And how crazy, like, used to that be a huge story.
[02:10:52.993 --> 02:10:59.694]  Now it's like, oh yeah, there was a 25th Amendment coup, and they tried to do this, and yeah, you know, they're on the payroll, the Chinese, the government.
[02:10:59.694 --> 02:11:01.435]  I mean, it's like, wow, we are so sold out.
[02:11:01.895 --> 02:11:02.516]  Exactly.
[02:11:02.516 --> 02:11:07.799]  And as Alan Dershowitz said last night on Tucker Carlson, that was clearly a coup.
[02:11:07.799 --> 02:11:13.283]  The constitutional remedy, if you believe the President is committing felonies, is to go and... Impeachment.
[02:11:13.283 --> 02:11:13.944]  Right, impeachment.
[02:11:13.944 --> 02:11:15.345]  That's the constitutional remedy.
[02:11:15.345 --> 02:11:18.027]  The 25th Amendment is all about incapacity.
[02:11:18.027 --> 02:11:20.368]  Is the President injured, like when Brigham was shot?
[02:11:20.368 --> 02:11:23.511]  Is he able to... Yeah, that's only one degree away from blowing the President's head off.
[02:11:24.107 --> 02:11:26.368]  When you're trying to use the 25th Amendment and all that.
[02:11:26.368 --> 02:11:37.013]  Sure, well they're removing him through unconstitutional means and they're doing it by collusion between the DOJ and his own legal counsel and the FBI behind his back.
[02:11:37.013 --> 02:11:38.233]  It's like seven days in May.
[02:11:38.233 --> 02:11:46.957]  I want to get to that in the next segment because that's really big and I'm glad you brought that up because we just get punch-drunk to the insane times we live in that's validated everything we've been warning of, everything we talked about.
[02:11:46.957 --> 02:11:48.698]  We were always used to having a globalist in office.
[02:11:48.698 --> 02:11:50.139]  It's the weird juxtapositive.
[02:11:50.139 --> 02:11:52.100]  We've got a quasi, you know, guy trying in there.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:58.564]  And he's under siege, we're under siege, but we're winning in many ways just because we've kind of fought him to a stalemate.
[02:11:58.564 --> 02:12:08.169]  And then you've got the paradox, though, of the Democrats not standing when Trump says, we saved 3,000 women and hundreds of kids in sex slavery, and we're stopping child pornographers.
[02:12:08.169 --> 02:12:10.311]  And then they won't stand up for that.
[02:12:10.311 --> 02:12:11.351]  It shows.
[02:12:11.351 --> 02:12:13.493]  And then, oh, MS-13 are God's children.
[02:12:14.213 --> 02:12:15.834]  I know Democrats locally in Austin.
[02:12:15.834 --> 02:12:17.916]  They all run illegal immigration chains.
[02:12:17.916 --> 02:12:19.397]  They're dealing drugs.
[02:12:19.397 --> 02:12:22.019]  They're feeding on the poor underclass they're bringing in.
[02:12:22.019 --> 02:12:27.703]  But, I mean, we have to understand, the Democratic Party has fully converted to an insane mafia.
[02:12:27.703 --> 02:12:29.484]  It's like mass gaslighting.
[02:12:29.484 --> 02:12:33.547]  They're doing all these things right in front of your face, and then they tell you, that's not happening.
[02:12:33.547 --> 02:12:34.989]  There's no crime on the border.
[02:12:34.989 --> 02:12:36.310]  There's no one being murdered on the border.
[02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:38.551]  Like today during the... Acostas!
[02:12:38.551 --> 02:12:38.791]  Right.
[02:12:38.791 --> 02:12:41.633]  These are real mothers holding up their dead kids, and Acostas doesn't exist.
[02:12:41.633 --> 02:12:43.375]  There's no crime there, even though they're right in front of him.
[02:12:43.815 --> 02:12:48.633]  Well, let him actually go down to the border for real and not just walk around behind a wall and see how much crime there is.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:50.921]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:12:50.921 --> 02:12:59.648]  Well, that's the problem, is that the president has gone down to the border, but what he needs to do is, what we did yesterday, what we did about a month ago, fly along the border.
[02:12:59.648 --> 02:13:00.769]  He should do a live stream.
[02:13:00.769 --> 02:13:01.830]  Here's the border.
[02:13:01.830 --> 02:13:03.572]  He should go interview ranchers on the border.
[02:13:03.572 --> 02:13:06.274]  He should take the time to go down there and put that up on there.
[02:13:06.274 --> 02:13:09.757]  He should meet the ranchers, and we'll talk about that in our attempt to kill against Trump.
[02:13:09.757 --> 02:13:12.159]  Which, again, we talk about it so much now that it's all confirmed.
[02:13:12.159 --> 02:13:13.681]  We're like, hey, we told you this.
[02:13:13.681 --> 02:13:14.421]  Now it's confirmed.
[02:13:14.421 --> 02:13:14.842]  But here's the deal.
[02:13:16.078 --> 02:13:17.519]  I'm anti-police state.
[02:13:17.519 --> 02:13:19.701]  I want due process here in America.
[02:13:19.701 --> 02:13:20.462]  And I push for that.
[02:13:20.462 --> 02:13:26.267]  But on your border and in a war, we never won a war playing games with a bunch of lawyers.
[02:13:26.267 --> 02:13:29.010]  And we win wars carpet bombing people.
[02:13:29.010 --> 02:13:32.093]  And Mexico's already being carpet bombed by the cartels.
[02:13:32.093 --> 02:13:34.255]  We're already collapsing into this.
[02:13:34.255 --> 02:13:37.357]  So I just don't know, with such a leftist press,
[02:13:38.058 --> 02:13:39.920]  Spying on the military and our police.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:44.145]  I don't know how we're supposed to smash the cartels once and for all and ever win that.
[02:13:44.145 --> 02:13:45.347]  I mean, we have to smash them.
[02:13:45.347 --> 02:13:48.070]  We have to exterminate them or it's going to keep coming back.
[02:13:48.070 --> 02:13:53.256]  Well, he has to recognize that we are facing really a perfect storm of an invasion.
[02:13:53.937 --> 02:14:12.767]  And an insurrection against our laws by their, inside the gates, traitors of the Constitution, the sovereign, of the sanctuary cities and sanctuary states, and all along the border you have compliant Democratic politicians who are in the back pocket of the cartels, and also, like the La Raza types, are ideologically motivated to tear down the border.
[02:14:12.767 --> 02:14:15.168]  It's a terrorist, narco state that's basically Brown KKK.
[02:14:16.221 --> 02:14:16.681]  Absolutely.
[02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:18.963]  I mean, their group is, for those in the race, everything.
[02:14:18.963 --> 02:14:20.444]  Those outside the race, nothing.
[02:14:20.444 --> 02:14:20.684]  Right.
[02:14:20.684 --> 02:14:22.285]  That's literal Hitler stuff.
[02:14:22.285 --> 02:14:27.889]  So you have the cartels in allegiance with radical Marxists and globalists who want to destroy the United States.
[02:14:27.889 --> 02:14:28.729]  And radical Muslims.
[02:14:28.729 --> 02:14:32.992]  It's like Marxist, racist, drug cartels in league with Muslims.
[02:14:32.992 --> 02:14:33.712]  Precisely.
[02:14:33.712 --> 02:14:40.077]  All of them have the same common enemy, which is Western civilization, and they want to destroy the borders and tear down sovereignty.
[02:14:40.077 --> 02:14:41.497]  So how do we counter this witch's brew?
[02:14:41.497 --> 02:14:43.339]  That's what I'm saying is, we're already under attack.
[02:14:44.039 --> 02:14:46.220]  And I think people want Trump to take the gloves off.
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:46.921]  Well, he has to.
[02:14:46.921 --> 02:14:48.602]  But he has to do it constitutionally.
[02:14:48.602 --> 02:14:55.526]  So he could call forth a militia, which include the National Guard and all of us, as the militia, to suppress the insurrection.
[02:14:55.526 --> 02:14:57.087]  He can call us forward to execute the law.
[02:14:57.087 --> 02:14:58.608]  How do you vet that and stop infiltrators?
[02:14:59.609 --> 02:15:02.470]  Well, you have your military veterans and your police officers first.
[02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.750]  Step up.
[02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:04.611]  Oh yeah, you have to go people who have a background.
[02:15:04.611 --> 02:15:05.931]  Look at the Trump rallies.
[02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:09.372]  They send in guys screaming racist stuff every time they're a Democrat.
[02:15:09.372 --> 02:15:12.293]  I'm not against the militia, but they're going to infiltrate a classic militia.
[02:15:12.293 --> 02:15:18.415]  Right, so what you do is... This isn't 1776 when the British were somewhat honorable and didn't do stuff like that and we didn't do it.
[02:15:18.415 --> 02:15:19.335]  That was still false flagging.
[02:15:19.935 --> 02:15:27.319]  Well, I think whether it's Governor Abbott here or President Trump could call up the militia and call on the military veterans and police officers first.
[02:15:27.319 --> 02:15:31.622]  And of course you're watching, you can do background checks, you can go through watch their social media and see where they're at.
[02:15:31.622 --> 02:15:35.704]  You can weed out your actual white nationalists or your radical leftists.
[02:15:35.704 --> 02:15:37.145]  And you'll find out who they are real quick?
[02:15:37.145 --> 02:15:38.125]  Yeah, you can find out.
[02:15:38.125 --> 02:15:44.669]  Let's talk about that because listen, more caravans are coming, 5 million tell Gallup they're coming, the country's under attack, Europe's already collapsed.
[02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:47.130]  We're not talking about militias and martial law for a joke.
[02:15:47.130 --> 02:15:47.851]  Pelosi says,
[02:15:48.804 --> 02:15:50.570]  She'll threaten Marshall Law and confiscate guns.
[02:15:50.570 --> 02:15:52.075]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:15:52.075 --> 02:15:53.239]  Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, stay with us.
[02:15:55.129 --> 02:15:59.012]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:30.271]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.

[02:17:04.027 --> 02:17:09.951]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:09.951 --> 02:17:13.753]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.753 --> 02:17:14.674]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.014 --> 02:17:16.015]  Who do we fight for?

[02:18:58.524 --> 02:19:00.265]  There is no set stasis.
[02:19:00.265 --> 02:19:01.485]  There is no managed system.
[02:19:01.485 --> 02:19:03.145]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:19:03.145 --> 02:19:06.366]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.

[02:19:09.726 --> 02:19:10.967]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:19:10.967 --> 02:19:11.767]  We'll be here forever.
[02:19:11.767 --> 02:19:13.007]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:19:13.007 --> 02:19:19.888]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:19:19.888 --> 02:19:20.468]  We made it.
[02:19:20.468 --> 02:19:22.629]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:24.429]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[02:19:24.429 --> 02:19:24.809]  And so,
[02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:31.615]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:19:31.615 --> 02:19:36.539]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:19:36.539 --> 02:19:39.402]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:19:39.402 --> 02:19:41.804]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:19:41.804 --> 02:19:45.307]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:19:45.307 --> 02:19:46.328]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:19:46.568 --> 02:19:50.854]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[02:19:50.854 --> 02:19:53.558]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:19:53.558 --> 02:19:54.819]  I want life!
[02:19:54.819 --> 02:19:59.085]  I want Jesus!
[02:19:59.085 --> 02:20:01.748]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:31.114 --> 02:20:35.359]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of O'Keepers, a Yale Law graduate, patriot.
[02:20:35.359 --> 02:20:37.701]  He's here with us.
[02:20:37.701 --> 02:20:42.246]  I get mad at myself because I tell this story almost every week because it's so critical to understand the globalist.
[02:20:42.246 --> 02:20:44.488]  And as I got older, I realized it was true.
[02:20:44.488 --> 02:20:52.536]  It's like 10, 12 years ago, I was on a first-class airline flight, American Airlines, and one of the heads of one of the big three banks
[02:20:54.192 --> 02:20:56.933]  He goes, no, too much hassle.
[02:20:56.933 --> 02:20:59.534]  I was visiting my dad, a retired general in San Antonio.
[02:20:59.534 --> 02:21:02.475]  I'm kind of letting you know who it is, you know, with this still being off record.
[02:21:02.475 --> 02:21:04.715]  He goes, this is off record, Alex.
[02:21:04.715 --> 02:21:11.777]  And he goes, the public's dumb and you'd be best just to join us because they're going to adapt to being slaves.
[02:21:11.777 --> 02:21:14.438]  He goes, you don't adapt and overcome, you adapt to what we're doing.
[02:21:14.438 --> 02:21:17.319]  And the public, you know, basically just as much idiots that deserve it.
[02:21:18.467 --> 02:21:25.548]  And I thought, well that's, later as I watch things, I'm adapting to governors on TV saying they kill babies after they're born.
[02:21:25.548 --> 02:21:26.429]  I mean, I don't like it.
[02:21:26.429 --> 02:21:29.209]  But I'm still just getting comfortable with that.
[02:21:29.209 --> 02:21:32.450]  Getting slapped in the face, you know, hearing these evils.
[02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:37.411]  And then now, like you said, Mexico's hundreds of thousands dead, not 40,000 dead like Trump said.
[02:21:37.411 --> 02:21:39.571]  Hundreds of thousands, that's the State Department's own numbers.
[02:21:39.571 --> 02:21:41.472]  Most areas are lawless, super dangerous.
[02:21:41.472 --> 02:21:43.632]  If you have any money, you're kidnapped very quickly.
[02:21:43.632 --> 02:21:45.573]  80% of women coming through there are raped.
[02:21:45.573 --> 02:21:46.653]  That's Amnesty International.
[02:21:46.653 --> 02:21:47.313]  It's a hellhole.
[02:21:48.544 --> 02:21:55.668]  And we're just here calmly talking about McCabe and them planning a 25th Amendment coup of the president, which confirms everything we knew was going on.
[02:21:55.668 --> 02:22:03.992]  And it's just like, don't people get that we're this close to there being no rule of law and then things just unravel very quickly?
[02:22:03.992 --> 02:22:08.354]  That Western cultures are rich and powerful because we know we're corrupt.
[02:22:08.354 --> 02:22:09.995]  We try to keep it in check.
[02:22:09.995 --> 02:22:12.656]  Once you put a bunch of clicks in, it's over.
[02:22:12.656 --> 02:22:13.857]  This country will unravel.
[02:22:14.637 --> 02:22:18.960]  It will fall apart like third world countries can't build nuclear reactors, they can't upkeep them.
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:22.542]  Our reactors will start melting down, and I'm not trying to scare people.
[02:22:22.542 --> 02:22:27.205]  Places like Venezuela can't run nuclear power plants, folks, they can't wipe their ass.
[02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:34.669]  And they were smart 50 years ago, they get lazy, they get dumb, everyone gives up, because there's no excellence, there's no leadership, so I'm ranting here.
[02:22:34.669 --> 02:22:42.414]  It's just that as a father of four, you're a father of six, gut level, historic level, everything, we have put up with far too much, and I know
[02:22:43.214 --> 02:22:46.697]  They're trying to break my will, even though I'm fighting hard.
[02:22:46.697 --> 02:22:48.418]  Imagine people that aren't even conscious.
[02:22:48.418 --> 02:22:51.501]  Let's get into the fact that they're currently trying to coup the president.
[02:22:51.501 --> 02:22:52.942]  They're admitting they're doing it.
[02:22:52.942 --> 02:22:58.887]  And then, as you said, we'll play the clip in a moment, Pelosi, you said it's not martial law, it's just dictatorship.
[02:22:58.887 --> 02:23:02.289]  She says, we'll declare an emergency and take your guns.
[02:23:02.289 --> 02:23:04.992]  And now we're going, oh, well, they want our guns.
[02:23:04.992 --> 02:23:06.893]  They should deny it 10 years ago.
[02:23:06.893 --> 02:23:10.056]  Now the New York Times says, ban the guns, take them.
[02:23:10.056 --> 02:23:12.337]  And that's what I mean is they've radicalized so far.
[02:23:13.817 --> 02:23:16.338]  That, here's the problem.
[02:23:16.338 --> 02:23:18.639]  People say, we'll just submit, we'll just give it.
[02:23:18.639 --> 02:23:19.979]  They'll never stop pushing.
[02:23:19.979 --> 02:23:21.900]  There will be a bloody civil war.
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:23.180]  I don't want it.
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:25.361]  But, they're not going to stop.
[02:23:25.361 --> 02:23:35.424]  And a certain percentage of Americans are not going to let the schools, like Jocelyn Elders wanted to do 20 years ago, now it's, you know, take your two-year-old and have the teacher sit there and, you know, sexually abuse him.
[02:23:35.424 --> 02:23:37.305]  I mean, these people are freaks!
[02:23:37.305 --> 02:23:38.826]  And there's no limit to what they'll do.
[02:23:38.826 --> 02:23:39.766]  So what I'm saying is, Stuart,
[02:23:41.741 --> 02:23:43.563]  You can smell the blood in the air.
[02:23:43.563 --> 02:23:46.305]  We're going down a road of just death.
[02:23:46.305 --> 02:23:48.066]  Right, and a couple things.
[02:23:48.066 --> 02:23:59.937]  One is, in a way, it's good that they're going so over the top with jumping the shark, like Cortez with all her open articulation that, well, any Latino can come to the United States, you know, there's no such thing as a border.
[02:23:59.937 --> 02:24:01.558]  We should just have a- Everything's free!
[02:24:01.558 --> 02:24:03.119]  You don't have to work.
[02:24:03.119 --> 02:24:04.901]  So they're letting you know what their plan is.
[02:24:04.901 --> 02:24:07.723]  Their plan is, and you know, of course, you understand that
[02:24:08.564 --> 02:24:10.407]  I come from a Hispanic background myself.
[02:24:10.407 --> 02:24:16.155]  My family came from Mexico originally, my mother's side, but they came here and assimilated, became Americans.
[02:24:16.155 --> 02:24:24.988]  What Cortez is articulating is the Weather Underground identity politics strategy of... It's a Marxist ethos!
[02:24:25.228 --> 02:24:29.331]  Sure, turning Americans who are Hispanic, trying to, against their own country.
[02:24:29.331 --> 02:24:35.055]  Of course, at least a quarter of the crowd in El Paso at the Trump rally was Hispanic, which is really nice to see.
[02:24:35.055 --> 02:24:39.679]  Those are patriotic Tejanos who believe in... And notice the media didn't want to show the crowd.
[02:24:39.679 --> 02:24:41.180]  No, they don't, and they won't.
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:42.881]  So that's part of their gaslighting.
[02:24:42.881 --> 02:24:47.184]  They don't want you to believe that there's anybody out there who supports Trump except for white people.
[02:24:47.184 --> 02:24:49.206]  The next inference is, well, they're all racist.
[02:24:49.206 --> 02:24:51.367]  At the same time, they want to bring in more people.
[02:24:51.367 --> 02:24:53.009]  They can't successfully
[02:24:53.709 --> 02:24:55.412]  Brainwash all minorities.
[02:24:55.412 --> 02:24:57.997]  Many, you know, the walkway movement is a testament to this.
[02:24:57.997 --> 02:25:00.361]  Well, statistically blacks and Hispanics are turning towards...
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:02.781]  Capitalism in America.
[02:25:02.781 --> 02:25:03.542]  Right.
[02:25:03.542 --> 02:25:06.865]  They failed to brainwash them and use them.
[02:25:06.865 --> 02:25:07.706]  They tried to use them.
[02:25:07.706 --> 02:25:10.908]  And that's why they want the very lowest IQ, dumbest in the third world.
[02:25:10.908 --> 02:25:11.329]  Hurry!
[02:25:11.329 --> 02:25:11.849]  Get in here!
[02:25:11.849 --> 02:25:15.152]  Already pre-brainwashed at UN camps to make sure they're vetted.
[02:25:15.152 --> 02:25:22.458]  Well, they want to bring in people who don't have our same history and our same culture, who are easier to manipulate.
[02:25:22.458 --> 02:25:23.199]  Absolutely right.
[02:25:23.199 --> 02:25:24.180]  Come from socialist countries.
[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:28.904]  They want someone from Venezuela or Honduras or Guatemala who they think will vote Democrat.
[02:25:29.184 --> 02:25:29.344]  No, no, no.
[02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:49.882]  That's right, America sucks, but get up here and get free stuff.
[02:25:49.882 --> 02:25:53.343]  Yeah, America sucks, help us destroy it, basically, is what they're doing.
[02:25:53.343 --> 02:25:57.644]  So what we have to do is realize the reality of that, make sure Trump also realizes it.
[02:25:57.644 --> 02:25:59.725]  He came close today in his press conference.
[02:25:59.725 --> 02:26:04.687]  He almost said this is an effort by the Democratic Party to bring in new voters.
[02:26:04.687 --> 02:26:06.867]  He should have said it, because it's true.
[02:26:06.867 --> 02:26:08.588]  But at the same time, he should focus on the cartels.
[02:26:08.968 --> 02:26:14.713]  We have a chance with him right now to fix this peacefully, relatively peacefully, but he has to be aggressive.
[02:26:14.713 --> 02:26:27.823]  He needs to purge out the neocons and the deep staters in his own cabinet, first of all to protect himself against a 25th Amendment coup, and then he also needs to purge out and clean out his DOJ so they'll go out there and ask him to talk to him.
[02:26:27.823 --> 02:26:28.664]  He must do it.
[02:26:28.664 --> 02:26:29.165]  He must, he has to.
[02:26:29.165 --> 02:26:31.687]  But here's the thing, MS-13, these people are so brainwashed, they love going to prison.
[02:26:32.407 --> 02:26:38.150]  And I'm not somebody that's, you know, we need to bring back the death penalty and it needs to be due process but done quickly.
[02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:39.311]  Because these people need to be killed.
[02:26:39.311 --> 02:26:44.294]  I mean people, you know MS-13 likes to kill little kids in rituals for the devil.
[02:26:44.294 --> 02:26:45.474]  And that's part of their whole thing.
[02:26:45.474 --> 02:26:51.418]  So people that are into torturing and killing kids, we don't need to put them in prison and let them out in five years when they've committed a murder.
[02:26:51.418 --> 02:26:52.678]  They need to be killed.
[02:26:52.678 --> 02:26:55.240]  And I'm not a bloodthirsty person, but we need to kill these people.
[02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:58.524]  Well, I mean, if you're waging war against them using the U.S.
[02:26:58.524 --> 02:27:01.127]  military on the border, it'd be a different paradigm.
[02:27:01.127 --> 02:27:04.091]  So it could get quite a bit more messy.
[02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:05.794]  And I'm not trying to sound big boss here.
[02:27:05.794 --> 02:27:12.002]  I'm just saying, when you're faced with people that worship the Grim Reaper and torture children, you have to take the gloves off.
[02:27:12.282 --> 02:27:14.966]  Well, there's mass graves full of women and children in Mexico.
[02:27:14.966 --> 02:27:21.835]  Once they use them up as sex slaves, they kill them.
[02:27:21.835 --> 02:27:25.300]  There's no retirement home for ex-sex slaves in Mexico.
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:26.581]  They're just killed and put in a mass grave.
[02:27:27.369 --> 02:27:37.015]  But what I was referring to, though, is what Trump should be doing is prosecuting the leftist NGOs and the politicians who are in his face violating federal law.
[02:27:37.015 --> 02:27:37.835]  And that's the key.
[02:27:37.835 --> 02:27:43.578]  When we come back, that's what they flipped out and threatened to take Lou Dobbs off the air when he had the head of Judicial Watch on going.
[02:27:43.578 --> 02:27:47.741]  We give billions to USAID that gives it to Soros to form these.
[02:27:47.741 --> 02:27:48.661]  It's public.
[02:27:48.661 --> 02:27:50.542]  And they went, oh my God, take him off because that's it.
[02:27:50.542 --> 02:27:51.343]  Just cut the funding.
[02:27:52.381 --> 02:27:56.322]  Well, prosecute them for aiding and abetting illegal aliens and harboring them.
[02:27:56.322 --> 02:27:56.642]  No, I agree.
[02:27:56.642 --> 02:27:56.982]  You're right.
[02:27:56.982 --> 02:28:00.683]  We've got to push it with prosecution, and then we get to cutting the money off.
[02:28:00.683 --> 02:28:01.303]  Exactly.
[02:28:01.303 --> 02:28:01.784]  Right.
[02:28:01.784 --> 02:28:05.264]  Well, the money, you can use RICO for that.
[02:28:05.264 --> 02:28:06.745]  Why doesn't Trump do that?
[02:28:06.745 --> 02:28:10.346]  I mean, he... Because he has a DOJ that's controlled by deep staters, as we now know.
[02:28:10.346 --> 02:28:11.826]  They tried to do a coup against him.
[02:28:11.826 --> 02:28:15.967]  His own deputy attorney general was plotting to use a 24-hour... Ron Rosenstein.
[02:28:15.967 --> 02:28:16.668]  Right.
[02:28:16.668 --> 02:28:17.428]  Yeah.
[02:28:17.428 --> 02:28:20.189]  You can take one look at that guy, and then his background.
[02:28:20.189 --> 02:28:20.589]  I mean, who?
[02:28:22.029 --> 02:28:23.809]  I mean, what scum?
[02:28:23.809 --> 02:28:24.550]  Exactly.
[02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:31.671]  So he was plotting, it's not just him being an outlier, it was him and the Deputy Director of the FBI together.
[02:28:31.671 --> 02:28:32.111]  Right.
[02:28:32.111 --> 02:28:33.851]  And who knows who else on his cabinet?
[02:28:33.851 --> 02:28:34.431]  We don't know.
[02:28:34.431 --> 02:28:44.673]  And then the documents being released by Congress where these people are going to the State Department saying, we'll reclassify this as not top secret if you give us a European job at the State Department.
[02:28:44.673 --> 02:28:47.474]  I mean, you watch the country being sold out for nothing.

[02:32:59.102 --> 02:33:01.765]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.195 --> 02:33:20.336]  Big Brother.
[02:33:20.336 --> 02:33:22.137]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:22.137 --> 02:33:24.078]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:24.078 --> 02:33:25.720]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:27.381]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:27.381 --> 02:33:33.185]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.185 --> 02:33:39.890]  I'm suggesting, Mr. President, there's a military plot to take over the government.
[02:33:39.890 --> 02:33:42.611]  This may occur sometime this coming Sunday.
[02:33:42.611 --> 02:33:45.834]  There are some who will say, it can never happen here.
[02:33:46.821 --> 02:33:55.952]  But this is the story of how it could happen in seven days of intrigue, of blackmail, of terror, an eternity of suspense.
[02:33:55.952 --> 02:34:05.403]  This is the astounding story of a military plot to overthrow the government of the United States, which, if successful, would change the fate of every American.
[02:34:16.806 --> 02:34:18.186]  You're a night crawler, Colonel.
[02:34:18.186 --> 02:34:18.727]  A peddler.
[02:34:18.727 --> 02:34:20.987]  You sell information.
[02:34:20.987 --> 02:34:23.268]  Are you sufficiently up on your Bible to know who Judas was?
[02:34:23.268 --> 02:34:27.509]  Yes, I know who Judas was.
[02:34:27.509 --> 02:34:30.110]  He was a man I worked for and admired.
[02:34:30.110 --> 02:34:33.171]  Until he disgraced the four stars on his uniform.
[02:34:33.171 --> 02:34:34.712]  Seven days in May.
[02:34:34.712 --> 02:34:42.054]  The first day when a Marine Colonel wondered who was inciting screaming mobs in Madison Square Garden.
[02:34:42.054 --> 02:34:42.454]  Antifa.
[02:34:44.594 --> 02:34:45.855]  Cortez.
[02:34:45.855 --> 02:34:50.660]  The second day, that uncovered secret meetings in Washington's back alleys.
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:56.686]  The third day, when unknown men prepared to kidnap the president from his private vacation resort.
[02:34:56.686 --> 02:35:02.311]  The fourth day, that brought a secret presidential messenger to death in a plane crash in Spain.
[02:35:02.311 --> 02:35:08.357]  The day a senator of the United States was held against his will.
[02:35:08.357 --> 02:35:08.998]  The fifth day,
[02:35:09.565 --> 02:35:12.909]  When a woman found her past being used for blackmail.
[02:35:12.909 --> 02:35:14.711]  Look, Ellie, if I could tell you why I had to do this, you'd understand.
[02:35:14.711 --> 02:35:16.953]  I'll tell you something.
[02:35:16.953 --> 02:35:19.896]  I was a stupid, impressionable female.
[02:35:19.896 --> 02:35:23.039]  Who let an Air Force General use her like his personal airplane.
[02:35:23.039 --> 02:35:24.281]  The sixth day.
[02:35:24.281 --> 02:35:27.564]  The discovery of a desert base for an airborne task force.
[02:35:27.564 --> 02:35:30.167]  Kept secret even from the President of the United States.
[02:35:36.198 --> 02:35:44.123]  The seventh day, when the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff dared the President of the United States to stop the conspiracy that couldn't be proved.
[02:35:44.123 --> 02:35:46.284]  You're not a weak sister, Mr. President.
[02:35:46.284 --> 02:35:48.125]  You're a criminally weak sister.
[02:35:48.125 --> 02:35:49.886]  You say I've duped the people, General.
[02:35:49.886 --> 02:35:50.506]  I've duped them.
[02:35:50.506 --> 02:35:51.227]  I've misled them.
[02:35:51.227 --> 02:35:53.908]  I've stripped them naked and made them defenseless.
[02:35:53.908 --> 02:35:56.450]  You accuse me of having lost their faith.
[02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:59.952]  Deliberately and criminally shut my ears to the national voice.
[02:35:59.952 --> 02:36:00.152]  I do.
[02:36:02.810 --> 02:36:05.491]  Well, where the hell have you heard that voice, General?
[02:36:05.491 --> 02:36:06.812]  In freight elevators?
[02:36:06.812 --> 02:36:07.992]  In dark alleys?
[02:36:07.992 --> 02:36:10.013]  In secret places in the dead of night?
[02:36:10.013 --> 02:36:13.555]  How did that voice seep into a locked room full of conspirators?
[02:36:13.555 --> 02:36:16.296]  That's not where you hear the voice of the people, General.
[02:36:16.296 --> 02:36:17.396]  Not in this Republic.
[02:36:17.396 --> 02:36:19.397]  And I will not resign voluntarily.
[02:36:19.397 --> 02:36:21.378]  I'm going to fight you.
[02:36:21.378 --> 02:36:23.879]  And then we'll see which one of us the United States is willing to follow.
[02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:42.393]  Raging War on Corruption.
[02:36:42.393 --> 02:36:50.361]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:36:50.361 --> 02:36:56.307]  Not since the founding of this nation, or the Civil War, has this country been in more danger, and the whole world's in danger.
[02:36:56.307 --> 02:37:01.973]  Because Europe's run by total tyrants, China's run by people even more soulless than Hitler.
[02:37:05.811 --> 02:37:15.756]  And Stuart Rhodes, constitutional lawyers here with us, founder of Oath Keepers, working hard on some really important operations here in Texas, he can't get into on air.
[02:37:15.756 --> 02:37:17.417]  He'll be co-hosting some next week.
[02:37:20.521 --> 02:37:23.982]  But you mentioned this, so I thought I'd pull a few news articles.
[02:37:23.982 --> 02:37:25.783]  We can put up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:37:25.783 --> 02:37:35.507]  Just type in 25th Amendment Coup, Infowars.com, and then click Google News, or Google Web, and you'll get hundreds of articles we wrote last year.
[02:37:35.507 --> 02:37:38.068]  Hundreds!
[02:37:38.068 --> 02:37:40.569]  Rosenstein is plotting deep state coup against Trump.
[02:37:40.569 --> 02:37:41.229]  25th Amendment.
[02:37:41.229 --> 02:37:42.110]  Let's move on.
[02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:43.610]  Coup d'etat now live.
[02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:44.831]  25th Amendment planned to remove Trump.
[02:37:45.686 --> 02:37:47.948]  Now you know why they want us off air.
[02:37:47.948 --> 02:37:51.391]  Why a New York Times story about a Rosenthal coup attempt is a setup.
[02:37:51.391 --> 02:37:54.033]  So now Alan Dershowitz is on Fox News last night.
[02:37:54.033 --> 02:37:55.054]  You mentioned it.
[02:37:55.054 --> 02:37:57.676]  Alan Dershowitz, Harvard lawyer, highly respected.
[02:37:57.676 --> 02:38:02.180]  He says the deep-seated commitment of the amendment to oust Trump is clearly an attempt at a coup d'etat.
[02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:04.202]  So, next year's News of the Day.
[02:38:04.202 --> 02:38:06.104]  They don't want us off the air because we're lying.
[02:38:07.145 --> 02:38:09.405]  They want us off the air because we're over the target.
[02:38:09.405 --> 02:38:10.266]  Yeah, exactly right.
[02:38:10.266 --> 02:38:27.369]  And I do think there's a chance that part of why this is coming out now is that they want to condition the public, just like conditioning you to accept infanticide, they want to condition people to say, well, you know, they did a 25th Amendment coup attempt and no one's prosecuted, so it's on the table.
[02:38:27.369 --> 02:38:29.329]  And if it happens down the road, it happens.
[02:38:29.329 --> 02:38:33.290]  And a lot of the leftists are still talking about using it right now, openly.
[02:38:35.623 --> 02:38:41.225]  And I remember they had full-page ads a year and a half ago in the New York Times saying, Al Stim, 25th Amendment coup.
[02:38:41.225 --> 02:38:45.086]  When I talked about it, they had articles saying, Jones made it up, it's not in the New York Times.
[02:38:45.086 --> 02:38:59.329]  And I had family read that, and then Alex, we believe you, but I had family go to places that have newsstands, and they went, son, it's, my mom, I had family come in and they go, son, it's full-page.
[02:38:59.329 --> 02:39:00.930]  Why would they say on the news it's not in there?
[02:39:01.795 --> 02:39:10.662]  What is that military tactic of a dark side military where, I guess it's gaslighting, but what's the point when it's in 5 million papers that they put out.
[02:39:10.662 --> 02:39:12.323]  It was in all 5 million.
[02:39:12.323 --> 02:39:15.425]  People had it delivered to their doorsteps by Fed family.
[02:39:15.425 --> 02:39:22.090]  Literally go, I don't want to say who in the family, but they're like, I got a call and they go, they're saying that's not in the New York Times.
[02:39:22.090 --> 02:39:22.711]  Why are you saying that?
[02:39:23.444 --> 02:39:25.186]  Well, it's right out of 1984, right?
[02:39:25.186 --> 02:39:26.827]  Like, Orwell's 1984.
[02:39:26.827 --> 02:39:33.534]  Everyone knows they're in a dictatorship, but it's the Ministry of Love, and Big Brother loves you, even though you know your neighbor's been disappeared.
[02:39:33.534 --> 02:39:40.301]  So at the same time as they reveal to you, here's what's going to happen to you if you get in our way, they also gaslight you.
[02:39:40.301 --> 02:39:42.423]  Don't see what's in front of your face.
[02:39:42.423 --> 02:39:43.744]  Don't see the tyranny right in front of you.
[02:39:43.744 --> 02:39:44.986]  Exactly, but if you're informed...
[02:39:45.606 --> 02:39:54.751]  The tactic is that it makes you upset, or I guess people aren't as dogged as we are, I'm not bragging, I guess they kind of give up, or because there's got to be a reason they do this tactic, like... Yeah, that's what it is.
[02:39:54.751 --> 02:40:11.639]  It's the ones who are awake and aware, they want them to become so demoralized that they just give up and hide, or they join forces, you know, come over the dark side, you were told, or the ones who are willfully ignorant and don't want to see it, they have an easy way to ignore what's in front of their face.
[02:40:11.639 --> 02:40:13.520]  I got a couple calls yesterday, and I'm not going to say
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:27.249]  Who by, but some big people and one of them was a major CEO and they just said, listen, it was so, it's off records, I can't say who, they go, this is your road to redemption, Alex.
[02:40:27.249 --> 02:40:27.989]  You're going to get destroyed.
[02:40:27.989 --> 02:40:28.910]  We don't want that to happen.
[02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:30.210]  It's not as bad as you think.
[02:40:30.210 --> 02:40:32.212]  There's a road for your redemption.
[02:40:32.212 --> 02:40:32.752]  Right.
[02:40:32.752 --> 02:40:37.115]  And so now they're saying, just fly to San Francisco.
[02:40:37.115 --> 02:40:38.235]  We have your road to redemption.
[02:40:40.252 --> 02:40:41.954]  I can't even entertain selling out.
[02:40:41.954 --> 02:40:42.715]  Right.
[02:40:42.715 --> 02:40:49.743]  I mean, if it wasn't pedophilia-driven and radical Islam-driven and so evil, I mean, I'd make deals, because I don't want to be destroyed, but I'm not making a deal with these people.
[02:40:49.743 --> 02:40:53.227]  No, you can't, because your soul is more important than anything else, right?
[02:40:53.227 --> 02:40:59.353]  I just don't get how most men, and I'm not trying to act like, I don't get how most men have been so, like, kept in a fishbowl their whole life.
[02:41:00.316 --> 02:41:01.117]  Because they don't even know.
[02:41:01.117 --> 02:41:04.279]  They just think you kiss other powerful men's ass and you move up.
[02:41:04.279 --> 02:41:06.120]  They don't even know.
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:08.742]  It's like Louie Gohmert said to the head of Google.
[02:41:08.742 --> 02:41:10.884]  He said, you just lie to us.
[02:41:10.884 --> 02:41:11.664]  But maybe you're not lying.
[02:41:11.664 --> 02:41:14.567]  Maybe you've lived in the dark so long, you don't know what the light is.
[02:41:14.567 --> 02:41:18.249]  Because they're like, well, why aren't you going to sell out?
[02:41:18.249 --> 02:41:20.611]  We're going to destroy you.
[02:41:20.611 --> 02:41:25.034]  Sell out to destroying everything?
[02:41:25.034 --> 02:41:26.575]  Sell out to jumping off a cliff?
[02:41:26.575 --> 02:41:27.716]  It's like there's nothing to sell out to.
[02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.410]  Right.
[02:41:29.410 --> 02:41:30.270]  What are you going to do?
[02:41:30.270 --> 02:41:37.472]  You're going to live a few more years longer in peace and quiet and then give over your children and your children's children to slavery?
[02:41:37.472 --> 02:41:38.092]  Of course you won't.
[02:41:38.092 --> 02:41:40.412]  You can't do that.
[02:41:40.412 --> 02:41:48.634]  But man, the average guy that's successful is polishing their Porsche, messing with their trophy wife, and they just... I want to kick their ass.
[02:41:48.634 --> 02:41:49.934]  They're the people I really don't like.
[02:41:49.934 --> 02:41:55.355]  There's nothing wrong with playing golf or having a good time, but these guys think not caring is like a shield.
[02:41:55.355 --> 02:41:57.256]  You see these strong, smart, good-looking guys,
[02:41:57.896 --> 02:42:01.397]  Might be able to kick my ass, have a higher IQ, but they don't have a spirit.
[02:42:01.397 --> 02:42:01.658]  Right.
[02:42:01.658 --> 02:42:03.698]  And I want to knock their teeth out.
[02:42:03.698 --> 02:42:05.379]  I don't blame you.
[02:42:05.379 --> 02:42:08.860]  And they're the reason why the GOP just did what it did yesterday.
[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:14.863]  They sold the American people down the river and they gave the president what I think is a big bag of turd, frankly.
[02:42:15.919 --> 02:42:16.359]  No, I agree.
[02:42:16.359 --> 02:42:22.542]  I like the emergency, but this whole DACA thing, Trump's starting to go sideways and it really worries me.
[02:42:22.542 --> 02:42:28.665]  Well, there's a provision in there that allows the communities on the border to say no to a wall.
[02:42:28.665 --> 02:42:31.487]  So you have these Democrat controlled, cartel controlled
[02:42:32.419 --> 02:42:33.420]  Um, communities.
[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:38.924]  Like, I was just down at Eagle Pass the other day, and I asked our guide there, the marine guide, I said, hey, what's the deal with the sheriff here?
[02:42:38.924 --> 02:42:40.505]  He said, well, he used to be a Border Patrol agent.
[02:42:40.505 --> 02:42:41.446]  I said, oh, that's good.
[02:42:41.446 --> 02:42:42.787]  So he's in favor of the wall?
[02:42:42.787 --> 02:42:43.147]  Oh, no.
[02:42:43.147 --> 02:42:45.309]  He's a Democrat, and he's opposed to the wall.
[02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:47.431]  It's obvious he's in the back pocket of the cartels.
[02:42:47.431 --> 02:42:50.373]  Oh, yeah, these guys all live in million-dollar houses.
[02:42:50.373 --> 02:42:52.294]  And by the way, down on the border, that's like a $10 million house.
[02:42:52.294 --> 02:42:52.715]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:55.939 --> 02:43:02.863]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the Brain Synergy Combo is here.
[02:43:02.863 --> 02:43:12.649]  Combining the powerful Turbo Force and Brain Force Plus nootropic formulas, this combo has what you need to hit your maximum potential every day.
[02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:21.234]  Take the tasty tropical berry flavored Turbo Force instant ring hits with you on the go or at work to help provide you with focus, clarity, and
[02:43:22.115 --> 02:43:22.916]  We're good.
[02:43:40.451 --> 02:43:52.901]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[02:44:08.786 --> 02:44:21.161]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[02:44:21.161 --> 02:44:23.083]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:44:23.083 --> 02:44:25.767]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:44:27.108 --> 02:44:31.451]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[02:44:31.451 --> 02:44:35.714]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[02:44:35.714 --> 02:44:37.995]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:44:37.995 --> 02:44:40.317]  This country is in a war!
[02:44:40.317 --> 02:44:51.003]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[02:44:51.003 --> 02:44:54.586]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[02:44:56.189 --> 02:44:58.130]  Patriots are on the go.
[02:44:58.130 --> 02:45:02.834]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[02:45:02.834 --> 02:45:13.281]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:13.281 --> 02:45:17.444]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[02:45:17.444 --> 02:45:20.347]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[02:45:21.007 --> 02:45:28.269]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar, no one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.
[02:45:28.269 --> 02:45:31.529]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.
[02:45:31.529 --> 02:45:41.152]  Secure your box of high-quality InfoWars Life protein bars today, and you will be impressed, and you will reorder them, and you will help fund the operation to break the Globalists back.
[02:45:41.152 --> 02:45:41.972]  It's up to you.
[02:45:41.972 --> 02:45:42.352]  It's easy.
[02:45:42.892 --> 02:45:43.273]  We're good.
[02:45:56.434 --> 02:46:04.139]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[02:46:04.139 --> 02:46:17.508]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:46:17.508 --> 02:46:22.411]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[02:46:22.411 --> 02:46:25.974]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[02:46:26.574 --> 02:46:35.681]  We're gonna go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:35.681 --> 02:46:38.423]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.

[02:46:45.628 --> 02:46:48.770]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:55.275]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:59.039 --> 02:47:09.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.849 --> 02:47:12.552]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:12.552 --> 02:47:17.676]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:47:32.483 --> 02:47:40.447]  All right, let's recap all this because we're gonna host 30 Minutes the next hour and then best-selling author, former Navy SEAL, really smart guy Matt Brackett's taking over.
[02:47:40.447 --> 02:47:41.547]  He's been hosting a lot.
[02:47:41.547 --> 02:47:44.089]  You're gonna be guest hosting some next week.
[02:47:44.089 --> 02:47:50.071]  Stuart Rhodes here in Texas getting a lot done with Gary Haven and other great patriots.
[02:47:50.071 --> 02:47:56.394]  We're not up here trying to be dramatic and that's my problem and I keep going back to this mentally to the audience.
[02:47:56.394 --> 02:47:59.516]  Everything we ever warned of basically has happened.
[02:48:01.571 --> 02:48:05.072]  And now it's almost like, okay, it's real.
[02:48:05.072 --> 02:48:07.653]  Let's just all just sit back and see what goes on.
[02:48:07.653 --> 02:48:09.934]  No, folks, people need to be focused.
[02:48:09.934 --> 02:48:10.975]  They need to be involved.
[02:48:10.975 --> 02:48:11.875]  They need to be diligent.
[02:48:11.875 --> 02:48:13.916]  And I'm not here saying it's like work.
[02:48:13.916 --> 02:48:15.296]  And I'm not complaining to the audience either.
[02:48:15.296 --> 02:48:24.900]  It's just that we have to take action because I want you to give your view on this as a smart guy, historian, lawyer, veteran, you're a smart guy.
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:27.921]  And I mean that for the illustrious shooting in.
[02:48:27.921 --> 02:48:29.842]  What's the world look like if they win?
[02:48:31.195 --> 02:48:35.639]  Versus if we can hold them back and at least push them back some because you know evil's an ongoing problem.
[02:48:35.639 --> 02:48:37.741]  We're not offering a utopia like Cortez does.
[02:48:37.741 --> 02:48:42.386]  You know, you don't have to work or everything's free and there's pie in the sky and chicken in every pot.
[02:48:42.386 --> 02:48:47.271]  But a good world if we become moral again and get engaged versus where we're going.
[02:48:48.328 --> 02:48:55.075]  It would look like, like Orwell said, the vision of the future is the boot stamping on the human face forever.
[02:48:55.075 --> 02:49:05.486]  And you can look at northern Mexico and the absolute demonic mass murder that's happening and oppression of the Mexican people by the cartels, and that's your future.
[02:49:05.486 --> 02:49:07.488]  That's your future in a communist dictatorship.
[02:49:07.988 --> 02:49:11.090]  It's your future in a narco-state too, a cartel-run narco-state.
[02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:13.411]  And you're going to get a combination of those two things.
[02:49:13.411 --> 02:49:16.754]  And your future is also what you saw in the caliphate with ISIS.
[02:49:16.754 --> 02:49:18.154]  That's your future as well.
[02:49:18.154 --> 02:49:22.177]  In fact, all three of those elements are at work in this country right now.
[02:49:22.177 --> 02:49:30.302]  You have all three demonic, possessed, totalitarian elements working together to overthrow our constitutional republic.
[02:49:31.042 --> 02:49:34.284]  Why does Christianity, real Christianity, produce so much incredible wealth?
[02:49:34.284 --> 02:49:43.268]  Like, Tootsies and Hootoos, the Christian groups, less than 10%, they have almost all the wealth because Christianity allowed them to not kill each other and produce wealth.
[02:49:43.268 --> 02:49:51.933]  You know, beyond IQ, some high IQ, some low, it's the Christian, real Christian ethos that creates fabulous wealth.
[02:49:52.153 --> 02:50:03.358]  Yeah, the sanctity of the human soul, the sanctity of human life, and the belief that you have a self-determination, and that the only person you have to answer to is God.
[02:50:03.358 --> 02:50:05.760]  That there's no man-god over you.
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:10.182]  Communism has a man-god over you, so does the caliphate, and so does the cartel.
[02:50:11.966 --> 02:50:15.389]  I remember being a little young and jealous or envious of things.
[02:50:15.389 --> 02:50:19.072]  The only thing I'm still jealous or envious of is women.
[02:50:19.072 --> 02:50:19.813]  That's genetic.
[02:50:19.813 --> 02:50:21.975]  But I was never like mad.
[02:50:21.975 --> 02:50:23.496]  The neighbor got a new motorcycle.
[02:50:23.496 --> 02:50:27.760]  The kid got a better motorcycle than I did or better golf clubs.
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:35.926]  But it's so freeing now to not get mad that some guy's got a gorgeous wife or a bunch of great kids or more money than me or a private jet.
[02:50:36.767 --> 02:50:39.970]  Um, I mean, it's so freeing that I'm, I mean, material's fine.
[02:50:39.970 --> 02:50:44.093]  I like to be successful and take care of my family, but it means nothing at the end of the day compared to ideas.
[02:50:44.093 --> 02:50:55.482]  But then I still run into most adults and they're just seized up with envy and like, well, your, your house is a little bigger or your pool or, and it's like, not that any of those things are bad, but to them, it's like, that's what they're shooting for.
[02:50:55.482 --> 02:50:56.883]  And they're so empty.
[02:50:57.608 --> 02:50:58.168]  Right.
[02:50:58.168 --> 02:51:08.594]  Well, it's what the Bible talks about when it says that, you know, a wealthy man will get into heaven much more easier or harder than putting a camel through the eye of the needle.
[02:51:08.594 --> 02:51:09.034]  Right.
[02:51:09.034 --> 02:51:15.237]  Because if you're worshiping just success and you're constantly grasping for more, you'll never be satisfied.
[02:51:15.237 --> 02:51:16.878]  What really counts is your everlasting soul.
[02:51:16.878 --> 02:51:17.999]  That's what really counts.
[02:51:17.999 --> 02:51:22.281]  And of course, if you really go to the Bible, the historians, Christ was pointing at the Jerusalem wall.
[02:51:22.281 --> 02:51:23.382]  It was called the eye of the needle.
[02:51:24.042 --> 02:51:26.243]  The thing is, a camel, you had to get on your knees.
[02:51:26.243 --> 02:51:27.403]  It was a very small opening.
[02:51:27.403 --> 02:51:29.724]  So the point was, you had to be humble.
[02:51:29.724 --> 02:51:32.165]  You can be rich, but you've got to get on your knees.
[02:51:32.165 --> 02:51:33.165]  And not to God.
[02:51:33.165 --> 02:51:34.905]  You can't put the money top.
[02:51:34.905 --> 02:51:45.088]  And that's why I think Christianity is so hated, is because that was the bedrock root of the conviction of our founding fathers to fight and bleed.
[02:51:45.088 --> 02:51:48.329]  They fear the conviction that we serve God, not man.
[02:51:48.329 --> 02:51:48.770]  Right.
[02:51:48.770 --> 02:51:50.070]  No king but Jesus.
[02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:51.911]  And they were willing to give their life up.
[02:51:51.911 --> 02:51:52.931]  And you had wealthy men
[02:51:53.511 --> 02:51:59.037]  Hancock, for example, who were willing to give up their fortune and risk all.
[02:51:59.037 --> 02:52:00.999]  And George Washington was wealthy as well.
[02:52:00.999 --> 02:52:01.919]  These are wealthy men.
[02:52:01.919 --> 02:52:05.323]  Where are the modern versions of Hancock and Washington?
[02:52:05.323 --> 02:52:10.688]  And as you know, the Brits were able to beat the Boers after a long war by grabbing their families.
[02:52:10.688 --> 02:52:14.111]  Many of the founders had their families taken and put on slave ships, starved to death.
[02:52:14.111 --> 02:52:17.855]  And they just let their families, they're like, we're sad, but you know, they starved to death.
[02:52:18.055 --> 02:52:29.742]  Well, if you have a conviction that what really counts is doing what's right, and that you're willing to give your life, and even your family's lives, because you know what really counts is your souls, then you don't give in.
[02:52:29.742 --> 02:52:38.908]  And imagine being in Boston or New York, and looking out at ships a mile out, and knowing your sons are on that ship, being starved to death, and you can't give up.
[02:52:38.908 --> 02:52:39.908]  Right, you can't.
[02:52:39.908 --> 02:52:42.330]  Well, because if you do, then everyone loses everything.
[02:52:42.890 --> 02:52:47.631]  Even if you want to talk about just here on earth, you're still talking about posterity.
[02:52:47.631 --> 02:52:49.271]  Your future is posterity.
[02:52:49.271 --> 02:52:51.312]  So why did the founders do that?
[02:52:51.312 --> 02:52:54.592]  Literally let their families starve to death instead of giving up?
[02:52:54.592 --> 02:52:55.432]  That's powerful.
[02:52:55.432 --> 02:52:55.732]  Right.
[02:52:55.732 --> 02:53:01.533]  Because they knew that they had to preserve the sanctity of the human conscience and the human soul.
[02:53:01.533 --> 02:53:04.394]  Your ability to say yes or no.
[02:53:04.394 --> 02:53:09.855]  And someone can kill you, but they can't make you submit to them unless you submit yourself.
[02:53:10.595 --> 02:53:12.116]  So let me ask you this, Stuart.
[02:53:12.116 --> 02:53:12.977]  Where are we going?
[02:53:12.977 --> 02:53:16.859]  Because Pelosi comes out and threatens to become a dictator.
[02:53:16.859 --> 02:53:17.599]  Here, let's play the clip.
[02:53:17.599 --> 02:53:18.740]  Cue up Pelosi.
[02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:22.623]  I mean, you talk about a monstrous person in her fascist dress.
[02:53:22.623 --> 02:53:22.943]  Here it is.
[02:53:24.099 --> 02:53:42.832]  The Republicans have some unease about it, no matter what they say, because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency, an illusion that he wants to convey, just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.
[02:53:42.832 --> 02:53:44.694]  You want to talk about a national emergency?
[02:53:44.694 --> 02:53:47.156]  Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary.
[02:53:48.231 --> 02:53:53.356]  of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America.
[02:53:53.356 --> 02:53:54.997]  That's a national emergency.
[02:53:54.997 --> 02:53:57.700]  Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?
[02:53:57.700 --> 02:53:58.400]  I wish you would.
[02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:01.724]  Even though gun crime's way down, what do you make of that, Stewart?
[02:54:02.383 --> 02:54:03.684]  Well, it's a scare tactic.
[02:54:03.684 --> 02:54:11.628]  What she's trying to say is that, you know, hey, you can't do this, and Republicans should oppose the president because he's opening the door for all kinds of problems.
[02:54:11.628 --> 02:54:16.430]  And I've even heard conservatives say, this is a problem, you shouldn't do this, because they could do this down the road.
[02:54:16.430 --> 02:54:21.593]  If they're advocating something unconstitutional, like gun confiscation, then they can't do it under the Constitution.
[02:54:21.593 --> 02:54:22.594]  It doesn't matter what Trump does.
[02:54:23.214 --> 02:54:25.275]  Regarding something that's perfectly constitutional.
[02:54:25.275 --> 02:54:29.918]  This is why, you know, self-defense of the nation and our borders, repelling an invasion, is squarely constitutional.
[02:54:29.918 --> 02:54:31.178]  It's one of his duties.
[02:54:31.178 --> 02:54:37.062]  So I don't really give much concern for this being a bad precedent for down the road.
[02:54:37.062 --> 02:54:44.226]  If they go and try to use a national emergency, you know, so-called, to confiscate firearms, it's unconstitutional and then we just fight.
[02:54:44.226 --> 02:54:45.887]  I was about to say, but let's expand on that.
[02:54:46.792 --> 02:54:50.715]  The left is spoiling for some weird war and all these antifa wimps.
[02:54:50.715 --> 02:54:56.040]  Can they imagine if they do start a war and the veneer of civilization peels away in seconds?
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:55:07.729]  Do they understand that everything conservatives and Christians have done to build businesses, and to serve their country and their family, is that people have already, I've not, the public's already scouted everything out.
[02:55:07.729 --> 02:55:13.534]  And they're not, they don't want to do this, but, I mean, everybody's going to know the moment, and then I don't think these leftists realize what's going to happen to them.
[02:55:14.505 --> 02:55:15.526]  No, they don't.
[02:55:15.526 --> 02:55:18.168]  And I want to stress that I don't want that.
[02:55:18.168 --> 02:55:25.293]  Like right now, I'm being smeared by Media Matters trying to say that, you know, we talked about murdering leftists on a show prior, you know, and sure.
[02:55:25.293 --> 02:55:29.516]  What we talked about is that if there's a civil war, they'll lose.
[02:55:29.516 --> 02:55:31.577]  And they'll force us to have to fight.
[02:55:31.577 --> 02:55:32.458]  And I hate that!
[02:55:32.458 --> 02:55:32.658]  Right.
[02:55:33.198 --> 02:55:35.759]  So a lot of them I think know it.
[02:55:35.759 --> 02:55:39.221]  I think the elites understand they can't go too far too fast.
[02:55:39.221 --> 02:55:43.424]  So what they're trying to do is condition us and they're waiting until one of them is Commander-in-Chief.
[02:55:43.424 --> 02:55:45.985]  They're not going to try something like this while Trump's in.
[02:55:45.985 --> 02:55:51.088]  They would prefer, if they're going to have an outright fight with us, they want to make sure that one of them is Commander-in-Chief.
[02:55:51.088 --> 02:55:56.010]  So that's why you got to watch out for a future Democrat as Commander-in-Chief under those conditions.
[02:55:56.010 --> 02:55:57.151]  Like with Hillary, if Hillary won,
[02:55:58.015 --> 02:55:59.136]  I think all bets are off.
[02:55:59.136 --> 02:55:59.556]  No, I agree.
[02:55:59.556 --> 02:56:00.957]  They're going to go over the censorship and everything.
[02:56:00.957 --> 02:56:02.898]  In fact, they're going ahead with it as if she had one.
[02:56:02.898 --> 02:56:04.058]  But here's the thing.
[02:56:04.058 --> 02:56:06.039]  I'm not an authoritarian.
[02:56:06.039 --> 02:56:10.842]  But when you're faced with authoritarianism, then what do you do?
[02:56:10.842 --> 02:56:13.803]  Because the Democratic Party is not an American party.
[02:56:13.803 --> 02:56:15.404]  They're a globalist, anti-American party.
[02:56:15.404 --> 02:56:17.385]  They say America was never great, will never be great.
[02:56:17.385 --> 02:56:18.886]  We shouldn't have borders.
[02:56:18.886 --> 02:56:20.667]  They're allied with foreign governments.
[02:56:20.667 --> 02:56:23.629]  I don't think they qualify
[02:56:25.026 --> 02:56:28.409]  As a party that could even be in the electoral system?
[02:56:28.409 --> 02:56:33.332]  Well, what the President can do is he can use the Constitution to suppress the insurrection.
[02:56:33.332 --> 02:56:36.435]  He has an open insurrection in the entire state of California.
[02:56:36.435 --> 02:56:41.839]  The elected officials there, with their sanctuary state, they're in open rebellion against the laws of the Union.
[02:56:42.319 --> 02:56:49.082]  And the clearest law of the union that's, you know, very constitutional is a law against illegal immigration and harboring illegals.
[02:56:49.082 --> 02:56:50.302]  They're committing felonies.
[02:56:50.302 --> 02:56:58.686]  So what Trump could do is he could prosecute them for the DOJ, but he could also call up the militia to go and suppress the insurrection that's happening right now in California.
[02:56:58.686 --> 02:56:59.306]  He could do that.
[02:56:59.306 --> 02:57:01.107]  It's a constitutional power.
[02:57:01.107 --> 02:57:06.309]  I know everybody I know that lives in California, especially Southern California, they say we're all trying to get out.
[02:57:06.989 --> 02:57:09.251]  I mean, it is a fricking hellhole.
[02:57:09.251 --> 02:57:10.953]  We're going to go on a break, come back and take your phone calls.
[02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:16.357]  The toll-free number to join us is Stewart Rhoades, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[02:57:16.357 --> 02:57:27.466]  We're going to take a few-minute break here when we come back and play part of this Alan Dershowitz interview with Tucker Carlson last night, in case you didn't know that they really are trying to 25th Amendment coup against the President.
[02:57:27.466 --> 02:57:28.788]  That's now mainstream news.
[02:57:28.788 --> 02:57:32.811]  I mean, we told you the emergency was coming, we told you this was going on.
[02:57:32.811 --> 02:57:34.773]  We broke it almost a year ago, but now it's all confirmed.
[02:57:35.794 --> 02:57:36.917]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:57:36.917 --> 02:57:39.082]  Stay with us, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:57:39.082 --> 02:57:42.531]  Please don't forget, a bunch of big specials in this Sunday in Fort WorthStore.com.
[02:57:42.531 --> 02:57:42.791]  Thank you.
[02:57:54.471 --> 02:57:56.792]  By leaps and by bounds.
[02:57:56.792 --> 02:58:03.474]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.474 --> 02:58:13.536]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.536 --> 02:58:22.079]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:22.944 --> 02:58:24.265]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:58:24.265 --> 02:58:25.426]  You must experience it.
[02:58:25.426 --> 02:58:27.507]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:58:27.507 --> 02:58:32.411]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.411 --> 02:58:33.932]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:58:33.932 --> 02:58:35.413]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:58:35.413 --> 02:58:42.118]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:58:42.118 --> 02:58:43.599]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[02:58:46.204 --> 02:58:48.906]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:48.906 --> 02:58:55.269]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:57.230]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:58:57.230 --> 02:59:03.874]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.

[02:59:10.037 --> 02:59:10.798]  We're good to go.
[02:59:29.674 --> 02:59:32.156]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:00.427 --> 03:00:05.404]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:18.399 --> 03:00:21.261]  We got some big breaking news at the start of the next segment.
[03:00:21.261 --> 03:00:27.186]  Lawmakers in Texas have introduced legislation for $2.5 billion to build a wall right here in Texas.
[03:00:27.186 --> 03:00:28.687]  So the states are taking action.
[03:00:28.687 --> 03:00:29.748]  Very, very exciting.
[03:00:29.748 --> 03:00:30.669]  Stuart Rose is with us.
[03:00:30.669 --> 03:00:33.651]  We've got, of course, Matt Bracken taking over at the bottom of the hour.
[03:00:33.651 --> 03:00:36.013]  I'm going to take your phone calls starting the next segment.
[03:00:36.013 --> 03:00:39.396]  But I want to play, Stuart mentioned it, because you kind of pinched yourself.
[03:00:39.396 --> 03:00:43.960]  Like I was telling people in October, Trump's declared an emergency, and then I said he would a month ago, and now he's done it.
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:47.463]  But we got into the 25th Amendment coup plan against the president specifically.
[03:00:48.203 --> 03:00:49.788]  And how it was being planned.
[03:00:49.788 --> 03:00:52.916]  And I'm just pointing out they want us off air because it freaks them out how accurate we are.
[03:00:54.198 --> 03:01:08.667]  But here's liberal Harvard law professor, very respected, one of the biggest winning records, you know, you're a lawyer out there, out there, you know, on all sorts of fronts, Alan Dershowitz, pointing out that this is an attempted coup against the president.
[03:01:08.667 --> 03:01:10.508]  We're living in amazing times, folks.
[03:01:10.508 --> 03:01:14.850]  So here is Alan Dershowitz, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:01:14.850 --> 03:01:19.313]  I should also again point out, everybody should visit Oathkeepers.org.
[03:01:19.313 --> 03:01:20.454]  Here is Alan Dershowitz.
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:28.404]  60 Minutes interview, McCabe admits that his attempt to undermine the president began almost immediately after his boss, Jim Comey, was fired.
[03:01:28.404 --> 03:01:31.906]  And it was, of course, due to Russia.
[03:01:31.906 --> 03:01:41.672]  I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency and won the election for the presidency and who might have done so.
[03:01:43.078 --> 03:01:51.543]  With the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable adversary on the world stage.
[03:01:51.543 --> 03:01:53.224]  And that was something that troubled me greatly.
[03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:59.594]  How long was it after that, that you decided to start the obstruction of justice?
[03:01:59.594 --> 03:02:02.576]  Look at that sanctimonious turds back there.
[03:02:02.576 --> 03:02:18.368]  I think the next day I met with the team investigating the Russia cases and I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward.
[03:02:19.378 --> 03:02:21.540]  Ellen Dershowitz is a retired Harvard Law School professor.
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:25.924]  He's the author of the book, The Case Against the Democratic House Impeaching Trump, and he joins us now.
[03:02:25.924 --> 03:02:27.965]  Professor, thanks very much for coming on.
[03:02:27.965 --> 03:02:39.055]  So, now the suspicions of many are confirmed by one of the players in it, the Department of Justice discussed trying to remove the President using the 25th Amendment.
[03:02:39.055 --> 03:02:40.036]  What's your reaction to that?
[03:02:41.775 --> 03:02:46.256]  Well, if that's true, it is clearly an attempted coup d'etat.
[03:02:46.256 --> 03:02:50.918]  Relating to what your former guest said, let's take the worst case scenario.
[03:02:50.918 --> 03:02:57.720]  Let's assume the President of the United States was in bed with the Russians, committed treason, committed obstruction of justice.
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:01.621]  The 25th Amendment simply is irrelevant to that.
[03:03:01.621 --> 03:03:03.962]  That's why you have an impeachment provision.
[03:03:04.502 --> 03:03:08.743]  The 25th Amendment is about Woodrow Wilson having a stroke.
[03:03:08.743 --> 03:03:13.624]  It's about a president being shot and not being able to perform his office.
[03:03:13.624 --> 03:03:16.605]  It's not about the most fundamental disagreements.
[03:03:16.605 --> 03:03:18.805]  It's not about impeachable offenses.
[03:03:18.805 --> 03:03:26.467]  And any Justice Department official who even mentioned the 25th Amendment in the context of President Trump has
[03:03:27.487 --> 03:03:27.748]  Right.
[03:03:27.748 --> 03:03:27.848]  Yes.
[03:03:46.889 --> 03:03:47.670]  That's right.
[03:04:17.129 --> 03:04:17.630]  Exactly.
[03:04:17.630 --> 03:04:18.490]  So this is not simply, you know...
[03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:48.294]  I bet they're doing that right now.
[03:04:48.294 --> 03:04:51.284]  But this is an attack on our system, I would say, not just on themselves.
[03:04:51.284 --> 03:04:52.368]  Al Dershowitz, thank you very much.
[03:04:52.368 --> 03:04:52.929]  We'll be back.
[03:04:52.929 --> 03:04:53.391]  Stay with us.

[03:06:15.037 --> 03:06:34.543]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.543 --> 03:06:40.785]  Alright, we're going to take phone calls for a couple of seconds from Stuart Rhodes, both keepers.
[03:06:41.770 --> 03:06:47.792]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and then we're going to turn the baton over to the rest of the broadcast, and the war room starts, to Matt Bracken.
[03:06:47.792 --> 03:06:52.333]  And of course, Matt likes Stewart Rhodes, so they may talk a little bit in the next segment as well.
[03:06:52.333 --> 03:06:56.694]  Don't forget, oathkeepers.org, you're doing a membership drive.
[03:06:56.694 --> 03:07:03.456]  People can also buy t-shirts there to support the great work you're doing, Stewart, as a constitutional Yale Law graduate.
[03:07:04.136 --> 03:07:06.399]  As a veteran, a patriot, he's doing a yeoman's work.
[03:07:06.399 --> 03:07:10.403]  And people, I always get these comments, and I'm talking about the membership drive, this paradox.
[03:07:10.403 --> 03:07:12.506]  They go, oh, you and Stuart Rose, they'll bring you up.
[03:07:12.506 --> 03:07:14.748]  They go, you claim you're against the police state.
[03:07:14.748 --> 03:07:18.533]  Now you want troops on the border, and you want to go after the cartel.
[03:07:18.533 --> 03:07:20.895]  Yeah, we don't want checkpoints in the middle of Kansas.
[03:07:21.883 --> 03:07:22.944]  Or New York.
[03:07:22.944 --> 03:07:23.365]  Randomly.
[03:07:23.365 --> 03:07:34.956]  When you've got a collapsing border, and narco-terrorists allied with radical Islam attacking, and hundreds of thousands dead in Mexico, and the Democrats working with MS-13, that's constitutional!
[03:07:34.956 --> 03:07:37.118]  That's what the military and police are supposed to do!
[03:07:37.118 --> 03:07:40.782]  They're not supposed to be asking me if my tint's too dark in my car.
[03:07:40.782 --> 03:07:42.324]  They're supposed to be dealing with criminals.
[03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:45.059]  Well, they have to defend the nation.
[03:07:45.059 --> 03:07:49.520]  The primary purpose of the military is national defense, which is defending our country.
[03:07:49.520 --> 03:08:00.384]  And Article 1, Section 8 articulates the three reasons the President can call forth the militia, which includes us, is to repel invasions, suppress insurrections, and execute the laws of the Union.
[03:08:00.384 --> 03:08:07.407]  And ever since the Civil War, in particular, there have been a series of statutes that give the President the authority to even use the armed forces for those purposes.
[03:08:07.407 --> 03:08:08.988]  I wouldn't want to see them used internally.
[03:08:08.988 --> 03:08:11.509]  I think it's actually unconstitutional to use the Army internally.
[03:08:12.509 --> 03:08:13.549]  Yeah, it's the militia.
[03:08:13.549 --> 03:08:15.510]  Not just the Posse Comitatus, the U.S.
[03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:16.490]  Constitution.
[03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:19.290]  It's the militia that's tasked with suppressing insurrections.
[03:08:19.290 --> 03:08:21.571]  It should be like civil defense, this militia.
[03:08:21.571 --> 03:08:22.051]  Well, no.
[03:08:22.051 --> 03:08:23.831]  Suppressing insurrections, executing the laws of the Union.
[03:08:23.831 --> 03:08:25.552]  There should be no FBI, frankly.
[03:08:25.552 --> 03:08:32.813]  It should be the militia who execute the laws of the Union under the command of the President, as Dr. Edmund Vieira has pointed out many times in a series of books.
[03:08:32.813 --> 03:08:33.333]  I recommend them.
[03:08:33.333 --> 03:08:35.034]  People say, oh, we need the professionals.
[03:08:35.034 --> 03:08:35.994]  What, like the FBI?
[03:08:36.334 --> 03:08:37.014]  No, exactly.
[03:08:37.014 --> 03:08:37.935]  Look how corrupt they are.
[03:08:37.935 --> 03:08:42.376]  I mean, Cointelpro back in the day, you can go back to what they did.
[03:08:42.376 --> 03:08:43.316]  And people never get that.
[03:08:43.316 --> 03:08:45.177]  So who commands the Constitutional Militia?
[03:08:45.177 --> 03:08:49.618]  It's not just like it's random, you know, every man's in it, but it's picked, it's selected.
[03:08:49.618 --> 03:08:55.020]  Well, no, it's the governors of the state command the militias unless they're called into federal service.
[03:08:55.020 --> 03:08:58.261]  And they're called into federal service for only three legitimate purposes.
[03:08:58.261 --> 03:09:00.082]  One is to suppress insurrections.
[03:09:00.842 --> 03:09:04.123]  But I just want to explain that in the classical thing, 18 to 45 or whatever,
[03:09:29.011 --> 03:09:31.654]  Under the governors, it's almost like the state guard.
[03:09:31.654 --> 03:09:34.116]  It's former police, military, or people that are vetted.
[03:09:34.116 --> 03:09:38.701]  I get every able-bodied man's in it, but obviously nowadays, able-bodied men don't want to be involved.
[03:09:38.701 --> 03:09:41.583]  We're not just going to randomly grab some guy off the street and hand him a machine gun.
[03:09:41.583 --> 03:09:47.709]  Well, the president could call up every able-bodied, still in federal statutes, every able-bodied male between 18 and 45 is in the militia.
[03:09:49.491 --> 03:09:55.893]  There's also a statute that says for military veterans up to age 65, we call it by the President of the United States.
[03:09:55.893 --> 03:10:00.755]  So even though the states have not formed militias, which they should, the President can call us up as the militia.
[03:10:00.755 --> 03:10:04.396]  And there should be militias for firefighting and floods.
[03:10:04.396 --> 03:10:05.377]  It's for any crisis, right?
[03:10:05.377 --> 03:10:05.497]  Sure.
[03:10:05.497 --> 03:10:08.358]  Well, yeah, just like the National Guard does disaster relief, the militia would do the same.
[03:10:08.358 --> 03:10:09.378]  Well, I was in the Civil Air Patrol.
[03:10:10.017 --> 03:10:10.217]  Right.
[03:10:10.217 --> 03:10:13.742]  And, you know, we were flying around doing drills when I was a kid looking for submarines in Old Mexico.
[03:10:13.742 --> 03:10:15.004]  It didn't mean we're all paranoid or anything.
[03:10:15.004 --> 03:10:16.205]  It's just what you do.
[03:10:16.205 --> 03:10:16.626]  Sure.
[03:10:16.626 --> 03:10:24.536]  And you still, in this state here, you still have your National Guard, which is your remnant of the militia, but you also have your state defense force, the Texas State Guard.
[03:10:25.097 --> 03:10:29.878]  is a state defense force that cannot be called into federal service and sent overseas, which is good.
[03:10:29.878 --> 03:10:36.600]  So what Governor Abbott could do and should do is fill that with patriotic Texans and train the Texans.
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:47.843]  And us with prior military service, what we should do is take the responsibility of training our fellow veterans, our fellow citizens here in Texas, for example, and make sure you train them all up so they're a trained pool of people
[03:10:48.323 --> 03:10:54.130]  Preferably under the command of the governor, formally, in the Texas State Guard, but then Trump could call them up.
[03:10:54.130 --> 03:10:56.953]  And the crisis, the governors line up on the president.
[03:10:56.953 --> 03:10:57.413]  Sure.
[03:10:57.413 --> 03:11:01.678]  So you now have a bill in front of your legislature in Texas to build the wall.
[03:11:01.678 --> 03:11:03.300]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:03.780]  Absolutely.
[03:11:03.780 --> 03:11:04.080]  Here it is.
[03:11:04.080 --> 03:11:07.544]  Two Texas lawmakers call for $2.5 billion state funds for the border.
[03:11:07.544 --> 03:11:08.705]  That's Houston Chronicle.
[03:11:09.366 --> 03:11:26.113]  And that's a brilliant solution because that gets right around, if the president does sign this monstrosity of a funding bill, which I think he should not, if he does, there's provisions in there that allow border counties to say no to a wall, which is ludicrous, because they're all controlled by the cartels and controlled by their Democratic allies.
[03:11:26.113 --> 03:11:38.719]  So what the governor of Texas is going to do, hopefully, is sign this bill, which will give Texas the authority to go down there and use eminent domain and pay the landowners for the taking of their property, and build a wall under Texas statutes
[03:11:39.139 --> 03:11:40.981]  The federal government can't touch it.
[03:11:40.981 --> 03:11:43.485]  The future Democratic president can't tear it back down.
[03:11:43.485 --> 03:11:44.886]  That's exactly what should happen.
[03:11:44.886 --> 03:11:48.110]  Because Texas has, what, at least half the border as in Texas?
[03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:57.041]  So you take care of that, God bless Texas, you guys fix it, and you should call up every Texan to step up, like in the Alamo, and go and serve as a Texas State Guard.
[03:11:58.087 --> 03:12:00.248]  And go and patrol that wall.
[03:12:00.248 --> 03:12:03.609]  Oh, I guarantee you if the governor called for that, he'd get 100,000 volunteers in a month.
[03:12:03.609 --> 03:12:04.749]  He should!
[03:12:04.749 --> 03:12:07.370]  We asked him to do that several years ago when he was first elected.
[03:12:07.370 --> 03:12:08.110]  We tried to reach him.
[03:12:08.110 --> 03:12:10.331]  His staff played blockage with him.
[03:12:10.331 --> 03:12:14.572]  So we hope that he'll hear the message and go ahead and call up Texans to get together.
[03:12:14.572 --> 03:12:21.894]  All I'm going to call is Stuart Rhodes, Oath Keepers, but it's clear that the UN is running this and trying to break our border.
[03:12:21.894 --> 03:12:23.814]  They didn't want the number of beds to take care of anything.
[03:12:23.814 --> 03:12:24.735]  They don't want judges.
[03:12:24.735 --> 03:12:25.755]  They want it broken.
[03:12:26.826 --> 03:12:27.527]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:12:27.527 --> 03:12:34.673]  This is Cloward Piven on a global scale to destroy Western civilization.
[03:12:34.673 --> 03:12:38.336]  And I know Matt Bracken's been talking about this for years and he's been completely spot on.
[03:12:38.336 --> 03:12:39.177]  That's what's happening.
[03:12:39.177 --> 03:12:41.959]  In Europe, we already see where we're going.
[03:12:41.959 --> 03:12:44.041]  What's happened in Europe is not happening in the United States.
[03:12:44.041 --> 03:12:46.523]  They're using the Central and South American countries.
[03:12:46.523 --> 03:12:48.745]  And by the way, they admit it's the plan.
[03:12:48.745 --> 03:12:49.105]  Yeah.
[03:12:49.105 --> 03:12:51.607]  That's what's so frustrating is this is all admitted.
[03:12:51.607 --> 03:12:53.449]  People are like, oh, Alex Jones or Stewart Rhodes.
[03:12:53.449 --> 03:12:54.250]  It's admitted.
[03:12:55.205 --> 03:13:06.370]  Also I'm glad AOC, Cortez, I'm glad she's coming out and saying we shouldn't even have a border because every Hispanic, anybody with Latino blood has a right to be here because it's indigenous territory.
[03:13:06.370 --> 03:13:10.491]  I'm glad she's saying that because she's now making it very clear this is what she wants to do.
[03:13:10.491 --> 03:13:11.612]  She is a La Raza.
[03:13:11.612 --> 03:13:13.212]  She's a La Raza fanatic.
[03:13:13.212 --> 03:13:17.014]  She's a communist fanatic who happens to come from New York.
[03:13:17.014 --> 03:13:19.015]  Doesn't she look like she's on methamphetamine too?
[03:13:20.100 --> 03:13:25.411]  Well, I think she's a radical Marxist and, you know, that means she's batshit, you know, crazy.
[03:13:25.411 --> 03:13:26.673]  But that's from her Marxism.
[03:13:27.449 --> 03:13:29.650]  She hates this country and she's been indoctrinated.
[03:13:29.650 --> 03:13:32.430]  But I love how she wears, like, $5,000 outfits.
[03:13:32.430 --> 03:13:33.290]  What is it about leftists?
[03:13:33.290 --> 03:13:37.271]  They're always, like, in luxury, multi-million dollar apartments.
[03:13:37.271 --> 03:13:40.352]  They're wearing $5,000 outfits.
[03:13:40.352 --> 03:13:43.913]  Well, they see themselves as the vanguard of the revolution, right?
[03:13:43.913 --> 03:13:45.354]  So the vanguard always gets the best.
[03:13:45.354 --> 03:13:49.835]  They always get the caviar and the Mercedes and, you know, the limousine liberals.
[03:13:49.835 --> 03:13:52.275]  So as long as they're in charge, it's okay.
[03:13:52.275 --> 03:13:54.236]  Man, these people are sick.
[03:13:54.236 --> 03:13:54.976]  We got Eustace.
[03:13:57.065 --> 03:13:58.888]  And then we've got so many other callers.
[03:13:58.888 --> 03:14:00.650]  Eustace in Missouri, you're on the air with Stuart Rhodes.
[03:14:00.650 --> 03:14:01.592]  Go ahead.
[03:14:01.592 --> 03:14:02.874]  How's it going, Stuart?
[03:14:02.874 --> 03:14:05.558]  Alex, thank you for fighting, man.
[03:14:05.558 --> 03:14:10.926]  Years ago, Stuart, I put you in touch with Kevin Vainio up there to help Wren in Montana.
[03:14:11.639 --> 03:14:17.441]  And the FBI does need to be dismanded, and there's a good website.
[03:14:17.441 --> 03:14:19.322]  You could just Google, I hate the FBI.
[03:14:19.322 --> 03:14:30.406]  But the reason I'm calling is I attended a speech last night from a gentleman that was a 31-year CIA agent, and he spoke at the College of the Ozarks here in Missouri, and I recorded it.
[03:14:31.255 --> 03:14:34.597]  And he tells them that they ask him about Snowden.
[03:14:34.597 --> 03:14:36.339]  He said Snowden's a traitor.
[03:14:36.339 --> 03:14:43.924]  He asked him about the investigation on Trump and he told the young kids that they should continue to investigate Trump till they get to the bottom of it.
[03:14:43.924 --> 03:14:53.410]  He said Putin is a killer and he told them how great it is to lie and that the CIA has a face and I would suggest everyone go listen to it.
[03:14:53.410 --> 03:14:54.431]  It's at Lone Star 1776.
[03:14:56.272 --> 03:15:03.780]  And they also advocate for the so-called domestic terrorist, Francis Schaeffer Cox, and he's up for re-sentencing and we're calling for a new trial.
[03:15:03.780 --> 03:15:11.427]  Well let's be clear, these politicos in the CIA, the CIA's a big organization, they're just globalist operatives that have used the National Security Act to take the country over.
[03:15:11.427 --> 03:15:16.232]  But yeah, they've got the CIA domestically involved now, they've legalized that eight years ago, Obama did.
[03:15:16.232 --> 03:15:20.075]  And to even call this, I don't think they're defending the CIA, they're not CIA.
[03:15:20.876 --> 03:15:23.461]  They're globalist collaborators in U.S.
[03:15:23.461 --> 03:15:28.311]  intelligence agencies all over the country preaching this anti-Americanism.
[03:15:28.311 --> 03:15:29.112]  And they're very dangerous.
[03:15:29.112 --> 03:15:29.994]  You want to say something about that, sir?
[03:15:31.042 --> 03:15:31.622]  Uh, no.
[03:15:31.622 --> 03:15:32.463]  It's no surprise.
[03:15:32.463 --> 03:15:36.024]  I mean, look, the CIA has been part of the Deep State since its inception.
[03:15:36.024 --> 03:15:36.584]  That's the problem.
[03:15:36.584 --> 03:15:37.824]  This is what Eisenhower warned about.
[03:15:37.824 --> 03:15:40.945]  It's part of the military-industrial complex that came after World War II.
[03:15:40.945 --> 03:15:44.567]  And he didn't like them because it was just totally, it was just doing whatever they want.
[03:15:44.567 --> 03:15:46.807]  I mean, it's like, you're not, you're under Congress's control.
[03:15:46.807 --> 03:15:47.028]  Sure.
[03:15:47.028 --> 03:15:49.228]  Kill me back with more calls and Matt Bragg and stay with us.

[03:17:23.858 --> 03:17:27.779]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.779 --> 03:17:29.320]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.320 --> 03:17:32.281]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.281 --> 03:17:37.843]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.843 --> 03:17:39.044]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.044 --> 03:17:41.985]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:41.985 --> 03:17:44.186]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.186 --> 03:17:48.648]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:48.648 --> 03:17:50.929]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:18:03.410 --> 03:18:12.434]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:18:12.434 --> 03:18:22.497]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:18:33.221 --> 03:18:34.362]  You must experience it.

[03:18:36.382 --> 03:18:41.363]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:18:41.363 --> 03:18:42.884]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:18:42.884 --> 03:18:44.364]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:18:44.364 --> 03:18:51.046]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:18:51.046 --> 03:18:52.546]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.

[03:19:00.556 --> 03:19:02.096]  Ultimate Bone Broth.

[03:20:17.255 --> 03:20:20.215]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:20:20.215 --> 03:20:22.296]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:20:22.296 --> 03:20:24.516]  We're taking your phone calls.
[03:20:24.516 --> 03:20:28.397]  We're going to go ahead and just co-host with Matt Bracken this hour.
[03:20:28.397 --> 03:20:32.318]  Stuart Rose and we're having important discussions behind the scenes here.
[03:20:32.318 --> 03:20:36.179]  That you have to talk about the operating system of the Democrats.
[03:20:36.179 --> 03:20:36.859]  Who they are.
[03:20:36.859 --> 03:20:37.879]  Why they're so crazed.
[03:20:37.879 --> 03:20:39.860]  Why they hate the country.
[03:20:39.860 --> 03:20:40.760]  What powers them.
[03:20:41.747 --> 03:20:46.408]  How they go on television and celebrate killing babies after they're born.
[03:20:46.408 --> 03:20:47.948]  Why they say America was never great.
[03:20:47.948 --> 03:20:50.089]  They run the country.
[03:20:50.089 --> 03:20:51.869]  But why do they have an existential hatred?
[03:20:51.869 --> 03:20:56.050]  Well, Matt Bracken, Stuart Rhodes, quick question for both of you.
[03:20:56.050 --> 03:21:00.091]  We're going to go back to calls and we can talk to the callers.
[03:21:00.091 --> 03:21:01.971]  Matt Bracken, EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[03:21:01.971 --> 03:21:03.252]  You're with OathKeepers.org.
[03:21:03.252 --> 03:21:03.952]  We're with InfoWars.com.
[03:21:05.632 --> 03:21:08.194]  And remember folks, only your word of mouth gets those websites out now.
[03:21:08.194 --> 03:21:09.114]  The total censorship's here.
[03:21:09.114 --> 03:21:11.476]  So your word of mouth is what trumps what the enemy's doing.
[03:21:11.476 --> 03:21:12.796]  So please remember that.
[03:21:12.796 --> 03:21:13.677]  Why?
[03:21:13.677 --> 03:21:16.959]  What is the Democrat, what is the globalist operating system, Matt Bracken?
[03:21:16.959 --> 03:21:23.223]  And why, I'm not putting words in your mouth, I think you agree, do they have such existential hatred for the West?
[03:21:23.223 --> 03:21:24.483]  Is it the Christian ethos?
[03:21:24.483 --> 03:21:26.705]  What is it?
[03:21:26.705 --> 03:21:27.425]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:21:29.813 --> 03:21:33.234]  They say that they're atheists, but they're actually very religious.
[03:21:33.234 --> 03:21:39.216]  They're hyper-religious in the same way that Islamists, you know, believe in forcing the Koran.
[03:21:39.216 --> 03:21:41.577]  They believe in Marxism.
[03:21:41.577 --> 03:21:54.481]  And part of Marxism is, just like with Islam, they have a socialist Takiyah, where because the ends justify the means, including, you know, pogroms in Russia or China or Cambodia,
[03:21:55.356 --> 03:22:04.087]  It certainly means that if they're willing to hurt people in gulags and machine guns on them, they're certainly willing to lie to our faces.
[03:22:04.087 --> 03:22:10.235]  The great reporter, so-called, who was considered the most trusted man in America,
[03:22:11.816 --> 03:22:13.277]  He was, you know, Walter Cronkite.
[03:22:13.277 --> 03:22:19.120]  He didn't, until he retired from television, did he admit he was a leader of the World Federalist Society.
[03:22:19.120 --> 03:22:20.541]  He hid that.
[03:22:20.541 --> 03:22:22.782]  He pretended to be a patriot.
[03:22:22.782 --> 03:22:27.425]  You know, he was there for all the rocket launches, but he was all the while acting like a termite.
[03:22:27.425 --> 03:22:33.529]  He was the guy that said in 68, Tet proves we've lost in Vietnam, when it was actually a wipeout of the Viet Cong.
[03:22:34.392 --> 03:22:43.639]  But he was, you know, all the way, a termite, hiding it, pretending to be a patriot, while secretly his religion really was globalism.
[03:22:43.639 --> 03:22:46.401]  And he didn't reveal this until much later.
[03:22:46.401 --> 03:22:55.207]  And I would expect on their deathbeds there are many acting, serving generals, senators, etc., that say, yeah, I gotta pretend to be an American, but I'm a globalist.
[03:22:55.856 --> 03:22:58.398]  I'm a global, secular, statist.
[03:22:58.398 --> 03:22:59.678]  I worship the state.
[03:23:25.794 --> 03:23:26.515]  Commitment.
[03:23:26.515 --> 03:23:31.340]  That's why they're willing to play the long game and they did the long march through the institutions.
[03:23:31.340 --> 03:23:34.784]  This started way back in the late 1800s and they did that.
[03:23:34.784 --> 03:23:37.788]  They successfully took over academia, the legal system.
[03:23:37.788 --> 03:23:41.672]  But they're rich and are always tax exempt and fly around in helicopters.
[03:23:41.852 --> 03:23:56.683]  Sure, but ultimately they believe, and to them it's not a conflict, the vanguard always, like in the Soviet Union, the people at the very top in the party had the villas on the Black Sea, had their mistresses, the best looking women.
[03:23:56.903 --> 03:23:59.144]  You know, they had all the caviar, etc.
[03:23:59.144 --> 03:24:05.327]  So it's like Orwell said, that's why he wrote what he wrote in the Animal Forum, that all animals are pretty equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
[03:24:05.327 --> 03:24:07.548]  He'd been a communist and believed it until he got into it.
[03:24:07.548 --> 03:24:09.649]  He saw what happened in the Soviet Union.
[03:24:09.649 --> 03:24:11.850]  This is why he wrote those, those are all warnings.
[03:24:11.850 --> 03:24:14.331]  Of course, the modern left takes those as playbooks.
[03:24:14.591 --> 03:24:17.612]  That's why you have face crime and hat crime.
[03:24:17.612 --> 03:24:19.092]  You wear a MAGA hat, that's hat crime.
[03:24:19.092 --> 03:24:20.193]  That's one he missed.
[03:24:20.193 --> 03:24:21.653]  But we talked about face crime.
[03:24:21.653 --> 03:24:24.194]  The wrong expression on your face could get you punished.
[03:24:24.194 --> 03:24:25.714]  That's where we are now in this country.
[03:24:25.714 --> 03:24:28.475]  So these people are just, call them what they are.
[03:24:28.475 --> 03:24:32.897]  They are Marxist ideologues and Marxist religious zealots.
[03:24:32.897 --> 03:24:33.697]  That is their religion.
[03:24:33.697 --> 03:24:39.839]  And that's why, like I was at Yale Law School, one of my fellow students was a community organizer from New York.
[03:24:40.659 --> 03:24:42.281]  And a union activist.
[03:24:42.281 --> 03:24:45.844]  And she said that the excesses of Stalin were our fault.
[03:24:45.844 --> 03:24:50.227]  Because the United States intervened and supported the white Russians against the regime.
[03:24:50.227 --> 03:24:52.409]  That that is why we had Stalin.
[03:24:52.409 --> 03:24:57.634]  So no matter what happens, they'll never admit that communism itself is demonic and flawed.
[03:24:57.634 --> 03:25:00.296]  They'll always say it's the wrong people who are in charge.
[03:25:00.296 --> 03:25:02.237]  Once we've extinguished capitalism.
[03:25:02.237 --> 03:25:02.858]  Yeah.
[03:25:02.858 --> 03:25:06.321]  It was wreckers from the capitalists who went in there and screwed up the revolution.
[03:25:06.921 --> 03:25:21.544]  So, Matt, now that what we talked about a year ago is confirmed, the attempted coup, 25th Amendment against the President, it's now on Fox News, CNN, CNN's saying it's a great idea, where do we go from here knowing there's a fifth column that hasn't been prosecuted?
[03:25:21.544 --> 03:25:30.386]  I'm glad the President declared an emergency, but it's a dereliction of duty if Whitaker or this new deep state Attorney General doesn't start indicting these people.
[03:25:31.414 --> 03:25:41.016]  Yeah, if William Barr turns out to be just another guy like Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, I mean, he goes back to the same CIA origins.
[03:25:41.016 --> 03:25:50.778]  He's one of these blue-ribbon commission guys you can count on to cover up like a, you know, TWA 800 or Waco or Ruby Ridge.
[03:25:50.778 --> 03:25:56.699]  He's one of those guys that has the patina of sincere objectivity and, you know, professionalism.
[03:25:56.699 --> 03:25:59.840]  But really, I think, to the bone, he's a deep state operative.
[03:26:00.300 --> 03:26:01.962]  And that'll be a big tell right there.
[03:26:01.962 --> 03:26:05.605]  If all of this gets swept under the rug, we'll know.
[03:26:05.605 --> 03:26:10.970]  But going back to why did Trump get elected, it's because he did promise to build the wall.
[03:26:10.970 --> 03:26:19.457]  And at a gut level, at a litmus test A-B level, people understand the globalists, the Democrats, they want to flood the country.
[03:26:19.457 --> 03:26:20.298]  Cloward Piven
[03:26:21.107 --> 03:26:21.788]  I agree with you.
[03:26:21.788 --> 03:26:24.090]  I think Peter Schiff's wrong.
[03:26:40.163 --> 03:26:48.427]  I think their rage has made them be precipitous, be honest about who they are, and all their horrible freedom ups and the Covington kids and everything.
[03:26:48.427 --> 03:26:54.270]  I think if we just hold the line and get more aggressive in the info war, I think we win.
[03:26:54.270 --> 03:26:58.732]  But Trump has got to, I mean, he should have someone like Evan Vieira as Attorney General.
[03:26:58.732 --> 03:27:01.654]  He should go pick a real patriot who has proven their loyalty.
[03:27:01.654 --> 03:27:04.315]  Yeah, what does he think going and getting establishment people does?
[03:27:05.174 --> 03:27:05.754]  Nothing.
[03:27:05.754 --> 03:27:10.795]  I mean, he's been convinced, and Barr is a, he'll advocate for a red flag.
[03:27:10.795 --> 03:27:15.196]  If Trump signs a red flag law, a national red flag law, his goose is cooked.
[03:27:15.196 --> 03:27:18.517]  Because gun owners across the country will stay home and will not vote for him.
[03:27:18.517 --> 03:27:22.798]  And so he's being set up, I think, to be pushed through a red flag law.
[03:27:22.798 --> 03:27:26.778]  And when he does that, he'll lose at least 10% of his base.
[03:27:26.778 --> 03:27:27.999]  Agree 100%.
[03:27:27.999 --> 03:27:29.979]  Red flags are going to be a red line.
[03:27:30.643 --> 03:27:44.489]  Because you can imagine all of these Federal Law Enforcers, where they'll say that, you know, you shouldn't have a firearm in your house because somebody has a domestic violence warning against you, something like that.
[03:27:44.489 --> 03:27:51.733]  Which is boilerplate for lawyers in a... Yeah, I mean, almost 90% of divorces, they tell the wife, get a restraining order.
[03:27:52.313 --> 03:27:53.334]  Well, this is worse.
[03:27:53.334 --> 03:28:10.564]  This is taking that same problem and making it so that your local police chief or your corrupt local official or someone who doesn't like you, a local activist who doesn't like your bumper sticker, can call the cops and say that you're a threat and you'll never even know it until the cops come to your door because it's an ex parte hearing, which means you're not there.
[03:28:10.564 --> 03:28:14.487]  You have no opportunity to confront your accusers, no evidence on your behalf.
[03:28:14.487 --> 03:28:18.389]  They have a star chamber event, this is what Bloomberg's pushing, and they just take your guns.
[03:28:18.709 --> 03:28:20.571]  Right, and he already had a death in Maryland.
[03:28:20.571 --> 03:28:23.994]  A man got in an argument with his adult sister, who doesn't even live with him.
[03:28:23.994 --> 03:28:25.876]  Not even a domestic violence situation.
[03:28:25.876 --> 03:28:27.177]  She called the cops on him.
[03:28:27.177 --> 03:28:29.359]  They came to his door because he went for his gun.
[03:28:29.359 --> 03:28:29.960]  They killed him.
[03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:33.984]  But why were they there in the first place?
[03:28:33.984 --> 03:28:37.347]  Alright, we're gonna take some phone calls, I promise.
[03:28:37.347 --> 03:28:38.188]  One after the other.

[03:28:53.114 --> 03:28:56.697]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:31:54.505 --> 03:31:58.470]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.470 --> 03:32:01.755]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.755 --> 03:32:08.023]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:08.023 --> 03:32:10.807]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.528 --> 03:32:15.351]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:15.351 --> 03:32:21.816]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.816 --> 03:32:26.781]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.526 --> 03:32:31.468]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.468 --> 03:32:38.651]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.651 --> 03:32:43.353]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.353 --> 03:32:49.575]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.575 --> 03:32:53.537]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:05.028]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.028 --> 03:33:06.490]  Another world.
[03:33:06.490 --> 03:33:07.511]  Another time.
[03:33:07.511 --> 03:33:09.193]  In the age of wonder.
[03:33:32.056 --> 03:33:36.678]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:36.678 --> 03:33:42.481]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:42.481 --> 03:33:45.302]  All right, Matt Bracken's here with us.
[03:33:45.302 --> 03:33:47.563]  I'm Alex Jones, commandeering this hour.
[03:33:47.563 --> 03:33:48.164]  Matt knows that.
[03:33:48.164 --> 03:33:48.744]  He appreciates it.
[03:33:48.744 --> 03:33:49.404]  We appreciate him.
[03:33:49.404 --> 03:33:50.405]  He's doing a great job.
[03:33:50.405 --> 03:33:52.406]  We've got us two rows of Oath Keepers here with us.
[03:33:52.406 --> 03:33:55.467]  EnemiesForeignDomestic.com, OathKeepers.org.
[03:33:55.467 --> 03:33:56.288]  Matt Bracken's here.
[03:33:57.595 --> 03:34:00.156]  And we have an active shooter in Chicago.
[03:34:00.156 --> 03:34:02.217]  We're getting the details right now.
[03:34:02.217 --> 03:34:07.220]  Aurora Police respond to active shooter report at manufacturing company at Chicago NBC 5.
[03:34:07.220 --> 03:34:09.341]  We'll be covering it as it unfolds.
[03:34:09.341 --> 03:34:11.002]  You guys are having some great discussions during the break.
[03:34:11.002 --> 03:34:11.862]  We got to go to calls.
[03:34:11.862 --> 03:34:13.023]  These are great folks.
[03:34:13.023 --> 03:34:16.124]  You're also making fantastic points.
[03:34:16.124 --> 03:34:19.626]  We're not here dreaming of civil war or martial law or civil unrest.
[03:34:21.071 --> 03:34:22.132]  Europe and the U.S.
[03:34:22.132 --> 03:34:27.115]  is being put into this by the globalists, their own admissions prove it.
[03:34:27.115 --> 03:34:38.763]  And so we have to realize the moment we're in, the globalists are panicking because even in their skewed polls, Trump is gaining support and capitalism is gaining support, Matt Bracken and Stuart.
[03:34:38.763 --> 03:34:42.906]  So what would you call Stuart and then Matt Bracken we're going to call as the historic point we're in right now?
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:47.501]  I think we're in the middle of an insurrection against the Constitution.
[03:34:47.501 --> 03:34:55.484]  I think the left are domestic enemies of the Constitution, they're Marxist enemies of the Constitution, and this is their end game.
[03:34:55.484 --> 03:34:58.725]  But you're not just saying that.
[03:34:58.725 --> 03:35:01.326]  You're a constitutional lawyer, you're a veteran, you're a smart guy.
[03:35:02.866 --> 03:35:08.008]  People who aren't evil look at a thing happening and can't believe it because they judge it by their own morals.
[03:35:08.008 --> 03:35:16.291]  Historically, we have traitor collaborators working with multinationals and the chi-coms in Hollywood to collapse and conquer and vertically integrate the nation.
[03:35:16.291 --> 03:35:17.912]  I mean, that's what it is.
[03:35:17.912 --> 03:35:21.733]  We are under globalist attack with insurrection traitors.
[03:35:21.733 --> 03:35:23.894]  Matt Braggin?
[03:35:23.894 --> 03:35:24.834]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:35:24.834 --> 03:35:25.915]  What Stuart said is correct.
[03:35:27.034 --> 03:35:32.239]  It's time now to blow past the smoke of socialist tequila.
[03:35:32.239 --> 03:35:34.501]  Remember, they lie.
[03:35:34.501 --> 03:35:38.504]  Just like Islamists will say, no, no, we're not trying to bring Sharia.
[03:35:38.504 --> 03:35:39.625]  They lie.
[03:35:39.625 --> 03:35:43.049]  So we have to judge them by their actions and their results.
[03:35:43.049 --> 03:35:45.531]  If a guy just is pretending to be an open borders
[03:35:46.092 --> 03:35:46.613]  Thank you
[03:36:03.387 --> 03:36:03.747]  We're good.
[03:36:23.810 --> 03:36:26.351]  Kenyan shopping malls.
[03:36:26.351 --> 03:36:30.932]  And I sat there and literally had a visceral, not responsive, hatred.
[03:36:30.932 --> 03:36:33.492]  My gut was, this is an enemy.
[03:36:33.492 --> 03:36:34.533]  Why is she even here?
[03:36:34.533 --> 03:36:35.913]  I couldn't help it.
[03:36:35.913 --> 03:36:38.134]  I was, I don't know how to describe it.
[03:36:38.134 --> 03:36:47.856]  It's beyond rage, it's beyond, it's like I'm feeling bad that she's, that I'm, she's literally gloating over dead people at a shopping mall in Africa.
[03:36:48.499 --> 03:36:53.444]  Yeah, sometimes their mask, real quick point, sometimes their mask slips.
[03:36:53.444 --> 03:36:57.288]  And right now, since winning the midterms, they're overconfident.
[03:36:57.288 --> 03:37:09.740]  And this, like the Green New Deal and wide open borders, you know, reception centers for the entire world to come in, their mask is slipping and the American people are going to see it for what it is, I hope.
[03:37:09.740 --> 03:37:09.900]  Yeah.
[03:37:10.680 --> 03:37:16.025]  We're going to phone calls right now, but I mean, we cannot stress how insane this is.
[03:37:16.025 --> 03:37:21.009]  Let me ask you all a 10 second question and we're going to go to calls.
[03:37:21.009 --> 03:37:23.151]  Is the free society turned the corner?
[03:37:23.151 --> 03:37:25.993]  Are we winning or are we just fighting for our lives?
[03:37:25.993 --> 03:37:29.156]  I mean, I think at a gut level, the fact that we're awake now shows we're starting to win.
[03:37:29.156 --> 03:37:32.459]  It doesn't mean we've won the war, but I think we're on the right foot.
[03:37:33.490 --> 03:37:34.250]  We're in the middle of it.
[03:37:34.250 --> 03:37:36.551]  It's an open window that can go either way.
[03:37:36.551 --> 03:37:39.652]  As you pointed out before, this is an open window that can go either way.
[03:37:39.652 --> 03:37:43.234]  We have to push and make sure we don't get complacent or apathetic.
[03:37:43.234 --> 03:37:46.935]  We have to keep pushing on our side.
[03:37:46.935 --> 03:37:48.476]  I think Trump is a reprieve.
[03:37:48.476 --> 03:37:50.037]  I think Trump is a reprieve.
[03:37:50.037 --> 03:37:51.117]  He's not an antidote.
[03:37:51.844 --> 03:37:53.085]  And he's bought us time.
[03:37:53.085 --> 03:37:58.791]  It's sort of like after Czechoslovakia before Poland and leading up to the Second World War.
[03:37:58.791 --> 03:37:59.592]  We're in that period.
[03:37:59.592 --> 03:38:01.094]  We bought some time.
[03:38:01.094 --> 03:38:02.535]  You know, a Dunkirk.
[03:38:02.535 --> 03:38:07.661]  But we're still leading towards a civil war because the Bolsheviks, the Communists, the Socialists, dem sucks.
[03:38:08.323 --> 03:38:11.844]  They would push us straight to the USSR if they had the power.
[03:38:11.844 --> 03:38:13.885]  The reason they can't is the Second Amendment.
[03:38:13.885 --> 03:38:15.286]  Let me ask you about a bloody nose.
[03:38:15.286 --> 03:38:17.386]  We don't want them to see exactly where you're going.
[03:38:17.386 --> 03:38:18.707]  I don't want any violence.
[03:38:18.707 --> 03:38:23.849]  I'm not calling for it, but not a false flag to make them be victims, but a real bloody nose.
[03:38:23.849 --> 03:38:25.829]  I don't think they even have any sense in them.
[03:38:25.829 --> 03:38:31.712]  I don't think they're being dropped out of helicopters into the Atlantic Ocean.
[03:38:31.712 --> 03:38:32.632]  I don't think they're going to wake up.
[03:38:35.037 --> 03:38:47.147]  You know, the way I put it is those who know what it means to zero a rifle should not instigate a civil war with those who do and have.
[03:38:47.147 --> 03:39:00.898]  I mean, they literally are in a green dream utopian fantasy and they're going against people who have studied communist revolution to the nth degree and understand every phase that's coming towards us.
[03:39:01.533 --> 03:39:05.498]  So it's an irresistible force going to meet an immovable object.
[03:39:05.498 --> 03:39:08.181]  It's going to be like a tsunami hitting a seawall.
[03:39:08.181 --> 03:39:08.542]  Exactly.
[03:39:08.542 --> 03:39:09.723]  That's the bottom line.
[03:39:09.723 --> 03:39:11.686]  We have globalists funded.
[03:39:11.686 --> 03:39:14.069]  We're in the middle of a Marxist revolution.
[03:39:14.069 --> 03:39:14.289]  Right.
[03:39:16.992 --> 03:39:19.773]  Silver lining is the walk-away movement.
[03:39:19.773 --> 03:39:27.897]  As you said earlier, increasingly blacks and Hispanics, like when I was at that rally in El Paso, about a quarter of the audience were Hispanic patriots.
[03:39:27.897 --> 03:39:33.160]  And so there are Americans who are waking up and we can't throw them, you know, maybe out with the bathwater.
[03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:36.842]  The dyed-in-the-wool zealot leader can't be
[03:39:37.856 --> 03:39:38.636]  We're good to go.
[03:40:06.963 --> 03:40:09.546]  She wants to force a... Whether they're Islam, gays are killed.
[03:40:09.546 --> 03:40:17.857]  Right, so in the countries where she champions their... she turns a blind eye to their abuse of people's rights, a transgender male would be killed.
[03:40:17.857 --> 03:40:18.638]  Exactly.
[03:40:18.638 --> 03:40:19.740]  And yet here she's trying to...
[03:40:20.891 --> 03:40:21.211]  Go ahead.
[03:40:21.211 --> 03:40:25.676]  Yeah, eventually their cognitive dissonance will cause the pot to boil over.
[03:40:25.676 --> 03:40:28.899]  You know, the identity politics, which is, you know, racial and sexual.
[03:40:28.899 --> 03:40:29.940]  She's a total footloose.
[03:40:29.940 --> 03:40:30.821]  I mean, yeah.
[03:40:30.821 --> 03:40:32.563]  Eventually it explodes.
[03:40:32.563 --> 03:40:37.088]  It can only hold together while they have the glue of political correctness to tamp down any kind of criticism.
[03:40:37.088 --> 03:40:38.990]  And I think you said that, and we're not calling for violence.
[03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:40.712]  I just think it's critical if they kick things off.
[03:40:42.216 --> 03:40:43.817]  Cut the head off the snake.
[03:40:43.817 --> 03:40:47.640]  And I think that's the point, is their leadership is decapitated, they fade away very quickly.
[03:40:47.640 --> 03:40:52.444]  I think the globals are going to find, with us, decapitating leadership, I don't think is going to do anything.
[03:40:52.444 --> 03:40:53.284]  No.
[03:40:53.284 --> 03:41:01.671]  And the president can, right now, suppress the insurrection in California and in all of the sanctuary cities by prosecuting them for violations of federal law.
[03:41:01.671 --> 03:41:05.994]  And that wouldn't be martial law, which is not constitutional, that would be executing the laws of the union.
[03:41:05.994 --> 03:41:08.076]  I agree, but does the establishment understand that
[03:41:09.520 --> 03:41:14.903]  Patriots are high IQ, have an operating system based on the Western Civilization.
[03:41:14.903 --> 03:41:16.824]  You don't cut heads off snakes with us.
[03:41:16.824 --> 03:41:17.164]  No.
[03:41:17.164 --> 03:41:19.446]  In fact, that triggers a response.
[03:41:19.446 --> 03:41:23.788]  But on the left, these are literally zombies who don't have their own operating system.
[03:41:23.788 --> 03:41:23.988]  Yeah.
[03:41:23.988 --> 03:41:27.750]  You get your Private Murphy will step up and take over.
[03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:28.691]  Okay?
[03:41:28.691 --> 03:41:30.031]  So it doesn't make a difference.
[03:41:30.031 --> 03:41:36.155]  And you'll find out that Private Murphy is way more talented than Captain Rupert Poindexter.
[03:41:36.155 --> 03:41:36.915]  Exactly.
[03:41:36.915 --> 03:41:37.115]  Yeah.
[03:41:37.115 --> 03:41:37.856]  Let's take a quick call.
[03:41:40.353 --> 03:41:43.415]  Yep, Audie Murphy comes out of the ground.
[03:41:43.415 --> 03:41:47.038]  Donald in Maryland, you're on the air Donald, go ahead.
[03:41:47.038 --> 03:41:55.744]  Trump taking a knee today to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and making his concession speech.
[03:41:55.744 --> 03:42:02.068]  And Green is the new Red, where they let all the muzzles in to take over the United States.
[03:42:02.068 --> 03:42:06.151]  And people bowing down Trump, he is just block for everybody.
[03:42:08.467 --> 03:42:15.549]  I think what you're saying, Donald, is we're seeing open treason, and I'm surprised Trump isn't being carried on people's shoulders.
[03:42:15.549 --> 03:42:19.050]  You know, I actually call him watermelons a few years back because he's right.
[03:42:19.050 --> 03:42:19.970]  Green is the new red.
[03:42:19.970 --> 03:42:22.350]  The green on the outside, the red on the inside.
[03:42:22.350 --> 03:42:27.672]  It's the new technique, along with identity politics, that's the next way to try to convince people to come to power.
[03:42:27.672 --> 03:42:28.952]  Donald, anything else?
[03:42:28.952 --> 03:42:29.812]  Talk something to me.
[03:42:29.812 --> 03:42:36.454]  How do you feel about Trump taking a knee, making that concession speech, and turning it into silence?
[03:42:37.276 --> 03:42:44.321]  It was a bad deal with Obama that he signed with Iraq and with Canada and Mexico.
[03:42:44.321 --> 03:42:46.222]  The deal he signed today is worse!
[03:43:02.458 --> 03:43:11.460]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:21.523]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:43:21.523 --> 03:43:30.065]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:30.905 --> 03:43:32.246]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.246 --> 03:43:33.407]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.407 --> 03:43:35.388]  It is a total game changer.
[03:43:35.388 --> 03:43:40.411]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.411 --> 03:43:41.932]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[03:43:41.932 --> 03:43:43.413]  It lasts 10 hours.

[03:44:54.355 --> 03:45:02.758]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.758 --> 03:45:04.198]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:04.198 --> 03:45:08.920]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.920 --> 03:45:11.981]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:45:12.461 --> 03:45:14.143]  I still have that energy.
[03:45:14.143 --> 03:45:34.325]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:46:18.835 --> 03:46:21.636]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[03:46:21.636 --> 03:46:28.878]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:46:28.878 --> 03:46:32.840]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.

[03:46:41.822 --> 03:46:43.323]  Hashtag Alex Jones!

[03:46:49.932 --> 03:46:52.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.370 --> 03:47:21.234]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:21.234 --> 03:47:27.618]  All right, four cops have been shot and reportedly are fighting for their lives, along with citizens in Chicago.
[03:47:27.618 --> 03:47:29.560]  They're in Aurora, a suburb.
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:34.523]  We'll be following that on The War Room, coming up 3 o'clock Central with Owen Schroyer and others.
[03:47:34.523 --> 03:47:35.384]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[03:47:35.384 --> 03:47:39.046]  I'm being a bad person, not getting to them, so I'm going to go to them right now.
[03:47:39.046 --> 03:47:40.387]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:47:40.387 --> 03:47:42.388]  George and then Nikki and others.
[03:47:42.388 --> 03:47:43.549]  George in California.
[03:47:43.549 --> 03:47:44.090]  You're on the air.
[03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:44.350]  Go ahead.
[03:47:46.631 --> 03:47:47.632]  How's it going, Alex?
[03:47:47.632 --> 03:47:48.672]  It's good to talk to you again.
[03:47:48.672 --> 03:47:51.333]  Good to talk to you.
[03:47:51.333 --> 03:47:56.896]  Man, it was about time that Trump would call it a national emergency.
[03:47:56.896 --> 03:48:04.579]  Like, I've been talking to you about it most of the time, where we have a problem with the legal, the drugs and everything.
[03:48:04.579 --> 03:48:07.300]  Yeah, this country is in an emergency.
[03:48:08.826 --> 03:48:24.738]  And what I find most incredible is the fact that we also have a homeless problem, but people would rather take care of the immigrants than the people who, say, serve the country and are now homeless, trying to get food and trying to get health care.
[03:48:24.738 --> 03:48:27.720]  You know, that's a great point, and I appreciate your call.
[03:48:27.720 --> 03:48:35.046]  Matt Bracken and, of course, Stuart Rhodes, why is the homeless population, they admit, ballooning, especially in blue cities?
[03:48:35.933 --> 03:48:43.335]  Well, it's just the poverty that has been caused in the cities in particular by the Democratic policies.
[03:48:43.335 --> 03:48:45.316]  And they don't really care about those people.
[03:48:45.316 --> 03:48:47.157]  That's the problem.
[03:48:47.157 --> 03:48:52.419]  They've used them up and gotten what they want out of them, and so now their focus is on new voters.
[03:48:52.419 --> 03:48:53.679]  Period.
[03:48:53.679 --> 03:48:55.019]  And these people don't have families.
[03:48:55.019 --> 03:48:56.820]  Most of the time it's mental illness.
[03:48:56.820 --> 03:48:59.421]  What do you think is happening, Matt?
[03:49:00.973 --> 03:49:10.776]  Well, I think that the Kala Zewaila model is proving to be a resounding success for the demsocks, and they would like to see that repeated in every state.
[03:49:10.776 --> 03:49:18.378]  They don't care if there's needles and feces on the sidewalks, if there's homeless camps, you know, right around the corner from Rodeo Drive.
[03:49:18.378 --> 03:49:22.179]  As long as they're in power, they are happy to rule the ruins.
[03:49:22.179 --> 03:49:27.081]  So, importing masses of foreign illiterates that will vote Democrat for welfare,
[03:49:27.918 --> 03:49:29.599]  That's what we have to expose.
[03:49:29.599 --> 03:49:32.382]  That's the big litmus test going forward.
[03:49:32.382 --> 03:49:37.846]  The people that are for open borders are for replacing Americans with welfare voters.
[03:49:37.846 --> 03:49:38.927]  Period.
[03:49:38.927 --> 03:49:41.729]  And again, we're not helping these people when we bring them here.
[03:49:41.729 --> 03:49:49.936]  It was about a year and a half ago, I don't get to hike a lot, but I was on Barton Creek in a wealthy area of Austin, a few miles from my house.
[03:49:51.585 --> 03:49:55.146]  And I've learned to recognize Central Americans versus, you know, different groups.
[03:49:55.146 --> 03:49:55.966]  And they were Guatemalans.
[03:49:55.966 --> 03:49:57.006]  I asked, are you Guatemalan?
[03:49:57.006 --> 03:49:58.506]  They said, yeah.
[03:49:58.506 --> 03:50:05.588]  There was a Guatemalan family of like a middle-aged man and his wife and four or five kids.
[03:50:05.588 --> 03:50:11.549]  And they had Coke cans with strings on them catching bass out of Barton Creek.
[03:50:11.549 --> 03:50:13.729]  And they had a fire going.
[03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:15.890]  And now I go where I've been going for 25 years.
[03:50:18.027 --> 03:50:27.094]  On the Greenbelt, and there's shantytowns up in the hills, and there's like Guatemalans and stuff, and there's Guatemalans right down the street from here?
[03:50:27.094 --> 03:50:37.321]  I mean, it's like, what is... I mean, I'm not even against these people, I'm not... But how did we like end up with Guatemalan shantytowns, and people eating out of the creek?
[03:50:37.321 --> 03:50:38.742]  I mean, what is going on?
[03:50:38.742 --> 03:50:42.004]  Same way you ended up with Somalia being transplanted to...
[03:50:43.405 --> 03:50:45.586]  Well, they've totally done it.
[03:50:45.586 --> 03:50:46.126]  Right.
[03:50:46.126 --> 03:50:48.207]  So it's the same model, and it's not helping them.
[03:50:48.207 --> 03:51:02.552]  I mean, they've destabilized, the globalists have destabilized entire regions of the world, and then caused dysphoria into the West, and that's meant to swamp the West at a greater rate than can be assimilated, and kill the coalition.
[03:51:02.552 --> 03:51:02.852]  Exactly.
[03:51:02.852 --> 03:51:05.133]  These were, I had to respect the family.
[03:51:05.133 --> 03:51:06.433]  I couldn't even videotape it.
[03:51:06.433 --> 03:51:11.415]  I was so like, they were like, you know, had the little woven hats, and they were like almost in Mayan attire.
[03:51:12.059 --> 03:51:13.981]  You know, it's almost like a Peruvian.
[03:51:13.981 --> 03:51:15.582]  Yeah, I mean... And I was like, what?
[03:51:15.582 --> 03:51:16.643]  I was like, you're Guatemalan?
[03:51:16.643 --> 03:51:18.584]  Yes, and you're a Guatemalan.
[03:51:18.584 --> 03:51:21.787]  Like, you live here in the Barton Creek.
[03:51:21.787 --> 03:51:23.549]  Yeah, and I have compassion for them.
[03:51:23.549 --> 03:51:25.250]  I really do.
[03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:29.253]  But we need to bring people... But, I mean, I'm gonna be searched by the TSA when I fly.
[03:51:29.253 --> 03:51:34.878]  I'm under all the surveillance and there's Guatemalans living in Austin on the side of the creek.
[03:51:34.878 --> 03:51:35.178]  Right.
[03:51:35.178 --> 03:51:36.479]  They're being used as a weapon.
[03:51:36.479 --> 03:51:37.941]  And, you know, that's the problem is that
[03:51:38.780 --> 03:51:45.587]  Even the innocent ones who are coming here just for a better life and actually love this country are being used as a weapon against us as well.
[03:51:45.587 --> 03:51:48.751]  But they're being conditioned to not assimilate along with them.
[03:51:48.751 --> 03:51:49.972]  I mean, it's just Twilight Zone.
[03:51:49.972 --> 03:51:51.393]  And they're like, oh, take your vaccines.
[03:51:51.393 --> 03:51:53.896]  And meanwhile, they bring the illegals in and have the diseases.
[03:51:53.896 --> 03:51:54.497]  It's insane.
[03:51:54.497 --> 03:51:57.039]  George in California, go ahead.
[03:51:57.039 --> 03:51:58.581]  Yeah.
[03:51:58.581 --> 03:52:00.323]  And the other point that I wanted to make is...
[03:52:01.092 --> 03:52:05.214]  There is a good amount of people that bring a lot to the country.
[03:52:05.214 --> 03:52:07.534]  Don't get me wrong, because I'm not going to be a hypocrite.
[03:52:07.534 --> 03:52:09.915]  My parents were illegal immigrants.
[03:52:09.915 --> 03:52:13.077]  But they need to do what my parents did in the Civil War.
[03:52:13.077 --> 03:52:21.180]  Come to the Civil War, learn the language, pay the taxes, and be voters, and actually hear their voice out.
[03:52:21.180 --> 03:52:21.520]  I agree.
[03:52:21.520 --> 03:52:22.060]  Great point, George.
[03:52:22.060 --> 03:52:27.042]  And that's the point is, we don't need the Democrats and the media indoctrinating them into America.
[03:52:27.042 --> 03:52:28.322]  I hate when I get here.
[03:52:28.322 --> 03:52:29.703]  That's why it has to be stopped.
[03:52:30.509 --> 03:52:34.451]  Well, what's happening though is that they're being brought here and they're being taught not to assimilate.
[03:52:34.451 --> 03:52:48.400]  I mean, I think it's, what's his name, Victor David Hanson has a pretty good book about this, about how he grew up in California where the ethos was, you come here and assimilate, you become Americans, like my relatives did, or my descendants or ancestors, I mean.
[03:52:48.400 --> 03:52:58.406]  They came here and they learned a language, my mom wouldn't even teach us Spanish, and everyone served in the military, and you became Americans and you saluted the flag and the national anthem.
[03:52:58.746 --> 03:53:03.611]  Now they're being taught to fly the Mexican flag, or even worse, to fly the communist flag, and they hate this country.
[03:53:03.611 --> 03:53:09.858]  But it's obvious, if you're going somewhere because you think it's better, you become that, and you add to it.
[03:53:09.858 --> 03:53:12.120]  That's how it used to be, but it's not obvious anymore.
[03:53:12.120 --> 03:53:16.845]  They're being told, the columns on these caravans are flying the Honduran flag.
[03:53:18.747 --> 03:53:28.731]  Or the Guatemalan flag, and they're being told by the leftists that, yes, you have a right to be here, as Cortez just said, you have a right to be here because this is actually indigenous people's lands.
[03:53:28.731 --> 03:53:30.931]  That's straight out of the Weather Underground Prairie Fire.
[03:53:30.931 --> 03:53:35.553]  Straight out of victim ideology, liberation ideology.
[03:53:35.553 --> 03:53:45.017]  And that's garbage because there were no Mexicans or anybody else that was pushed out of America after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[03:53:47.432 --> 03:53:49.593]  Yeah, that is a fiction.
[03:53:49.593 --> 03:53:54.916]  The Spanish citizens who lived in the Southwest became Americans.
[03:53:54.916 --> 03:53:59.158]  There's nobody from Mexico or Guatemala coming back to reclaim land.
[03:54:00.051 --> 03:54:05.515]  The Scots and Irish and everybody out of Alabama and Tennessee down there because they couldn't beat the Comanche.
[03:54:05.515 --> 03:54:06.516]  And that's Texas.
[03:54:06.516 --> 03:54:10.439]  And then as soon as we wiped out the Comanche, then they moved in.
[03:54:10.439 --> 03:54:15.083]  They're like, well, now that you've killed the Comanche that were killing everybody, the Comanche were not nice folks.
[03:54:15.083 --> 03:54:16.604]  I got a little bit of a Comanche in me.
[03:54:16.604 --> 03:54:18.125]  I'm not ashamed of it.
[03:54:18.125 --> 03:54:19.126]  I'm not proud of it.
[03:54:19.126 --> 03:54:21.148]  The point is, is that was the real war that went on.
[03:54:21.148 --> 03:54:23.650]  Let's take another call here real quick.
[03:54:23.650 --> 03:54:25.311]  Max in Wisconsin.
[03:54:25.311 --> 03:54:26.051]  Max, you're on the air.
[03:54:26.051 --> 03:54:26.392]  Go ahead.
[03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:30.352]  Hi Stuart, hi Alex, hi Matt.
[03:54:30.352 --> 03:54:33.574]  I'm a huge fan, huge fan, Stuart.
[03:54:33.574 --> 03:54:37.896]  I was wondering, I wanted to give you a little tip for the 2020 election.
[03:54:37.896 --> 03:54:44.180]  I think you guys can be very effective in turning blue areas red.
[03:54:44.180 --> 03:54:53.446]  In urban areas such as Milwaukee, Chicago, there is a huge population of African American and Slavic people.
[03:54:53.905 --> 03:54:59.328]  Who are very into the gun rights and are unaware of a gun grab occurring in front of them.
[03:54:59.328 --> 03:55:04.832]  For us, it's very in front of our face, but for the average TV people, it's not very apparent.
[03:55:04.832 --> 03:55:05.232]  No, I agree.
[03:55:05.232 --> 03:55:08.454]  Pelosi's saying, we'll use an emergency to take your guns.
[03:55:08.454 --> 03:55:10.976]  The House saying, we have the votes to ban all semi-autos.
[03:55:10.976 --> 03:55:13.357]  I think we make guns the big issue, because they are.
[03:55:13.357 --> 03:55:13.937]  Well, certainly.
[03:55:13.937 --> 03:55:15.178]  I mean, it's one of the big issues.
[03:55:15.178 --> 03:55:18.260]  The two biggest issues that got Donald Trump elected... Well, three.
[03:55:18.260 --> 03:55:19.181]  Borders and guns.
[03:55:19.181 --> 03:55:21.182]  Borders, jobs, and guns.
[03:55:21.522 --> 03:55:25.685]  Those are the three things people in this country care most about, and their religious freedom, too.
[03:55:25.685 --> 03:55:27.926]  And again, it's not that we're obsessed with guns.
[03:55:27.926 --> 03:55:29.607]  It's like we get like, I'm a good person.
[03:55:29.607 --> 03:55:30.988]  I'm a free person.
[03:55:30.988 --> 03:55:32.669]  I have a right to have a gun.
[03:55:32.669 --> 03:55:45.077]  You have a right and obligation and duty to defend your family and self-preservation, but also we understand that if we are disarmed, we'll go, look at Venezuela right now, being shot in the streets openly by the secret police.
[03:55:45.077 --> 03:55:46.338]  So we have a duty and obligation.
[03:55:47.296 --> 03:55:52.961]  In France, they're using these exploding projectiles and they're supposed to be fired at people's feet.
[03:55:52.961 --> 03:55:55.263]  They're blowing off hands and eyes with them.
[03:55:55.263 --> 03:55:57.464]  So this is in disarmed France.
[03:55:57.464 --> 03:56:02.829]  I mean, in the United States, the police would never do that because there would be a different kind of return fire.
[03:56:03.169 --> 03:56:04.811]  EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[03:56:04.811 --> 03:56:06.212]  Find his books there.
[03:56:06.212 --> 03:56:07.273]  Great job to everybody.
[03:56:07.273 --> 03:56:08.414]  The war room is about to start.
[03:56:08.414 --> 03:56:09.475]  Stuart Rhodes, you're welcome.
[03:56:09.475 --> 03:56:10.316]  Both of you guys are going there.
[03:56:10.316 --> 03:56:13.879]  If he wants to have you, I'm sure he wants to have you in just a few minutes.
[03:56:13.879 --> 03:56:15.781]  I'm about to start with Owen Schroeder.
[03:56:15.781 --> 03:56:16.381]  I'm out of time.
[03:56:16.381 --> 03:56:17.022]  I apologize.
[03:56:17.022 --> 03:56:24.189]  Lyle, Emory, Brad, James, Frank, Nicky, and Nick, if you call into the war room, I'm sure they'll take your call.
[03:56:24.189 --> 03:56:25.310]  But thank you for holding.
[03:56:25.310 --> 03:56:25.850]  Thank you for calling.
[03:56:25.850 --> 03:56:27.832]  We appreciate you and we thank you for that.
[03:56:27.832 --> 03:56:28.473]  And then lastly,
[03:56:29.656 --> 03:56:37.122]  Big sales in this weekend for our great Nootropic RainForce Plus and our other big special as well on TurboForce.
[03:56:37.122 --> 03:56:42.206]  That's a total body energy pre-workout, energy drink replacement, beyond that.
[03:56:42.206 --> 03:56:45.829]  And our new protein bars that are the highest in protein bars.
[03:56:45.829 --> 03:56:47.090]  Normally $3 a piece, discounted $2.40.
[03:56:47.090 --> 03:56:48.311]  Believe me, these are like a $5, $6 protein bar.
[03:56:55.252 --> 03:56:55.352]  $2.40.
[03:56:55.352 --> 03:57:01.276]  Get them in 12 packs in vanilla, coconut, and of course, chocolate and peanut butter.
[03:57:01.276 --> 03:57:02.517]  And we'll probably demonize that.
[03:57:02.517 --> 03:57:06.519]  He sells snake protein, but Jones sells water filters.
[03:57:06.519 --> 03:57:07.720]  He's a scammer.
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:09.001]  And seeds.
[03:57:09.001 --> 03:57:11.382]  They'll grow a plum tree or an apple tree, but they're bad.
[03:57:11.382 --> 03:57:12.603]  He's a bad person.
[03:57:12.603 --> 03:57:14.765]  We need to be funded, and it's your action.
[03:57:14.765 --> 03:57:16.666]  Instead of buying stuff at the grocery store, buy it here.
[03:57:16.666 --> 03:57:17.987]  It funds our operations.
[03:57:17.987 --> 03:57:23.150]  So get a Don't California My USA shirt at m4store.com today.
[03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:25.051]  All right, Stuart Rhodes, great having you.

[03:58:09.352 --> 03:58:10.693]  We're good to go.
