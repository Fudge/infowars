[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  He's corrupt and they found the laptop you know they call that the laptop from hell
[00:14.480 --> 00:22.120]  that is a laptop that's a laptop from hell let's see what happens with it let's see
[00:22.120 --> 00:29.800]  what happens with it so a giant trove of emails show hunter-biden making deals
[00:29.800 --> 00:35.840]  setting up meetings with his father Joe and using the office of the vice
[00:35.840 --> 00:42.840]  president for a for-profit cash machine that's what it is this guy's a vacuum
[00:42.840 --> 00:49.040]  cleaner he follows his father around and takes millions hundreds of millions and
[00:49.040 --> 00:53.400]  billions of dollars out of these countries I mean that is so dishonest
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.360]  that's so crooked he is no I call him the human vacuum cleaner right you know
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.160]  those things on television he's better than any one of them Joe Biden said he
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.500]  knew nothing but he lied because they have they this I'm telling you this
[01:08.500 --> 01:17.840]  laptop is a disaster is mostly about the bait prep he will not be seen again
[01:17.840 --> 01:22.720]  after today until Thursday night in Nashville at that next
[01:47.840 --> 02:01.720]  and every American heart ladies and gentlemen the magnitude the stakes of
[02:01.720 --> 02:08.960]  what this country the planet faces are so insane that any student of history
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.800]  will tell you that this is one of the greatest moments that we're in in the
[02:13.800 --> 02:17.820]  history of our planet and the forces of evil know that the only problem is the
[02:17.820 --> 02:23.560]  forces of good really don't understand how much trouble we're really in now
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.400]  everywhere Trump goes despite the COVID hysteria and the overblown chicken
[02:28.400 --> 02:35.720]  little behavior he gets between 20 and 50,000 people showing up and I watch the
[02:35.720 --> 02:42.120]  videos all over the country Joe Biden can't get 10 people to official big
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.600]  campaign events in major battleground states but we're told he's way ahead in
[02:46.600 --> 02:50.280]  all the polls just like we were told Hillary Clinton had a 97% chance of
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.200]  winning New York Times internal polling algorithm they have another name for it
[02:56.200 --> 03:04.320]  it's called Bravo Sierra or bull crap horse manure but you see here's the key
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.200]  they are positioning it to try to steal the election to the electronic voting
[03:08.200 --> 03:11.800]  machines just came out in Oregon that the machines can all easily be hacked
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.200]  obviously for the Democrats the 80 million fake ballots out there they're
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.500]  intending to try to steal it straight up and then just have a decisive victory
[03:22.500 --> 03:27.920]  through fraud have the media say that Biden is the victor Trump will be locked
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.040]  down all of us will be locked off any social media any of the modern
[03:33.040 --> 03:36.080]  communication systems with the electronic straight jacket they've
[03:36.080 --> 03:42.760]  already tested now prepared so that if Trump tries to contest fraud they will
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.560]  claim he's a dictator and a bad guy they've already pre scripted all of that
[03:49.560 --> 03:58.600]  if they're unable to get such a tsunami of fraud over the American people they're
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.920]  gonna contest regardless and try to split the country up and it's all
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.080]  financed by the globalist economy of China and this really is the country
[04:07.080 --> 04:14.340]  fighting for its very existence is Trump has said if the United States gets
[04:14.340 --> 04:17.320]  Joe Biden's president who's totally compromised as a Chinese Communist
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.120]  agent on record they are gonna press the attack they've already bought off most
[04:22.120 --> 04:27.760]  the Democrats they have them compromised they will rule this country and the
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.520]  ongoing sell out of our jobs our industry everything will accelerate I
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.080]  mean we're fighting for our lives and they've got all these dumb down leftist
[04:35.080 --> 04:41.040]  and all these dumb down housewives you know who hate men and hate America who
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.400]  believe that they're unhappy because of Christian conservatism they are
[04:45.400 --> 04:48.680]  literally stomping around frothing cheering on China and their own
[04:48.680 --> 04:52.000]  destruction when Xi Jinping would throw them in a slave camp and harvest their
[04:52.000 --> 04:59.400]  organs so fast to make their fat asses spin we're right back stay with us if you
[04:59.400 --> 05:03.640]  pay close attention to what big tech is actually saying and more importantly
[05:03.640 --> 05:08.880]  what they're actually doing when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.560]  that was a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress
[05:13.560 --> 05:18.720]  information because they've also been on record saying coming up on election day
[05:18.720 --> 05:22.240]  and thereafter they're not gonna let anyone but quote authoritative sources
[05:22.240 --> 05:27.320]  that means CNN New York Times what a joke come out and say who the real winner
[05:27.320 --> 05:30.440]  is that way they can contest the election even though Trump's declare
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.040]  winner hold everything up with the ballots then cause a constitutional
[05:34.040 --> 05:38.520]  crisis call for secession and have the UN come in and declare the election for
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.400]  Biden this is what John Podesta and others are on record saying and so when
[05:42.400 --> 05:45.720]  you see them in concert censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop
[05:45.720 --> 05:50.320]  story that is a drill that is a test to get all their systems ready but also
[05:50.320 --> 05:54.560]  to condition the public the big tech works in unison to suppress speech
[05:54.560 --> 06:00.200]  and information this is election meddling 101 this is illegal
[06:06.360 --> 06:14.200]  it's Monday October 19th 2020 we are 14 days out from the election and the
[06:14.200 --> 06:16.800]  civil war
[06:16.800 --> 06:26.000]  info wars tomorrow's news today if Biden wins China will own the United States
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.560]  and I turned it all around and you know that better than anybody in 2019 if you
[06:31.560 --> 06:36.360]  go back ten years everybody projected 2019 the economy of China was going to
[06:36.360 --> 06:40.560]  be bigger than the US except it didn't happen because I got elected and I
[06:40.560 --> 06:45.720]  turned it the opposite way we were picking up much more than them and then
[06:45.720 --> 06:49.240]  I did the no dumping steel and I did tariffs and I did everything on them
[06:49.240 --> 06:55.800]  no no they want sleepy Joe to win and if he does if sleepy Joe wins China will
[06:55.800 --> 07:00.160]  own the United States and when you look at these photographs that are
[07:00.160 --> 07:05.280]  disgusting and horrible the Chinese have every single one of them Chinese have
[07:05.280 --> 07:09.920]  every single one probably ten times more because what the Chinese government
[07:09.920 --> 07:15.160]  has been doing and a country was totally undefended against this is setting
[07:15.160 --> 07:20.120]  Biden up putting him in a position where he's totally compromised they've now
[07:20.120 --> 07:23.800]  they've now given him so much money he's totally compromised they now have
[07:23.800 --> 07:29.600]  pictures of his son doing things that doing things that I can't describe some
[07:29.600 --> 07:36.640]  of which are illegal it's Saturday October 17th the year is 2020 we are now
[07:36.640 --> 07:42.720]  two weeks out from the election and the information I'm about to cover here is
[07:42.720 --> 07:49.040]  bigger than anything we covered it's bigger than anything we covered in the
[07:49.040 --> 07:55.760]  run-up to the 2016 election well I shot that emergency report it's got 1,981,000
[07:55.760 --> 08:01.040]  views at band.video in defiance of Google and big tech that would have
[08:01.040 --> 08:09.000]  silenced you and I and us you've had an extra 7 million views on our videos
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.240]  concerning the election at band.video 7 million people that have been able to
[08:14.240 --> 08:19.000]  see the truth and circumvent the giant media firestorm of un-American
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.440]  disinformation it is Monday October 9th the year is 2020 we are exactly 14 days
[08:25.440 --> 08:30.320]  out from the election and the globalist moving with communist China to break up
[08:30.320 --> 08:34.400]  the United States and bulked eyes us along racial and religious lines for
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.480]  ever but the path of America to its destruction will not be so smooth for
[08:39.480 --> 08:43.600]  the new world order because the sleeping giant has awakened and the fight has
[08:43.600 --> 08:50.560]  just begun and that's not high that's the reality of the epic moment we're all
[08:50.560 --> 08:58.400]  in together when you get excited when you take action when you spread the word
[08:58.400 --> 09:03.840]  when you become Paul Revere it changes the world and the globalist are in fear
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.000]  of you right now in fear of you realizing your real power all right
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.400]  I'm going to open the phones up for the transmission and we have several
[09:14.400 --> 09:19.680]  special guests as well during this epic countdown Dr. Steve Pachett is gonna come
[09:19.680 --> 09:25.000]  on and talk about the hunter-biden China blackmail operation and the real

[09:34.960 --> 09:39.040]  Christian conservative tried to hold a free speech rally in San Francisco was
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.880]  viciously beaten teeth knocked out put into the hospital and the left just

[09:47.920 --> 09:51.360]  as well and then Gerald Salente head of the war room and then with shroyer I am
[09:51.360 --> 10:01.280]  your host Alex Jones now let's go right into it right now the globalists think
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.000]  we're weak they're making their move communist China is their command base
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.040]  where they can carry out any crime they want or they can organize and produce
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.800]  the economic prowess they need to take over the planet that's the CFR and the
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.400]  trilateral Commission of the Bilderberg Groups stated goal two minutes to
[10:20.400 --> 10:25.400]  midnight we get Trump in four years ago and he reverses the economic shutdown
[10:25.400 --> 10:31.160]  and the economic surrender we've been under for 50 years really 40 years or
[10:31.160 --> 10:37.080]  so and overnight things come back they launch hoax after hoax to try to
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.280]  delegitimize the election and the voters and the president everything they're
[10:42.280 --> 10:45.600]  guilty of working with China working with Russia working with Ukraine they
[10:45.600 --> 10:51.080]  project on to POTUS they engage in massive crime they get caught engaged in
[10:51.080 --> 10:54.640]  massive crime in attempted coups they do not get in trouble because everyone is
[10:54.640 --> 10:57.280]  so scared of the Justice Department because they were put in there at the
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.960]  top to be yes men and follow along and so even though the president with stood
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.520]  and the American people with stood outrageous coup attempts and attacks and
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.760]  disinfo and economic warfare and lawsuits and physical attacks it only
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.960]  emboldened the enemy to up the ante and become even more aggressive now with the
[11:16.960 --> 11:23.720]  global COVID exaggeration hoax shut down with the economic warfare shut down
[11:23.720 --> 11:29.560]  with the race war shut down China's been fully open for business for six months
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.400]  Europe is still under martial law the Democrats pledge to put us back under
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.040]  it this is the form of warfare psychological the Pentagon will tell you
[11:38.040 --> 11:44.040]  that in modern wars 90% is psychological no longer physical and the average
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.320]  American is so under mind control a good 30% or so Democrats that they believe
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.040]  Gigi pings a hero they believe America is bad they believe Trump's evil they
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.320]  don't even care about their own interest they think Gigi ping in the new world
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.360]  order is gonna give them a bunch of free goodies and take care of them if they
[12:00.360 --> 12:04.920]  can just help take the country down you see we keep trying to convince
[12:04.920 --> 12:10.160]  Democrats to don't side with China and the globalist and those that rip us off
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.440]  and give us unfair deals and have deindustrialized us by designed to
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.960]  capture us and control us stand up with America stand up for your own common
[12:17.960 --> 12:21.840]  sense stand up and look at these headlines G's choice destroy Trump or
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.120]  save him and weaken America this is who they are these are the globalists that
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.160]  set up the communist Chinese to enslave the Chinese people and now they want to
[12:31.160 --> 12:34.640]  set up a dictatorship here that the globalist control to enslave us fully
[12:34.640 --> 12:42.080]  absolutely hellish and you look at the list of demonic goons like Whitmer and
[12:42.080 --> 12:51.280]  others and and psycho Newsom and the rest of them and they say you want the
[12:51.280 --> 12:57.360]  lockdowns to end vote out front big Mike says it Newsom says it Whitmer says it
[12:57.360 --> 13:01.600]  Cuomo says it because he didn't follow all their rules it's his fault his
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.680]  rallies kept the COVID at all time levels but notice not not not spiked
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.760]  deaths spiked numbers and then if it bumps up a little in death that goes
[13:12.760 --> 13:18.600]  back down they call that a huge spike these are the scams and they just keep
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.920]  pressing and pressing the compliance hoping we get used to it all a
[13:22.920 --> 13:26.480]  permanent martial law telling you when you can stay open when you can be
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.680]  outside when you can do this when you can do that this is economic warfare and
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.600]  I'm gonna get into the laptop and the big revelations of Hunter and not just
[13:35.600 --> 13:39.360]  hookers and not just sex and not just crack and not just math but doing
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.600]  illegal things underage raping them as a form of torture but reportedly beating
[13:44.600 --> 13:49.720]  up little Chinese girls as part of him as the initiation into the Communist
[13:49.720 --> 13:56.920]  Party China so he'd be fully compromised this is what's really happening this is
[13:56.920 --> 14:01.000]  China's war Chinese military beefs up coastal forces as it prepares for
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.520]  possible invasion of Taiwan they are announcing they may invade as another
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.360]  surprise and why not they've got the Democrats they've got our debt they've
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.480]  got Hollywood they got most the cities and states and they can't believe the
[14:15.480 --> 14:18.000]  chai cons the average American won't stand up with themselves and are just
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.560]  total fools but they're not they're worse they hate America and actually want
[14:23.560 --> 14:30.200]  to see it burn it's sick the NBA black players love China worship them the most
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.000]  racist country in the world towards black people millions of Christians and
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.440]  Buddhists and Muslims and death camps the left loves it because they're empty
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.080]  nobodies because LeBron James is as close to Hitler as you're gonna get he
[14:41.080 --> 14:45.640]  knows what he's doing he wants the money so he called America racist that
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.280]  covers his Chinese bosses that now fund most the NBA think about that when you
[14:50.280 --> 14:57.520]  watch your ballers China's economy is almost over COVID oh New York Times
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.760]  NPR oh they're open they did a good job they had good martial law but Republican
[15:03.760 --> 15:07.560]  states didn't have total martial law so you're not allowed to ever reopen
[15:07.560 --> 15:13.000]  French virus curfew produces eerie quiet on streets of Paris they say the
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.880]  martial law never end oh see couldn't deal the yellow vest couldn't deal people
[15:16.880 --> 15:24.760]  wanting the crown out well now he's a dictator and it goes on from their
[15:24.760 --> 15:29.520]  Sweden to start lockdowns as the world's 12th highest COVID-19 death rate
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.240]  totally made up garbage and the lowest rate in Europe they noticed the world so
[15:34.240 --> 15:37.280]  now their socials government's been pressured so they'll lock down since the
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.000]  Swedes never did it they'll go ahead and do a lockdown now it's just so they're
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.160]  good slaves Polish Jim dubs itself a church to bypass virus rules over here
[15:45.160 --> 15:47.520]  they ban you have a church because government just runs over the first
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.600]  amendment we've got so much more on the mask front wait we have the top news on
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.880]  that coming up and there's so much more only you though can override the
[15:55.880 --> 16:01.320]  censor share the live feed the future isn't coming it's here and in the
[16:01.320 --> 16:07.120]  future keeping your humanity saving your soul your integrity your very essence
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.240]  is going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset
[16:12.240 --> 16:17.040]  the world being built by the technocrats the trap they've now sprung
[16:17.040 --> 16:23.000]  is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking
[16:23.000 --> 16:30.040]  us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization human life
[16:30.040 --> 16:35.640]  will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[16:35.640 --> 16:41.640]  2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things
[16:41.640 --> 16:46.520]  like this to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own
[16:46.520 --> 16:50.680]  decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must study their own
[16:50.680 --> 16:55.440]  writings you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it you're all
[16:55.440 --> 16:59.800]  being incrementally destroyed as I take this announcement we were exactly 14
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.520]  days out from the election and the globalist controlled Democrats know
[17:04.520 --> 17:08.240]  that America has woken up to them and turned against them the whole planet is
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.760]  a huge populist realignment and so they've openly said we need to go to pure
[17:12.760 --> 17:17.600]  authoritarianism not just censorship but physically attacking and arresting
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.520]  anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda and they're on record saying that once
[17:22.520 --> 17:26.960]  they remove Trump they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.840]  to prosecute us and put us all in prison this is what all the old Clinton
[17:31.840 --> 17:35.560]  nieces are saying it's what the Obama bots are saying it's what Keith
[17:35.560 --> 17:40.840]  Overman saying it's what Nancy Pelosi saying this is their stated criminal
[17:40.840 --> 17:45.800]  authoritarian intent and they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and
[17:45.800 --> 17:49.560]  forced inoculations Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines

[18:04.960 --> 18:23.640]  Trump knows he's going to win the election winning isn't everything
[18:23.640 --> 18:35.040]  this is Stalin said that matter to folks to counsel us the threat is real waging
[18:35.040 --> 18:41.480]  war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[18:41.480 --> 18:43.960]  info war
[18:43.960 --> 18:49.960]  here we are with the new world order the tricons the global master bankers the
[18:49.960 --> 18:55.680]  genetic engineers big tech all the left devil worshipers worldwide radical
[18:55.680 --> 19:02.240]  Islam aligned with them with their great general Satan in command fusing
[19:02.240 --> 19:06.240]  together through a world-fascist system all these disparate groups into a giant
[19:06.240 --> 19:11.520]  battle acts try to destroy what's left of Christendom only our slumber empowers
[19:11.520 --> 19:19.200]  the devil we must awaken and become born again now let me just tell you what's
[19:19.200 --> 19:22.720]  coming up for the rest of the show I keep I plowed into the coven news the
[19:22.720 --> 19:25.520]  only scratch the surface I'll do that next segment I'll hit this laptop news
[19:25.520 --> 19:31.640]  which is a giant October surprise because it's what we already knew just like
[19:31.640 --> 19:36.120]  his father goes on TV and says yeah they were gonna you investigate me for
[19:36.120 --> 19:39.520]  barisma so I said fire the prosecutor or you don't get a billion bucks and they
[19:39.520 --> 19:45.600]  fired him that day son of a bitch I was just reading about a rapper that made
[19:45.600 --> 19:51.480]  millions of dollars off of rap songs bragging about crimes he committed and
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.360]  the cops went and checked it and that were true crimes he committed so now
[19:55.360 --> 20:01.440]  he's gone to prison I saw that in the news last night I mean this is what
[20:01.440 --> 20:10.000]  criminals do ladies and gentlemen it was an article I guess last night about a
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.360]  rapper that you guys could type it in I had here in the stack but he ripped off
[20:14.360 --> 20:18.560]  the federal government for 1.2 million dollars in just one scam and then did a
[20:18.560 --> 20:23.520]  rap video about how he did it and again people normal people go why would you
[20:23.520 --> 20:26.360]  commit a crime and brag about it because you're not a criminal you don't
[20:26.360 --> 20:36.080]  understand that they get off on doing the bad so why would Hunter Biden go
[20:36.080 --> 20:42.640]  around with a laptop with 25,000 photos and videos of him smoking crack him
[20:42.640 --> 20:50.840]  smoking meth why would he tweet photos of all his teeth falling out why would he
[20:50.840 --> 20:56.760]  do all it why would he send emails around going hey yes we'll follow your
[20:56.760 --> 21:00.240]  orders to end the criminal investigations into your company I want an
[21:00.240 --> 21:06.200]  extra 30 million tells his family hey I've got you these cuss jobs but don't
[21:06.200 --> 21:10.920]  worry you don't have to kick back 50% to me they don't deny it's real in fact
[21:10.920 --> 21:14.160]  his lawyer it comes out has been talking to the shop and they released the
[21:14.160 --> 21:18.040]  emails trying to get the laptop back but it was too late he'd already gone to the
[21:18.040 --> 21:27.160]  FBI and then the FBI did nothing and so the rest is history but think about the
[21:27.160 --> 21:33.840]  new span and you knew this would happen when this broke last Thursday they knew
[21:33.840 --> 21:39.720]  about this laptop a year ago the FBI got it first they said seven months ago now
[21:39.720 --> 21:44.560]  turns out 11 months ago remember the FBI put out a story oh the Russians are
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.920]  trying to get the biden's laptops and computers they they knew that they just
[21:49.920 --> 21:53.480]  gotten this from the computer shop they knew that the republicans are going to
[21:53.480 --> 21:59.600]  be made aware of it so they planted that story parallel constructed that it was
[21:59.600 --> 22:07.000]  Russians when there's no evidence of that think about how these people operate
[22:07.920 --> 22:12.880]  and it changes the subject to who cares if the tooth fairy got it who cares if
[22:12.880 --> 22:18.400]  the Japanese got it you know the Chinese have got it it's blackmail so the
[22:18.400 --> 22:22.200]  only way to stop the blackmail and the takeover of your country is to expose
[22:22.200 --> 22:27.680]  it oh no but the FBI besides to cover it up is at the top they work with the
[22:27.680 --> 22:31.280]  globalists that are working with China who want a controlled president in there
[22:31.280 --> 22:35.560]  that they've got by the short hairs and that's who biden is is the perfect
[22:35.560 --> 22:40.720]  puppet that can hardly talk and then another puppet Kamala Harris right there
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.840]  and so now they're doing it here's the headline hunter biden's laptop is not
[22:44.840 --> 22:50.520]  some russian disinformation campaign d&i ratcliffe slams shift here's another
[22:50.520 --> 22:54.960]  one the emails are russian they've already got clapper and Brennan running
[22:54.960 --> 22:58.480]  around who just tried to sell the country out and oh another zero-hedge
[22:58.480 --> 23:01.960]  article does this explain why facebook was so quick to suppress hunter biden's
[23:01.960 --> 23:07.300]  revelations they all formally work for biden the top facebook people the top
[23:07.300 --> 23:14.520]  twitter people they all work for the dnc but you see the republicans didn't do
[23:14.520 --> 23:18.240]  anything when everybody else got censored so now it's the new york post now
[23:18.240 --> 23:26.160]  it's members of congress now it's matt gates now it's everybody because why
[23:26.160 --> 23:30.440]  not we keep rolling over here's the director of national intelligence who
[23:30.440 --> 23:34.300]  is a good guy ratcliffe laying this out but notice we don't get to see what
[23:34.300 --> 23:37.640]  is in it we don't talk about what's in it that's on the news we just are told
[23:37.640 --> 23:41.920]  it's the russians what's this get out of jail free card that hunter biden can
[23:41.920 --> 23:46.320]  reportedly rape ten-year-old girls beat them torture them is what the witnesses
[23:46.320 --> 23:51.400]  say who first broke all this and they don't even deny it they just say well
[23:51.400 --> 23:55.800]  it's the russians so hunter biden could what blow up a sports stadium with a
[23:55.800 --> 24:00.520]  hydrogen bomb because you know and then the russians videotaped it would be
[24:00.520 --> 24:05.160]  their fault these are some magical creatures these russians because they
[24:05.160 --> 24:08.520]  get you out of all the trouble you're in for the incredible crimes it's just
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.240]  all you don't get to see that it's the russians you know maybe you're ten years
[24:13.240 --> 24:16.000]  old you open bedroom door your mom and dad are having sex they go you didn't
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.760]  see anything it's the russians or maybe your wife comes home and you're drunk
[24:20.760 --> 24:24.200]  with a bottle of jack Daniels you go they didn't I didn't drink it the russians
[24:24.200 --> 24:31.560]  did or maybe your wife catches you out of the movie with your girlfriend you oh
[24:31.560 --> 24:34.880]  no honey this isn't my girlfriend you caught us with our arms range other
[24:34.880 --> 24:41.360]  it's the russians put that in your head here's Ratcliffe fake is this russian
[24:41.360 --> 24:47.720]  disinformation director so Maria it's funny that some of the people that
[24:47.720 --> 24:52.160]  complain the most about intelligence being politicized are the ones
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.320]  politicizing intelligence and unfortunately in this case it is
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.600]  Adam Schiff the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who as you
[25:00.600 --> 25:04.880]  pointed out on Friday said that the intelligence community believes that
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.160]  Hunter Biden's laptop and the emails on it are part of some russian disinformation
[25:10.160 --> 25:13.840]  campaign let me be clear the intelligence community doesn't believe that
[25:13.840 --> 25:17.900]  because there's no intelligence that supports that and we have shared no
[25:17.900 --> 25:21.640]  intelligence with chairman Schiff or any other member of Congress that hunter
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.160]  Biden's laptop is part of some russian disinformation campaign it's simply not
[25:26.160 --> 25:31.400]  true and this is exactly what I said I would stop when I became the director of
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.680]  national intelligence and that's people using the intelligence community to
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.040]  leverage some political narrative and in this case apparently chairman Schiff
[25:40.040 --> 25:44.680]  wants anything against his preferred political candidate to be deemed as not
[25:44.680 --> 25:47.480]  reading I want to explain something to the listeners here because listeners
[25:47.480 --> 25:50.600]  always call in and say oh you have incredible sources oh you're this and
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.000]  that no I'm a regular guy just like you that got pissed off started an
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.080]  organization that you believed in we built this you built this this is our
[25:58.080 --> 26:04.520]  thing just like a guy at a max job he's the owner that's the form you sign when
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.080]  I sign forms you don't come back and pay for this we get to keep it after three
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.480]  to six months his was three months he calls up dozens of times come get your
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.840]  laptop he goes hunter Biden like that's vice president son he goes and looks on
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.280]  at his right to do it before he resells it and it's all this child porn and
[26:21.280 --> 26:27.760]  torture porn he's like what the hell so he calls the FBI they do nothing after
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.560]  almost a year he gets scared starts calling Biden finally Biden's lawyer
[26:32.560 --> 26:36.040]  starts emailing him saying yeah we want that because you wanted it's too late
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.680]  what the hell did you get me this for I'm scared his normal people aren't like
[26:41.680 --> 26:44.560]  that they don't want to be in possession of stuff like this but that's who the
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.000]  left is it's what they traffic in but it's regular little people like that
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.080]  laptop discover at that max shop that's the power
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.200]  vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock it's being sold out

[28:25.240 --> 28:31.400]  our great crew with documentary films and ten hours of live radio and TV a day

[30:02.400 --> 30:20.600]  14 days ladies and gentlemen until all the craziness you've already seen it's
[30:20.600 --> 30:27.720]  turned up from 10 to 11 as they say in spinal tap welcome to the October 19
[30:27.720 --> 30:31.560]  Monday transmission I am your host Alex Jones alright I'm gonna give the
[30:31.560 --> 30:35.840]  number out here in a moment I'll start taking some calls next segment I've got
[30:35.840 --> 30:40.440]  huge covered news it's absolutely got to be hit so far with some new big
[30:40.440 --> 30:45.480]  developments next segment but right now this segment's all about me which I
[30:45.480 --> 30:50.120]  don't do on purpose it just comes up all over the news and it ties into
[30:50.120 --> 30:52.800]  everything we're talking about and so we're gonna hit it because it's also
[30:52.800 --> 30:56.280]  about you what happens to you happens to me what happens to me happens to you
[30:56.280 --> 31:03.320]  this is all crazy remember this New York Post headline August 9th 2018 it was
[31:03.320 --> 31:09.080]  indicative and it was a good case example of what was going on at the time
[31:09.080 --> 31:13.480]  why the Alex Jones band is no reason to break up big tech and they go on to say
[31:13.480 --> 31:17.240]  it's a great thing their accounts are all still shut down across the internet
[31:17.240 --> 31:27.520]  right now same New York Post that Thomas Jefferson started there's a
[31:27.520 --> 31:33.440]  headline Twitter still refused to unlock New York Post account and even though
[31:33.440 --> 31:36.560]  Jack Dorsey apologized he said he did the right thing he just said it could
[31:36.560 --> 31:41.040]  have been done better nice double-think talk and we love being gaslit so why
[31:41.040 --> 31:46.920]  not so they've got Senate judiciary votes to subpoena Facebook CEO they won't
[31:46.920 --> 31:51.000]  care they'll steal the election by then declare Trump's the loser and put Biden
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.760]  in because you guys are a bunch of amateurs man you let those big tech
[31:56.760 --> 31:59.080]  guys lie to your face while they're working with comments China and others
[31:59.080 --> 32:04.160]  literally blackmail most the government they need to blackmail you because
[32:04.160 --> 32:09.880]  you're a bunch of stuff suit lawyers and think you know everything you don't you
[32:09.880 --> 32:13.480]  got your asses handed to you and Brad Parscale's thought he could make Trump
[32:13.480 --> 32:17.280]  win again and he blew all the money and screwed up I've got the inside baseball
[32:17.280 --> 32:22.840]  we're in a lot of trouble because people won't recognize how much trouble we're
[32:22.840 --> 32:26.640]  in and get out of it
[32:26.800 --> 32:31.800]  Twitter removes mass guidelines from White House COVID-19 advisor medical
[32:31.800 --> 32:35.800]  prestigious doctors come out with statistics that mass don't protect you
[32:35.800 --> 32:39.400]  and actually cause more harm and Twitter says that's not what the UN says
[32:39.400 --> 32:44.760]  you're not allowed to you'll wake up in a total tyranny this Facebook suspends
[32:44.760 --> 32:50.080]  user Jamie almonds account after shows a huge rally of black Americans for Trump
[32:50.080 --> 32:57.280]  in DC but that gets banned because it's hateful this is the election meddling
[32:57.280 --> 33:02.720]  and Biden's transition team basically runs Facebook and Twitter that's even
[33:02.720 --> 33:09.080]  Fox News oh but remember the old days Alex Jones in full-war site accuses big
[33:09.080 --> 33:14.440]  tech of censorship remember oh that was in 2018 oh Jones claims there's a thing
[33:14.440 --> 33:17.680]  called shadow banning he claims I remember like New York Times articles he
[33:17.680 --> 33:25.120]  claims it's called the platforming we had the damn documents in 2017 the plan
[33:25.120 --> 33:34.520]  to the platform everyone a digital gulag New York Times free speech
[33:34.520 --> 33:39.680]  scholars Alex Jones you're not protected New York Times the press aren't
[33:39.680 --> 33:45.960]  watchdogs for free speech they're attack dogs they're executioners now why did I
[33:45.960 --> 33:48.600]  raise all this because there's a bunch of tweets I want to go over and tie it
[33:48.600 --> 33:56.360]  into the war on free speech but oh media matters George Soros's group this is
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.240]  didn't age well this is from just two weeks ago conspiracy theorists Alex
[34:00.240 --> 34:03.920]  Jones alleged kidnapping plot against mission governor Whitmer a false flag
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.840]  by the deep state set up by FBI informants I predicted that it was run by
[34:08.840 --> 34:14.280]  FBI informants I said probably two of the top people probably two out of the

[37:26.640 --> 37:31.760]  all for your support so here's the headlines update suspect say ring
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.000]  leader in plot to kidnap wretched governor Whitmer was an alleged FBI
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.480]  informant well that was last week now it comes out in court that they are FBI
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.560]  informants mainstream news in Detroit is reporting defense says governor
[37:44.560 --> 37:49.280]  Whitmer kidnap plot was just big talk between crackpots being wound up by the
[37:49.280 --> 37:53.680]  FBI yep to make her look like a victim let's play a few minutes of media
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.200]  matters a week and a half ago saying that I was crazy predicting this here it
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.560]  is criminal complaint outlines Michigan militia groups plot to kidnap governor
[38:02.560 --> 38:07.360]  Whitmer and what other false flags are we going to see now because this is
[38:07.360 --> 38:11.880]  definitely a probably a provocateur action but what do you do what if the
[38:11.880 --> 38:13.960]  governor said you can never leave your house again you gotta starve to death
[38:13.960 --> 38:17.880]  lay down a die I guess because the power to shut things down is the power to
[38:17.880 --> 38:20.680]  bankrupt it's a power to kill what about all the folks committed suicide because
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.120]  her but all the folks that again died because she said COVID patients there
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.760]  well she's the governor she's above the law she's God well we knew it was
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.360]  coming I predicted over and over again the last few months it's not a hard
[38:34.360 --> 38:39.680]  prediction that they engage in a provocateur setup or a false flag against
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.360]  Democrat Party officials to make them look like victims when they launch
[38:44.360 --> 38:50.920]  incredible tyranny deep-stator governor Whitmer who sent all those patients
[38:50.920 --> 38:54.460]  with COVID into nursing homes so she get a higher death rate that monster the
[38:54.460 --> 39:01.680]  woman that has that crazy look of psycho smile she supposedly I was the victim or
[39:01.680 --> 39:08.640]  the potential victim of a plot to kidnap her oh that's right six people
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.580]  charged with a plot to kidnap Michigan governor Whitmer the FBI quoted one of
[39:13.580 --> 39:17.320]  the accusers saying Whitmer has no checks and balances at all she has
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.200]  uncontrolled power right now all things must come to an end funny the
[39:22.200 --> 39:26.680]  Supreme Court of the state just ruled that she taken all powers legislative
[39:26.680 --> 39:30.840]  executive judicial under herself and had become a dictator that the state was
[39:30.840 --> 39:37.840]  under a form of martial law that was the ruling on Monday and it's gotten
[39:37.840 --> 39:42.840]  almost no attention but now the same FBI leadership still run by the deep state
[39:42.840 --> 39:45.760]  this is the number one threat is white supremacist the same FBI that's been
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.880]  caught creating militia groups winding them up setting them up we're gonna come

[41:54.640 --> 41:59.600]  in fiction super villains are known as super villains because they have
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.960]  gigantic huge global plants that are incredibly well thought out and
[42:04.960 --> 42:10.120]  incredibly complex and about it told you a year ago back in october 2019 that a
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.000]  powerful billionaire who controls the u.m. would roll out a global hysteria and
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.040]  a lot down the planet star billions of people and would be pushing a forced
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.280]  inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.480]  would say we're all gonna work from home now and that this was good to lower the
[42:27.480 --> 42:31.440]  carbon footprint and the human population you tell me that's crazy you
[42:31.440 --> 42:35.160]  tell me that's a dystopia you tell me that's some type of science fiction
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.880]  comic book but in reality it really did happen his name is bill gates and he's
[42:39.880 --> 42:45.200]  the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more
[42:45.200 --> 42:49.880]  than 60 years ago and we're living in this world bill gates is built until we
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.680]  start saying no we are bill gates his property it's time to expose bill gates
[42:54.680 --> 43:00.120]  coven rollout has been extremely well planned very well thought out and it's
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.120]  being incrementally orchestrated first it's 15 days to keep the hospitals
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.800]  empty that's all I that it's two months and it's six months and it's a year now
[43:07.800 --> 43:12.520]  bill gates has 10 years and people are not saying I like my mask I like my face
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.440]  diaper I like might be key and so getting into the fear getting into the
[43:17.440 --> 43:22.480]  hysteria getting into all these exaggerated death numbers this is our
[43:22.480 --> 43:29.960]  new neurotic control freak society overseen by robots overseen by AI and all
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.920]  of it is designed to make humans non-essential that's why out of the
[43:34.920 --> 43:40.640]  gates they tell us you are non-essential you are non-essential your
[43:40.640 --> 43:46.800]  company your restaurant your job your profession is not essential this is so
[43:46.800 --> 43:52.120]  incredibly authoritarian premeditated and bill gates sits on top of it come on
[43:52.120 --> 44:01.960]  folks let's reject this you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:07.640 --> 44:12.040]  welcome back I am your host Alex Jones now the reason I'm spending time on
[44:12.040 --> 44:16.080]  Governor Whitmer and how I actually predicted but the leftist arm of the FBI
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.640]  did having a group of eight people two of them being FBI informants that were
[44:21.640 --> 44:25.160]  actually the leaders who would actually have the discussions and get people to
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.680]  agree with them it's a repeat we've seen over and over again how they infiltrate
[44:29.680 --> 44:33.560]  militias how they set up groups we knew right away the guys were Antifa they
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.000]  were anarchists they were leftists they hated Trump and it turned out those were
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.520]  the FBI informants that's all confirmed now let's see it's the same thing with
[44:42.520 --> 44:47.680]  covid just like the FBI formula of setting somebody up as a formula
[44:47.680 --> 44:52.720]  they don't let people freelance this they follow a playbook it's just like now
[44:52.720 --> 44:56.840]  oh the hospitals are full again oh you got a new lockdown is needed because the
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.440]  hospitals are overwhelmed and they'll show a PR team in hazmat suits going
[45:01.440 --> 45:04.440]  in and out of the building which they now admit they did fake video shoots all
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.320]  over the US now they're running new ones about the lockdown in the red states
[45:09.320 --> 45:14.960]  it's all theater that's what the left has is magician scams and the winners
[45:14.960 --> 45:17.640]  coming so there'll be more flu deaths more cold deaths they don't take it
[45:17.640 --> 45:21.800]  vitamin D or vitamin C or zinc no they're gonna count all those deaths and
[45:21.800 --> 45:25.720]  they and they've got exponential more testing and most of its false positive
[45:25.720 --> 45:31.640]  so again oh the numbers are way up you try to talk to somebody though the
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.960]  average particularly young women I'm sorry undereducated folks poor people they
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.480]  just they like a binky they they like to believe this is something special for
[45:41.480 --> 45:46.000]  them and they're part of something it's quite their followers but a lot of men
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.080]  go along with it as well it's very very sad but the demographics are there the
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.880]  media praises women oh women you're good you're wearing your face diaper when the
[45:54.880 --> 45:58.600]  force inoculations come you know to buy and sell the women are gonna roll their
[45:58.600 --> 46:02.400]  kids sleeves up and not even think why their kid has lupus or why their kid
[46:02.400 --> 46:06.960]  gets diabetes or why it's all in the literature but see they'll never admit
[46:06.960 --> 46:11.040]  they did something wrong part of being a follower is you never step up to the
[46:11.040 --> 46:15.880]  plate and admit you were con that's the religion of slaves is never admitting
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.640]  how you got scammed but but going along with it being a chump
[46:23.120 --> 46:29.720]  yeah face mask on babies it's it's all just total absolute cult rainwashing
[46:29.720 --> 46:33.880]  that they're evil that the babies are bad that they can give you something that
[46:33.880 --> 46:38.120]  all humans are dirty that we can't be trusted that AI is gonna monitor us
[46:38.120 --> 46:42.640]  rock concerts with the flaming lips everybody in bubbles cuz no one can be
[46:42.640 --> 46:48.520]  trusted total clown world but that's what cults do they have to get you to go
[46:48.520 --> 46:51.800]  against your own interest so they get you to do it and tell you you're cool
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.640]  Napoleon invented metals for the military he found that they gave them
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.160]  little metals and awards they throw themselves on to bayonets
[47:03.320 --> 47:09.000]  well now you know you're at SJW so let's finish up what happened with Whitmer
[47:09.000 --> 47:17.240]  here it is just from the spot we had it's fine guys remember we were playing the
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.760]  media matters go ahead yeah militia it was not planning a takeover years ago it
[47:21.760 --> 47:25.360]  was all a setup the FBI informant said well what if the UN invades and is
[47:25.360 --> 47:29.000]  arresting everyone and putting us in camps well we'll have to fight then and
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.440]  take the local government back what if the member of the Hattar militia the
[47:34.440 --> 47:37.640]  recordings were released they're driving to the Knob Creek machine gun
[47:37.640 --> 47:43.000]  shootout and they're asking them the FBI informant well what do we do if the UN
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.840]  takes over and put everybody in prison camps where we'll have to fight and take
[47:46.840 --> 47:52.000]  back the local government for America boom indicted because there's a UN
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  takeover happening front page the New York Times the UN needs to occupy
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.960]  America and so the number one sin is talking about you're not gonna put up
[48:01.960 --> 48:05.000]  with it and again militias are in the Constitution I think they're good
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  especially in Michigan and other areas they're always getting infiltrated by
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.720]  the feds that tend to lead them to set people up what are you gonna do when
[48:14.720 --> 48:17.680]  they come to take the guns well what are you gonna do when anti was killing
[48:17.680 --> 48:22.720]  people door-to-door well I guess nothing but I guess you're not a man or somebody
[48:22.720 --> 48:27.760]  says something like I need some more ammo oh you plan to kill some people no I
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.480]  just need some more ammo everything breaking down oh you're scared you're
[48:31.480 --> 48:38.560]  scared to stand up well no I'm willing to kidnap the governor and then they
[48:38.560 --> 48:42.080]  got you they could be the headline and oh my gosh see the FBI is right it's white
[48:42.080 --> 48:45.480]  supremacist Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacy though he's not and then
[48:45.480 --> 48:51.080]  these guys that goes on and on it has echoes of Ruby Ridge another setup where
[48:51.080 --> 48:55.080]  they told him you're gonna sell guns for us illegally and you know you're gonna
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.320]  set up these local groups we're gonna put you in prison you saw that in it so
[49:00.320 --> 49:06.240]  they're trying the exact same playbook yet again and we've got the criminal
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.360]  complaint here that's pretty that actual complaint up thank you it's links right
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.600]  here criminal complaint outlines Michigan militia groups plot to kidnap
[49:15.600 --> 49:22.120]  governor Whitmer and what other false flags are we going to see now because
[49:22.120 --> 49:26.720]  this is definitely a probably a provocateur action but he what do you
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.720]  do what if the governor said you can never leave your house again you gotta
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.800]  starve to death lay down and die I guess because the power to shut things down is
[49:32.800 --> 49:35.400]  the power to bankrupt it's the power to kill what about all the folks committed
[49:35.400 --> 49:38.920]  suicides are what about all the folks that again died because she said COVID
[49:38.920 --> 49:46.080]  patients there well she's the governor she's above the law she's God it's all
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.680]  just a bunch of lawyers in the FBI who just want to go have news events and
[49:50.680 --> 49:56.600]  stunts of course this announcement to overshadow did we ever follow did we
[49:56.600 --> 50:01.760]  ever cover the 11 a.m. national security press conference on all the spine oh no
[50:01.760 --> 50:06.740]  sorry we didn't care about that now we didn't care about the attempt to
[50:06.740 --> 50:13.080]  overthrow the election of the president and so now here we are so they put out
[50:13.080 --> 50:17.400]  the most true stuff I say to act like it's dirty and then to have the media
[50:17.400 --> 50:22.920]  say it's unacceptable to say that the FBI probably led this plot to kidnap her
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.200]  to make her look like a victim when she was in trouble but of course that's all
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.120]  true and that happened I'm proven right so that doesn't age too well for media
[50:31.120 --> 50:36.960]  matters and that brings us to this point remember this article in the New York
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.700]  Post or a bunch of them why the Alex Jones ban is no reason to break up big
[50:40.700 --> 50:48.920]  tech and now that very group all the New York Post writers and their account is
[50:48.920 --> 50:54.920]  locked up for punishment for what they've done and now when the head White
[50:54.920 --> 51:00.160]  House scientist says mass don't protect you he gets banned as well and when a
[51:00.160 --> 51:04.960]  group of black Americans march for Trump in DC they get banned as well this is
[51:04.960 --> 51:09.000]  total Soviet level control and Congress does nothing against this incredible
[51:09.000 --> 51:16.240]  racketeering but oh maybe they'll have a hearing and that's why they're so
[51:16.240 --> 51:18.960]  arrogant that's why they're so out of control me look at these old articles
[51:18.960 --> 51:22.480]  out of the New York Times free speech college say Alan Jones is not protected
[51:22.480 --> 51:27.720]  let's get rid of the First Amendment but let's look at what the public saying
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.800]  two years later here's just a small smattering
[51:32.800 --> 51:39.160]  mark dice I still can't post and link any Alex Jones videos on band on video
[51:39.160 --> 51:44.360]  site you're fully blocking them Jack or did you just mean your unblocking links
[51:44.360 --> 51:48.520]  to the New York Post commie scum because they had a Twitter said oh it's wrong to
[51:48.520 --> 51:51.800]  block any URLs we should you know because that's that's controlling the
[51:51.800 --> 51:55.440]  internet we're gonna stop that but of course he doesn't play you got to share
[51:55.440 --> 52:03.000]  2020ElectionCenter.com which they haven't blocked yet another one Anne O'Malley
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.720]  at legendary energy New York Post in 2008 if I started a conservative Facebook
[52:09.720 --> 52:18.440]  eyed man Alex Jones too this is John at ELIT MIK Alex Jones said within the
[52:18.440 --> 52:23.160]  past week that all conservatives would be censored hardcore in the weeks leading
[52:23.160 --> 52:26.680]  up to the election especially after the election they've got you all in a
[52:26.680 --> 52:31.960]  stranglehold now because they said they were gonna ratchet it down and then
[52:31.960 --> 52:35.120]  totally not let anybody contest it when they contest it and take over they mean
[52:35.120 --> 52:41.640]  they're telling you and our supposed champions Josh Howley and them basically
[52:41.640 --> 52:48.800]  are like fighting a tank with a slingshot at first they came for Alex Jones I
[52:48.800 --> 52:53.800]  said nothing because I wasn't Alex Jones Alexander Rodgers
[52:53.920 --> 53:02.480]  Caitlyn Johnstone I have no idea what Alex Jones is even up to anymore I used
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.360]  to see his face all the time now routinely forget he exists that's how
[53:06.360 --> 53:09.600]  powerfully Silicon Valley mega corporations are they can completely
[53:09.600 --> 53:15.600]  disappear anyone for public view this power can't be left unchecked again the
[53:15.600 --> 53:18.640]  average person if they don't see your Twitter feed or Facebook or YouTube they
[53:18.640 --> 53:22.520]  think you're gone they don't even remember URLs or other sites think of
[53:22.520 --> 53:26.560]  that monopoly over the mind tell folks Alex Jones is still on the air it's
[53:26.560 --> 53:29.360]  gonna be everybody soon taking off these platforms people better start
[53:29.360 --> 53:37.880]  promoting their URLs you know we built band video you know we built all these
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.920]  systems to fight for this time when we knew everyone will be censored and then
[53:41.920 --> 53:45.240]  we'd be the last person standing we told you that member and here we are
[53:45.240 --> 53:48.840]  because we know the enemy plan they're coming for everything a full overthrow
[53:48.840 --> 53:55.280]  full collapse to bring it to your knees I would offer a heartfelt F you to those
[53:55.280 --> 54:00.200]  who are complaining now but hand waved me when I said they should stand up for

[54:44.240 --> 54:49.440]  really important and quite frankly bad news for you we've confirmed from high
[54:49.440 --> 54:52.840]  level sources our own research that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election
[54:52.840 --> 54:56.280]  and they're gonna really try to do it they're that crazy they intend to not
[54:56.280 --> 55:00.240]  just shut down info wars but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested here's the
[55:00.240 --> 55:03.640]  really bad news they're coming after everybody and they're coming after the
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.080]  economy and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting
[55:08.080 --> 55:11.760]  Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash but here's the really
[55:11.760 --> 55:16.960]  good news the really good news humanity is awakening to this threat we're no
[55:16.960 --> 55:21.800]  longer asleep and we understand that the globals are our mortal enemies and we
[55:21.800 --> 55:24.640]  fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free
[55:24.640 --> 55:30.160]  market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever that's why we must come together
[55:30.160 --> 55:34.360]  now as Americans every race color and creed and repudiate the New World Order
[55:34.360 --> 55:39.320]  and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump but also the information war support

[56:59.600 --> 57:05.200]  Alex Jones and I am screaming and howling for vengeance because we are
[57:05.200 --> 57:14.520]  under attack so rise it's time to break the silence
[57:15.200 --> 57:22.320]  engines is boiling ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting
[57:22.320 --> 57:26.800]  worldwide I'm gonna give the number out for first-time callers to give me your
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.160]  take on this headline if Joe Biden wins common to China will rule America the
[57:31.160 --> 57:35.040]  president said that it's absolutely true I've been saying for over a year and he's
[57:35.040 --> 57:44.160]  to say that that's the truth 14 days to the end of the Republic question mark I
[57:44.160 --> 57:50.160]  mean this is really an IQ test the idiots that would vote against their own
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.480]  interest and vote against President Trump anyone that would go for the
[57:54.480 --> 58:00.560]  globalist model of deindustrialization but if you ever ask yourself how would
[58:00.560 --> 58:03.840]  evil take over America it would undermine it would bankrupt it would turn
[58:03.840 --> 58:11.280]  us against each other it would exploit our diversity and use it against us
[58:11.280 --> 58:17.240]  because diversity is strong and adaptive if there's a unifying Christianity or
[58:17.240 --> 58:24.240]  unifying Americana a unifying ethos but if you don't have a unifying narrative
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.160]  you will disintegrate and that's what's happened our narrative now is white
[58:29.160 --> 58:33.040]  people are bad and America sucks and be babies and be a victim and wine and
[58:33.040 --> 58:37.280]  scream and you know the college will give you some play-doh to play with and
[58:37.280 --> 58:42.800]  an American flag to burn I mean that's really their default position and so when
[58:42.800 --> 58:47.160]  you look at these crybaby drama queens and who they are this is this is where
[58:47.160 --> 58:50.800]  this is all going they'll ruin your business they'll ruin your life they'll
[58:50.800 --> 58:57.040]  tell you how moral they are all day but they're lazy absolutely evil and we've
[58:57.040 --> 59:02.440]  allowed them to do it so it's our fault and so this is God's giving us a choice
[59:02.440 --> 59:10.160]  right now clear the day pull free number to join us 877-789-2539 877-789-2539
[59:10.160 --> 59:16.000]  877-789 Alex a lot of folks will ask me well Jones how are you taking it you're
[59:16.000 --> 59:22.240]  just at the grocery store at the gym or at churches everywhere when I was all
[59:22.240 --> 59:25.400]  over the news four years ago three years ago two years ago a year ago but they
[59:25.400 --> 59:29.720]  were really using me as the face of evil people how you taking it oh you're a
[59:29.720 --> 59:34.680]  victim we feel so I said man I'm taking the enemy on I'm up front in the fight
[59:34.680 --> 59:39.720]  like a like a battleship that the main enemies coming after or an aircraft
[59:39.720 --> 59:43.120]  carrier they're trying to shoot the runner off of because I'm pounding the
[59:43.120 --> 59:46.640]  enemy I'm in a war you understand you're the target right you understand I just
[59:46.640 --> 59:50.440]  understand it that I'm a target and I've decided to take action against this
[59:50.440 --> 59:55.000]  set of go along with it or join it or roll over because I just can't do that
[59:55.000 --> 59:58.880]  and you understand in a couple years you'll all be shut down without rhythms
[59:58.880 --> 1:00:02.000]  watching everything you say and do and they'll be total control in a Chinese
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:11.400]  social credit score info wars broke the Chinese social credit score in 2013 MIT
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:15.720]  cooked it up with the Democrats and shipped it over to China we broke all
[1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:20.200]  of it only because we're realist and we live in the real world anybody could
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:27.120]  track these people I do I track them and sir I mean they're coming after
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:31.720]  everybody if Trump wins they're coming after you if Trump loses my god it is
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:36.000]  going to be hell on earth they're gonna break this country bankrupt everybody
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.520]  reorganize everything shut down the economy and loot the living snot out of
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:45.080]  us in a great leap forward communist revolution cultural revolution that's
[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:48.800]  the model and they're gonna do it just as sure as the sun came up and they are
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:55.760]  sympat ago they are in Congress they are interface with the chai comms and it is
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:02.160]  a disgusting sickening sight to behold and just as the poor Chinese people it's
[1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:05.360]  hard working smart folks have been put their living hell we're gonna be put
[1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:09.040]  their living hell now and what's gonna be crazy is they'll do it the steps
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:13.760]  telling the left do this to get goodies and then they'll get less goodies and
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:18.120]  they'll tell them oh it's the resistance people not complying is the reason
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:21.760]  you're not getting all the free stuff with the five or six degrees you went
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:26.080]  and got that we're all worthless I mean it's just look here's go once a chump get
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:29.680]  scammed they never admit they're a chump that's why they're called chumps
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.720]  everybody else gets scammed wakes up to it doesn't do it again chumps never learn
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:38.640]  chumps like it and chumps want to take you with them and even worse a lot of
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:43.920]  chumps join evil and they go oh if I got chump instead of fighting it they
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:52.280]  decided to join it and chump others it's planet chicken crap run by the chumps
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:58.560]  finally the stagnant republican establishment understands what infowars
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:03.160]  understands what our listeners understand what Donald Trump understands we are
[1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:09.000]  in a digital civil war there are giant filters filtering out 99% of
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.920]  communication going on on every major tech platform and now they're doing it
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:18.320]  to the private apps they're doing it to text messages they're doing it to email
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:24.000]  this is mafia organized crime election meddling but finally when they blocked
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.120]  Hunter Biden and the barisma information and the Chinese information and
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:32.520]  the photos of the crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be
[1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:36.920]  real Biden hasn't denied it finally Congress got pissed and said this is out
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:40.760]  of control you've got to stop it now we're taking action oh inject worse you
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:43.800]  went oh what's the mistake it's an accident it's an accident but they keep
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:48.160]  pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff well infowars is
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:52.960]  calling their bluff and I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:09.240]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:12.800]  lines of the Info War
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:25.440]  877-789-2539 open funds first-time callers 877-789 Alex well the headline of
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:29.360]  the show today that I hope you share is you've Joe Biden wins Communist China
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:34.520]  will rule America 14 days to the end of the Republic
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:38.200]  Dr. Steve Pachennick pops in to give us his take by on the hour and then
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:42.520]  continue with your calls right through the transmission but talk about
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:48.400]  rigging debate commission drops foreign policy questions amid Hunter Biden
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:53.600]  expose hoping then that Trump can never even bring it up and now the way they
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:58.000]  work it with these attack dogs you thought Chris Wallace was bad Samantha
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.360]  was Savannah was even worse and then now the new lady is a Democrat Party
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:08.800]  operative Christina Welker is even worse and so he'll be debating both Joe Biden
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:13.360]  and her and they won't let Trump bring it up Trump's gonna have to just say
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:16.120]  what he wants tell her to shut up and then tell them to stop rigging the
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:19.160]  debate right up their own stage Trump says he knows it's gonna be rigged he
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:24.560]  says he'll still play their rig game and beat them but this is just crazy folks
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:28.520]  this is absolutely out of control and you've got the hunter Biden laptop they
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:31.640]  want you to forget about that they're now saying Russian this info with no
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:34.880]  evidence when it's they've confirmed it's their laptop their lawyer said it's
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:41.000]  his laptop so who cares who got it but it wasn't the Russians it's about the
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.960]  crimes he's committing reportedly having sex raping underage girls and
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:50.800]  reportedly doing brutal things characterizes extreme torture those
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:53.920]  reports are at Band-Aut video I hope you share those as well because the only
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:57.760]  way the enemy wins is by silencing you and now you see there's silence in the
[1:04:57.760 --> 1:05:04.240]  Congress they're silencing the president there's shadow banning people and when
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:08.560]  whenever the president complains or when Don Jr. complains about how you're
[1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:13.640]  shadow banning our tweets they go oh that doesn't exist you're crazy same
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:17.240]  thing that it does four years ago it's a formula they're following an exact
[1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:23.160]  plan and Congress will sit there and have hearings and go are you centering us

[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:28.800]  that gets around their systems for now but but absolutely that would have been
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:32.920]  a great idea everyone should go to parlor everyone should go to gab everyone
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:36.560]  should go to telegram or telegraph everybody we're on all that we mirror
[1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:39.720]  all our stuff there as well and that's what everybody needs to do instead of
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:42.920]  counting on you're always gonna have that because you're not these are all
[1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:48.800]  tools of control it's an authoritarian takeover Peter in Canada what happens if
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:55.480]  Biden wins I want your take thank you sir hi Alex yes sir yeah with two weeks
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:08:01.640]  left it's too late the Biden wins the US is sunk what Trump has to do right now
[1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:08.120]  is do the insurrection act get rid of Bill Barr and wound up and prosecute
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:15.760]  every single one of them Biden Hunter Hillary built the works of them by the
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:19.440]  way they're the authoritarians that have tried to have three coups they're the
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:23.360]  authoritarians working with a foreign power and with all this media ganged up
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:27.000]  on the president the American people so it's not a police state to have them
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:31.760]  arrested it's what George Washington or Winston Churchill or Charles de Gaulle or
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:36.320]  anybody that was real would do just Trump doesn't have the FBI or the
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:39.840]  military leadership to do it he does have the rank and file and we're now to
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:44.000]  that point where communist China is about to steal the election when Trump
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.520]  challenges it the whole media will say he's a fraud we're all gonna be locked
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:52.280]  down we're all gonna be barred we've got to hit the streets very legally and
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:59.200]  lawfully but very aggressively now ahead of this and when it happens so I mean
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:06.920]  this freight train is coming down 14 days to election 79 days of hell and I'm
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:10.960]  just telling all these folks that that see their numbers and know that Trump's
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:14.920]  gonna win yes but the enemy is fraudulent they're gonna make their move and I
[1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:19.480]  agree communist China has blackmailed Joe Biden we have the emails proving it and
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:23.800]  father foreign powers he is not fit to be the leader and he's they all need to
[1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:28.040]  be arrested and then after the leaders has been arrested a new democratic party
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:32.360]  can form and in a year we can have another general election but and this is
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:35.640]  not because I fear Trump's gonna lose he's gonna legitimately win but they've
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:39.320]  said they want secession they've said they want martial law and your damn
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:43.080]  right sir if they can't steal it with an overwhelming fraud they're gonna then
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:47.680]  contest have secession race war we can't just sit back and let foreign powers do
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:52.640]  this we're under attack Franklin Delano Roosevelt listen they didn't make a big
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:56.600]  deal about it Franklin Delano Roosevelt who I wasn't a fan of in some respects
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:00.800]  but I wasn't for the Nazis taking over the US either he got approached McCormick
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:04.560]  Dixie committee covered this later Spendley Butler the commandant of the
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:11.160]  Marine Corps congressional medal honor winner two time he got approached they
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:16.120]  wanted to run for president because he didn't like Roosevelt and they said we
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:21.640]  want you to overthrow the 500,000 man army they just quietly sent out the
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:27.560]  Marines and the army the manly the army to deal with the people that did it and
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:31.360]  it was only about a thousand people they killed reportedly they just quietly
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:33.920]  went said hey I take it for a ride when pick them up for work people up their
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:38.160]  house took them out and shot them back in the head buried them and that ended the
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:42.480]  Nazi attempted takeover in the late 1930s of the US well this is a Chinese
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:46.720]  takeover Chinese Communist takeover so I was asking Peter what do we do I'm not
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.080]  gonna go get people and shoot them and things I'm just saying that's what
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:53.680]  Roosevelt did when the Nazis tried to overthrow the government covertly is he
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:58.920]  just went and killed him I mean so what are you saying well Alex if Biden gets
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:05.880]  in the US has finished Trump the only they are going to fix this election
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:11.920]  six ways to Sunday no two ways about it the only chance the US has is
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:18.480]  the insurrection act get whatever form of the military that's behind them
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.520]  anybody who's behind them get them get them out there get them arresting the
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:27.760]  traitors and if they have to redo the election redo the election whatever but
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:36.120]  but yeah I'm looking at you up here from Canada and I fear if Joe Biden wins
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:40.280]  there will be a civil war in the United States no two ways about it it's gonna it's
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:47.120]  gonna be a hot civil war and I live far too close to the border from for my
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:50.960]  liking oh they're planning to break your will they want to end Western
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:55.160]  civilization they want to end the consumer society for us because they
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:59.120]  want us control the serfs we're going into Neo serf them brother and you're
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:02.200]  and look we're not up here hyping this people get now that I wouldn't hype in
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:05.800]  this a year ago or six months ago and I've got chills up now my spine I feel
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:10.600]  physically sick I'm so sad this is here and I've talked to some high-level people
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:13.640]  today that don't want to go on record yet Roger Stone's on tomorrow by the way
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:18.760]  and you know Roger doesn't want to attack the people running the campaign but
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:23.120]  and but I mean I know the numbers and I know the internal polling and Trump's
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:27.760]  only five points ahead he was 15 points ahead last time and that's how he was
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:30.800]  able to still win they thought it was massive fraud he's only five points
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:35.680]  ahead in most these states and the fraud will be so high he's gonna lose and so
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:38.920]  all these republicans thinking oh we're gonna win and having this euphoria and
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:44.280]  stuff I'm sorry folks right now Trump's gonna lose via fraud and the communist
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:47.960]  Chinese will rule America with the satanic pedophile Democrats we love
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:54.640]  the rightful girls this is your last chance to get a pack power stack and I'm
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:58.560]  really bummed out about that it started out as a sleeper product but the people
[1:12:58.560 --> 1:13:02.200]  that did order it loved it and sort of reordering it they spread the word and
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.720]  became one of our best sellers but because of the COVID supply chain
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:10.240]  breakdown because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack we are
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:16.320]  unable to secure it anymore this is the highest in a npm pack system you're
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:19.400]  gonna find where you take half the pills in the morning half the
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:22.560]  capitalism pills and shell caps at night it's amazing I don't have time to go
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:26.360]  into everything that's in it but this gets people to remember to take it and
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.320]  that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:32.800]  absolutely amazing what's your last chance to get a power stack info or

[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:56.280]  were exactly 14 days out from the election and the globalist controlled
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:00.400]  Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them the
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:04.440]  whole planet is a huge populace realignment and so they've openly said
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.040]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism not just censorship but physically
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:14.080]  attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda and they're
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:17.720]  on record saying that once they remove Trump they are going to persecute
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:22.040]  Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:27.160]  this is what all the old Clintinesias are saying it's what the Obama bots are
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:32.600]  saying it's what Keith Overman saying it's with Nancy Pelosi saying this is
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:37.440]  their stated criminal authoritarian intent and they intend to keep the
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:40.920]  lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations Trump is trying to end the
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:46.480]  lockdowns and the same vaccines will be voluntary Donald Trump or die you've
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:49.800]  got to get Trump in everybody get out there and vote until your family to vote
[1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:58.120]  now you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:11.720]  bullet in my shoulder blood running down my vest 20 in the posse and they're
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:24.920]  never gonna let me rest till I became a wanted man I never even owned a gun but
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:38.360]  now they hunt me like a mountain cat and I'm always always always on the run I
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:46.760]  killed poor Jet Bright in a bad Laredo fight killed him with my bare hands for
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:53.920]  the girl I love that night Jets brothers out to get me he's coming with a gang
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:16:01.200]  but I'd rather shoot it out by God and let him watch me hang bullet in my
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:10.280]  shoulder running down my vest 20 in the posse and you're never gonna let me
[1:16:10.280 --> 1:16:16.440]  rest till I became a wanted man folks America got taken over by very evil
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.480]  corporations that are ruthless that have set up communist China and if you look
[1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:27.120]  at Nancy Pelosi Keith Overman I saw Robert Reich you know the former Clinton
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:33.360]  administration what was he in her housing urban development nothing in short
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:36.600]  people but he's literally a midget and they're talking about how they're gonna
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:40.080]  persecute us and arrest us and put us in prison and they've tried to put me in
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:46.520]  prison behind the scenes I'm not gonna get into it that latest attempt has been
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:50.640]  dealt with thanks to the grace of God your prayers they try to put everybody I
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:54.360]  know basically in jail they tried to set my data folks but we were Russian
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:17:00.320]  agents that's what's going on here so believe me I know how serious this is
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:05.080]  am I worried about me hell no I'm worried about all of us man you really
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:10.240]  want to see you think we're just safe go along with us keep your head down you
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:13.240]  gonna really sit back and watch that happen that's really who you are I know
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:16.600]  our audience of activists are the opposite that's why I love you that's why
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:21.720]  it's obscene you call up thinking me thank me for wanting to not be a slave
[1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:27.560]  again that's like going under the deep end of the pool going down 10 feet when
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:30.200]  your wife loses a ring in it or something says hey honey get my ring it fell
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:33.880]  off and you like don't come up for air and they go boy you know you sure got
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:40.600]  courage when you came up for air this is a natural thing to do to say no to
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:45.360]  this and when I look at every angle of this the most horrible outcomes are what
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:53.080]  I see and I'd be a liar if I didn't tell you that of course Trump's got bigger
[1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:58.000]  crowds than he had four years ago of course he's got 40% of black males 20%
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.800]  of black females saying they're gonna vote for him and that's when people are
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:05.640]  scared being asked the question it's probably higher Kanye West and others
[1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.880]  are a bellwether but what does Facebook and Twitter do when it shows a big
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:15.600]  group of black Americans marching in DC they ban you that's authoritarian because
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:24.360]  they're creating a racial narrative sony is worth 45 billion dollars it's owned
[1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:28.720]  by the Japanese Imperial family and others who nothing is Japanese they're
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:35.200]  nice folks but man you talk about being homogeneous and racist only other group
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:45.760]  more racist is the Chinese I mean it's a fact folks they're putting 45 billion
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:52.480]  dollar company is pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the black lives
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:56.920]  matter movement which has nothing to do with black people and I know you know
[1:18:56.920 --> 1:19:05.920]  that but this is the elite of the world coming after us Apple 100 million black
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:12.920]  lives matter George Soros hundreds of millions black lives matter and then I
[1:19:12.920 --> 1:19:17.160]  read the headlines you know older blacks particularly are going to vote
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:20.240]  because they've got black sons and they're not gonna let white people kill
[1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:29.320]  them your 27 times more likely in Chicago to be killed by a black man if
[1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:34.120]  you're a black man then you are a white man 2,000 black men die a year in
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.600]  Chicago on average how many cops shoot unarmed black men in even questionable
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:46.800]  cases a year 14 it's a myth but they take every event if they showed you a
[1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:49.720]  great white shark attack I think it's like two of them on video they showed
[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.600]  you that every night people think they're great white sharks everywhere but
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:56.920]  again it's the same thing it's like it's like COVID they take all the flu
[1:19:56.920 --> 1:19:59.840]  numbers all the pneumonia numbers all the cancer numbers all the heart attack
[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:03.280]  numbers all the car wrecks all the skydiving accidents these are real
[1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:07.600]  cases gunshot wounds and they put it in the COVID column and then go oh my god
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:12.280]  we've lost 230,000 people from COVID but when you look at all the numbers it's
[1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:20.320]  6% of that actually died from COVID so divide six out of 230,000 everybody
[1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:30.560]  can do it 15 16,000 people that didn't die of something else they did the
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:37.320]  numbers in Australia 77 people died of COVID in Australia let me show you these
[1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:42.200]  numbers look at these headlines Cuomo killed my parents protesters filled
[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:46.600]  casket with copies of governor's book on COVID leadership yes get in their
[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:53.040]  face info war and then look at these numbers these numbers as the whole
[1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:57.280]  world locks down China's totally open Biden wears two masks at a campaign
[1:20:57.280 --> 1:21:02.240]  stop oh virtue signaling now people are wearing spacesuits because humans are so
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:05.480]  bad we're so dirty we're so evil we can't be around each other we have to
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:08.760]  all go die we have to all die and starve because we can't have one person die
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:17.320]  covered but look at this headline Brazil's major state run by a communist
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:23.360]  calls for mandatory COVID vaccinations to buy or sell and the communist state is
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:29.520]  now buying 46 million doses and of course they're all involved look at this
[1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:34.320]  headline I a t a you're more likely to get struck by lightning than catch COVID
[1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:39.960]  19 on a plane the International Air Transport Association has recently
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:43.760]  published research on COVID flying that should help you feel safe for the
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:49.080]  health of safety air travel the I a t a demonstrated that low incidence of flight
[1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:53.360]  COVID-19 transmission with an updated tally of published cases between January
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:57.480]  2020 there were 44 cases worldwide of COVID-19 reported in which transmission
[1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:01.000]  is thought to have associated in a flight journey in close of a confirmed
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:08.640]  potential causes of the same period 1.2 billion passengers have traveled so do
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:14.480]  the math on that what chances that of you getting COVID the figures above
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:20.400]  represent a 1 in 27 million probability of catching COVID-19 on a flight which
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:23.440]  is significantly less the chances of being struck by lightning which is
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:31.200]  Australia is around 1 in 12,000 so they're like what did I say a month ago I
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:35.720]  said COVID is calling it a hoax is not proper the rollout has a bunch of
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:42.280]  hoaxes adding death numbers from other things into the columns of hoax saying
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:45.440]  hospitals were full and they weren't so hoax hiring reporters to dress up in
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:49.560]  hazmat gear as a hoax there's lots of hoaxes in it but no there is a virus
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:54.080]  that is man-made so gates can own a common cold virus and then make you pay
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:00.400]  his subsidiaries trillions of dollars and if you're super rundown and don't have
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:03.200]  your vitamins and minerals it can kill you but there are lots of other
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:06.000]  pneumonia's and stuff that are killing lots of people you need vitamins and
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:10.240]  minerals you need to be prepared you need D3 you you have to have it you need
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:15.240]  C you have to have it you need zinc you have to have it was 13 14 15 vitamins
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.000]  you got to have a bunch of minerals you got to have a lot of scientists argue
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:22.840]  it's only 14 but a lot of scientists more than 30 point is this is good for
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:29.920]  people we got your calls coming up but man wow one in 27 million probability on
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:33.000]  a plane getting it but doesn't matter you're a hero when you wear the mask
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.400]  you're a hero and so the airlines are shut down there's half as many flights
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:40.040]  they're laying off the pilot so they go it doesn't matter I'm saving people
[1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:44.920]  every in the third world millions are dying but it's fun and you're a hero and
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:48.280]  it's good and the Democrats admit it's all political theater to shut down
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:54.160]  America vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock it's being
[1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:57.040]  sold out for months they're sold out because people know that high quality
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:01.720]  b12 and a good mix of vitamins minerals especially zinc boost your bodies
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:06.960]  natural defenses and are critical to your immune system well both products are
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:12.000]  back in stock at info or store comms two weeks after the election and we're
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.360]  offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple Patriot points
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:22.080]  your next order also if you sign up for auto shipping additional 10% off that
[1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:25.520]  makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders now we have had a big
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:28.680]  clearance sale going so a lot of stuff sold out while the other stuff is
[1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:31.960]  close to selling out but some of our best sellers are still there and some of
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:35.360]  them actually come back in to stock and because of your support we've had the
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:39.280]  money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out so
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:42.240]  those should be back in stock as well soon thank you so much for keeping
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:45.880]  info wars on the air obviously we're critical to fight and you've helped win
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:51.760]  the war against the global so far a major life lesson just took place last
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:58.120]  night the top story in the country was that hunter-biden's laptop information
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:03.880]  to come out him with hookers and shooting porno movies and crack pipes with
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:09.240]  the real news was how he had indeed been bought off by barisma and it done so
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:13.600]  at the behest of his father who was getting large parts of the money but
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:17.760]  you see Twitter and Facebook and others totally censored info and even
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:21.560]  censored major news publications and even censored the president when the
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:25.120]  president and Congress said they were gonna take action suddenly jack of
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:29.560]  Twitter said he didn't know what had happened and it was wrong that's the
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:34.120]  big life lesson here standing up and saying no to organized crime rapid
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:38.920]  caring is the way to stop it groveling to it and letting big tech lie to us
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:42.800]  run over us is the way to make these pilots continue to go absolutely crazy
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:47.280]  remember they support communist China and its death camps what will they do to us
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:52.120]  will we now know it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:57.160]  new cell phones would track your GPS location I read from the federal law
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:02.240]  and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American now the media
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:06.960]  admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on droids
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.960]  don't just track your location but your surfing history where you go who you talk
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:16.480]  to your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:21.040]  you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:25.840]  to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:30.840]  transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.400]  phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:39.240]  based on information this is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit score get
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:44.000]  your protection privacy pockets at info or short com and cut big brother off
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:49.320]  dead in his filthy tracks info or store dot com
[1:26:49.320 --> 1:27:06.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:21.360]  she
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.840]  All right, we've got limited time within two segments that will continue with calls next hour.
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:55.560]  Dr. Steven Chenick was raised to the top end.
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:00.520]  He was a real spy chief, state department, and over CIA and army operations and others.
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:03.560]  Regime change, Camp David Accord's founding of Delta Force.
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:06.440]  And he's actually been there in the last 40 plus years.
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:10.040]  He's a psychiatrist, Harvard, MIT, all of it.
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:12.840]  So he's a real insider, not one of these fake ones.
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:16.120]  And he's really charted the course on the show the last 18 years,
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:19.240]  but probably the most accurate guess we've had.
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:22.360]  I got to tell you, I know Trump's going to win big and real polls,
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:24.040]  but there's so much election fraud.
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:25.800]  The Democrats are going to declare Biden won.
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:28.840]  And they're going to do all this.
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:34.200]  And I made a lot of calls last week and this weekend about how he's compromised with the Chinese.
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:36.440]  Well, Biden hides this in plain view like Ukraine.
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:38.120]  And the emails are real.
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.080]  His lawyer confirms it.
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:41.080]  Like, yeah, okay, yeah, that place shouldn't have had these.
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:43.640]  The FBI did nothing with it.
[1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:45.320]  Barr did nothing with it.
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:46.440]  And now they're talking about it.
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:48.920]  The New York Post publishes it, even blurred out.
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:49.640]  It's a crime.
[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:50.840]  Well, then, okay, so who has it?
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:53.560]  It's not a criminal, but then who exposes it's a criminal.
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:55.960]  I guess it's like Julian Assange locked up in prison.
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:00.920]  So going to Steve Pachinic of StevePachinic.com,
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:05.880]  also find all his books he co-ops with Tom Clancy and his new ones as well there.
[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:08.360]  I know he doesn't care about promoting them, but they're still great books.
[1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:09.960]  What the hell is going on here?
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:12.600]  Because the media won't show any of this,
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:14.600]  but now they say it's Russian disinfo,
[1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:17.320]  but the head of national intelligence says that's a lie.
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:19.720]  I don't care if the Easter Bunny came up with this stuff.
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:20.920]  This is Hunter Biden.
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:23.560]  He's compromised with the Chai comms and others.
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:26.360]  I don't see how Biden can even be a candidate
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:27.720]  when it's open and shut like this.
[1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:31.240]  I mean, I really feel the republic is in peril, Dr. Pachinic.
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:34.760]  Well, you're right in some way,
[1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:37.480]  but the other part that you and I have been talking about
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:39.960]  in terms of the Democratic Party,
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:45.560]  what you're seeing at doing, it is constantly self-destructing.
[1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:49.960]  For several years now, I've told you that the Democrats have been self-destructing
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.760]  because you've had, they're too old.
[1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:53.560]  They're too old.
[1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:55.160]  They're too antiquated.
[1:29:55.160 --> 1:29:58.760]  They're too irrelevant to what's happening in this new era.
[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:02.760]  In an era where we need a businessman who's never been a politician
[1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:06.360]  who understands business, sometimes he makes a mistake,
[1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:08.360]  but he knows how to correct it.
[1:30:08.360 --> 1:30:13.800]  I can't have an 87-year-old, Diane Feinstein, who's worth $8.58 million.
[1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:19.560]  I can't have a Nancy Pelosi who's 80 years old and worth $35 million.
[1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:24.360]  I can't have a Maxine Waters worth $8 million and it's 82 years old.
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:27.160]  In other words, what you're seeing here is Biden,
[1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:28.600]  what we said all along.
[1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:32.920]  He's the metaphor for what happened to the Democratic Party.
[1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:34.920]  See now dimension.
[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:39.960]  They eventually erupted and became literally seen now demented.
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:44.760]  And in turn, they brought in some woman who happened to have spent most of her life,
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:48.760]  not in the United States, but in Canada, in Montreal,
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:54.760]  and claims that she is a black American, has no relevance to America,
[1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:55.960]  is not even black.
[1:30:55.960 --> 1:31:02.760]  And so what you see is the narrative for the Democrats is not only distorted,
[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:03.960]  it's perverted.
[1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:09.960]  The Hunter Biden is the metaphor and the reality of what happens when you are in Congress
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:14.520]  or the House of Representatives or Senator for so long.
[1:31:14.520 --> 1:31:16.520]  This is what Biden really did.
[1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:22.520]  He did nothing except self-aggrandize, self-destruct, and at the same time,
[1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:28.520]  lead our country into six wars, which for which he's never been held accountable.
[1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:36.520]  Now is the time for America to start incarcerating these people and stop giving rationalizations.
[1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:38.520]  Well, that's why I got you on because I'm against police states.
[1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:44.520]  But when you've got a foreign power backing crazy people that are doing all this saying
[1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:48.520]  they're going to cause a civil war, they're going to cause secession, at a certain point,
[1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:52.520]  I mean, they've got to be militarily dealt with because that's what they're saying they're going to do to us.
[1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:56.520]  You've got all the Democrats saying once Trump loses, they're going to come arrest all of us.
[1:31:56.520 --> 1:31:58.520]  Well, that's not going to happen.
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:00.520]  A civil war is going to happen.
[1:32:00.520 --> 1:32:02.520]  You're correct.
[1:32:02.520 --> 1:32:06.520]  I mean, in the area where I am, the Second Amendment is enshrined.
[1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:10.520]  We have a Second Amendment free zone, so to speak.
[1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:14.520]  The rest of the country has become less and less irrelevant.
[1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:20.520]  As we said, the East Coast, the West Coast, the Northeast, all of them are irrelevant now.
[1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:28.520]  The power has clearly shifted down to Florida, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina.
[1:32:28.520 --> 1:32:36.520]  What we have now is the time for Trump, once he gets back in, not say Fauci's just stupid.
[1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:42.520]  What I've asked for three years is that he goes to prison and he be fired for insubordination.
[1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:46.520]  He's part of what we call a paramilitary unit public health service.
[1:32:46.520 --> 1:32:50.520]  You do not confront the President of the United States.
[1:32:50.520 --> 1:32:58.520]  You do not disseminate false information and you do not self-aggrandize when you are part of a unit.
[1:32:58.520 --> 1:33:00.520]  That is a paramilitary unit.
[1:33:00.520 --> 1:33:02.520]  There is no reason for him to be there.
[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:04.520]  There's no reason for him to make $400,000.
[1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:10.520]  There's no reason for his wife to make $200,000 plus NIH.
[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:16.520]  So Trump has to begin to act in a way, incarceration of Hunter Biden.
[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:19.520]  You've been saying that for a while, so have I.
[1:33:19.520 --> 1:33:22.520]  He's been saying in every speech, I want them locked up.
[1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:24.520]  They're criminals. I want Obama. I want the Clintons.
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:26.520]  I want Biden locked up because they deserve to be locked up.
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:28.520]  The media goes, oh, he's crazy.
[1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:29.520]  No, that's the truth.
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:34.520]  But what does he do when there's a toothless justice department that is scared of their own shadow?
[1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:38.520]  This is where we've been talking about for years.
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:44.520]  When I said, and I can't blame Trump, he really didn't know who he was bringing in.
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:48.520]  But when you bring in everybody who'd been with the Bush administration,
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:52.520]  Christopher Wray, my God, went to Andover.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:57.520]  The people at Andover thought he was a jerk, totally incompetent.
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:33:58.520]  I know that for a fact.
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:02.520]  Bush Jr., Bush Senior went to Andover.
[1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:03.520]  Where did they go to school?
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:04.520]  Yale.
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:06.520]  What is Christopher Wray really doing?
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:10.520]  He's nothing but a pimp who self-aggrandized himself,
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:15.520]  made a lot of money as a pimp lawyer, has no sense of what the FBI,
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:19.520]  and by the way, the FBI has to be taken down.
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:22.520]  How many times have I said this since 9-11?
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:27.520]  The FBI is totally against our civil rights.
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:29.520]  It's totally incompetent.
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:33.520]  It can't find anything if you ask the local police force.
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:37.520]  In any county, anywhere from Montana to Florida,
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:41.520]  I've worked with policemen, and the same story comes across.
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:45.520]  The FBI is incompetent, useless, worthless.
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:46.520]  Get rid of them.
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:48.520]  We have Homeland Security.
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:49.520]  I got ATF.
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:54.520]  I've got enough federal troops to block any kind of secessionist movement
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:58.520]  that I predicted in state of emergency in a novel I wrote
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:03.520]  that was happened around Arizona because of the water rights.
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:08.520]  Now, what we have here is a chance for Trump to redefine
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:10.520]  what does incarceration mean.
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:11.520]  Get rid of Barr.
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:18.520]  Who, in God's name, uses a man who was a DI, an analyst at the agency,
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:23.520]  then converted to a DDO, an operative, then converted to a quote,
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:28.520]  a lawyer, but has always been loyal to the CIA.
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:30.520]  I mean, it doesn't make sense.
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:36.520]  I've said we've got 16 units in the CIA getting rid of 80% of them.
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.520]  Let's talk about what's about to happen in the next two weeks
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.520]  because I agree with all of that.
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:42.520]  I know there's a bunch of different camps in the government,
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:45.520]  and the corporate system really wants to put Joe Biden in
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:47.520]  because they'll totally control him and lute the country.
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:51.520]  But obviously, anyone saying there's any good people left in government,
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:53.520]  we need to stop this and put Trump in.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:55.520]  This is crazy.
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:59.520]  Well, it may be crazy, but the point of fact is what you and I said correctly.
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:04.520]  There's going to be ballot harvesting, and that is a problem for me.
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:07.520]  It's a problem for me individually and as an operative
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:11.520]  because we do not know how many ballots have been harvested,
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:15.520]  and in nine states, it's mandatory balloting.
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:19.520]  Washington, Oregon, you know, all the liberal states.
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:22.520]  So they can have all kinds of ballots come in.
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:26.520]  Personally, I would bring in the police force in every area
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.520]  to monitor what's going on,
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:32.520]  and I would bring as much as I hated a national force,
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:38.520]  either the ATF or some other unit of the government, not the FBI.
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  They're useless, but another...
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  Let's talk about this when we come back.
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:37:02.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:10.520]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:16.520]  attacked, and threatened because we are effective.
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:18.520]  The Great Awakening is here.
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:24.520]  Go to banned.video, download the videos, and share.
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:32.520]  Support the Information War at infowarstore.com
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:43.520]  and never give up the fight.
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:47.520]  Infowars.com
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:49.520]  Black Friday in October.
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:52.520]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:55.520]  that we ran in the last couple weeks of October.
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:56.520]  It was popular for a reason.
[1:37:56.520 --> 1:38:01.520]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:04.520]  And that means 30% to 60% off store-wide free shipping,
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:08.520]  triple-patriot points at 15% off your next order,
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:11.520]  and everybody that signs up for auto-shipping additional 10% off,
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:13.520]  that makes many of these items lost leaders.
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:15.520]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out,
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:17.520]  some of our best sellers are still there, but some good news.
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.520]  Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:22.520]  and all other vitamins and minerals and amino acids
[1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:25.520]  for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses.
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:28.520]  It is back in stock, back on sale today,
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:31.520]  which is two weeks of the election, and more good news.
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.520]  Ultra 12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason.
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:36.520]  Highest quality, 5 and B12,
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:39.520]  take it under the tongue for full absorption.
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:40.520]  It is now back in stock.
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:44.520]  Both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:45.520]  Infowars.com.
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.520]  Black Friday comes in October.
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:51.520]  History is now.
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:53.520]  History is taking place in front of us.
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:55.520]  We are at the crossroads.
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:57.520]  We are now only two weeks out
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:00.520]  from the most historic and important election in world history.
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:02.520]  I've been saying that for over a year,
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:04.520]  but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating.
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:05.520]  This is so critical.
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:07.520]  The New World Order wants to repudiate the nation state.
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:09.520]  They'll repudiate the idea of America.
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:11.520]  They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:14.520]  and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy.
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:18.520]  So they are throwing everything they've got,
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:20.520]  and not just the American people, but the people of the world.
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:23.520]  That's why your word of mouth is beyond king.
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:25.520]  It is paramount.
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:28.520]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos,
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:30.520]  when you shoot your own video, or write your own article,
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:32.520]  or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them,
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.520]  When you speak out against the system,
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:38.520]  when you do things that seem little,
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  together it adds up into giant things.
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:42.520]  Many hands make life worth.
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:43.520]  History is happening now.
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:45.520]  Take action now while you still can.
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  Please, for all of our futures.
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:19.520]  The system is censoring
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:21.520]  because the power of the people
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:23.520]  overrode them four years ago.
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  Trump has finally figured this out,
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:27.520]  and since he's going to take action once re-elected,
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:28.520]  he gets big tech.
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:29.520]  I mean, he's a modern situation.
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:31.520]  Well, we know the president is overwhelmed right now,
[1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:32.520]  so we're going to sit here and cry,
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:34.520]  because he has taken action.
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:36.520]  We the people are taking action now,
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:38.520]  and you can do it very, very easily by sharing
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:39.520]  2020ElectionCenter.com,
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:40.520]  2020ElectionCenter.com,
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:42.520]  and checking out the new redesigned
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:45.520]  infowars.com, and sharing that with you.
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:47.520]  Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:07.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:08.520]  Dr. Steve Fitchenick is our guest
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:09.520]  for one more segment,
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:11.520]  then I'm going right to your phone calls.
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:13.520]  Alex Jones, your host.
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:14.520]  And I get it.
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:16.520]  Dr. doing a great job giving us background,
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:17.520]  explaining what's going on.
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:18.520]  It's all dead on.
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:19.520]  We know that. We appreciate it.
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.520]  I'm just sitting here 14 days out,
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:24.520]  and I get the Democrats are self-destructing.
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:25.520]  I get there a bunch of zombies.
[1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:30.520]  I get that their emblematic logo or mascot
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:33.520]  is a person with dementia.
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:34.520]  So it just shows their total disconnect,
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:36.520]  their arrogance, their hubris.
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:39.520]  But still, I can have an anvil made out of steel
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:40.520]  with not one IQ point.
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:42.520]  I drop it on somebody seven hundred feet.
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:43.520]  They're going to die.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:44.520]  If the chai comms and the globalists
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:46.520]  and these out of control corporations,
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:48.520]  none of them who are even in charge,
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:52.520]  they all just want compliant minions throw Biden
[1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:56.520]  this giant hunk of steel at us or this dead body,
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:41:57.520]  whatever he is,
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:41:58.520]  that you can drop a dead body on somebody
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:41:59.520]  for a hundred feet will kill him.
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:01.520]  It's still going to cause a problem.
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:02.520]  They're still going to try to execute
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:04.520]  in a way their ignorance is their strength.
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:05.520]  To quote 1984.
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:07.520]  The fact that they try to have a civil war,
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.520]  the fact that they have the Hutzpah to keep trying
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:10.520]  all these coups,
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:12.520]  the fact that everyone bows down to them.
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:13.520]  I mean, you get what I'm saying?
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:17.520]  It's like a mentally retarded automaton
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:19.520]  and their supporters are like that.
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:20.520]  They just never stop.
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:22.520]  They never go away.
[1:42:22.520 --> 1:42:25.520]  Let me say the following.
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:27.520]  One of the things that I would do,
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:30.520]  and this is something I looked at very carefully,
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:35.520]  it's strategic and it's point of focus targeting.
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:37.520]  I would use Richard Grinnell,
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:41.520]  who has been an incredibly effective operator
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:44.520]  and spokesperson for this administration.
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:46.520]  Pence has been wonderful.
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:47.520]  Trump is wonderful.
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:51.520]  But in order to send a message to the big tech companies,
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:55.520]  you've got to pick out the largest and most salient,
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:59.520]  but not always apparent weakness among them.
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:02.520]  And the one person I can continuously attack,
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.520]  and I've known from past experience,
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:08.520]  is totally incompetent and that's Dorsey,
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:11.520]  who created both Square and Twitter
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:15.520]  and thought he could get away with all kinds of criminal activities.
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:18.520]  Why would I want Grinnell to go after Dorsey?
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:22.520]  Number one, Dorsey created Square.
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:23.520]  He created Twitter,
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:27.520]  but the Wall Street Journal considered him the worst,
[1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:32.520]  the worst CEO in the entire gamut of big tech.
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:35.520]  But there's another reason I'm going to attack him,
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:37.520]  and the reason becomes more personal
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:40.520]  since he decided to become personal with Trump
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:44.520]  and use Hunter Biden and started to threaten our own president
[1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:46.520]  and our own people, including me.
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:50.520]  And that is Grinnell has to ask Dorsey,
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:53.520]  isn't it amazing for the past 15 years
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:57.520]  you've been considered the bachelor of the year?
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:00.520]  What does that really mean, Dorsey?
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:03.520]  Now, remember, Grinnell is proud he's gay
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:06.520]  and I have no problems with somebody being gay.
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:10.520]  I do have a problem when you have somebody like Dorsey
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:12.520]  who thinks he's self-righteous,
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:14.520]  who thinks he's better than other people
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:18.520]  and he doesn't want to come out publicly that he's gay.
[1:44:18.520 --> 1:44:20.520]  That is a problem for me.
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:24.520]  The hidden secrecy and nastiness of a guy like Dorsey.
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:26.520]  Now, why do I say that personally?
[1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:30.520]  Number one, when I owned Twitter the stock years ago,
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:33.520]  I couldn't find out where their office was.
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:34.520]  No one answered.
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:37.520]  Then when we were using Square, guess what happened?
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:40.520]  They said they don't work on Saturdays and Sundays.
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:44.520]  Well, Dorsey, you've got multi-billion dollars,
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.520]  but the one thing you can't cover up
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:50.520]  is the fact that you are covert or homosexual,
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:53.520]  the fact that you do not like to be with other people,
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:57.520]  the fact that you are a male model when you were only 12 years old,
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:44:59.520]  but you never said anything to anyone,
[1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:02.520]  and the fact that you had to overcome
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:05.520]  what you knew in terms of self-hatred,
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:07.520]  these are the women and men.
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:11.520]  And now we're going to have somebody who's going to come in
[1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:13.520]  and say it out publicly,
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:15.520]  Dorsey, what's your problem?
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:19.520]  Why can't you come out and be gay and be proud of it?
[1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:21.520]  That's the way I would hit them.
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:23.520]  That's the way I work.
[1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:26.520]  When I need to work, I pick my targets very carefully,
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:28.520]  and I go right after them.
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:32.520]  I have no problem using whatever information I need to know.
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:35.520]  I totally agree with you that they have been spying on us,
[1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:39.520]  enslaving us, bullying everyone,
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:41.520]  election meddling,
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:43.520]  and with 14 days out,
[1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:45.520]  the president needs to understand
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:48.520]  that he needs to take the gloves off in a legal and lawful way
[1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:51.520]  and go after all the dirt on all of them.
[1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:53.520]  My God, the heads of Google,
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:55.520]  and the things they've done that I even know,
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:57.520]  the Trumps people know that,
[1:45:57.520 --> 1:45:59.520]  all of them are incredibly compromised.
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:01.520]  Apple moving to China, giving them the code keys,
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:03.520]  that's espionage. Forget Section 230.
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:05.520]  And if Trump ever did one thing,
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:07.520]  ever had one action,
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:09.520]  they would all fold like a house of cards
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:11.520]  and do the right thing.
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:13.520]  But instead, because there's been no government action,
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:15.520]  and because of the Heritage Foundation,
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:17.520]  fake libertarian BS,
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:19.520]  and so we're like, oh, hands off big tech?
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:21.520]  So it's now been captured by consortium,
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:23.520]  authoritarian corporations in China.
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:25.520]  And so by extension,
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:27.520]  they've now given up all their rightful power
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:29.520]  to protect the Republic,
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:31.520]  and have actually become by extension enemies
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:33.520]  of themselves in the country.
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:35.520]  And so we need drastic action now.
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:37.520]  What else would you say needs to be done?
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:39.520]  Well, what I would say is,
[1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:41.520]  I'd get a new attorney general right away
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:43.520]  and get rid of Barr.
[1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:45.520]  I would show the country that he is not
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:47.520]  adequate, he's not sufficient,
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:49.520]  nor can the agency continue
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:51.520]  with what he's been doing.
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:53.520]  Similarly, I would get rid of Gene Haspel.
[1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:55.520]  In other words, even with 14 days left,
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:57.520]  I would start firing
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:46:59.520]  people right and left so that
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:01.520]  the country can understand
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:03.520]  we're getting rid of the vestiges
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:05.520]  of the old regime that came out of Yale.
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:07.520]  Great idea. Great signal.
[1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:09.520]  Just start anybody that's
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:11.520]  establishment, anybody that's globalist.
[1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:13.520]  I mean, you could Google them in a minute,
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:15.520]  but they are just fire thousands of them.
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:17.520]  That's what I would do,
[1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:19.520]  and that's what I have done in the past.
[1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:21.520]  When I got called in on a Bush senior
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:23.520]  because he was 20 points behind
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:25.520]  Dukakis,
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:27.520]  do you think Bush senior really
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:29.520]  cared for me or Baker?
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:31.520]  The answer was no. Did I care for Bush senior?
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:33.520]  No, but I got him in there.
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:35.520]  People said, oh, you should be grateful
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:37.520]  you worked for Bush senior. No, it was the other way around.
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:39.520]  But honestly,
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:41.520]  I left after I put together Cambodia,
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:43.520]  but you've got to be able
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:45.520]  to do the nastiest
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:47.520]  things just before you get elected.
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:49.520]  And that's what I have to do.
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:51.520]  And that's what you get done.
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:53.520]  Now Trump knows that
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:55.520]  he has a hard time, and I said it
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:57.520]  repeatedly, being
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:47:59.520]  able to fire people.
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:01.520]  He's actually really too nice. That's actually a secret.
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:03.520]  I know that.
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:05.520]  You and I have known that.
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:07.520]  He's got to get rid of Fauci
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:09.520]  who came out with his mouth again,
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.520]  who's totally
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:13.520]  When I got remarried three years ago,
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:15.520]  Trump literally got my wife's number
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:17.520]  called sir, we're in an airport in Hawaii
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:19.520]  and talked to her five minutes and I got on the phone
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:21.520]  and I said, sir, you can call me
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:23.520]  if you want, but I don't need a pat on the head.
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:25.520]  You got enemies around you. You need to
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:27.520]  take them out politically. You need to protect yourself.
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:29.520]  And I mean, he goes, well,
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:31.520]  I just wanted to let you know I appreciate you. And I'm like, dude,
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:33.520]  I get it. But I said, you don't need to call
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:35.520]  me to pat me on the head. Listen,
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:37.520]  my destiny is tied to America. Yours
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.520]  is to let's just win this thing. That wasn't
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:41.520]  an arrogant thing. That wasn't me like
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:43.520]  trying to like alpha the president. I was saying, sir,
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:45.520]  you don't need to call us up and congratulate our wedding.
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:47.520]  We want war. We want victory.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:49.520]  I told him, I said, I want the enemy to feed it.
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:51.520]  I want our country sovereign again. I want China
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:53.520]  who's the enemy dealt with. And the good news is
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:55.520]  he wasn't talking about China
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:57.520]  three years ago. He really gets it now. And that's good.
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  The good news
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:01.520]  is that he understood that your wife
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:03.520]  was better looking than you.
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:05.520]  Exactly.
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:07.520]  And that's why
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:09.520]  don't forget he likes women and good
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  guys. And I'm glad he likes women.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:13.520]  That's been a unique feature
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:15.520]  of our president.
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:17.520]  But the issue with ChaiCom right now,
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:19.520]  you're correct. But I'd rather focus
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:21.520]  on the domestic
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:23.520]  problems that we have now and just start
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:25.520]  firing. And you've got enough
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:27.520]  people in that White House to be able
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:29.520]  to do it. And, you know,
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:31.520]  Barr has to go. He has
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:33.520]  absolutely done nothing.
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:35.520]  Chai has to go.
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:37.520]  Chai has to go. Pompeo,
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:39.520]  I think he's totally useless.
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:41.520]  And I thought Mills
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:43.520]  was also useless.
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:45.520]  Trump's even started criticizing Pompeo.
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:47.520]  Do five more minutes if you can, and then I promise
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:49.520]  callers, I'm going to get to all of you in a
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:51.520]  segment. I'm going to come right back to our

[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:45.520]  tongue, you get almost as good
[1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:47.520]  absorption as if you went and got a prescription
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:49.520]  version and injected it.
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:51.520]  And listen, I go to a doctor once
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:53.520]  you get a prescription. I inject by the B12
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:55.520]  and I remember to do it. I've got it in my refrigerator in there.
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:57.520]  That's better than this. This is almost

[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:29.520]  listening to. And I want you
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:31.520]  to spread the word because that's how we

[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:41.640]  With two weeks left until the historic election,

[1:52:56.680 --> 1:52:59.600]  because stocks are low in a lot of our best selling products.
[1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:01.440]  But two things that came back in

[1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:44.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:52.040]  Lively music
[1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:57.400]  Yes, populism and free market away cannings on the march.
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:53:59.400]  Corruption was on the run,
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:02.160]  but now they've launched their counter strikes.
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:04.560]  I don't see Pachydynx or a few minutes,
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:05.440]  I'm gonna go break.
[1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:08.560]  One minute, right back to all your calls.
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:09.880]  So you're a smart guy,
[1:54:09.880 --> 1:54:11.920]  you've had a lot of contacts here to the ground.
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:16.560]  You're saying you think Trump wins, wins big, uh, Democrats still say they're going to contest.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:20.800]  What, what do you see coming up? What do you think we can all do not just counting on Trump
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:28.720]  but ourselves to make sure we restore the republic? Well, number one, I would not vote with a ballot.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:34.400]  I would vote in person and make sure that you, you came and you voted and make sure you had
[1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:42.560]  poll watches who are honest and consistent. Number two, I would assign somebody within the White House
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:48.720]  to silence the White House instead of leaking out information that's not appropriate to the
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:55.840]  newspapers or to whomever. I don't want to hear that senior officials in the White House off the
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:02.480]  record spoke to some newspaper. That's not going to work unless you clamp down on that White House
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:09.520]  and fire immediately. There's a lot of leakage going on. Number three, I think Pence has to
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:16.160]  delineate very well what he's been doing and how he feels that a president should act and that
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:21.520]  Trump has done well and then explain as well, not only Trump, how are we going to get back.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.600]  That's right. He needs all his surrogates running around the country doing their own rallies.
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:33.120]  Well, the surrogates are not as effective. The only man who's really effective, the only
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:40.000]  man anybody's looking at is Trump. But Pence has acted as a number two. I was very impressed.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.440]  I become even more impressed with him. I mean, Grinnell gets the message out very well as well.
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:52.240]  As you said, what's the wild card of more October surprises and what Giuliani's got with
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:55.680]  this laptop? The media is trying to cover that up. What's your take on that?
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:03.600]  Unfortunately, what could happen is a boomerang effect, which I've seen in the past. That is,
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:10.560]  it's so lethal and so incredulous that the Democrats, particularly the liberals, would say
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:17.040]  that's nonsense. That's totally made up. It's fake news. It's people on the right wing. Remember,
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:23.840]  you're in the alternative media and Steve Pachanik and Alex Jones are consistent with conspiracy.
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:31.840]  So the notion of conspiracy theories is going to skyrocket on the left, while the reality of
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:38.400]  what's happening to the Democrats is going to be minimized. There, they know how to just say
[1:56:38.400 --> 1:56:44.560]  nothing and make sure that they can force us to say, oh, these are conspiracies on the right.
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:49.760]  And they will say, I want you to get your ballots in, particularly in the states where
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:56.080]  it's mandatory. As I said, the liberal states, there we need poll watches from the Republican
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:00.640]  party. They can just totally ignore no matter how horrible it is. They just ignore it because we
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:04.400]  all kind of have an inclination to like what videos of him raping little girls. Okay, we better
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:10.720]  not get into that. So they use that. Well, they use it, but you ignore it. You override it. And
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:17.280]  at the same time, you're going to have to make sure you have a strategy for number one. If Biden
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:23.360]  does win, I need to have a strategy in that White House. Or what happens if Biden comes in very
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:28.720]  close and they want to contest it? What if he loses and they want to contest it? In other words,
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.440]  I need some strategic. That's what I've been saying is we've been trying to battle plan here on
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:36.320]  air is what we're doing right now. That talks folks in the White House. They say there's really
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:41.760]  no battle planning going on. Well, that's the problem. There's no one there who's strategic.
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:47.360]  And that's been a problem for over three and a half years. What happens with a man like Trump,
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:52.400]  who is quite formidable and he loves what he does and he's good at what he does,
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:57.600]  is to entertain the audience. There has to be somebody real realist that just report to him
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:02.720]  and then leave it at that. He can do what he wants. Why exactly? You have to be cold-blooded.
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:07.920]  This is, you know, this is war. This is a war that we're going to have from now on. It's not
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:13.040]  going to be in Afghanistan. It's not going to be in Iraq. It's going to be in the White House.
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:19.840]  And that White House war might last a couple of months and I need a plan or somebody needs a plan
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:25.760]  to understand strategically what you're going to do, who's going to be involved and how long are
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:29.520]  you going to use that strategy? Well, I totally agree. So you tell me when you want to come on
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:34.480]  for an hour in the next few days. I want to hear your idea because we need to get ahead of this
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:38.400]  now and I guarantee you this stuff then leaks into the White House because they leak. We leak
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:42.080]  back in there. They try to keep them controlled. We get the info too. And Dr. Steve Pachennick,
[1:58:42.080 --> 1:58:43.760]  thank you so much. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:51.600]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying and more importantly,
[1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:57.520]  what they're actually doing, when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[1:58:57.520 --> 1:59:03.360]  that was a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress information because
[1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:08.080]  they've also been on record saying coming up on election day and thereafter, they're not going to
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:13.520]  let anyone but quote authoritative sources. That means CNN, New York Times, what a joke, come out
[1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:18.160]  and say who the real winner is. That way they can contest the election, even though Trump's
[1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:22.800]  declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots, then cause a constitutional crisis,
[1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:27.760]  halt for secession and have the UN come in and declare the election for Biden. This is what
[1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:32.400]  John Podesta and others are on record saying. And so when you see them in concert, censoring
[1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:37.360]  something like the Hunter Biden laptop story, that is a drill, that is a test to get all their
[1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:42.640]  systems ready, but also to condition the public that Big Tech works in unison to suppress speech
[1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:56.000]  and information. This is election meddling 101, this is illegal. Welcome back, hour number three.
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:09.760]  All right, you guys have been holding the next person quickly wanting to get to everybody.
[2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:18.560]  Let's talk to Roxy in Florida. Roxy, thank you for calling. What do you think is really going
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:23.360]  down? So much. I just want to thank you for making Endgame because if you hadn't made Endgame, you
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:32.880]  never would have woke me up. First of all, my gut instinct tells me that we may actually have
[2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:40.400]  a Harris Biden administration. And I didn't say that to be cute. I said that on purpose.
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:47.520]  And the reason I say this is because a lot of women I've been speaking to have revealed
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:55.040]  in talking that they know Biden's denial. And because of what happened with Hillary,
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:02.560]  they feel like the way to get a woman president, which they feel the United States isn't ready for,
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:09.200]  which is totally not the case. It just has to be the right woman would be to circumvent Joe Biden
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:16.160]  completely and, you know, vote for Biden Harris so that he goes and eventually does whatever he
[2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:21.200]  does, plays Mahjong and puts on his slippers and watches Terry Mason and she's in control.
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:25.600]  Well, that's it. And the Democrats have even said, oh, he's a placeholder. When I don't care,
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:30.720]  it was a black guy, a white woman, a black lady, a dude, an old guy, as long as they're competent
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:35.120]  and aren't traders who she's a horrible person. Just like she's not as bad as Hillary, but she's
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.520]  almost as bad. I guess she hasn't had real power yet. So we'll see. But absolutely, this is all
[2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:46.160]  about a woman president and women fetishizing that as an reflected glory, her being president and a
[2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:52.320]  chai con puppet is not going to help women. That's crazy. And then my other thing is,
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.240]  I keep in my spirit, I keep getting a discernment and I've been having this since about May.
[2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:02.400]  What happens if we do are the states in the union do to see? People don't stop and think, well,
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:09.040]  we're fighting like idiots. The left-right paradigm is complete garbage. It really is.
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:14.880]  That the Hegelian dialectic and anyone who knows it, who listens to your show and is
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:20.560]  somewhat literate and can read a paper should be able to see through that.
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:31.520]  Now, the point that I'm trying to make is that if he does win, we need beans,
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:38.000]  bullets, and band-aids. And you need to be ready. You need to start getting physically fit. If you
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.520]  haven't been, you should have been a long time ago. And you need to know your state's constitution,
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:52.000]  as well as the actual constitution, because what it's going to take is going to be an actual push
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:57.360]  back of the people. Absolutely. We've never pushed back. And so here's what happened. You had
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:03.120]  Republicans and Democrats sharing power the last 50, 60 years and selling the country out to foreign
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:08.000]  interest. And then finally, they just sold out to the Chinese and globalists to be their new boss.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.280]  They weren't just selling out interest. They sold out completely to them. And then Trump came along,
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:17.600]  took over the Republican Party partially with a populist movement. That's why, you know, 10 years
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:21.840]  ago, I wouldn't Republican or Democrat because both parties were so bad. Trump is a populist
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:25.360]  attempt to take over to get the country back. And that's why everybody should get behind him.
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:32.480]  God bless you. Yeah. People like to buy into hype. And there's a lot of guys, a lot of women,
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:38.560]  you name it, that have bought into this and they are destroying their own interest. And Trump is
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.120]  in serious danger, folks. And he's in serious danger of losing. And remember, I'm the guy
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:48.800]  that told you he was going to win when nobody else did. I guess Ann Coulter said it before I did.
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:55.600]  I was like the second and I was sure of it. My gut's never wrong because it's just thousands
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:59.200]  of data points integrated into the subconscious and then the spirit makes the decision.
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:06.000]  If they held the election today, Trump's going to lose because of massive fraud.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:13.680]  He's got to get his points way up above her, not just 5, 10 points, 15, 20 points to beat the fraud.
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:20.560]  And then again, even if he wins by just overwhelming landslide, they're going to contest it, folks.
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:26.080]  So just anywhere you slice it, this is a foreign outside takeover of the country, literally.
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:33.520]  I mean, the sense of foreboding and doom I have has never been, I mean, it's overwhelming.
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:37.600]  And by the way, it's very exhilarating. I'm not like scared here. I'm like ready for war.
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:42.240]  I'm ready to, you know, I mean, metaphysically, I feel like I've got battle axes in both hands.
[2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:52.480]  So, I mean, and China's about to invade Taiwan. I mean, it's on, folks. It's on. It's on. It's on.
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:58.400]  Get right with Jesus is all I can tell you. Everything we talked about is coming down now,
[2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:04.400]  baby. And there's a normalcy bias in the military, a normalcy bias in the Justice Department,
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:07.760]  the average person in the Justice Department, it's not a traitor. They're just kind of ho hum,
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:12.880]  a Republican or a Democrat. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, martial law. Oh, sure. The chai comes. Oh,
[2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:18.560]  sure. And then boom, reality slaps right in on you like a meteorite. Extending the dinosaurs.
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:22.960]  I mean, it's bam. All right, so I got to take all these calls. It was a great call.
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:26.480]  Let's talk to Patrick in Boston. Patrick, your take on the situation.
[2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:33.040]  Hey, man, I was wondering why you were so upset about Hunter Biden's sexual interpride.
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:38.720]  I don't know what that because he's being blackmailed by the communist Chinese and of
[2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:44.000]  this underage that's that those are children of my business. What he does with his penis
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:49.680]  unless I'm sitting in his lap. Sir, sir, sir, just a second. You're like a seminar caller.
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:54.640]  This doesn't sound like a fair deal here to me. They admit these emails are real now. So I don't
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:58.720]  think. Well, first off, do you deny that emails are real or do the Russians make them up? Let me
[2:05:58.720 --> 2:06:04.080]  ask that question. I don't know if they are and you don't know either. Excuse me. We have the
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:08.320]  repair shop. We have the emails. We have the emails from the lawyer. They're not denying it.
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:14.560]  Use you at all because I don't think you're you're being in a reasonable arbiter right now.
[2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:20.720]  Let me ask you this. In the emails, it says to Burisma, we want the investigation covered up.
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:25.360]  We'll give you $30 million. I mean, it says it right there. Yeah. Do you know those are true?
[2:06:26.880 --> 2:06:31.760]  Did you hear me that the FBI had the laptop confirmed that it was Hunter Biden's
[2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:37.520]  and there were a pair shops released the emails with lawyers? You know, you know damn well that
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:45.920]  the FBI has not confirmed anything. No, they've confirmed they had the laptop. It's being harangued
[2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:53.600]  by. You're trying to call into this show and gaslight us that that Hunter Biden and his dad.
[2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:59.040]  Okay. Did his dad get up on C span and say that they were investigating us so I went and said,
[2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:02.480]  I won't give you a million bucks and they fired the prosecutor. Listen to me, boy.
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:10.560]  We're done with you. We're done with you, boy. You're the punk. Okay. You think you call in here
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:15.360]  and gaslight my audience. You don't do that. You're a joke. If I had more time, I'd keep you
[2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:21.360]  on but I got to get to other callers. Unbelievable. That's who these guys think they are. They think
[2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:27.280]  they're chomping you. They think they're smarter than you. The Bidens are degenerate scum.
[2:07:28.240 --> 2:07:32.640]  All the one side of China deals. They sold our country out. They're enemies of the Republic.
[2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:38.560]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in California. Nick, thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hi, Alex.
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:44.240]  Hi, Alex. I wanted to say my mentor reminds me often, never stop an ego on its way to
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:50.080]  self-destruction. It doesn't need your help. And the way I see it is that America's ego
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:56.400]  that's been lulled back to sleep in the wake of Renee's propaganda is destructive. But the good
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:00.400]  thing is, is that what follows an unhealthy ego's collapse is a formation of a healthy,
[2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:05.600]  mature ego, which is people waking up. I agree. But if we have a collapsing third world, the
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:12.560]  nuclear weapons, the collapse of the ego makes it kill us. I guess no comment there. You're
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:16.480]  right. You think about the danger of that. But what do you think of the last guy? He says,
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:22.400]  the Bidens would have said this was fake up front if it was fake. They have said nothing.
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:25.440]  Now we have the lawyers' emails. The FBI admitted they had the laptop.
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:31.280]  I have nothing to say about the last guy. I mean, I don't even know why he's listening to your show
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:34.720]  if he's going to call and harass. But what he said is everything. Well, I mean, I want to
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.320]  spend more time with the guy. I just got to get to other calls. But it's just the arrogance and
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:46.480]  the con game. Like I was some 70 IQ, 14-year-old girl he'd picked up at a bus stop. This laptop
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:50.640]  is about underage girls. That's illegal. Even if you're a Democrat, they should have some basic
[2:08:50.640 --> 2:08:55.920]  decency. Yeah. And that's why I have a problem with early voting, because people who already
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:09:00.400]  voted for Biden, they can't take their vote back once they see that a hundred Bidens are a child
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:05.200]  molester. That's how they get around the October surprises, don't they? Is they have what most
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:09.440]  of the ballots have already been passed? Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Like 30 million.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:14.160]  Yeah. Got all money. Mostly for Biden. Nick, what else do you think is going to happen as America
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:21.120]  self-destructs? I don't have much comment about what's going to happen in America. I have a lot
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:26.000]  of comment about people not really understanding who they are and what they are and how they got
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:30.320]  programmed to be what they are. Like for instance, we don't even have rates of passage anymore in
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:35.360]  this country. So a lot of boys who are, you know, or should I say adults, we're just still boys.
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:38.560]  You know, we went from high school to a high job. Hey, let's talk about this. You didn't go through
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:42.080]  rights of passage. I didn't go through some of the rights of passage. I mean, what you mean by
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:46.240]  that? We come back to Nick, then Michael, Gavin, Zach, Brett, and others. It's taken me two and a
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:52.960]  half years to finally even be able to convince Congress and the rest of the world that we were
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:58.880]  only the initial target to set the precedent for a coordinated big tech censorship. Now the world
[2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:04.240]  finally understands it. But we don't have two and a half years for the learning curve to take place
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:11.520]  this time. Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying lockdown is permanent. It is a plan to lower
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:18.160]  carbon footprint. It is a plan to make the world population poor. It is a diabolical power grab.
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:23.120]  It is a revolution against the industrial revolution. They call it the post-industrial world.
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:28.240]  And it's the excuse for them to take control of every facet of our lives and implement absolute
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:32.880]  authoritarianism. So again, to everybody out there, if you love your children or my daughter
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:37.760]  that just woke up here, and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get awake,
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:11:01.760]  you need to understand this information, you need to warn others, okay? It's a life and death situation.

[2:11:48.720 --> 2:12:01.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:13.760]  Arrested Development.
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:19.680]  Arrested Development. That's what Nick's talking about. Now they say the new age of adults, it's 25.
[2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:23.760]  It'll be 30. We're all going to be locked in our houses because of COVID. The robots will take care
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:29.040]  of us. This is a post-human world the elite are building in their own words. So what are you getting
[2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:33.600]  at about how people break out of that and then refine those rites of passage?
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.720]  All right. What I have to say about that from what I've been taught by my mentors is that first
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:45.200]  people have to understand what they are made of, in terms of paradigm, not in terms of biology,
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:48.960]  but in terms of their paradigms. You have animal nature and you have human nature.
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:53.760]  And a lot of people say that humans are basically good. Well, that would be true if we were in our
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:58.080]  human nature, which has access to good because of choice. But a lot of people are stuck in their
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:02.960]  animal nature, which if you look at children, children are animals. Basically, they're developmental
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:07.040]  narcissists. It's me, me, me, me, me. So when their parents get divorced, they take it personally.
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:12.320]  Of course, they're developmental narcissists. Well, without a rite of passage that takes a person
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:18.720]  that puts that person on a path to facing courage, facing all their fears and going for what they
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:22.320]  want. Exactly. They got to face fears. They got to be on a mission. They've got to have a kinship.
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:25.040]  They've got to experience something bigger than themselves.
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:31.120]  Right. Without that experience, they're still children. They're still essentially, excuse me,
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:36.800]  girls with penises, right? That's what boys are before they had adolescence. They're
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:41.280]  prepubescent. They're basically girls with penises. Now, what that means is they don't have that
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:48.720]  protector, that provider, that defender. They don't have those instincts. So those things
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:56.080]  are not to be known. Let's go further. Those are epigenetical, compressed books in the genome
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:02.320]  that the brain's connected to. Rites of passage are trigger points to open those. Women have
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:08.240]  rites of passage. Men have them. By removing the ancient rites, they have shuttered development
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:12.400]  and basically like whole weapon systems. I mean, as I've gone through rites of passage and there
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:16.480]  are more, not just being a boy into a man, then there's the father, then there's, he goes up.
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:22.000]  It's like one day you finally wake up. You have all these dreams and all this stuff. And it's like,
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:27.920]  it's like armories of understanding of weapons. I don't mean like weapons to kill people,
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:32.240]  but just, it's like you start getting so much knowledge. It's incredible. And I hear what
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:36.400]  you're saying, brother. It's so real. And that's the difference between God and the devil. The
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:41.040]  devil is a force that doesn't want you to expand. God wants you to have everything. But God had to
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:46.080]  give you free will so you have that opportunity. So you got to go with God, go with God and get
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:52.960]  behind me, Satan while I love Viacindios. All right, let's go ahead and talk. This has been
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:15:00.160]  holding the longest now. That would be Michael in Texas. Michael, you're on the air. Oh,
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:05.120]  do you hear me? Yes, go ahead. I just want to talk about, you know, I've been seeing a lot of
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:11.120]  people, a lot of Christian people that I believe are good intention, but they're still thinking
[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:14.880]  about, you know, they're, they don't like Trump or they want to vote for Biden because, you know,
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:19.200]  they think they want to act morally superior and say, oh, he's terrible, but he's better than Biden.
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:23.760]  No, he's incredible champion that's been through hell. And you should back him, get persecuted
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:30.800]  for it. You damn cowards. And I especially want to speak to pastors and things, you know,
[2:15:30.800 --> 2:15:38.080]  posting things about don't, you know, go into conspiracy theories. And the Bible is real.
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:43.680]  It's true. It's God's word. And you can test it. You can question it. And God's not afraid of our
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:51.040]  questioning. So it's the devil that always says don't work into the details. Exactly. The devils
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:56.400]  in the details and the devil never wants you to look at details. Absolutely. I have a couple
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:00.720]  of things that I've noticed in the scripture that hopefully people can share. I know, you know,
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:05.200]  everybody is listening to the show, probably knows, but you have friends at your church that,
[2:16:05.200 --> 2:16:10.480]  you know, I know people that won't listen to, won't watch a video of Alex Jones. But, you know,
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:20.000]  if you share with them from the Bible in Genesis 47, Pharaoh had a dream about seven years of great
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:25.280]  harvest and then seven years of famine. Joseph interpreted that dream as the prime minister.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.840]  They did not share that information with the people. They kept that themselves.
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:36.800]  They as a government stockpiled food. And then they were able to sell it back to the people.
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:40.880]  And then in following years, the people had to sell their life. Oh yeah. That goes back to the
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:46.240]  dream of the prophet in Egypt. Remember that? Yeah. Of the seven years of fat, the seven years of
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:53.760]  skinny. So if people don't think that that story has been around for 5000 years, you don't think
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:57.440]  that you know, I was talking, I was talking to a high power Democrat to show you how evil these
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:02.960]  people are. About a month ago, how I had to meet with because of some issues. And I was meeting
[2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:09.280]  with the local Democrat Mafia head. And he said, he said, Alex, what's going on was done 4000 years
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:15.760]  ago in Egypt with the, with the seven days of plenty and the seven days of seven years of famine.
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:19.440]  And I was just like, they already know all this. They've just decided to be on the other side.
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:25.520]  You believe that? Yeah. So it's funny you called about that because that, yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:32.800]  Oh, no, but people who won't believe that a government or powerful organizations will cause
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:39.840]  a famine or a plague or whether it's real or not, in order to gain the benefits of that,
[2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:43.280]  you know, they had a whole country sell themselves into slavery in the Bible.
[2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:49.200]  Well, look, look at Pharaoh, they went and dug up the Sanskrit and the hieroglyphs.
[2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:52.960]  It's true what's in Genesis and what's later in Exodus and all that.
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:59.200]  But Pharaohs in Exodus ordered the first born of the Israelites killed as a way to just call off boys.
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:03.360]  They don't want too many boys because they don't want warriors. They want women they can control.
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:08.000]  Nothing gets women. It's a fact. And so you're absolutely right. God bless you.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:12.400]  I appreciate your call. Amazing points. And by the way, folks can sit there and say,
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:16.080]  oh, you should never meet with the Democrats. You know, that's evil. No, it's not. I never
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:20.480]  compromise one bit. I mean, they say in the Bible that God meets with the devil.
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:23.840]  The devil and I'm not saying I'm God. I'm saying it's an allegory. The devil has to go up and
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:28.320]  ask God for remission for things. I will absolutely meet with the enemy. They want to meet with me.
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:33.920]  I've met with two representatives of the top billionaires. I've met with the enemy repeatedly.
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:38.000]  I've got meetings with the enemy going on right now on the East Coast.
[2:18:39.680 --> 2:18:44.240]  And I encourage the enemy to stop and give up and reject Satan and embrace Christ,
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:47.600]  but they won't because they're of their father, the devil, the synagogue of Satan.
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:53.360]  But that's what this comes down to. This is very real. And they know it. The devil can quote
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:59.520]  scripture all day long. They know it better than we do. They know these are people that decided to join it.
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:09.120]  Because they don't believe in you. They think you're losers. They think that they're really
[2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:15.600]  going to become gods and merge with machines and escape this. But I look at Soros and Stelter and
[2:19:15.600 --> 2:19:23.040]  and and and and all of these people and I see losers. I see that there's nobody home but an evil force.
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:28.320]  I look into God fearing people. They could be black. They could be Hispanic, old, young, Asian.
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:34.560]  And I see intelligence in goodness and love. And I see their spirit. And then I see these
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:40.640]  people arrogant and fake and empty and alone. Thank God. I don't have eyes like Newsome or AOC.
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:47.360]  I mean, put them back up there. Look at their eyes. That ain't human, folks. Look at Schiff.
[2:19:47.360 --> 2:19:53.840]  Look at Pelosi. Look at David Hogg. Look at Dershowitz. Look at the Aurora shooter.
[2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:59.840]  They all got that satisfied, weird, sick look. Look at Cuomo.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:08.160]  Look at him. Look at Stephen Colbert. That's the most evil all I'm right there. Look at that face.
[2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:14.080]  That is that is none of this world. All right. We got a special guest that got beat up in San
[2:20:14.080 --> 2:20:20.080]  Francisco on Saturday. We're having an event. He's a well-spoken nice black man. We have a free
[2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:26.000]  speech event. So he got his one of his teeth totally knocked out. He just he's a tough guy too.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:30.880]  Very Christlike. He just takes the beating. I'm not as strong as he is. I got it going crazy.
[2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:34.560]  I get so mad. You knocked my front teeth out. God, you're dead. You're dead.
[2:20:34.560 --> 2:20:38.800]  I'll beat your brains out. He didn't know. He's a better man than I. He took it. We're right back.
[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:10.400]  Just two weeks off from the election and we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:15.520]  and triple patriot points to your next order. Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, additional
[2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:19.840]  10% off. That makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders. Now, we have had a big
[2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:24.000]  clearance sale going. So a lot of stuff sold out while the other stuff is close to selling out.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:27.760]  Well, some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually come back in to
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:32.400]  stock. And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things that
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:36.320]  have actually sold out. So those should be back in stock as well soon. Thank you so much for
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:40.240]  keeping info wars on the year. Obviously, we're critical of the fight and you've helped win
[2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:46.160]  the war against the global so far. Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:50.000]  Are you sleeping too well at night? Is your city too safe?
[2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:58.880]  Well, not anymore. Introducing Democrats. Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your
[2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:06.240]  neighborhood with violence, looting, rampant violence and even homelessness. The secret
[2:22:06.240 --> 2:22:12.960]  is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity. No more pesky lawn order.
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:18.240]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats,
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:24.480]  sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground. But wait, vote for Democrats now and
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:31.200]  bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:34.960]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:49.520]  2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time, you've got to save right there in your browser
[2:22:49.520 --> 2:22:55.760]  and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms. Most importantly,
[2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:03.360]  via text message, email or by word of mouth because they have banned the links to ban.video.
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:09.840]  But 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos,
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:16.320]  we can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring because the power of the
[2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:20.480]  people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out and since he's going
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:24.720]  to take action, once reelected, he gets big tech and then he's modern in the situation.
[2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:27.920]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit here and cry
[2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:32.080]  because he has to take an action. We the people are taking action now and you can do it very,
[2:23:32.080 --> 2:23:37.040]  very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com and checking out the new
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:49.600]  redesigned infomores.com and sharing that link. Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:11.840]  Hollywood, radical Islam, the pedophile lobby are striking against our Republic.
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:16.560]  The many people who've been asleep have been awakened by what they've seen
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:22.880]  and humanity is coming together, coming together with our red blood and our humanity that unifies
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:29.040]  us against the globalist onslaught. We're going to go to our guest who I really appreciate joining
[2:24:29.040 --> 2:24:32.720]  us here in a moment. I'm going to show some of the videos of him being brutally beaten
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:38.080]  for trying to have a free speech rally and to support President Trump in the new fascist
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:44.720]  Communist Command Center of San Francisco. But here's a video of hundreds of young Black American
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:49.600]  activists marching saying we want Trump. This has been banned off Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[2:24:49.600 --> 2:25:05.280]  Go ahead and roll it with audio. Here it is.
[2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:16.880]  It goes on and on. So that's people beating the mind control. That's just being silenced on the
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:22.720]  Internet. But our guest here, and I'll do the next hour and take your calls for Zach and Noah
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:27.440]  and Brett. Everybody hold on. I'll get to you. I love you. Philip Anderson has been completely
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:31.600]  de-platformed after he was physically attacked. That's the other part. He didn't just get his teeth
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:36.880]  knocked out. He also has been de-platformed. Banned on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, just hours
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:43.360]  after Antifa, knocked his teeth out. He defended the Portland court office by stopping two riots
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:49.200]  importantly stood in between Antifa BLM and the police in Louisville, Kentucky, and protected the
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:53.440]  police from them. And then he was in San Francisco when this happened. And he's being absolutely
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:59.680]  destroyed by these people. He's got a website that we'll put on screen for you, but hadn't been
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:05.360]  updated. He's got a new site. We'll tell you about a moment. TeamSafeAmerica.com. What a great name.
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:10.240]  We ought to work with this guy and try to help him. TeamSafeAmerica.com. He's got to go fund me.
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:15.200]  Everybody should support, help Philip Anderson fix his teeth. And his friend that got attacked,
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:19.920]  Mark and Gina assaulted at San Francisco Rally. And again, they bankrupt you. They take your bank
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:26.960]  accounts. They take everything from you. Hashtag TeamSafeAmerica. But he joins us here in just a
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:32.720]  moment. Let's roll the videos, though, first for TV viewers, radio listeners. These are all over
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:37.520]  the place on infowords.com. They've been blocked online because victims can't be shown to the left.
[2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:41.840]  Philip Anderson has his teeth knocked out at Free Speech Rally. We'll play that.
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:47.840]  And then we cut to him talking about what happened next. And his message is Joe Biden. Here it is.
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:27:15.200]  He's got to be hit the hardest. And so that's a white dude knocking a black kid's teeth out. That's
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:21.280]  a good thing, according to the left. He still gives a speech with his tooth knocked out. Then
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:29.600]  they attack him again. It just goes on and on. It's too bad. This is what happens when you lose
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:48.000]  these people. This is what happens when you lose your teeth. Take a good look. Take a good look. You knocked the black man's teeth out. You knocked my teeth out. But you're here to say a black wise matter. You knocked my teeth out of my mouth. That makes no sense. Look! Look at what you did.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:56.480]  He's $2,000 a day to fix that bare metal. What are you trying to do, sir? You're trying to kill me.
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:03.200]  Hey, Joe Biden. I have a question for you, Joe Biden. You said that Antifa is just an idea.
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:11.120]  This is what the idea you're talking about, Antifa? This is what they did to me. I'm at the hospital right
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:16.960]  now, Joe Biden, because we're Antifa. So I just want to ask you, do you still think, after seeing this,
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:23.520]  that they're just an idea? Okay. I want you to answer that question, Joe Biden. It's Antifa.
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:30.560]  Antifa, just an idea. All the folks shot and kill. All the police kill. People shot at checkpoints.
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:34.960]  Phillip Anderson is an amazing guy. I've seen his work for a while. What called you to travel
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:38.480]  around the country and stand up for freedom and describe what happened to you, brother? We really
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:42.160]  appreciate you and hope you get your teeth fixed, my friend, because yeah, I guess you lost the other
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:49.520]  tooth now. Can you hear me out? I can, sir. Good to have you on. Hey, man. I'm so thankful to be here.
[2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:55.760]  It's unbelievable that I'm the victim of a hate crime. And even though on top of being a black man
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:01.360]  and being the victim of a hate crime, just hours after Democrats knocked out my teeth,
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:06.560]  made this vicious hate crime against me, they completely de-platformed me just because I was
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:12.160]  going viral and it made them look bad. Yeah. How would Jack Dorsey like his little teeth knocked out
[2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:17.120]  and then he'd be platformed? Is there little murdering big tech criminals that push this and
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:22.000]  allow it? Jack Dorsey and others are guilty of what they've done to you and all the dead people.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:28.880]  And one day they're going to get retribution. It's true. And what I had to say to Info Wars
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:34.160]  and to the where you go one, you go all crowd and especially Nick Fuentes and Groy for Army,
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:38.880]  it's time to protest big tech. Time to protest big tech at all their headquarters. Facebook,
[2:29:38.880 --> 2:29:44.400]  Instagram, Twitter. I put the last video I posted before they banned me. They watched that video
[2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:49.360]  and they immediately banned me on Twitter. They banned me on Facebook. They banned me on Instagram.
[2:29:49.360 --> 2:29:53.280]  All together they got to silence the victim. I should have said that up front. After you're
[2:29:53.280 --> 2:29:57.920]  physically attacked, they then silence you. Yeah. I didn't do anything wrong. I mean,
[2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:02.560]  the attacker is guilty. I just got my teeth knocked out and if I was a Democrat,
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:06.800]  I'd be the next Black Lives Matter martyr. I'd be Breonna Taylor, but just because I'm Republican,
[2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:11.200]  they treat me like I'm a slave. They knock my teeth out and they ban me completely off the
[2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:15.520]  internet. This is unacceptable. They committed a hate crime against me. Literal hate crime.
[2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:19.360]  And that's what the guy's getting charged with. The guy who knocked my teeth out has been arrested
[2:30:19.360 --> 2:30:25.760]  by San Francisco police. They called me yesterday last night. And I just can't believe it because
[2:30:25.760 --> 2:30:30.400]  when Instagram banned me, I posted a video. That's exactly what they did out right in that picture.
[2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:35.520]  This is me off, man, because this is real fascism. This is real evil.
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:39.760]  Exactly. And that's the whole point of having the free speech rally. They showed us that we're
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:44.400]  not even allowed to have the free speech rally. Okay. They shut it down and they couldn't tell
[2:30:44.400 --> 2:30:48.320]  us why they shut it down. Well, you're not a little guy. You obviously, I could see you when
[2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:51.840]  they knocked your teeth out. You made the decision. You kind of got, for a minute,
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:55.920]  like you were about to, you, you got your fist in a ball and you decided not to fight back.
[2:30:55.920 --> 2:31:02.560]  Why'd you do that? The reason why is because I saw a white guy there. I knew for a fact
[2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:06.080]  that they were going to murder him. They're just going to kill him. And that's what put my arm
[2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:10.000]  around him. Because I knew that this guy was a good guy, not just because I saw him wearing
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:13.440]  infill wars gear, you know, because I know right off the bat, those are good people. They don't
[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:18.800]  throw the first punch. They just defend themselves. But I already know what Antifa does. They target
[2:31:18.800 --> 2:31:23.440]  white people who are wearing anything that's pro maga, you know, pro infill wars, literally just
[2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:27.280]  pro America and they beat the living hell out of them. I said, that's not acceptable. That's
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:32.320]  racist. That's the same racism that black people had to go through in the fifties and sixties.
[2:31:32.320 --> 2:31:36.560]  That's what white people have to go through right now. I completely condemn and disavow
[2:31:36.560 --> 2:31:42.560]  any type of hateful action like that against white people. It's not acceptable. I'm disgusted by it.
[2:31:42.560 --> 2:31:46.320]  And just because I try to protect that white man, this is what they did to me.
[2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:51.280]  This is how much they hate. Let's describe how that started. They were trying to get him first,
[2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:56.240]  right? And then they came to get you. Yeah, put my arm around him to protect him. And then out
[2:31:56.240 --> 2:32:00.640]  of nowhere, someone comes behind me and punches me from the back. And then right there, he punches
[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:05.200]  me a second time in the mouth. He won't even let me talk to him and say, dude, why did you punch
[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:10.640]  me? I'm just trying to walk into my own event. And that's what this attendee and to the event,
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:15.920]  because there's a lot of people who actually came out. The news is lying. All the Antifa
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:21.760]  and BLM people there, mostly Antifa, they decided to lock all the people who are trying to enter
[2:32:21.760 --> 2:32:27.280]  the event with Gina and Mark Lopez and the GoFundMe you guys saw at the beginning of this video.
[2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:30.960]  They practically broke his leg. They had to take him on a stretch to the hospitals,
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:35.600]  but please be sure to donate. But that's a Latino man. They also attacked his Latino wife.
[2:32:36.480 --> 2:32:41.200]  Let's talk about this. Americans every day are getting maimed and killed to simply speak
[2:32:42.240 --> 2:32:46.000]  support of the president in America. This is so sick. This is so sad.
[2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:50.320]  In the whole reason, I'm sorry, when the police, when that guy punched you in the mouth,
[2:32:50.320 --> 2:32:53.920]  the police should have gone with their billy clubs and arrested that guy.
[2:32:53.920 --> 2:32:59.040]  I mean, it's absolutely disgusting. The reason why they're afraid to do that house,
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:02.240]  because you've seen the Black Lives Matter movement, you see how they're willing to burn
[2:33:02.240 --> 2:33:07.920]  down entire city. Oh, it's all backed by all the billionaires. Yeah, they would use any footage
[2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:12.240]  of those guys going in, trying to get justice for a black man, getting his teeth knocked out,
[2:33:12.240 --> 2:33:16.400]  and they would turn it on the police. You see police officers going to the billy clubs and
[2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:21.200]  they say, oh, peaceful protesters were just attacked by the police. I know at some point,
[2:33:21.200 --> 2:33:24.560]  we got to not give a damn about what happens, but I get it. All right, let's come back and talk
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:28.240]  about where all this is going. My God, this is unbelievable. Phillip Andersen is here at
[2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:36.880]  TensaveAmerica.com. I tell you, man, God, I love my team. That's the money. Not my front teeth,
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:41.040]  I don't mind it. I just, I just, what a horrible situation this country's in.
[2:33:42.160 --> 2:33:46.320]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election,
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:51.680]  and the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:56.320]  them. The whole planet is a huge populist realignment. And so they've openly said,
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:01.760]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking
[2:34:01.760 --> 2:34:07.440]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda. And they're on record saying that once
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:12.720]  they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us
[2:34:12.720 --> 2:34:18.480]  and put us all in prison. This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying. It's what the Obama
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:22.640]  bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman's saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:30.080]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep the lockdowns going
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:35.200]  forever and forced inoculations. Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and the same vaccines will be
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:40.720]  voluntary. Donald Trump or die. You've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:45.680]  and tell your family to vote now. Black Friday in October. Last year, that was one of our most
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:51.280]  popular sales that we ran in the last couple of weeks of October. And it was popular for a reason.
[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:57.920]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October. And that means 30 to 60
[2:34:57.920 --> 2:35:02.720]  percent off, store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points. That's 15 percent off your next
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:06.400]  order. And everybody that signs up for auto shipping, additional 10 percent off. That makes
[2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:10.960]  many of these items lost leaders. Now, a lot of stuff sold out. Some of our best sellers are still
[2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:16.000]  there. But some good news. Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:20.080]  and minerals and amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses.
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:25.920]  It is back and stocked back on sale today, which is two weeks to the election. And more good news.
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:32.000]  Ultra 12. It's got the name Ultra for a reason. Highest quality vitamin B12. Take it under.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:37.040]  The tongue for full absorption. It is now back in stock. Both of those are 50 percent off at
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:41.600]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com Black Friday comes in October.
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:50.240]  InfoWars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:56.640]  tyranny. You built InfoWars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products.
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:02.720]  You called in. You made recommendations. InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine. And that's why
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:08.080]  the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack,
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:14.000]  in many ways, we've become stronger. With band.video, redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:21.280]  with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day, we are the resistance.
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:26.720]  You are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:31.520]  spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built

[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:48.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:38:07.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:15.040]  front lines of the Info War. All right, folks. Well, we just had our whole systems shut down.
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:21.040]  We had backups kick in. We were warned about this, but a lot of stuff's going on behind the scenes.
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:24.880]  We're going to go back to our guests in a minute as soon as we get the power back up fully here
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:29.840]  in the studio. But here's Keith Overman saying he wants to arrest everybody and put us in prisons
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:33.520]  as a horrible authoritarian piece of filth. Here's this enemy combatant that thinks,
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:36.960]  here's this Chycom agent who thinks he owns you and your family. Here he is.
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:45.680]  Trump can be and must be expunged. The hate he has triggered, the Pandora's box he has opened,
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:53.120]  they will not be so easily destroyed. So let us brace ourselves. The task is twofold.
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:58.560]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box,
[2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:04.720]  and then he and his enablers and his supporters and his collaborators and the Mike Lee's and
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:09.760]  the William Barr's and the Sean Hannities and the Mike Pence's and the Rudy Giuliani's and the
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:16.320]  Kyle Rittenhouse's and the Amy Coney Barris must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our
[2:39:16.320 --> 2:39:23.840]  society while we try to rebuild it and to rebuild the world Trump has nearly destroyed by turning
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:31.600]  it over to a virus. Remember, even as we dream of a return to reality and safety and the country
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:37.360]  for which our forefathers died, that the fight is not just to win an election but to win it by
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:45.200]  enough to chase at least for a moment Trump and the maggots off the stage and then try to clean
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:50.960]  up what they left. Remember it, even though to remember it means remembering that the fight
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:56.400]  does not end November 3rd, but in many ways will only begin that day.
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:40:03.520]  Alright, this is like the science fiction movie or the Star Trek or Star Wars where the millennium
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:09.600]  Balkans on fire and stuff's going off and lights are flashing and nothing's working. I got briefed
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:14.080]  about two weeks ago by folks that are hooked in with Homeland Security and the Pentagon and they
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:22.320]  said, Alex, you already know this, you've got the maps. We're getting hit with 100 times, 200
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:27.520]  times any previous attacks, cyber attacks, cell towers are going on all over the US, banks are
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:31.760]  getting hacked into, everything's going crazy, they're trying to bring down the dollar, they're
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:35.200]  trying to bring down the United States. So when we have a technical difficulty, I don't always
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:41.360]  just blame it on that but we're having daily hacks, daily infrastructure attacks and now we're told
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:47.680]  the next thing would be our power grid and our studio. Mike Adams was briefed by some of the
[2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:54.160]  same people, he said that yesterday when he was on. So we have full backups, we have everything
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:59.200]  plugged in, everything right, but this just happened and I mean, you ought to see it,
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:06.720]  like a half a billion requests a minute, fake requests to info wars and I've been asked by
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:11.680]  IT people not to show you our stuff so people know what to hit, but they're not just hitting us,
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:19.040]  they're hitting everybody. America is at war right now. So Philip Anderson, going back to you,
[2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:23.360]  physically had your teeth knocked out, then Andy was through bottles of water at you while you
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:28.880]  tried to finish your speech. This is such an historic time. Talk about yourself. What got
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:33.440]  you engaged? Who are you? Because you're a great guy. What made you go out and travel the country
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:37.520]  and stand up for free speech? Was it just something at a gut level, spiritual? What was it?
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:43.360]  Alex, you're the reason why I saw they wrongfully banned you and at first people like, oh, it's
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:47.440]  just one guy doesn't matter. I'm like, you guys are being real dumb. They're going to ban us all.
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:50.800]  It doesn't matter where your skin color is. It doesn't matter what your religion is. It doesn't
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:56.000]  matter whatever they're going to take you out. The second you have an idea that they don't agree
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:59.840]  with and they don't want spread and they know that you have the ability to effectively spread
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:03.920]  that idea. You're the man who got President Donald Trump elected. I don't care what people say,
[2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:07.760]  that's the fact. You know, statistics, the numbers, they don't lie. You're the man.
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:11.760]  And they took you out because of that. They don't want Americans to have the right to free speech.
[2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:16.000]  They took away your free speech right, Alex. They took away your right to peacefully protest.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:20.960]  Now they did the same thing to me. Now I don't have the right to organize and peacefully protest.
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:24.960]  Now I don't have free speech. I've been completely de-platformed off the internet and all I have
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:30.880]  left is a website. I'm the exact same as you. And they say, oh, Alex Jones leads this racist white
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:35.120]  guy. I'm a black guy. I got my teeth knocked out. I'm the victim of a hate crime. And they just did
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:40.720]  the same thing to me. This proves that what they did to Alex Jones is not justifiable. It's a
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:46.320]  political agenda. And these social media platforms claim protections because they claim to be
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:50.400]  neutral platforms and they get these protections. And here's the whole problem.
[2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:56.480]  All I said was Americans have the right to free speech and they have the right to peaceful protest.
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:43:01.120]  Big tech thinks that you're slaves. Twitter, Instagram and Facebook think that you all are
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:07.040]  slaves. They are wrong. I posted that video saying that. Now I'm the victim of a hate crime and how
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:12.240]  they did just ban me on Instagram and how they're going to ban me on Twitter and Facebook in the
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:18.080]  morning. And the only thing I got wrong is that they ban me one hour after I posted that video.
[2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:22.720]  That's what's so incredible is you're a free speech guy. You're giving a loving speech.
[2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:28.640]  You don't fight back. And then they can't have a victim of their evil. So they disappear you
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:33.600]  like they buried you in a nameless grave. I mean, they would they support communist China
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:38.160]  what they're doing. I mean, Jack Dorsey, all these guys are really monsters, aren't they?
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:43.200]  They really are. Hey, Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg. Can you look at this right here?
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:47.920]  These are my teeth. I don't know. Right. Here we go. These right here. You know, these are my
[2:43:47.920 --> 2:43:53.440]  teeth. I'm trying to get it like in the middle. There we go. Yeah, these are my two front teeth.
[2:43:53.440 --> 2:43:59.040]  And I want to know, I just see in my two front teeth here, you know, why did you ban me? Why did
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:04.000]  you completely do platform me? My teeth were literally knocked out of my mouth. Mark Zuckerberg,
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:10.400]  why did you ban me? Well, let me tell you a story. Heinrich Himmler was the head of the SS,
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:15.680]  but he'd never been in the military, never killed anybody. He was a member of the royal
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:20.800]  family low level and a chicken farmer. But Hitler hired him as he did what he said and he did what
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:25.840]  he told him. But Himmler went out a few times to execution sites where they were shooting people,
[2:44:25.840 --> 2:44:31.040]  machine gunning him. He would throw up and said, I can never see this again. So Jack Dorsey and
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:34.640]  Mark Zuckerberg, they don't want to see your teeth knocked out by the people they find,
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:38.880]  people they protect. They want to just ignore the victims of what they've done.
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:44.160]  And I just say that, you know, how would he like his teeth? I mean, if somebody walks up to him
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:50.160]  next time he's at Congress and knocks his teeth out, and then he doesn't just, he doesn't just
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:54.160]  have his teeth knocked out. He's then banned off Twitter because his teeth were knocked out.
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:44:58.720]  Or what if somebody, God forbid, beat his brains out with a baseball bat and then
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:03.520]  his name was banned because he can't have a victim. See, that's who these guys are. They're creeps,
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:08.960]  they're nerds, and they feel like they have a right to piss on everyone and abuse us and dominate
[2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:14.960]  us. They're monsters. Yeah. And that's the whole point. Why? They wanted to destroy me as quickly
[2:45:14.960 --> 2:45:19.520]  as possible because they said the Proud Boys were there and they were not there. First off,
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:24.560]  the Proud Boys are not a white supremacist organization. Exactly. But now just saying
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:28.480]  you're them. Hey, they're not white supremacists, but now they just say you're with them so you
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:33.600]  deserve to have your teeth knocked out. Yeah, they weren't even there. Not a single Proud Boy. It was
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:38.640]  just me and the people who came to see the rally and our speakers and Antifa Berkeley
[2:45:38.640 --> 2:45:42.000]  knew that the Proud Boys weren't there. And let's talk about that. I was reading it. It was like a
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:46.480]  free speech pro-Trump rally. You can't even have that in America. Like all Americans should be
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:53.040]  outraged by this. Yeah, they told everyone that white supremacists were coming. They told everyone
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:57.840]  that Proud Boys were coming, that fascists were coming, and there was a total lie. Meanwhile,
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:04.000]  the main white supremacist leader has endorsed Biden. Exactly. Richard Spencer has endorsed,
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:08.960]  you know, Joe Biden. I mean, white supremacists stick together, don't they? Because Joe Biden
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:14.560]  is the total racist. He's so senile and old, he can't stop himself from having his true feelings
[2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:20.240]  and thoughts. He goes, I like roaches and I like black kids. And black kids are just as smart as
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:27.360]  white kids. Yeah, he'll always go up and creep up on and sniff and touch all the white kids.
[2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:31.520]  But you don't see him touching any children of color, do you? That ought to tell you something.
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:36.960]  Okay, I'm almost... That's a good point. He's never grabbing on brown kids, is he? Oh. Yeah,
[2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:40.640]  I'm almost thankful that he's a racist. Thank God that he's not going to put his hands, you know,
[2:46:40.640 --> 2:46:44.480]  on my sister or my children. I don't even have children. Thank goodness for that. And thank
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:48.400]  goodness that we did have children that'd be black or else Joe Biden would be all over them.
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:53.360]  You know, if my sister was actually older than me, she'd probably walk up to her and just like
[2:46:53.360 --> 2:46:57.840]  the other woman he walked up to say, I wish you were four years old and dancing. This is something
[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:02.880]  actually said to a woman on live TV. And guess what? The media didn't even report on that. He
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:07.120]  went up to a woman and told her, I just wish that you were four years old.
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:11.440]  Philip Anderson, I've seen some of your videos. Philip Anderson, I'm very impressed with what
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:16.000]  you've done. Please. Thank you. Please come. No, we love you, brother. Please come back
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.960]  home with Owen Stroyer. Please join me again in a couple of days and please work with us because
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:27.920]  obviously for folks that don't know, because I never had bad teeth, but I've been grinding them.
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:32.080]  So these disintegrated. I finally got two posts put in the last six months. Now I get the
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:36.960]  tooth put on. It's over $2,000 per tooth. People want to support you. How do people help you get
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:40.160]  your front teeth back, brother? Because I want to see you on air with me in a couple of months.
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:44.480]  It takes that much time to drill in and put the post in and make them see that they got to put
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:48.480]  the new teeth in. But how do we support you, brother? Because, you know, they give all these
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:52.720]  globalists all this money. We need you to get a lot of money, not just for your teeth, but just
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:58.400]  have your own mini organization and some security. Yeah. Here's the thing, Alex. The money that's
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:02.720]  being raised right now, that is not just to fix my teeth. The money that has been raised,
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:07.520]  that should be about enough or almost enough to fix my teeth. But the whole point of why I want
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:12.800]  you guys to continue donating so we can have another free speech rally because we need a protest
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:19.040]  Twitter, you need a protest Facebook, you protest Instagram. Hey, Philip, you got me sold, brother.
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:23.200]  Go fund me. Help Philip Anderson fix his teeth. Go fund me. Mark and Gina Assaulton,
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:28.240]  SF Rally. Join us again tomorrow, brother. We love you. Phone calls and big breaking news
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:33.840]  straight ahead. And we got some big Hunter Biden laptop news. I've got some really important
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:38.800]  and quite frankly, bad news for you. We've confirmed from high level sources in our own
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:42.240]  research that if Joe Biden is able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:47.120]  it, they're that crazy. They intend to not just shut down in full force, but have yours truly Alex
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:51.760]  Jones arrested. And here's the really bad news. They're coming after everybody and they're coming
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:56.800]  after the economy and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:01.840]  Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash. But here's the really good news. The really good
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:08.400]  news. Humanity is awakening to this threat. We're no longer asleep. And we understand that the
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:12.240]  globalist are our mortal enemies. And we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:18.880]  nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever. That's why we must come together
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:24.320]  now as Americans of a race, color and creed and repudiate the new world order and stand firm
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:29.600]  and vote for Donald Trump. But also the information war support independent media that tells the truth
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:35.200]  like info wars.com. Thank you. With two weeks left until the historic election,

[2:51:03.760 --> 2:51:09.440]  All right, Matt, Zach, Noah and Brett, I'm taking your calls and this Patrick Howley
[2:51:09.440 --> 2:51:17.520]  of national file and epic times as major breaking Joe Biden news. And then we'll continue
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:23.040]  as long as we can. All right, this has been on the longest. That would be
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:28.160]  Brett in Texas. Thank you so much, sir. We really appreciate you. Go ahead.
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:34.560]  Hey, Alex, man, I really appreciate it. You are the tip of the spear, man. Love your show.
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:40.640]  Been listening a long time. Yeah, I was listening to Dr. Pachennik and he's right. I think, you
[2:51:40.640 --> 2:51:45.760]  know, we need to fire all these. We need to fire all these people, you know, at the head of the
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:52.720]  CIA, the DOJ and the FBI. I mean, you know, the Bible, they've all shown their traders sold out.
[2:51:52.720 --> 2:51:57.920]  Sorry, the Bible says, go ahead. Yeah, I mean, there's a scripture in the Bible that says,
[2:51:57.920 --> 2:52:02.400]  wherefore, by their fruits, you shall know them. Well, so what you look, you look at what they
[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:07.360]  do. You know, I mean, Haspel, Gina Haspel's been stonewall in requests for documents.
[2:52:07.920 --> 2:52:12.480]  You know, Christopher Ray has this cavalier attitude toward Antifa, you know, not even going
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:17.680]  after him, not even hardly ever hardly even acknowledging it. And then, you know, I think
[2:52:17.680 --> 2:52:23.760]  most importantly, Bill Barr and John Durham have no indictments of any significance so far.
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:28.960]  And they've they've managed to slow walk the investigation into a constitutional crisis,
[2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:35.360]  which is going to be the election. And if you look at, I was watching an interview with Bill Barr
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:42.480]  and Maria Bartiromo, and Bill Barr said that what happens with regards to the investigation
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:47.120]  will depend on who wins the election, you know, and then, you know, not to mention,
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:51.200]  not to mention the fact that Congress isn't doing anything about the big tech censorship,
[2:52:51.200 --> 2:52:55.760]  because they're all bought off. I mean, if you look at Jim Jordan being interviewed by Tucker
[2:52:55.760 --> 2:53:01.760]  Carlson a while, a few weeks ago, Tucker totally embarrassed him, you know, for taking campaign
[2:53:01.760 --> 2:53:07.200]  contributions for Google. So they're all bought off. Everybody's corrupt. So, you know, and more
[2:53:07.200 --> 2:53:13.280]  than bought off, they're scared of big tech. Because big tech, but they're bought off. They
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:17.920]  have they haven't done. I mean, this could have been this could have been addressed 10 years ago.
[2:53:17.920 --> 2:53:21.600]  But you know, they've got all they've got these carve outs, you know, that they can they can run
[2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:28.400]  roughshod over, you know, with with the free speech infringements and everything. And they don't do
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:32.480]  anything if they haven't done anything about it, when they could, they could have done done something
[2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:37.680]  about it years ago. So, you know, I mean, basically, you know, it looks like we're on our own. I mean,
[2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:42.960]  we can't we can't put our faith, you know, we can't put our faith in in man, you know, any kind of,
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:48.240]  you know, our representatives. I really do think Trump is our last. Oh, there's no doubt for real.
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:52.960]  And by real, he's really a guy who really thinks he's president, who's really doing what he thinks
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:59.040]  is best. He's fallible. But I mean, he's real. And if we don't double down, I mean, you imagine
[2:53:59.040 --> 2:54:02.640]  what they're going to do if they get rid of Trump. I mean, can you imagine what's about to happen? I
[2:54:02.640 --> 2:54:08.720]  mean, I I can handle it. And that's my, I mean, that's my, you know, that's my point is like,
[2:54:09.280 --> 2:54:15.120]  why, why has Joe Barr and John Durham been, you know, I mean, if they if they weren't corrupt
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:20.800]  these guys, a lot of his way, they lie to his face, they lie to his face, you know, some
[2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:27.040]  some important indictment so far. Now, here I got to go. I got to break here. But the point is,
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:34.720]  is they lie to his face. They lie again. And they lie again, because they don't want a war with the
[2:54:34.720 --> 2:54:40.160]  deep state. The problem is the deep states bring in the war anyways. It's like somebody's like
[2:54:40.160 --> 2:54:45.120]  pounding you in the face. But you're not going to fight back because you don't want to get in a
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:51.760]  fight. You're all ready getting your ass kicked. You might as well fight back. And that's what
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:58.160]  this comes down to. All right, Matt, Zach, and Noah are last callers. And then I've got Patrick
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:07.040]  Howley of National Fallen Epic Times has got some big breaking bike news and laptop news and a lot
[2:55:07.040 --> 2:55:12.880]  more. So that's coming up. And I appreciate Gerald Salento. He's a great guy. He understands
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:16.240]  everyone. So I've got to preempt him. So I've done that. The times are too epic.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:22.480]  We've got a lot of other things to hit as well. But I just hope you all understand this is
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:28.240]  we've lived under the shelter of Christianity and under America under George Washington,
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:34.400]  which was the fruit of the Magna Carta and the Renaissance. That's all being torn away.
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:39.520]  He's a Star Trek analogy. Our shields are down, folks. It's kind of a good thing. We're about to
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:47.520]  face God. In fiction, super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic,
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:53.280]  huge, global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex. And I
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:59.040]  might have told you a year ago, back in October 2019, that a powerful billionaire who controls the
[2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:04.720]  UN would roll out a global hysteria and lock down the planet and start millions of people and would
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:09.920]  be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:14.480]  would say we're all going to work from home now and that this was good to lower the carbon
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:19.440]  footprint on the human population. You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia.
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:25.040]  You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book. But in reality, it really did happen.
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:30.560]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:36.160]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago. And we're living in this world Bill Gates is built.
[2:56:36.160 --> 2:56:40.400]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:57.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:56:57.840 --> 2:57:15.280]  This is Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco, a dystopian hellhole.
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:32.960]  Where a bubonic plague of homelessness has skyrocketed steadily under her watch.
[2:57:32.960 --> 2:57:38.800]  And just as Pelosi ignores her constituents, she has done the same to average Americans
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:45.600]  with her weak mental capacity to hold her office. Perhaps you mistook them for somebody who gave a
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:50.480]  damn. It's not it's it's not the worst of her offenses. And you point out a long train here
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:57.360]  referring to Donald Trump as an enemy of the state federal and law enforcement agents as
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:58:03.680]  stormtroopers. One wonders if she's just completely unwound. I don't I don't know if
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:08.240]  you'll have success in removing her from her post, but I'm glad you put the indictment out there.
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:12.560]  Here's the other thing that most people don't realize. There was a major rule change when
[2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:19.040]  Nancy Pelosi came in because they had the majority and it was to prevent anybody from
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:22.240]  doing this other than the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy.
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:27.360]  Interesting. Pelosi is a sick one. We've got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems.
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:34.560]  Recently, Nancy Pelosi reached a milestone by not speaking to Donald Trump for an entire year.
[2:58:34.560 --> 2:58:40.800]  MSNBC anchor Nicole Wallace asked Pelosi if she would be open to Trump reaching out to her.
[2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:46.720]  Pelosi said it would depend on what the purpose is this during a pandemic and skyrocketing
[2:58:46.720 --> 2:58:51.520]  unemployment. As you know, there are Americans who are being evicted from their homes. They can't
[2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:56.960]  pay the rent. Many Americans are waiting in food lines for the first time in their lives.
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:59:01.120]  Can you look them in the eye, Madam Speaker, and explain why you don't want to accept the
[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:07.920]  president's latest stimulus offer? We represent these people. I have for over 30 years represented
[2:59:07.920 --> 2:59:15.680]  my constituents. I know what their needs are. I listen to them. Why not call them and say,
[2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:19.360]  Mr. President, let's work out a deal? It's not going to be everything you want.
[2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:23.120]  Not going to be everything I want. But there are so many Americans right now
[2:59:23.120 --> 2:59:29.520]  who are in desperate need. Let's make a deal. What makes me amused, if it weren't so sad,
[2:59:29.520 --> 2:59:33.760]  is how you all think that you know more about the suffering of the American people
[2:59:33.760 --> 2:59:38.640]  than those of us who are elected by them to represent them at that table.
[2:59:38.640 --> 2:59:45.920]  Nancy Pelosi, the 33-year congresswoman representing the Democrat armpit of San Francisco with a
[2:59:45.920 --> 2:59:52.880]  net worth of $120 million, continues her scatterbrained tyranny. The father of Nancy Pelosi,
[2:59:52.880 --> 2:59:59.920]  Thomas D. Alessandro Jr., was a Democratic U.S. congressman from Maryland and a mayor of Baltimore.
[2:59:59.920 --> 3:00:06.720]  D. Alessandro was so deeply involved with the Magliano Mafia that John F. Kennedy had Hoover's
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:13.440]  FBI investigate him, an investigation that Hoover warned would end D. Alessandro's political career.
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:18.960]  And now, that spirit of arrogant corruption lives on in the current speaker of the House,
[3:00:18.960 --> 3:00:23.920]  who has taken a meat cleaver to the balance required in her position of power.
[3:00:23.920 --> 3:00:29.040]  The 25th Amendment is all about the stability of the presidency and the continuity of the office.
[3:00:29.040 --> 3:00:34.400]  And this is, you know, not with bad intention. If a president becomes incapacitated,
[3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:41.760]  by stroke, a ventilation, whatever it happens to be, he would not have the ability,
[3:00:41.760 --> 3:00:49.360]  as President George W. Bush had to make a judgment for this period of time, I transfer the power.
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:55.440]  Clearly, it is due time for Pelosi to vacate the chair. John Bowne reporting.
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:01:05.680]  Again, I don't have to describe to viewers and listeners right now how critical the situation is.
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:14.560]  I am encouraged by the fact that we have record traffic to infowars.com and newswars.com and band
[3:01:14.560 --> 3:01:19.120]  up video, and that we have a lot of our great affiliates saying, how do we support infowars?
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:24.240]  How do we save America? Our affiliates are always great, our radio stations and TV stations, but
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:28.240]  I've never had this much response. We've had more response from them the last week.
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:33.760]  We had the last six months. I mean, they get, because before it's like, okay, Jones is okay to
[3:01:33.760 --> 3:01:38.480]  warn about tyranny, but he exaggerates a little, but he's still overall a necessary evil.
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:44.240]  Now people are like, okay, Jones wouldn't make it. Folks, I don't want to make this up.
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:50.080]  How about making any of this up? We are in trouble, man. A lot of trouble.
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:57.200]  I mean, I sit here reading the reports and the confirmed documents about the globalist and what
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:03.680]  they're doing, and I just can't believe they're this evil. I know why you don't believe me. I don't
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:14.000]  believe it. It's crazy. They admit that it's come out. Biden's ignored it. His lawyer admits it's
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:19.920]  the laptop. They haven't denied it. And it's the barisma executives saying you're going to end
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:29.680]  a criminal investigation and does, we'll give you the money. And then we learn it's raping little
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:37.520]  girls. Well, of course it is because you don't get in this club unless you're doing that. Okay,
[3:02:37.520 --> 3:02:43.840]  Matt, Zach, and Noah, I'm going to take your calls right now. And we've got Patrick Howley at the
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:48.720]  bottom of the hour joining us. So I get to all these calls. He's got some big breaking news today.
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.160]  It's like Trump said last week, he said in a couple of speeches, he said,
[3:02:54.960 --> 3:03:02.480]  he said, I can't believe they're this evil. It's worse than I thought. I thought I could turn
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:08.480]  around easier. And he went on to say, and I can't believe they're for China against their own interest.
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:12.880]  And I can't believe they hate the country like this. That's word for word, but I've said,
[3:03:12.880 --> 3:03:17.840]  Trump didn't get that from me. We're just in the spirit, Symponico, just like you are.
[3:03:18.560 --> 3:03:23.920]  People call me, oh my God, you're saying exactly what I think in real time because it's the truth.
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:28.720]  This morning I got up at like, you know, 530, I'm having coffee, sun comes up 630,
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:34.480]  the sun comes up behind these black clouds. It's really beautiful. If we're all looking at that
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:41.600]  same picture, that's the same picture. Then we look at fellow Americans who literally believe
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:48.560]  Trump's a KKK member. They literally believe China's our friend. They literally believe against
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:52.080]  their own self interest. I'm going to go to break, go to Mack, Zach, and Noah. You've held it to all
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:57.280]  three in the next segment. I love you. And I appreciate you, Zach's first. Briefly, because
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:02.960]  I didn't plug last hour, we'll be bankrupt if we don't. I went to top developers. We've got like
[3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:09.840]  seven suppliers. I said, I want the best multivitamin mineral amino acid drink that tastes great,
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:16.320]  that's natural, organic, healthy. And I wanted a great price. And we came up with this about three
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:20.800]  years ago. And at first it was an okay seller, not in our top 10. It's become one of our best sellers
[3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:27.840]  since people love it. Vitamin mineral fusion, advanced multivitamin formulation. It's got
[3:04:27.840 --> 3:04:33.040]  everything in it. And it's so good for your immune system, so good for your body's defenses.
[3:04:33.040 --> 3:04:42.480]  96% reviews out of 1,879 reviews on power reviews. That's a 4.8 score. It's been sold out for months,
[3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:49.680]  but it's 50% off free shipping and triple Patriot points we make like, I don't know,
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:55.440]  I haven't done the math. $6, $7 at this price. Got to sell a lot of them to do that. But
[3:04:56.160 --> 3:05:01.760]  this is quality. Most places put synthetic vitamins and minerals. They put crap in. We don't do that.
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:08.240]  This is quality. InfowarsTour.com. It's the new Black Friday comes in October. I was like,
[3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:12.800]  man, October is weighed down. We're not making any money. They go, well, Alex, you did your idea.
[3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:16.240]  Black Friday in October last year was a big sale. I said, well, say it out again then.
[3:05:16.240 --> 3:05:22.640]  So I'm just telling you, my marketing plan is reality. You have 12 days, nine hours,
[3:05:22.640 --> 3:05:28.240]  45 minutes, 27 seconds to take advantage of everything at store-wide free shipping,
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:33.200]  triple Patriot points, and vitamin mineral fusions, so good with all the stuff that's going on,
[3:05:33.200 --> 3:05:39.600]  and ultra 12. Highest quality, two types of vitamin B12 that they say mixed together for upload
[3:05:39.600 --> 3:05:43.360]  synthesis. I don't get it all, but this is what I talked like four different places. They said,
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:48.720]  yeah, this is the best formula. And the only way to get more B12 into your body, because your
[3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:52.160]  guts don't really absorb it with most people, especially if you're white or Northern European,
[3:05:52.160 --> 3:05:56.640]  you can absorb it. You have big problems, is injectable. You can inject this. It's not to
[3:05:56.640 --> 3:06:00.320]  be injected, but it's the same type that they do inject. It's taken out of the tongue, sit there
[3:06:00.320 --> 3:06:05.120]  for a minute. Those are your blood vessels. Let it sit there a minute. It's incredible. It's the
[3:06:05.120 --> 3:06:12.320]  base to everything in your body. Ultra 12, 96% reviews as well. Only 54 reviews on this.
[3:06:12.320 --> 3:06:22.560]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, Black Friday in October, up to 60% off,
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:27.600]  triple Patriot points, and free shipping. And we got to sell a ton of product to fund ourselves,
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:32.560]  with discounts that big. So thank you all for taking action now. Funding Infowars is one of
[3:06:32.560 --> 3:06:37.520]  the most critical things you can do to cross the club list. And you know we're committed and will
[3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:44.560]  not back down until death. COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out,
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:49.440]  and it's been incrementally orchestrated. First it's 15 days to keep the hospital's empty, that's
[3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:53.920]  all live. Then it's two months, then it's six months, then it's a year. Now Bill Gates has 10
[3:06:53.920 --> 3:07:00.240]  years. And people are not saying, I like my mask. I like my face diaper. I like my binky. And so
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:05.760]  getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated death numbers,
[3:07:05.760 --> 3:07:14.960]  this is our new neurotic control freak society, overseen by robots, overseen by AI. And all of
[3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:20.480]  it is designed to make humans non-essential. That's why out of the Gates they tell us,
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:28.400]  you are non-essential. You are non-essential. Your company, your restaurant, your job,
[3:07:29.040 --> 3:07:34.480]  your profession is non-essential. This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated,
[3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:37.920]  and Bill Gates sits on top of it. Come on folks, let's project this.
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:56.800]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:02.240]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:07.040]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app.
[3:08:07.040 --> 3:08:13.360]  I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that
[3:08:13.360 --> 3:08:17.520]  Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action,
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:23.120]  you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:27.600]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below. On your
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:32.800]  email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share band.video.
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:10.320]  Now the anti-human system's here, telling us the babies got to wear face shields and masks when
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:20.800]  they're born. What a satanic cult. Let's go back to Lukinbock, Texas. Go back to America.
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:29.440]  Whaling and whaling in the woods. The successful life we're living. The successful life we're living
[3:09:29.440 --> 3:09:39.600]  times. Got us fusing like the heck out in Santa Claus. Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:50.400]  Newberry's train songs and blue eyes crying in the rain. Out in Lukinbock, Texas. Ain't nobody feeling
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:56.000]  no pain. Let's get Zach, Matt, and Noah in here ahead of Patrick Alley, NationalFall.com with
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:01.440]  Big Breakin' News. Zach, thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome. Hey, Jay, how we doing?
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:06.320]  We're at the Great Crossroads, brother. Everything we talked about now down the line,
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:11.200]  it's just, it's, we're finally here. It's so epic. It's so incredible. So much love for you,
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:16.320]  buddy. Hey, I got two things. One, appreciate, always bring up the heroes like Mr. Gunderson
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:20.880]  yesterday. I never heard of the guy. Unfortunately, you know, I wasn't found him. I just got woke.
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:25.120]  I mean, I'm embarrassed about being just woke. Don't be embarrassed, brother. We were all asleep
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:32.400]  one point. Imagine how Guggerson literally laid it all out. I mean, you know. Right, right, right.
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:36.720]  Well, then there was a guy, I'm sure you know about him named Butler with FDRs camp that tried to
[3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:41.520]  give it to him. And I guess FDR sold him out. Yes. Yeah, I was trying to find it. Well, think
[3:10:41.520 --> 3:10:45.120]  about Gunderson. They offered him the FBI directorship to stop his investigations
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:50.480]  because he didn't know this until he went to LA. He told me this on air. He got to LA. It's like
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:54.960]  all these devil worshipers and all this stuff. And like Gunderson wasn't a saint. I mean, he like
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:58.640]  women and stuff. And he like got him with Hollywood. And he's like, dude, I'm not a devil
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:04.400]  worshiper. That's when he woke up. Wow. I mean, I don't even understand how people can even
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:08.320]  see the life like that. I guess that's what Owen always said. Well, he said no to it. He didn't
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:12.480]  go along with it. Right. Right. And you read what he wrote. It's you read his FBI, I follow
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:17.840]  it's public. It's literally what happened. I'm digging into it. I am. I appreciate that. One more
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:25.200]  thing, HR 5736 will bury the Torah screwed on the, I'm sorry for the language, the American people
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:28.960]  where, you know, the pub or the media can sit here and disseminate everything, which actually
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:34.000]  helps your business. But I think that's what our whole, well, I think that's why the country is
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:37.280]  on a standstill because nobody can get past just going to the TV. They don't want to do their own
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:40.880]  research. They don't want to, you know, a lot of people just want to feel like they want to be
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:45.440]  a simulator. They want to feel like they're a winner. Like, oh, I'm for Biden. I'm a winner. Oh,
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:51.200]  I'm with CNN. CNN's a joke. We got to tell them you're being chumped. Don't go with CNN. CNN.
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:57.680]  100%. I don't want to take it towards your time, but HR 5736, did that hurt or help you or did it,
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:03.360]  like it, you know, help you, I guess blow up more. Sir, I'll be honest. There's a lot of bills. What
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:11.440]  bill are you talking about? Okay. This is the Obama's media dissemination bill from 2012,
[3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:17.760]  where the media can basically disseminate any story they want. Oh, that was the end of the
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:22.400]  propaganda ban. Oh, that hurt us. That allowed, that wasn't me. I never put out this info. That
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:26.400]  meant they could put government money into foreign. Oh, that was Obama legalizing domestic
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:30.640]  propaganda. That's been terrible for everybody, brother. I'm glad you raised it off the actual
[3:12:30.640 --> 3:12:35.520]  bill number. I forgot the bill number. Great call, Zach. Amazing. Wow. Like folks, I can't
[3:12:35.520 --> 3:12:40.080]  remember all the bill numbers, but yeah, that was horrible. Foreign affairs, the CFR promoted it.
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.480]  That's why they're able to lie about Trump because they, they have these foreign offshore
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:49.200]  corporations that already got the money when Obama left to do all this. Yeah, a bill to establish
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:54.960]  an Orwellian truth ministry. And the best report, Senator at zero hedge, Obama establishes his own
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:59.040]  ministry of truth. We'll bring it up for you. So thanks for reminding me, brother. Notice the
[3:12:59.040 --> 3:13:04.320]  caller is calling in to ask my advice. He already knows it all. And then he's reminding me, but
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:10.240]  that's what it's all about. I'm older now. I used to remember everything in real time. I don't know.
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:14.080]  It's kind of freeing though. It's like used to, I would like someone would say something like,
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:18.960]  I had all the points and now it's kind of like, I don't remember any of that because I couldn't
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:23.680]  handle all the knowledge I got at this point. Noah in Washington, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:29.920]  Hello, sir. It's a pleasure to be talking to you. Yes, sir. Go ahead. I've been listening for about
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:33.920]  five years since I was like in eighth grade. And I've been with you ever step the way I've been
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:39.920]  trying to wake my, my family up to everything you're saying. We love you, brother. I want to
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:44.960]  get into it. So I'm not sure who advised Trump personally. I don't know if you do.
[3:13:45.600 --> 3:13:49.920]  I just want to say this. Trump needs to know about the new world order and the capacity
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:54.480]  that you and all of us listeners know because after the election, whether he wins or loses,
[3:13:55.040 --> 3:13:59.920]  the American people left and right, both deserve to know about who these people really are and
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:05.360]  who we're dealing with as a nation because it's from Satan. It's from the principalities of darkness.
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:09.440]  Everybody needs to know who these people really are. Listen, Trump overall is a good person,
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:14.480]  but he does it. I mean, it's the big corporate bureaucracies. It's all these scams. It's a
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:22.560]  gen 21. It's the new world order. I mean, like, like, like, like you say, we need to expose all
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:27.120]  this. I think you're exposing it right now, sir. I just, I just, I just really wanted to blow
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:30.960]  the lid off the whole thing after the election. That's all I really want to say. No, no, I agree
[3:14:30.960 --> 3:14:36.000]  with you. That's a big show we should do with callers. How does Trump go on the offense? How
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:41.120]  do you see Trump going on the offense? Nella? So I see him. So after the election, I think,
[3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:44.400]  sir, I'm trying to be respectful. I don't want to tell you what to do because you've been doing
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:48.320]  this for a long time. You know, you tell me what to, no, no, don't worry, sir. I can,
[3:14:48.320 --> 3:14:50.720]  I can handle people. Tell me what I should do. What do you think I ought to do?
[3:14:51.680 --> 3:14:56.160]  I think, sir, I really think that you should pray about this yourself. And I think you should
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:15:00.320]  call Trump and you should advise him on the new world order who these people really are. And I
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:04.320]  think Trump should come out after the election. And I think he should tell America he should
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:09.280]  brief the nation and blow the lid off this thing and name name. I totally agree. He should level,
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:12.800]  which he's been pretty much doing to see the speeches, but he should be cut and drive. Listen,
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:18.480]  I did brief him and they had big national scandals and oh, Jones is banned from briefings. And the
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:22.960]  number one mission with John Kelly is ban Alex Jones. Believe me, sir, I did those briefings.
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:30.960]  And they caused a literal SH-T fit. I love you and I appreciate you. Thank you, Noah.
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:34.880]  Matt in New Hampshire ahead of Patrick Allen coming up. Go ahead, Matt, your own year. Thanks
[3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:39.840]  for holding. Hey, Alex Jones, you are the tip of the spear, you're the man.
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:41.760]  You're the tip of the spear, brother. I love you. Go ahead.
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:50.240]  So today I moved my vote from Massachusetts where I grew up to my new residence in New Hampshire to
[3:15:50.240 --> 3:15:55.280]  hopefully have a Trump vote count. You know what I'm saying? And make America great again.
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:16:00.320]  Yes, sir. Keep it great. But you know, I think I've, I've been listening to your show for a
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:07.280]  long time and what I'm seeing is like globalists, people in charge, they're firing their like
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:15.040]  death shots right now. And if we can somehow weather this storm as it continues to proceed,
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:22.640]  like if Trump gets in, he can just completely run amok and let it rip on all the corruption
[3:16:22.640 --> 3:16:26.720]  in the swamp. What do you think about that? Well, I'm going to take what you just said.
[3:16:26.720 --> 3:16:30.800]  We archive this to band up video and put a minute and a half of it up front. That's it.
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:35.520]  This is death rattles. This is their full assault. They might get rid of Trump. They
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:39.280]  might kill the election. It'll cause a bigger civil war, a bigger destruction for them.
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:43.040]  They don't care. They're like Satanists. They just operate power, power, grab, grab,
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:48.720]  you know, more power. But, but absolutely they're done. They're screwed. And if we just weather
[3:16:48.720 --> 3:16:55.040]  this storm, we're winning, brother. Humanity is powerful. There's a battle of good and evil, man.
[3:16:55.040 --> 3:16:58.080]  It's real and it's happening every day. There's no doubt about it.
[3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:04.480]  And you know that. So the fact that you know that is interfacing with God, brother. Isn't that
[3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:08.320]  beautiful? Most of these slaves don't even know there's good and evil. Thank God you know that,
[3:17:08.320 --> 3:17:15.520]  brother. Alex. So one thing I wanted to talk to you about was using the platform that you have.
[3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:22.320]  One software developer, individual petitions per state, bomb rush, the Senate and the Congress
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:26.480]  with petition saying we've got to hand big tech censorship. I'll tell you what,
[3:17:26.480 --> 3:17:29.920]  I've got Patrick probably summing up, but if you want a whole, I'll go to you at the end of the hour.
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:31.200]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:43.760]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months.
[3:17:43.760 --> 3:17:48.240]  They're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins, minerals,
[3:17:48.240 --> 3:17:54.560]  especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your immune system. Well,
[3:17:54.560 --> 3:18:00.160]  both products are back in stock at info or store.com's two weeks after the election.
[3:18:00.160 --> 3:18:06.160]  And we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple patriot points to your next
[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:11.120]  order. Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, additional 10% off that makes many of the things
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:16.320]  we're selling lost leaders. Now we have had a big clearance sale going. So a lot of stuff sold out
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:20.080]  while the other stuff is close to selling out. Some of our best sellers are still there and
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:23.440]  some of them have actually come back in to stock. And because of your support,
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:27.600]  we've had the money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out.
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:31.600]  So those should be back in stock as well soon. Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:35.760]  year. Obviously, we're critical to fight and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:44.000]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what info wars understands what
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  our listeners understand what Donald Trump understands. We're in a digital civil war.
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:56.240]  There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech
[3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:01.600]  platform. And now they're doing it to the private apps. They're doing it to text messages. They're
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:09.040]  doing it to email. This is mafia organized crime election meddling. But finally, when they blocked
[3:19:09.040 --> 3:19:14.480]  the Hunter Biden and the barisma information and the Chinese information and the photos and the
[3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:19.280]  crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real. Biden hasn't denied it.
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:23.520]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control. You've got to stop it now. We're
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:27.920]  taking action. Oh, and check the worst you went. Oh, it's a mistake. It's an accident. It's an accident.
[3:19:27.920 --> 3:19:31.920]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff. Well,
[3:19:31.920 --> 3:19:35.600]  info wars is calling their bluff. And I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:43.120]  2020 elections center.com. Just type it in one time. You've got to save right there in your
[3:19:43.120 --> 3:19:48.960]  browser. And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms. But most
[3:19:48.960 --> 3:19:56.560]  importantly, via text message, email or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to
[3:19:56.560 --> 3:20:02.800]  band.video. But 2020 elections center.com is a clone of the side of the exact same links,
[3:20:02.800 --> 3:20:09.600]  the exact same videos. We can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring because
[3:20:09.600 --> 3:20:14.160]  the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out. And
[3:20:14.160 --> 3:20:18.800]  since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech, I mean, he's modern situation.
[3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:22.000]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now. So we're going to sit here and cry
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:26.160]  because he has taken action. We, the people are taking action now. You can do it very,
[3:20:26.160 --> 3:20:29.920]  very easily by sharing 2020 elections center.com, 2020 elections center.com,
[3:20:29.920 --> 3:20:36.000]  and check out the new redesign info wars.com and share that. Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  Yeah. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:13.520]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:18.880]  Alex Jones. All right, we really appreciate the top prince forecaster, Gerald Salente,
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:25.040]  who hosts every Monday, fourth hour, but he understands occasionally we have to preempting
[3:21:25.600 --> 3:21:30.240]  not because his info isn't amazing. We had the power go out last hour. So we're behind about
[3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:34.800]  15 minutes. So instead of cutting into him, he's welcome to come in and host any hour he wants.
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:37.920]  He can host Friday if he wants. Whenever we love to have Gerald Salente here,
[3:21:37.920 --> 3:21:41.840]  always really enjoy and learn a lot from what he has to say. So no diss on him,
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:46.800]  but for folks to see and preempt it, it's part of what we do. It happens sometimes. All right.
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:56.720]  Patrick Halley is with national file.com. He also writes for Epic times.com. Amazing folks.
[3:21:56.720 --> 3:22:01.920]  And he's got a lot of news about Biden and Texas, but I want to get his take on the laptop
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:07.200]  and on who's really behind that, what his intel is and what's about to happen. Because we know that
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:12.720]  sex blackmail is how the global esteem state operates with Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:22:12.720 --> 3:22:18.160]  And of course, at the same time, the Hunter Biden, people say, well, why would he just
[3:22:18.160 --> 3:22:22.240]  leave a laptop with all this sex video on it because they own the FBI because they know they're
[3:22:22.240 --> 3:22:28.080]  protected because they don't care, but it'll be their hubris that undoes them. So Patrick Halley,
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:34.960]  thanks for joining us on this live October 19th, Monday edition. Where do you want to start first
[3:22:34.960 --> 3:22:40.560]  with all the huge news that's happening? Well, you know, look, I think what we're seeing now
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:44.320]  is Hunter Biden. First of all, I mean, I don't know if the left thought they were just going to
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:49.040]  cakewalk to this election with the stupid vote by mail and the drive through Taco Bell voting,
[3:22:49.040 --> 3:22:55.200]  but I don't think they counted on the fact that Patrick Halley, 2016 veteran Rudy Giuliani,
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:23:00.880]  our super agent, our James Bond for America, Steve Bannon. I mean, these people are still
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:05.760]  out here, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone, we didn't go away. We didn't all fade away. They
[3:23:05.760 --> 3:23:10.880]  might have put Paul Manafort in solitary and, you know, charged a few of these people, but
[3:23:10.880 --> 3:23:16.160]  we didn't go away. And I think right now what we're seeing is Joe Biden is compromised.
[3:23:16.160 --> 3:23:19.840]  The entire world is learning that Joe Biden has no business being the president of the United
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:24.960]  States. They might object if he actually gets elected, the military might object to him even
[3:23:24.960 --> 3:23:28.960]  being the president of the United States and taking the oath of office because of the ridiculous
[3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:35.120]  leverage and collateral that foreigners have over this guy. I mean, China, you think about
[3:23:35.120 --> 3:23:39.680]  China spying. I mean, anybody in the world, you know how easy it was for Rudy Giuliani to get
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:43.840]  his hands on that laptop? I mean, this guy is compromised. This guy cannot be the president
[3:23:43.840 --> 3:23:48.320]  of the United States or else our country would start to look like a nightmare because any foreign
[3:23:48.320 --> 3:23:54.480]  desperate could call him up and blackmail him. Well, that's it. And notice that the lawyers
[3:23:54.480 --> 3:23:59.360]  in the emails, they admit this is a real laptop. The Bidens don't deny it's real. They just,
[3:23:59.360 --> 3:24:05.520]  they're not saying, oh, it's Russian. The Russians didn't get this. The Mac store in Delaware got it.
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:10.640]  But if it was true, don't change the subject. It doesn't matter. What are you doing on the videos?
[3:24:12.160 --> 3:24:15.760]  There's nothing to do with the Russians. I don't think anyone even believes the Russian stuff
[3:24:15.760 --> 3:24:20.560]  anymore, except like Bill Kristol and a few of the people who've worked in the deep state
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:25.600]  and cat ladies who drink box wine and watch the Rachel Maddow show. Otherwise, I don't think anyone
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:30.800]  believes these. That's right. Your grandfather or dad wasn't a Trotsky guy kicked out of Russia.
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:35.440]  So you got a hard on for Russia unless you're a weird Trotsky. No one buys it. Russia's doing this.
[3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:39.920]  Yeah, that's that's really what it is. Right. It's the Trotsky. It's who still have
[3:24:40.480 --> 3:24:46.400]  who are still angry about Russia. And, you know, it's, it's God Stalin took out Trotsky with
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:52.320]  that freaking ice pick that that that ice that that ice saw beautiful. That was a good work.
[3:24:52.320 --> 3:24:56.560]  I mean, I'm not a fan of Stalin, but that was some good work. Well, it's just too bad that the
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:01.520]  Russians get credit for all of our work on independent media and on the pro-Trump side,
[3:25:01.520 --> 3:25:06.640]  you know, it's totally sick. I mean, obviously, the Russians have nothing to do with what we're
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:13.120]  doing. No, of course not. And so look, Joe Biden's extremely compromised. Now, it wouldn't surprise
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:18.400]  me if what we see in the Hunter Biden laptop is, in fact, what everybody thinks it is,
[3:25:18.400 --> 3:25:24.320]  considering the fact that the FBI agent who is working the case is a child pornography expert.
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:29.600]  So that is something that we all need to deal with. And that needs to come out, ladies and
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:33.040]  gentlemen. I mean, the New York Post has said that they're not going to go forward with with
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:36.160]  putting out. Well, that was the next thing. The New York Post says they can't publish it as child
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:40.240]  porn. Well, okay, if it's a crime of you publish it, what about the dude that has it?
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:48.800]  Well, look, I have been in contact with people on Rudy Giuliani's team. And I'll say that much.
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:52.000]  And look, we need to get this information out there. There are people already voting. They're
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:55.920]  already trying to steal this election with vote by mail. So, you know, there is,
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:01.280]  there's a need, there's a, there's a, the public has a right to know. Okay, this,
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:05.040]  this is what drives my entire journalism career. The public has a right to know
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:11.040]  information. And so that supersedes a lot of stuff. And so, you know, people need to know
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:15.760]  what's on this laptop without showing it even that we don't even necessarily need to show it.
[3:26:15.760 --> 3:26:21.280]  But you do need to, to tell the people what's on it and describe what's on it. And well,
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:26.640]  what about the reports that it's not just raping, it's underage girls beating him,
[3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:31.120]  the Chinese guy that predicted it three weeks before it broke, says it's torturing little kids.
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:38.160]  I mean, what, what have you heard on this? I've, I've not seen what's on there. I do know people
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:42.400]  who have seen what's on it. They're shocked. They're disgusted. They're horrified by it.
[3:26:42.400 --> 3:26:47.280]  And that's what I know. Well, Giuliani said it's so illegal. He can't even talk about it.
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:52.880]  Yeah. But I mean, look, we've, we don't have that much time left before election day. Okay.
[3:26:52.880 --> 3:26:56.640]  We've got November 3rd and they're trying to steal this thing with vote by mail, which is,
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:27:00.080]  you know, what I'm working on all over the country. So the people are already voting.
[3:27:00.080 --> 3:27:03.680]  You got the meta voters who are already out there wearing their masks, lining up,
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:08.080]  you know, voting like it's Taco Bell. So the New York post is a perfectly final
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:11.920]  legitimate newspaper and kudos to them for running the first round of it. But there's,
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:16.480]  there's got to be a second round of it now. There's, I mean, there's, there's just no way that we can.
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:20.720]  I mean, this is a national security issue. If Joe Biden gets into the presidency in the United
[3:27:20.720 --> 3:27:25.040]  States and then China puts this out, it's not going to be good for the United States. That could
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:30.320]  destroy the United States. I mean, literally the US will be captured by communist China.
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:34.480]  If Biden, what about the emails they had met a real where they're like,
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:38.160]  Oh, you got to kill the investigation of a resma. Give me 30 million. I mean,
[3:27:38.160 --> 3:27:44.080]  this is open and shut classic textbook stuff. Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's, it's,
[3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:48.320]  it goes without saying this man can't be the president of the United States. And I honestly
[3:27:48.320 --> 3:27:53.840]  believe if he is not able to get a security clearance, I mean, you're going to look at a
[3:27:53.840 --> 3:27:58.960]  real constitutional crisis, not only with this election, but God forbid if Biden does get elected
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:03.360]  and becomes the president elect, then it's another constitutional crisis. Because this guy,
[3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:06.880]  you could, you could destroy the United States of America. If you're China, you could destroy the
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:11.360]  United States of America because they have this. If they have, if they put this out and this guy,
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:15.840]  when this guy is the president of the United States, we can't have this. Okay. We have to stop
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:19.920]  this now before the election happens. We're fighting for the survival of America right now.
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:26.800]  And by the way, that's not hype. That's real. That totally freaks me out that you're talking
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:32.320]  about that. And that's true. And that the fact that our establishment would even allow this,
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:37.040]  but it shows they're globalists, they're all invested all the world. They just see America as
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:41.600]  like some big thing they're taking down. They realize how dangerous that is. And the chain
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:47.200]  reaction I see, if the chai comms with Biden get this coup, there's going to be a rebellion
[3:28:47.200 --> 3:28:52.720]  that's super dangerous. I don't want that. This is insane. They must stop now. I've
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:58.880]  looked at every angle, Patrick. This is deadly. It is one of the worst things we've ever faced
[3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:03.280]  before in the United States of America. This man, Biden is so dirty and so corrupt.
[3:29:03.280 --> 3:29:09.040]  It is, it defies imagination. However, we already went through this with Hillary Clinton. However,
[3:29:09.040 --> 3:29:13.760]  what we saw with Hillary Clinton is all the stuff that was on the Wiener laptop and everything else
[3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:19.440]  with Huma, that stuff didn't come out over the last four years, did it? The Spooks and Clapper
[3:29:19.440 --> 3:29:25.040]  and Brennan and the rest of them didn't allow it to come out. So, I mean, do they honestly think
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:29.600]  they could stonewall through something like this through four years of Biden? Not going to happen.
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:32.560]  No, that's the good news. Other people have this everywhere.
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:38.240]  Yeah. Trump called it the laptop from hell. Trump knows what's on it. People know it's on it.
[3:29:38.240 --> 3:29:44.000]  But, you know, this is potentially World War III if it comes out or if it doesn't come out.
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:48.800]  Well, notice China is saying they may invade Taiwan this week. They know they're in trouble.
[3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:53.120]  Because if they get embarrassed by this, they're going to have to launch a war. That's how this
[3:29:53.120 --> 3:29:58.320]  works. Yeah. Oh, they know. They know it's on it. Yeah. They know it's on it.
[3:29:59.040 --> 3:30:03.520]  And the only way we have power against them is to admit it and destroy Biden and Democrats.
[3:30:03.520 --> 3:30:09.520]  We can't like just try to cover it up and play ball with the chai cops. I mean, give me a break.
[3:30:09.520 --> 3:30:13.840]  No. Patrick Halley is our guest. We'll talk about other big shoes about to drop.
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:19.840]  Fourteen days. We're 13 and a half, folks. We are game time. And then the real game starts
[3:30:19.840 --> 3:30:24.640]  after election day where they're going to challenge the election. The 79 days of hell.
[3:30:24.640 --> 3:30:29.680]  Remember, you heard it here first. I'm Alex Jones, committed to the Republican freedom.
[3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:40.160]  State weather. Patrick Allen straight ahead. It was 30 months ago that info wars. And of course,
[3:30:40.160 --> 3:30:46.880]  yours truly Alex Jones was banned on more than 60 major platforms in one day, led by the CEO of
[3:30:46.880 --> 3:30:51.920]  Apple Tim Cook, who helps China run giant death camps. Always just let that be in the back of
[3:30:51.920 --> 3:30:57.680]  your mind. We talk about these monsters and where they're taking us. They have no bottom.
[3:30:57.680 --> 3:31:00.720]  And people said, Jones, how are you taking it? And I said, I'm taking it just fine. They're
[3:31:00.720 --> 3:31:04.960]  coming for you next. This is a technocracy. They're merging with big pharma. They're taking
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:10.160]  over the media. This is a digital psychological dictatorship in their own words. This is a
[3:31:10.160 --> 3:31:15.440]  planetary takeover. They're then going to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague
[3:31:15.440 --> 3:31:20.880]  threats. That's so the wireless system can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot
[3:31:20.880 --> 3:31:24.960]  takeover. How did I know all this would happen? Because they've been saying they're going to do
[3:31:24.960 --> 3:31:30.640]  it. You see, it's not that I'm psychic. I know how to read what these monsters are saying. So
[3:31:30.640 --> 3:31:56.480]  you have to understand that crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from me. It comes from them.
[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:05.360]  Lost leaders. Now, a lot of stuff sold out. Some of our best sellers are still there,
[3:32:05.360 --> 3:32:10.000]  but some good news. Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:14.960]  minerals and amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses. It is
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:20.240]  back in stock, back on sale today, which is two weeks to the election. And more good news. Ultra
[3:32:20.240 --> 3:32:26.640]  12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason, highest quality vitamin B12 taken under the tongue for
[3:32:26.640 --> 3:32:34.000]  full absorption. It is now back in stock. Both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:42.080]  Black Friday comes in October. A major life lesson just took place last night. The top story in the
[3:32:42.080 --> 3:32:50.320]  country was that Hunter Biden's laptop information had come out. Him with hookers and shooting porno
[3:32:50.320 --> 3:32:57.040]  movies and crack pipes. But the real news was how he had indeed been bought off by Barisma and had
[3:32:57.040 --> 3:33:02.480]  done so at the behest of his father, who was getting large parts of the money. But you see,
[3:33:02.480 --> 3:33:07.760]  Twitter and Facebook and others totally censored the info and even censored major news publications
[3:33:07.760 --> 3:33:11.120]  and even censored the president. But when the president and Congress said they were going to
[3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:17.200]  take action, suddenly Jack of Twitter said he didn't know what had happened and it was wrong.
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:22.400]  And that's the big life lesson here. Standing up and saying no to organized crime without the
[3:33:22.400 --> 3:33:28.000]  caring is the way to stop it. Groping to it and letting big tech lie to us and run over us is
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:33.200]  the way to make these tyrants continue to go absolutely crazy. Remember, they support Communist
[3:33:33.200 --> 3:33:39.360]  China and its death camps. What will they do to us? Will we now know? This is your last chance to get
[3:33:39.360 --> 3:33:44.400]  a packed power stack. And I'm really bummed out about that. It started out as a sleeper product,
[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:48.640]  but the people that did order it loved it and sort of reordering it. They spread the word and
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:53.520]  became one of our best sellers. But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:34:00.480]  13 different formulas in a packed power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore. This is the highest
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:05.840]  in AMPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills in the morning, half the
[3:34:05.840 --> 3:34:09.440]  capitals and pills and gel caps at night. It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:14.240]  that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it. And that's why it's having such a great
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:18.320]  effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing. So it's your last chance to get a power
[3:34:18.320 --> 3:34:23.600]  stack at infowarstore.com. It's 60% off and free shipping. That is at cost for all of you that

[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:02.000]  This is what Trump is saying and doing. He just got off an airplane at a campaign event.
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:25.200]  Here is the president what he just said.
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:33.840]  Is that Brian Skelter? Is that Brian Skelter? I mean, you want Trump to fight. He's doing it.
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:40.560]  Trump could basically do nothing at this point. Wrong. He admits China's the enemy.
[3:35:40.560 --> 3:35:44.640]  He's come out against him. He's tried to turn the economy back on. He's tried to stand up for
[3:35:44.640 --> 3:35:48.000]  what's right. Patrick Howley, this is incredible. What do you make of this?
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:54.320]  Well, President Donald Trump is fired up in a way that is very inspiring to me.
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:35:59.120]  He is making it clear at his rallies. He wants to open up society again. Biden and the Democrats,
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:03.280]  they want us to turn society into a prison, lock us down, put these disgusting masks on our faces.
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:09.280]  We're going into permanent martial law if Biden wins. I mean, I just can't believe how real this is.
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:14.400]  But it's permanent martial law that the United States is not going to have any sovereignty
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:19.680]  over because of all the people who are blackmailing Joe Biden. Oh, yeah. So you win the China runs
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:25.680]  and sets when we can go outside or have a job. Yeah, this is crazy. Yep. So it will be a kind
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:30.800]  of martial law tyranny in which it's not martial law with the US military is going to, you know,
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:33.600]  General Flynn's not going to be making the decisions. The decisions are going to be coming
[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:37.680]  down from Tedros at the who and the rest of them and Gates and the rest of them there.
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:42.080]  This is disturbing. This is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen. And the psychotic demonic
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:48.080]  leftists who have lost their sanity, who have been gaslighted and driven into hallucinatory
[3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:51.760]  madness over the last couple of years, and especially the last couple of months, they're
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:55.760]  voting for this because they think they're taking down white supremacy and they're taking down the
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:37:00.960]  white man and they're tearing down the white man statues. And it's madness. It has nothing to do
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:06.080]  with white people. It's a globalist chatcom takeover. Let's play Trump again. Just minutes ago,
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:12.320]  so epic, laying it out and just saying, Hey, we need to arrest all these people, their enemies,
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:14.640]  because that's what this is. It's a foreign takeover. Here it is.
[3:37:14.640 --> 3:37:21.680]  He's a criminal. He got caught. Read his laptop. And you know who's a criminal. You're a criminal
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:28.160]  for not reporting it. You are a criminal for not reporting it. Let me tell you something. Joe Biden
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:32.960]  is a criminal and he's been a criminal for a long time. And you're a criminal in the media for not
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:39.760]  reporting it. I know that ugly head anywhere. That's Brian Stelter, literally on a tarmac.
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:43.680]  And Trump's saying you're a criminal. Patrick, this is great. Just call it like it is. We're
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:49.760]  going to win. I mean, Trump has 13 days to go to total war, 13 days to victory. I just think he
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:54.480]  needs to take the gloves off. What do you think? I know people who have seen the contents of Hunter
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:38:01.120]  Biden's laptop. They are shocked. They are horrified. They are depressed. They are depressed about
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:04.720]  humanity right now after looking at what's on that laptop. It's the laptop from hell, as the
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:10.000]  president said. The New York Post has a responsibility to continue this story. And if they're not
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:14.080]  going to continue the story, I'll tell them right now. I'll tell them right now. If the New York
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:20.160]  Post does not publish the second round of this, I will. And I'll tell you that right now. And I've
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:25.600]  already had a conversation about it. I'll do it. And so the New York Post, they need to do it and
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:31.760]  they need to do it today. We need to save America and we need to not allow. Nobody at the New York
[3:38:31.760 --> 3:38:37.120]  Post, however liberal some of them might be, wants to see Communist China conquer the United States
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:42.480]  of America. Okay. Well, the problem is they've signed on to doing this. So they just don't know
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:52.000]  where to stop. How's the leftist get off the global string? I think that I think that even
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:57.040]  some of the middle of the road leftists over the last few days and over the last few months are
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:02.160]  beginning to see the gravity of what we're getting ourselves into and only the most strident,
[3:39:02.160 --> 3:39:07.600]  insane leftists who are the people proudly wearing a mask and screeching about white
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:10.800]  supremacy and Trump, the people who have really lost their minds. Yeah, this is like
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:16.720]  somebody supported Hitler in 1944. I mean, you're betting on a loser here. I mean,
[3:39:16.720 --> 3:39:21.600]  why is he wearing two masks? There's no end to the just like, how about five masks? How about 20
[3:39:21.600 --> 3:39:27.360]  masks? He needs another one. Look, it's a sigh of how many times has Biden set out in the campaign
[3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:31.360]  trail? Ooh, they might kill me. Ooh, they might throw me off the White House balcony,
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:35.840]  something like that. He's a hostage and he knows he's a hostage and the whole family
[3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:41.200]  is being held hostage by foreign despots because this guy couldn't even get a security clearance.
[3:39:41.200 --> 3:39:44.160]  If he tried to become the president of the United States, they would say no,
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:48.160]  you can't get a security clearance. So we would have the president who couldn't even see classified
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:53.520]  information because he is so corrupted. This guy could have the nuclear football. The guy is not
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:59.040]  even capable of thinking for himself. He's mentally deficient. He's blackmailed by everyone in the
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:03.760]  world and he could have the red phone. He could have the nuclear football guy. And then it's
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:09.280]  Dr. Strangelove and it's a mushroom cloud. I mean, bring back the LBJ, bring back the LBJ
[3:40:09.280 --> 3:40:14.400]  Daisy ad. I've been trying to get this made for weeks. Bring back the LBJ Daisy ad from 1964,
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:20.240]  where the girls pick in the flowers and then it's oh, that's Biden. I'll get Owen Shroyer to air that.
[3:40:20.240 --> 3:40:25.760]  Derek Green, man, I forget the name off the Daisy ad from the 60s of nuclear war of Hillary got
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:31.200]  elected. And I totally agree. We should air that. I bet they can find it. Let's be safe. Let's say it
[3:40:32.160 --> 3:40:39.600]  330. 30 minutes into the Owen Shroyer war room. I know they'll find it. Now there's the Daisy ad.
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:46.800]  It's a Leanne McAdoo, Derek Green ad will air the Daisy ad and then we'll air at 33 after the Daisy ad
[3:40:46.800 --> 3:40:52.080]  and we'll air that piece that McGreen and I and McAdoo put out four years ago because it's so
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:56.800]  powerful, like 20 million views and it really helped with the election. And so we're going to air
[3:40:56.800 --> 3:41:03.120]  that coming up. Patrick Howling, getting back to you though. I mean, here's the deal. I never had
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:08.560]  to hype the show. I've always got crazy info. Now I don't have ways to hype it as big as it is.
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:10.880]  What would you call the political point we're at right now?
[3:41:12.720 --> 3:41:17.360]  We are looking at total obliteration. We're looking at the destruction of America if the
[3:41:17.360 --> 3:41:21.440]  Democrats managed to pull off this scheme. If they managed to do these Taco Bell vote by mail
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:25.600]  votes, drive through voting and they managed to pull off this scheme. We're looking at the destruction
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:30.640]  of America, the obliteration of America. That mask is a symbol, okay? That mask is a symbol
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:36.080]  of the fact that, I mean, it's sinister. It's very sinister stuff. It's the same
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:42.960]  reason Antifa wears masks. It's about intimidating you and harassing you and the stupid people in
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:47.520]  this country, the stupid normies, the sheep-like people who are going along with it. There are
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:51.760]  enemies just as much as the oligarchs, just as much as Bill Gates. It's about harnessing them to
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:56.480]  support force inoculations, everything else that happens. I mean, it's a very genius plan.
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:01.760]  They have certainly spent a lot of time on it. They didn't rush it through. However,
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:06.560]  they have made some big mistakes in it. The coronavirus thing was launched too early, okay?
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:11.200]  The coronavirus thing was launched and now most people are waking up to it and realize that it's
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:15.760]  just a political- I agree. If they launched it now, they would have won, but they launched it
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:20.960]  eight months early. Only the leftists, only the leftist activists are still going hard on the masks
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:26.240]  and most of the people, most of the normal people are saying enough is enough of this mask thing.
[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:32.080]  And so it becomes harder for them to justify the vote by mail and the drive-through voting,
[3:42:32.080 --> 3:42:36.000]  but they still got it through because the administration didn't put up a strong enough
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:41.120]  bulwark against this because the deep state was very powerful. They bring up this fochi guy
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:45.920]  and the entire media is glorifying him. But at least Trump has come out and said Fauci's a joke,
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:51.840]  Fauci's a fraud. Here it is right here. Fauci is an idiot and a disaster, excuse me,
[3:42:51.840 --> 3:42:57.440]  not a fraud. Idiot and a disaster. Trump's always been on our side because he has great
[3:42:57.440 --> 3:43:01.280]  instincts and he knows. He knows the deep state. He understands what's going on. He doesn't want
[3:43:01.280 --> 3:43:05.040]  poverty. He doesn't want to rule through poverty. He wants to rule through success.
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:10.320]  Yeah, he genuinely wants people to do well in this country and to have small businesses
[3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:15.440]  and to profit and to, he's doing this for us. He's not gaining anything from us.
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:21.040]  SDNY is going to stick every prosecutor that they have on him as soon as he's out of office
[3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:24.640]  and try to put him in prison for the rest of his life and bankrupt him. They've had every federal
[3:43:24.640 --> 3:43:29.280]  agent on this side behind. No doubt, I've experienced it. He is a champion. Patrick Halley over there
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:35.360]  at nationalfoul.com. We love you. We appreciate you joining us again soon. Thank you. We'll do, Alex.

[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:49.600]  original Daisy ad that he's talking about with LBJ ran against a great patriot who was fighting the

[3:43:55.120 --> 3:43:59.760]  next hour. I wanted to air this for a while on my show and I kept forgetting the crew to get it
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:03.440]  or I didn't tell them the right video. I don't remember the name of it. We produced so much
