[02:03.620 --> 02:07.820]  what we're facing that's what we're dealing with this is it this is the big
[02:07.820 --> 02:12.180]  move it's why they've got the police of the military militarized and dug in
[02:12.180 --> 02:16.440]  against the people worldwide it's why all these preparations are being made the
[02:16.440 --> 02:21.540]  globalists are preparing to try to make their move to cause giant regional wars
[02:21.540 --> 02:28.340]  that may slide into a third world war and out of that crisis a new world order
[02:28.340 --> 02:34.420]  George Herbert Walker Bush's fifth objective will emerge out of these
[02:34.420 --> 02:40.620]  troubled times we see our fifth objective a new world order will emerge
[02:40.620 --> 02:48.140]  order out of chaos the Illuminati slogan this is what we're facing this is

[02:59.020 --> 03:04.340]  you're going to see a lot of infighting within the establishment and you're
[03:04.340 --> 03:11.220]  going to see a lot of battle lines being drawn yesterday Steve Pachinic in high
[03:11.220 --> 03:15.500]  level in the council on foreign relations black ops you name it you know
[03:15.500 --> 03:19.220]  coming out and saying that Israel and Saudi Arabia killed the US ambassador in
[03:19.220 --> 03:24.340]  Benghazi Libya off the charts a lot of what he was saying Tarpley was
[03:24.340 --> 03:29.660]  concurring with when those two were concurring look out we've got just all
[03:29.660 --> 03:35.220]  of this unfolding right now these are the times like pre-World War one pre-World
[03:35.220 --> 03:40.100]  War two these are the times when the world is lining up right now with the
[03:40.100 --> 03:47.740]  backdrop of global hyperinflation looming with QE unlimited and I feel so
[03:47.740 --> 03:51.620]  sorry for the general public who doesn't even understand false politics who
[03:51.620 --> 03:57.460]  isn't even informed on fake left-right debates of Republican Democrat even
[03:57.460 --> 04:06.140]  when you study this 12 14 15 16 hours a day for decades it is somewhat murky
[04:06.140 --> 04:10.660]  until you pull back and when you pull back and study history and study this
[04:10.660 --> 04:15.060]  ruling elite and study their eugenics based sciences their full spectrum
[04:15.060 --> 04:21.140]  dominance mindset covering all their bases placing money on all you know
[04:21.140 --> 04:25.940]  areas of the crap table then you understand the larger plan here and it

[06:07.900 --> 06:11.500]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[06:11.500 --> 06:15.300]  gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country
[06:15.300 --> 06:19.260]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from

[07:09.980 --> 07:14.540]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the
[07:14.540 --> 07:17.740]  cost-to-feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business

[08:54.740 --> 09:02.500]  and we all better hope and pray we don't continue down the current path we
[09:02.500 --> 09:08.660]  are headed down like a snowball sliding right into hell we need to stop
[09:08.660 --> 09:16.700]  going downhill like a snowball headed for hell to quote Merle Haggard
[09:16.700 --> 09:25.780]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 17th day 17th day of September 2012 the
[09:25.780 --> 09:32.100]  one the only Max Kaiser on QE unlimited global financial meltdown hyper
[09:32.100 --> 09:39.100]  inflation the design collapse of Europe into the EU banker super state all of
[09:39.100 --> 09:45.020]  it is happening all of it is going according to globalist plan all the
[09:45.020 --> 09:51.780]  chaos all the bedlam all the wars all of it is part of their plan the general
[09:51.780 --> 09:56.220]  public will say but they're wrecking things they're creating poverty they're
[09:56.220 --> 10:02.620]  destroying civilization now you got it now you know what agenda 21 is now you
[10:02.620 --> 10:06.980]  understand you can't pick a side of the New World Order because you're either in
[10:06.980 --> 10:14.460]  the left hand or the right hand which are connected to forearms and upper arms
[10:14.460 --> 10:21.820]  and shoulders and a torso and a head and a waist and legs and feet that is a
[10:21.820 --> 10:26.500]  diabolical system let me explain something here there are different
[10:26.500 --> 10:29.700]  factions and criminal elements in the global corporate structure that's
[10:29.700 --> 10:34.620]  anti-free market monopolistic before I get into the World War three news this
[10:34.620 --> 10:39.540]  is so important to understand but they all stand again off the corporate
[10:39.540 --> 10:44.300]  welfare of building the police state spy grid the control grid they all stand
[10:44.300 --> 10:49.580]  again from centralization even though over time it destroys productivity
[10:49.580 --> 10:55.300]  freedom and society they stand again by dumbing people down even though down the
[10:55.300 --> 11:00.380]  road it means they'll have servile addled minions that can't even perform for
[11:00.380 --> 11:05.780]  them you've got all these evil factions battling with each other for control and
[11:05.780 --> 11:11.780]  power but none of them will ever dismantle any of the machinery of
[11:11.780 --> 11:17.780]  tyranny because those are treasures to them that they're fighting over the
[11:17.780 --> 11:25.780]  equipment of this whole juggernaut is what they want the social engineers the
[11:25.780 --> 11:31.220]  technocrats are upper level but they're not at the highest level and they're
[11:31.220 --> 11:37.140]  mercenaries that give their genius their understanding their idiot savant skills
[11:37.140 --> 11:45.660]  in different specialized areas to the overlord class and the overlord class
[11:45.660 --> 11:49.180]  though they battle with each other over control of the levers they will never
[11:49.180 --> 11:54.740]  decommission or shut down or stop any of this because they all dream of
[11:54.740 --> 12:01.460]  controlling it themselves and basically they're like a bunch of
[12:01.460 --> 12:07.260]  lemmings following a lamp in the night like moths right off the edge of a
[12:07.260 --> 12:15.700]  cliff and they're all so competitive none of them can ever not give into pure
[12:15.700 --> 12:20.780]  evil or the most wicked scientific tactics of control because if they don't
[12:20.780 --> 12:25.540]  use it somebody else will and that's the whole Mackey of alien in justifies the
[12:25.540 --> 12:33.820]  means that they teach special forces in this country for 50 years I'm sure
[12:33.820 --> 12:38.060]  they've changed it since I have talked about this and Rush Limbaugh's talked
[12:38.060 --> 12:43.220]  about it as well but I talked to some retired operators they said yeah no
[12:43.220 --> 12:48.460]  that's true that we're from different joint forces best of the best special
[12:48.460 --> 12:54.060]  forces and they recruit you to go into Delta Force and there's other units that
[12:54.060 --> 12:59.700]  they shoot dip you out of even above Delta in this whole corporate mercenary
[12:59.700 --> 13:09.580]  system and after they've gone through the months of rigorous qualification to
[13:09.580 --> 13:15.300]  the next level when they're exhausted they put them in a shack in bad
[13:15.300 --> 13:19.620]  conditions mosquitoes biting them or whatever the case is and have and give
[13:19.620 --> 13:28.940]  them 12 hours to read Machiavelli's The Prince written 500 years ago and then
[13:28.940 --> 13:34.860]  you write an essay on it and if you say I don't believe the unjustifies the means
[13:34.860 --> 13:39.420]  you don't compromise good morals in the name of beating evil you don't become
[13:39.420 --> 13:44.500]  evil to defeat evil they say oh very good yes now you've made it we're gonna
[13:44.500 --> 13:50.380]  put you in this area of logistics but if you say I do believe the unjustifies
[13:50.380 --> 13:55.020]  the means and we need to be more evil than evil to protect good oh you
[13:55.020 --> 14:00.380]  understand the greater secret you're going to be promoted to the higher level
[14:03.180 --> 14:11.460]  and that's basically what we face as a society is the system has gotten a bunch
[14:11.460 --> 14:16.860]  of people over the decades into the power structure who've then recruited
[14:16.860 --> 14:25.180]  still more who will rationalize anything they do they've even got a lot of
[14:25.180 --> 14:30.340]  people who are twisted who think they're actually good working for this
[14:30.340 --> 14:39.140]  system who will do unspeakably horrible things like stage 911 in the name of
[14:39.140 --> 14:43.820]  winning this clash of civilizations between west and east when at a higher
[14:43.820 --> 14:56.420]  level the globalist are actually playing both sides off against each other to
[14:56.420 --> 15:02.740]  destroy society itself because to the truly evil high-level globalist
[15:02.740 --> 15:10.180]  civilization decency honor beauty purity that is a threat because they've
[15:10.180 --> 15:15.460]  woven a web of deception and evil and ugliness and the darkness seeks to hide
[15:15.460 --> 15:19.660]  from the light but to hide from the light that's so painful to them who've
[15:19.660 --> 15:26.500]  turned themselves over to pure evil they seek to destroy all that is good and
[15:26.500 --> 15:30.820]  that's why if you study history every culture every society every race
[15:30.820 --> 15:40.220]  manifests the same dark murderous temples temples of doom they build
[15:40.220 --> 15:49.620]  civilizations based on hellraiser like worship of pure evil because once you
[15:49.620 --> 15:55.100]  let evil get in place then greater evil will supplant that evil and then still
[15:55.100 --> 15:59.460]  greater evil will supplant that evil and then still greater evil will supplant
[15:59.460 --> 16:12.740]  that evil until you get pure distilled absolute just total death death kill
[16:12.740 --> 16:19.420]  steal destroy burn bio weapons atomic weapons hydrogen weapons scorched earth
[16:19.420 --> 16:28.180]  black cities poisoned water dead oceans genetic engineering run wild hell on
[16:28.180 --> 16:35.700]  earth is what is being produced it is the fruits it is the works it is the
[16:35.700 --> 16:44.340]  sum total of what the system is moving us towards there been corrupt elites in
[16:44.340 --> 16:47.780]  the last 300 years in the West but still they wanted to have big public works
[16:47.780 --> 16:51.340]  projects they wanted to build palaces they wanted to compete with other
[16:51.340 --> 16:56.260]  nations for who had the best scientist in literature and art all that is going
[16:56.260 --> 17:00.220]  by the wayside who can produce the ugliest art who can produce the most
[17:00.220 --> 17:04.460]  twisted families who can who can produce the sickest things who can turn
[17:04.460 --> 17:09.580]  creation on its head who can create an economic system to destroy wealth and
[17:09.580 --> 17:14.420]  destroy families and destroy creativity and destroy intellects and who can
[17:14.420 --> 17:18.260]  chemically poison the population while having them work to build their own
[17:18.260 --> 17:27.460]  global government kill grid it is life inverted it is death it is the symbol of
[17:27.460 --> 17:35.060]  humans the star they had the arms the legs turned upside down you know what
[17:35.060 --> 17:38.940]  all these Satanists and people think they know all this alchemy and all this
[17:38.940 --> 17:41.820]  other mumbo jumbo and they sit there and they wear pentagrams around their
[17:41.820 --> 17:53.660]  necks they think it gives them all this power they're a bunch of lunatics they
[17:53.660 --> 17:58.020]  take the cross it's a symbol of someone giving their life up to try to help
[17:58.020 --> 18:03.900]  others and they turn it upside down they say it's all about me it's about my
[18:03.900 --> 18:16.300]  power and they don't understand because they're lower level evil people who who
[18:16.300 --> 18:20.420]  aren't even really evil they're cowards who are afraid of the night so they try
[18:20.420 --> 18:25.820]  to make a friend of it and they try to exercise power they try to build up
[18:25.820 --> 18:31.060]  their own little power bases to simply exercise power and then the world doesn't
[18:31.060 --> 18:35.740]  give them that power like it promised so they get deeper into evil seeking after
[18:35.740 --> 18:39.700]  it thinking of ill-gain power and they simply turn themselves over to the
[18:39.700 --> 18:49.060]  dark side the dark side will destroy us all and we must turn away from it now
[18:49.060 --> 18:55.540]  world war three is now not on the horizon world war three is rolling up our
[18:55.540 --> 19:02.900]  street like a giant juggernaut a warmock a tank out of hell and you know what
[19:02.900 --> 19:08.260]  empowers it our apathy are not being involved the average American right now
[19:08.260 --> 19:12.520]  the polls are out are so delusional they're not concerned about dead troop
[19:12.520 --> 19:15.700]  numbers they're not concerned about rioting they're not concerned about
[19:15.700 --> 19:22.100]  foreign policy they just want to go watch the football game while world war
[19:22.100 --> 19:28.780]  three is being prepared you've got a western civilization in a trance drug
[19:28.780 --> 19:35.700]  out of their minds on sick culture and chemicals having no idea the point that
[19:35.700 --> 19:39.540]  we've now reached we are now being brought directly to the edge of the
[19:39.540 --> 19:44.100]  cliff just six months ago we were a hundred feet from the cliff we're now
[19:44.100 --> 19:52.580]  five feet from the cliff and those that want world war are shoving and pushing

[23:38.940 --> 23:42.460]  controversial video the thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[23:42.460 --> 23:47.300]  in the last three months go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird

[24:00.300 --> 24:15.580]  we are 40 minutes out from Dr. Webster Griffin Tarpley joining us on this
[24:15.580 --> 24:23.700]  Monday edition then Max Kaiser joins us from England break down QE unlimited he
[24:23.700 --> 24:27.020]  of course made his strongest prediction ever and he's got a very accurate
[24:27.020 --> 24:31.820]  record inventor of the virtual trading software that's used on many stock
[24:31.820 --> 24:37.740]  exchanges today he predicted that by April there will be a total collapse he
[24:37.740 --> 24:41.420]  predicted that about a month ago on this broadcast we're gonna have him
[24:41.420 --> 24:45.500]  elaborate on that he also predicted they would begin unlimited quantitative
[24:45.500 --> 24:51.420]  easing on multi fronts so that's what we have on people that are accurate the
[24:51.420 --> 24:55.460]  mainstream news has people on constantly who are inaccurate but not because
[24:55.460 --> 25:01.220]  they're even stupid they themselves are investing the ways our guests have been
[25:01.220 --> 25:06.580]  recommending while telling you to not invest in ways that protect you again
[25:06.580 --> 25:11.900]  this is a culture of predatory activity and the fish rots from the head down and
[25:11.900 --> 25:17.700]  so now the entire culture is converting over to a predatory system and a system
[25:17.700 --> 25:22.060]  of just complete lies so the establishment starts smoking their own
[25:22.060 --> 25:26.300]  dope drinking their own Kool-Aid believing their own propaganda I mean
[25:26.300 --> 25:30.060]  look separately from the Middle East at some of the news China Japan heading
[25:30.060 --> 25:37.780]  towards war says US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and they've got ships
[25:37.780 --> 25:42.020]  threatening each other protests in each other's countries I mean it is getting
[25:42.020 --> 25:46.900]  serious we've got the head of the EU admitting that this is a plan to take
[25:46.900 --> 25:50.540]  over Europe the debt a third round of bailouts that doesn't go to Greece or
[25:50.540 --> 25:54.540]  Spain it never did they just blame those countries it goes to the megabanks
[25:54.540 --> 26:01.140]  whose operatives signed the countries on to derivatives we've got all this other
[26:01.140 --> 26:05.780]  news coming out domestically where the FBI says yeah we've got face-scanning
[26:05.780 --> 26:10.860]  cameras up nationwide now following you as you walk down the street with your
[26:10.860 --> 26:14.460]  driver's license photo now that's been going on for a while but now they're
[26:14.460 --> 26:19.540]  announcing it just big brother on steroids so we're going to be going over
[26:19.540 --> 26:25.100]  all of that but shifting years back into the Middle East let's just go over some
[26:25.100 --> 26:34.540]  of these headlines ambassador Susan Rice Libya attack not premeditated and it
[26:34.540 --> 26:40.820]  continues I mean who would believe that that it was not premeditated New York
[26:40.820 --> 26:44.820]  Times spins new video of ambassador Stevens it shows him being drugged to
[26:44.820 --> 26:49.220]  the streets as they chant God is great Allah Akbar obviously celebrating like
[26:49.220 --> 26:53.140]  they did with Gaddafi's dead body and they say all the Libyans were saving him
[26:53.140 --> 26:57.380]  going to help him so there's ever video of me being killed by a mob and then
[26:57.380 --> 27:01.060]  shooting me or whatever oh look they're helping him remember Benazar
[27:01.060 --> 27:06.100]  Budo Pakistan president video of the her being shot and our media said she
[27:06.100 --> 27:09.620]  fell and hit her head doesn't matter if there's footage of her being machine
[27:09.620 --> 27:15.340]  gunned she fell and hit her head that's how dumb they think you are that they
[27:15.340 --> 27:19.180]  tell you that oh well just a little mob protest and killed the ambassador oh yeah
[27:19.180 --> 27:22.900]  no no other governments are involved oh and the Libyan government's like no al
[27:22.900 --> 27:27.180]  Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia did this who do you think runs al Qaeda who think put
[27:27.180 --> 27:30.060]  al Qaeda in the country
[27:31.500 --> 27:37.580]  continuing a Syrian rebels burn American flags oh the al Qaeda that Obama put in
[27:37.580 --> 27:43.260]  there that NATO put in there now burning American flags we we told you they
[27:43.260 --> 27:47.340]  would then turn around and say we've got a bomb these countries in fact they're
[27:47.340 --> 27:51.980]  now saying Assad has to be invaded because al Qaeda is there that NATO
[27:51.980 --> 27:59.020]  landed and put in I mean I've studied history and I've never seen anything like
[27:59.020 --> 28:03.540]  this usually not usually governments always at least had some narrative that
[28:03.540 --> 28:11.700]  could be halfway believed even if it was bull this is just total total bedlam
[28:11.700 --> 28:15.700]  designed global chaos to distract you from the financial takeover that's
[28:15.700 --> 28:20.300]  happening look at the story out of Israel why net news ex-Envoy to Israel US
[28:20.300 --> 28:25.340]  will go to war in Iran in 2013 that's what Carpley saying he's saying this is
[28:25.340 --> 28:29.260]  meant as an October surprise to get rid of Obama who's again their puppet they
[28:29.260 --> 28:33.660]  want the new puppet Romney who can get conservatives behind him for a larger
[28:33.660 --> 28:39.540]  war who knows we're gonna find out but this is all accelerating right now
[28:39.540 --> 28:44.660]  Israel all looks to end Cairo flights increased numbers of foreign elements
[28:44.660 --> 28:49.700]  jihad groups operating in Syria really leading Sunni clerics demand a global
[28:49.700 --> 28:53.740]  ban on insults to Islam they're talking about laws in the US to restrict the
[28:53.740 --> 28:58.660]  First Amendment now for Muslims see how the media blames a film connected to the
[28:58.660 --> 29:03.620]  FBI and the federal government and then they use this false flag to try to take
[29:03.620 --> 29:10.900]  our rights you see how that works here's another one Libyan reports shred
[29:10.900 --> 29:14.660]  White House claim that Benzah Benghazi attack was spontaneous driven by anti
[29:14.660 --> 29:20.140]  Islam film yeah no kidding thanks up Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander
[29:20.140 --> 29:24.060]  says its troops in Syria we told you that six months ago now it's in Reuters
[29:24.060 --> 29:28.460]  they're not ready to tell the childlike public Iran Iran is officially
[29:28.460 --> 29:33.900]  announcing that it's a proxy war Russia and Iran on the side of Syria the
[29:33.900 --> 29:40.980]  United States and NATO in Europe backing al Qaeda while telling us give our rights
[29:40.980 --> 29:44.700]  up is al Qaeda is gonna kill us when the globalists just used al Qaeda to kill
[29:44.700 --> 29:49.020]  the ambassador the stampede the US into a war on Iran but they're gonna blame for
[29:49.020 --> 29:56.140]  it we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:24.380 --> 33:29.020]  that openly wants to establish a modern eugenics global empire
[33:29.020 --> 33:34.140]  based on destroying civilization destroying art literature
[33:34.140 --> 33:37.740]  annihilating education it is a new dark age

[34:24.380 --> 34:30.060]  consolidation of wealth a system hell bent on impoverishing the
[34:30.060 --> 34:34.220]  population so we can be more easily managed
[34:35.980 --> 34:39.340]  and of course we have to be more easily managed in our
[34:39.340 --> 34:43.020]  culling in the soft kill operations going on

[35:33.580 --> 35:38.300]  gee you think something's going on i know it's fun to get scared of the
[35:38.300 --> 35:41.820]  Arabs and the muslims and ask the government to take all your rights
[35:41.820 --> 35:45.740]  away because of it but the government is run by foreign banks
[35:45.740 --> 35:49.660]  that run the radical muslims and they run them in your face
[35:49.660 --> 35:53.260]  and use them to take over libya syria egypt
[35:53.260 --> 36:00.700]  everywhere else and then turn around and say oh my gosh they killed our
[36:00.700 --> 36:03.980]  ambassador oh but then obama plays along because they
[36:03.980 --> 36:07.340]  don't want to let the cat on the bag oh yeah it was just some protesters that
[36:07.340 --> 36:11.180]  went in and killed the navy seals and killed the ambassador and then
[36:11.180 --> 36:14.380]  everybody else in the house stood down because you know it's coming out there
[36:14.380 --> 36:17.900]  weren't just four people the rest of security
[36:17.900 --> 36:21.580]  the rest of security stood down
[36:22.380 --> 36:25.260]  and all of you that work for this so-called government
[36:25.260 --> 36:28.780]  should remember what they did to seal team six blowing up the helicopter at the
[36:28.780 --> 36:32.300]  site others spoke out so they blew up most of the rest of the team
[36:32.300 --> 36:38.060]  a few months later i even talked to a navy seal whose friends in navy seal
[36:38.060 --> 36:42.140]  team six and they said yeah yeah there was a bomb on the helicopter
[36:42.140 --> 36:46.380]  really you think so they crammed 24 of you on the helicopter and fly out in the
[36:46.380 --> 36:50.380]  desert to a rescue mission of course turned out it
[36:50.380 --> 36:54.060]  wasn't a rescue mission it was all made up just like pat tillman was charging
[36:54.060 --> 36:58.140]  the hill to fight al-qaeda turned it over wasn't any al-qaeda
[36:58.140 --> 37:01.180]  turns out we shot him he begged for his life we came up and shot him in the
[37:01.180 --> 37:06.140]  face three times and why do we know that because the valiant
[37:06.140 --> 37:11.100]  colonel the medical doctor pointed out they'd murdering
[37:11.100 --> 37:16.620]  and so the whole story fell in that's who we're dealing with
[37:16.620 --> 37:20.700]  and i have to sit here and have you know different spies and people
[37:20.700 --> 37:23.820]  that you hear on the air but also off the air people you've
[37:23.820 --> 37:27.820]  you've heard of but don't know have contacted me over the years
[37:27.820 --> 37:31.900]  sit there and say don't worry alex you and your family are safe
[37:31.900 --> 37:35.180]  which of course means me and my family are not safe
[37:35.180 --> 37:38.700]  you know i live in the real world where i talk to retired four star generals
[37:38.700 --> 37:42.060]  i live in the real world where i talk to current one star generals
[37:42.060 --> 37:45.580]  i live in the real world where i talk to kernels on a weekly basis
[37:45.580 --> 37:49.420]  i live in the real world where i get information from fbi agents you name it
[37:49.420 --> 37:53.820]  and let me tell you something folks they're all scared
[37:55.020 --> 37:59.260]  when the chairman of the joint chiefs comes out
[37:59.260 --> 38:02.540]  two weeks ago guys you print it for me again it was in the associated press and
[38:02.540 --> 38:08.540]  others headline gemsy says don't blame us of israel attacks iran
[38:08.540 --> 38:12.860]  when they come out and start saying it's a bad idea we're saying don't do it
[38:12.860 --> 38:16.220]  when you see those type of breaks and fissures going on
[38:16.220 --> 38:21.260]  you know there's a serious issue you know that this attack on iran that many
[38:21.260 --> 38:25.180]  analysts believe will probably lead to a giant world war
[38:25.180 --> 38:28.780]  we better pray it's conventional and people don't start using nukes but when
[38:28.780 --> 38:33.180]  military start losing they start using nukes and russia rolled nukes
[38:33.180 --> 38:37.740]  into north georgia whenever nato back forces were overrunning them and so
[38:37.740 --> 38:41.340]  we're getting ready to use nuclear weapons
[38:42.140 --> 38:48.220]  and this can start real quick the elites aren't building bunkers and digging in
[38:48.220 --> 38:51.340]  and building bunkers under their houses and getting 10 years supplies of food
[38:51.340 --> 38:54.540]  and everything else in the last few years because they wanted to play
[38:54.540 --> 39:01.020]  tiddlywinks i told you about that billionaire defense company owner
[39:01.020 --> 39:03.740]  that i happened to run into didn't even know who it was at the time i went and
[39:03.740 --> 39:07.900]  looked it up and i'm like wow she was who she said she was
[39:07.900 --> 39:11.420]  talking about how she was leaving the us this is four years ago
[39:11.420 --> 39:16.620]  and i said why are you leaving the us she said there won't be a us in four to
[39:16.620 --> 39:18.860]  five years you remember the story i've told it many times i said
[39:18.860 --> 39:24.460]  what do you mean she said well you just better get ready to get real popular
[39:24.460 --> 39:27.980]  and i said well why do you say that and i was at a law firm setting up some
[39:27.980 --> 39:33.260]  corporations i said i said i mean this is in the
[39:33.260 --> 39:37.340]  waiting room and i said well why do you say that
[39:37.340 --> 39:42.780]  she said because what's your sayings absolutely on target
[39:45.820 --> 39:52.300]  absolutely on target and and i'm moving to the cook islands i'm out of here
[39:52.300 --> 40:00.540]  selling basically her holdings and getting out of the country
[40:00.540 --> 40:04.060]  i mean real good job new world order you took over you robbed everything
[40:04.060 --> 40:08.140]  now we get to have world war three thanks a lot but again you're evil
[40:08.140 --> 40:10.380]  that's that's where your god has led you that's
[40:10.380 --> 40:14.140]  that's where you always take people that's where all these lunatics
[40:14.140 --> 40:18.220]  whether it's linens stalin mal Hitler or a hundred other thugs before him
[40:18.220 --> 40:25.420]  it always leads to huge wars
[40:25.420 --> 40:30.140]  armies buried their necks in mud collapsing societies famines and death
[40:30.140 --> 40:33.420]  because you people have got to have it all you've got to run it all
[40:33.420 --> 40:39.180]  you run everything but yourselves you can't control yourselves
[40:39.180 --> 40:42.780]  and you notice we told you when all this would happen when they announced
[40:42.780 --> 40:45.820]  unlimited quantitative easing when they started
[40:45.820 --> 40:53.580]  the the the hyperinflation trajectory when they moved towards iran
[40:53.580 --> 40:59.100]  when all the navies mass there's been six seven times in the last five six
[40:59.100 --> 41:01.260]  years that they've massed the aircraft carriers
[41:01.260 --> 41:04.860]  and us forces there's been a few french and british forces
[41:04.860 --> 41:09.900]  there are now the navies of 25 countries
[41:09.900 --> 41:17.980]  massing in the Strait of Hormush
[41:19.100 --> 41:24.220]  that's what's happening you've got armies massing you got b2 and b1 bombers
[41:24.220 --> 41:27.900]  dispatched them at least last week that's classified by the way which you
[41:27.900 --> 41:31.260]  just were told i confirmed it through two
[41:31.260 --> 41:34.780]  different sources one that saw it happen so then i called another source
[41:34.780 --> 41:38.540]  one of them wasn't even military they're probably listening right now
[41:38.540 --> 41:42.220]  then i called the other source they took off it
[41:42.220 --> 41:45.420]  out of their west texas base at what three a.m. till five a.m.
[41:45.420 --> 41:49.100]  to launch the whole wing and then i talked to my other source
[41:49.100 --> 41:52.940]  they're now sitting very close to the middle east i'll just leave it at that
[41:52.940 --> 41:55.900]  that's what's going on they don't move those things because
[41:55.900 --> 41:59.340]  they're good weapons systems the lancet the lancer
[41:59.340 --> 42:01.420]  but
[42:02.460 --> 42:05.740]  they're hard to hold together it's a good weapons platform it has a lot of
[42:05.740 --> 42:10.140]  technical problems and they're all massing ladies and gentlemen
[42:10.140 --> 42:15.660]  all massing all massing right now and you see all the articles about
[42:15.660 --> 42:19.260]  we've got to have a war with iran and they know the general european but
[42:19.260 --> 42:22.620]  even more so the average american or canadian
[42:22.620 --> 42:27.900]  will buy saying that iran is behind all this last year they tried saying iran
[42:27.900 --> 42:30.060]  was going to attack the saudi ambassador
[42:30.060 --> 42:33.820]  in in new york or dc remember that and that turned out to be a fraud
[42:33.820 --> 42:37.740]  so now they're trying it again by using the al-qaeda that saudi arabia and
[42:37.740 --> 42:41.580]  others controlled saudi arabia's big enemies with iran folks
[42:41.580 --> 42:47.420]  you see they know americans think oh there's just uh you know muslims over
[42:47.420 --> 42:51.740]  there they all want to kill us no there's there's 19 percent shiai
[42:51.740 --> 42:57.420]  80 percent sunni and then one percent alawait and a few other subsects that
[42:57.420 --> 43:00.940]  are really zoroastrian christians mixed
[43:00.940 --> 43:04.620]  together and you've got all these groups here
[43:04.620 --> 43:08.700]  and the average analyst in government doesn't even know all the groups
[43:08.700 --> 43:11.820]  i've been researching further and dr patrick was talking about this
[43:11.820 --> 43:15.020]  where the neocons don't even like cia
[43:15.020 --> 43:19.020]  or state department people that even have studied or have a degree
[43:19.020 --> 43:23.820]  in arabic studies and can even communicate with them
[43:23.820 --> 43:29.660]  they'll assassinate people who can even talk to arab's
[43:29.660 --> 43:35.340]  that's how dumb down even the power structure is
[43:35.340 --> 43:39.180]  so-called government experts and operatives don't even know what's going
[43:39.180 --> 43:43.020]  on it's a joke it's a bunch of lazy people
[43:43.020 --> 43:47.100]  that just want to cash their taxpayer paychecks and a bunch of corporations
[43:47.100 --> 43:51.500]  fat off taxpayer money who are delusional but why do you think the
[43:51.500 --> 43:54.940]  real generals and the real top cia analyst and
[43:54.940 --> 44:00.620]  massad analysts and others are saying don't do it don't attack iran
[44:00.620 --> 44:05.660]  don't do it bb don't do it
[44:07.820 --> 44:13.820]  the globalist faction at the top thinks that if they corner israel against the
[44:13.820 --> 44:17.100]  wall and if they corner the us against the wall
[44:17.100 --> 44:20.620]  that the overwhelming force will be forced into this class of civilization
[44:20.620 --> 44:25.580]  and this giant war that will fold russia intimidate china and make all the
[44:25.580 --> 44:30.380]  middle eastern countries kneel that is not going to happen
[44:30.380 --> 44:35.260]  empires don't really go to afghanistan to die
[44:35.260 --> 44:38.620]  quite a few have gone there where empires really go to die in the 20th
[44:38.620 --> 44:44.140]  century and the in the 19th century they go to russia to die
[44:44.140 --> 44:51.980]  that's where empires go empires go to russia to die
[44:51.980 --> 44:55.340]  and it's madness you look at john corezine
[44:55.340 --> 44:59.420]  40 to one bets on mf global other people's money thinking he'd win
[44:59.420 --> 45:03.100]  and then somebody over at goldman sacks they formally headed and jp morgan was
[45:03.100 --> 45:08.380]  really jp morgan screwed him there's not even honor amongst these
[45:08.380 --> 45:17.500]  people themselves they're crazy
[45:17.500 --> 45:20.460]  meanwhile while world war three is being prepared
[45:20.460 --> 45:28.140]  what's the federal government doing buying 1.4 billion bullets plus
[45:28.140 --> 45:31.340]  and when the public gets concerned you just put out a disinfo piece saying
[45:31.340 --> 45:36.380]  hey it's only 174 000 bullets never mentioning the other
[45:36.380 --> 45:44.860]  13 billion plus or 1 billion 300 million plus excuse me
[45:44.860 --> 45:49.100]  or do the math one point whatever it is billion
[45:52.060 --> 45:55.340]  the point is is that
[45:56.140 --> 45:59.820]  we're here we're here watching it about to happen again this time with nuclear
[45:59.820 --> 46:04.380]  and high-tech bio weapons chemical weapons uh it won't just be
[46:04.380 --> 46:06.860]  stage terrorists we're going to have to worry about
[46:06.860 --> 46:11.020]  there will undoubtedly be real acts of sabotage and asymmetrical warfare all
[46:11.020 --> 46:15.020]  over the place this is not going to be a good thing but the globalists are all
[46:15.020 --> 46:17.900]  dug in and have this planned they want the wrecking of
[46:17.900 --> 46:22.620]  civilization to happen like they funded hitler to wreck europe
[46:22.620 --> 46:26.220]  so that then they can roll in and reorganize the whole planet
[46:26.220 --> 46:31.020]  under their planetary regime and bring in their one world government where you're
[46:31.020 --> 46:35.820]  not allowed to criticize any religion based on the demand of 25 of the world
[46:35.820 --> 46:38.620]  the muslims
[46:38.700 --> 46:42.380]  you can see the whole adam visop plan coming into view
[46:42.380 --> 46:45.980]  a new world order out of these troubled times
[46:45.980 --> 46:49.980]  so government is gearing up and training the army and police
[46:49.980 --> 46:53.180]  not to fight al-qaeda who publicly works for them
[46:53.180 --> 46:58.700]  al-qaeda is just the backdrop of fear and who they used overthrow countries
[46:58.700 --> 47:02.300]  now
[47:03.500 --> 47:07.900]  they are gearing up and training the paramilitary system for a civil war in
[47:07.900 --> 47:11.260]  america and they can trigger it by not
[47:11.260 --> 47:15.100]  delivering the welfare checks they can trigger it by going after our guns
[47:15.100 --> 47:18.220]  and you have to understand the globalists are all in these armored redoubts
[47:18.220 --> 47:22.140]  they're all into these national security systems in these keeps
[47:22.140 --> 47:26.220]  in these fortresses in these castles in these um
[47:26.220 --> 47:31.500]  hardened facilities use the modern parlance
[47:33.100 --> 47:37.820]  and to them it's all beautiful this great time of wrecking
[47:37.820 --> 47:44.220]  just like us and british banks shent was at 18 000
[47:46.300 --> 47:50.140]  us citizens and others over into russia to bring it down
[47:50.140 --> 47:52.940]  and then instead of giving the people freedom from the czars they put something
[47:52.940 --> 47:57.660]  in probably 20 times worse and killed most the christians
[47:57.660 --> 48:01.180]  in ukraine other areas i mean the globalists have this planned here ladies
[48:01.180 --> 48:04.620]  and gentlemen and it's not pretty and thank god
[48:04.620 --> 48:09.740]  for george washington and thomas jefferson 236 years
[48:09.740 --> 48:14.140]  into the future the only thing we've got left a free man
[48:14.140 --> 48:18.460]  is our open exercise of the first amendment is like a habit
[48:18.460 --> 48:22.140]  and habits can work for you or against you but we we have such a habit
[48:22.140 --> 48:25.180]  of speaking our mind that all the intimidation
[48:25.180 --> 48:28.540]  cannot shut people up and folks are learning the truth so we have the first
[48:28.540 --> 48:31.900]  amendment god bless them we're going to break the
[48:31.900 --> 48:35.340]  change with that and god bless them we have the
[48:35.340 --> 48:39.580]  ancient right of any free man of weapons of armaments
[48:39.580 --> 48:43.260]  not to offensively use them my god we don't want to go to that
[48:43.260 --> 48:47.180]  but they're there nonetheless as a massive check
[48:47.180 --> 48:50.860]  and balance against the globalist hubris we are not the germans
[48:50.860 --> 48:55.980]  we are not the russians we are not the chinese when the cia put malcetongan
[48:55.980 --> 49:00.780]  and the cia put fidel castro in that's on record
[49:00.780 --> 49:05.500]  is the cia is the foreign banks folks it is sculling bones it is the illuminati
[49:05.500 --> 49:08.380]  look it up it was founded by sculling bones
[49:08.380 --> 49:14.300]  found out of england and germany chapter 322 it is here to bring this insane
[49:14.300 --> 49:17.820]  rage of of death and destruction upon us
[49:17.820 --> 49:21.180]  because it's what these people like this is their holiday
[49:21.180 --> 49:26.300]  this is their season this is their world this is their beauty this is their
[49:26.300 --> 49:30.060]  art their art is burning cities and starving children
[49:30.060 --> 49:35.820]  their art is piles of skulls and all their weak acolytes who seek after power
[49:35.820 --> 49:39.580]  have no idea that they won't be given the power they were promised
[49:39.580 --> 49:45.660]  they will be paint on the palette to be placed on the canvas
[49:45.660 --> 49:49.420]  you are going to have you're going to beg for god to protect you those of you
[49:49.420 --> 49:53.100]  that have served evil you're going to beg you're going to grind your teeth
[49:53.100 --> 49:56.860]  you're going to pull your hair out you're going to you're going to fall
[49:56.860 --> 50:01.820]  down on the ground and wish you hadn't been so wicked
[50:01.820 --> 50:05.980]  because you cowards have run to evil because you're afraid of it
[50:05.980 --> 50:09.260]  most of you i know your secret most of you that think you're really evil
[50:09.260 --> 50:13.900]  you're weak and pathetic you're not really truly evil
[50:13.900 --> 50:19.260]  you think evil's beautiful you're going to really get to get into the lake
[50:19.260 --> 50:22.540]  you're going to get to go for a swim in what you've been admiring
[50:22.540 --> 50:27.900]  from your little hilltop vantage point you like the smell of death you're
[50:27.900 --> 50:32.860]  going to get to drink out of that cup until your guts bust
[50:32.860 --> 50:36.940]  and i hope all of you like it because it's what you want
[50:36.940 --> 50:42.460]  it's what you get you want bio warfare you want
[50:42.460 --> 50:47.820]  chem warfare you want hydrogen weapons detonating over us cities
[50:47.820 --> 50:51.660]  you want world war three you want starvation
[50:51.660 --> 50:57.580]  you think death sexy you think skulls are pretty
[50:57.580 --> 51:00.780]  if we don't turn this around you're going to get to
[51:00.780 --> 51:04.940]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[51:04.940 --> 51:09.020]  the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in
[51:09.020 --> 51:12.860]  drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[51:12.860 --> 51:16.860]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[51:16.860 --> 51:20.300]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[51:20.300 --> 51:24.700]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[51:24.700 --> 51:28.620]  by getting your own supply of foods from eat foods direct now as the price of

[54:18.860 --> 54:23.180]  yeah i've been preaching today and we will go over all these articles when
[54:23.180 --> 54:27.020]  tarpoli gets on with us in the next hour then max kaiser joining us
[54:27.020 --> 54:31.980]  can't think of two better people to have on to break all this down
[54:31.980 --> 54:35.180]  but they are preparing to try to launch a global conflict
[54:35.180 --> 54:38.700]  that out of the crisis a new world order will be built on
[54:38.700 --> 54:41.820]  again i'll remind you of your new listener it has been openly announced
[54:41.820 --> 54:46.220]  that mega banks that created trillions over a thousand trillion
[54:46.220 --> 54:50.700]  in false assets sold and signed on to by governments
[54:50.700 --> 54:55.500]  have declared that we are their slaves in hundreds of financial publications
[54:55.500 --> 54:59.900]  and on television as a public notice they follow a law
[54:59.900 --> 55:05.260]  of telling you what they've done very esoteric
[55:05.260 --> 55:09.100]  and they have announced their domination of us they are now announcing the
[55:09.100 --> 55:14.380]  paramilitary occupation of the west by uh goon forces
[55:14.380 --> 55:18.540]  europe has tsa style goons also now showing up all over the highways
[55:18.540 --> 55:22.460]  to oppress the public their real target uh while telling you that they're doing
[55:22.460 --> 55:25.980]  it to protect you from al-qaeda that they publicly run
[55:25.980 --> 55:29.180]  now to get the united states behind an attack
[55:29.180 --> 55:33.660]  on um iran and syria probably syria first and then i ran
[55:33.660 --> 55:36.780]  by the way that's in the news today they're saying we've got to have boots
[55:36.780 --> 55:39.340]  on the ground i've got like six articles here
[55:39.340 --> 55:44.220]  we've got to have boots on the ground in syria because al-qaeda is there
[55:44.220 --> 55:47.660]  that's how dumb they think you are they land al-qaeda
[55:47.660 --> 55:53.500]  in helicopters and infiltrate them and exfiltrate them across the
[55:53.500 --> 55:58.140]  borders with jordan and turkey that's not debated now for eight months
[55:58.140 --> 56:01.900]  now they publicly are saying we've got a bomb aside
[56:01.900 --> 56:05.180]  to stop al-qaeda that our criminal government put in
[56:05.180 --> 56:08.300]  and they think the public is so stupid i sit there and talk to good old boys and
[56:08.300 --> 56:10.860]  they go i know it's true what you're saying i just
[56:10.860 --> 56:13.820]  still want to give my rights up because of al-qaeda
[56:13.820 --> 56:18.140]  i just am still i just and i'm like can't you aren't you smart enough to get
[56:18.140 --> 56:21.420]  this it's so over the top though i know
[56:21.420 --> 56:24.220]  things that are so simple or hard to understand i've actually found that in
[56:24.220 --> 56:28.700]  my life and it's so painful to see that we're
[56:28.700 --> 56:32.220]  going into this time all i know is we're here to the end hard core
[56:32.220 --> 56:35.260]  trying to warn people and i want to say this too
[56:35.260 --> 56:39.900]  like i'm going to start the show with us today i am not going to get into one
[56:39.900 --> 56:45.180]  side or the other of romney obama because at the top they're run by the
[56:45.180 --> 56:49.420]  same people but they need us to choose a side so that we're
[56:49.420 --> 56:53.500]  complicit in our own destruction and so we have this idea
[56:53.500 --> 56:58.700]  that oh well at least we had some choice so that we never focus on the real
[56:58.700 --> 57:03.100]  controllers it's a continuation of the policy
[57:03.100 --> 57:07.020]  to use al-qaeda to overthrow these middle eastern countries
[57:07.020 --> 57:10.700]  and al-qaeda like to take over egypt it's a continuation
[57:10.700 --> 57:14.220]  to then have al-qaeda kill the ambassador that's a false flag
[57:14.220 --> 57:19.340]  to get into iran to get into syria it doesn't even mean mit romney was behind
[57:19.340 --> 57:25.340]  it because the people behind mit romney are the ones behind obama
[57:25.340 --> 57:30.220]  they're trying to prod america into this iran war
[57:30.220 --> 57:33.580]  it's deeper than even what tarpoli says and i think when i bring that up he's
[57:33.580 --> 57:36.940]  going to have to admit it he's just playing politics
[57:36.940 --> 57:40.780]  with just because he thinks obama is better than romney by the way he
[57:40.780 --> 57:44.140]  he thought obama was horrible and was for mccain
[57:44.140 --> 57:47.020]  you see when you get up to this level of real analysis
[57:47.020 --> 57:51.420]  it isn't about parties anymore it's about what does the power structure want
[57:51.420 --> 57:55.180]  and you can believe whatever they want it's bad for us
[57:55.180 --> 58:01.260]  but it's even deeper than that obama is playing along with the official story
[58:01.260 --> 58:04.620]  that it was just random people that killed him and it was the film that did it
[58:04.620 --> 58:09.980]  that's what the neocons are putting out too for a clash of civilizations
[58:09.980 --> 58:13.180]  so i won't give obama cover in this because there's connections to the
[58:13.180 --> 58:17.260]  israelis and soly arabians in this like obama is is is better
[58:17.260 --> 58:20.700]  because they would do this to him they didn't do this to obama he's a puppet
[58:20.700 --> 58:24.700]  that reads off a teleprompter they did this to us the american people in europe
[58:24.700 --> 58:30.780]  to start a clash of civilizations a new jihad crusade
[58:30.780 --> 58:35.020]  attack against each other so the globalist can referee the whole thing
[58:35.020 --> 58:43.340]  and get everybody into deeper debt and take liberties

[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:11.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:17.580]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:23.900]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:29.980]  growing up as a child i could have never imagined
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:35.100]  that i would be in the position i'm in today able to reach tens of millions of
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.300]  people a week that does not puff up my ego it
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.700]  does the opposite it's an incredible responsibility
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.780]  and to know that we're all in this position now under a eugenics based
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.540]  world government with a cosmology of anti-civilization
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.460]  anti-human because we've had corrupt elites before
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.980]  but i can say this about the united states and i've studied it
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:03.660]  it has not been perfect but compared to other countries it's been the best
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:08.220]  and until the 60s our country really did try to build up other nations even
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.060]  countries they they took over and had an idea of a
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:16.940]  renaissance in a true enlightenment and was egalitarian there were a lot of
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.580]  evil people that operated within the system and there were some bad things
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.180]  that went on but we were a overall good society we were
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.740]  delusional we did some bad things to certain groups that were leftovers from
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:31.820]  ancient times but that happened in those times
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.020]  we're now talking about what was developing in the last 200 years
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:43.580]  and now to see the united states as a absolutely
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:49.100]  bankrupt culturally spiritually financially
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:57.180]  devoid of any honor system and to see the system actively waging war
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:02.620]  against everything good even if you're evil you should know that evil in
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:06.540]  society more effectively can survive and operate
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:11.660]  and hide behind good and that and that a system without good
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.740]  you know the illuminati would call it balance i don't believe in that but
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.580]  balance is real but not the idea of what we can do evil as long as we do good
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:24.140]  there's a balance so balance in the force you know you see this in
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.180]  in any kind of the establishment new age version and the rest of it
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:31.420]  but but but that's what that's what a lot of these people believe
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.460]  but i've studied the globalists as you get up higher into this they just believe
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:40.300]  in death of destruction you know a satanist thinks me me me all my power
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.500]  all my enjoyment i'm going to be a hedonist i'm going to be nihilistic
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.900]  eat drink be merry that's that's low level stuff
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.260]  the globalists are luciferians they think they're god
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:56.060]  they think they're becoming gods they uh think they're going to be gods they
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.660]  so they love transhumanism it ties into their cosmology that they're going to be
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.940]  god and all i see is a bunch of people
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:10.620]  disconnected from the universe all i see is a bunch of power tripping mad men
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.900]  who don't have real vision
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:18.300]  if you have real vision you know that you need to build civilization and
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.500]  enlighten and empower and that you need to build up
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.740]  and you need to fight the slide towards decadence and corruption and evil
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.260]  because it sucks everything into it and unless you really are committed to
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.980]  total death total destruction of our species
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.420]  the end of life on this planet then you should join good
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:41.660]  because evil is a con game and a lie
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.260]  that's all i can say there and that's why evil tries to confuse you
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.380]  and tell you thinking a woman is beautiful is evil
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:56.060]  no that's not that's god's design that's programming
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:00.620]  or you know flogging yourself with guilt for little things you do
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.540]  that's how the system controls you while they have no guilt they have no
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.620]  they have nothing to restrain them they are like a wild runaway train off the
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.260]  edge of a cliff we come back after this break i'm
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.780]  going to hit a few top news stories and go to webster griffin tarpley
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.300]  recap the top stories and we're going to break down
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.460]  where we left off last night where the world is financially
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.300]  right now and where he sees qe unlimited going
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.540]  defining that and then we'll get into the geopolitical ramifications because
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.220]  we know historically what these kleptocratic oligarchs do
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.420]  in their quest to dominate humanity they'll play all sides off against each
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:41.020]  other while posing as the moderators the saviors
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:47.980]  the referees over the conflagration that they themselves have engineered
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.380]  we will cover what is the most dangerous
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.700]  time in human development in history when we come back after this quick break
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.780]  i am alexander emrick jones
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.860]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.140]  the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.780]  corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:16.780]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.300]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.220]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.500]  prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.060]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.580]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply

[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:33.980]  the west has put al qaeda in the libya and syria and other areas publicly and that's the main force

[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:30.460]  will pull back and analyze what's going on and i agree with tarpley this has got neocon fingerprints
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:37.020]  on it neocon groups the same ones that upload the adam gadon fake al qaeda videos and the intel center
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:43.180]  uh video layer caught uh the same groups and this fbi informant producer of anti islam

[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.900]  bankrupting the countries by their operatives shining them on to the bank's debt bringing them
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:31.260]  into a europe where they had a super federal europe run by banks they're announcing global banks have
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.460]  conquered the united states they have engineered the collapse and are riding the collapse down

[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:54.140]  over russia i mean i mean this is this is madness this is people full of bravada hubris hootspo whatever
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:59.020]  you want to call it this is hitler turning into russia napolia turning into russia alexander
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:04.540]  the great going to afghanistan this is madness let me just read a few headlines we're going to
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:09.100]  tarply and then uh for five minutes the next hour and then max keiser joins us on the economic
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:15.580]  angle we're being fed this line of bull by obama's people that this was not coordinated and some
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:23.980]  protesters killed the navy seals and overrun the um the uh it's not an embassy it was a sub substation
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:30.620]  so we've got that going on we've got syrian rebels being funded by the west burning american flags
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:36.460]  and burning churches down headline info wars dot com syrian rebels burn american flag while obama
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:42.780]  sends the millions in taxpayer dollars x envoy to israel us will go to war when i ran in 2013
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:49.180]  why that news israel i'll all stop in flights to cairo increase numbers of foreign element jihadi
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:53.420]  groups operating in syria and i've got it in the stack six different articles we're going to cover
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.820]  where they say we've got to invade syria with boots on the ground nato does and bomb them
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:03.580]  because al qaeda is taking over man that's incredible our criminal government puts al qaeda in
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:08.700]  publicly hauls and freedom fighters and then says we got to invade because of al qaeda i mean this is
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:15.740]  a new level of order out of chaos operating on a public and a trance leading suny clerics demand
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:20.140]  global ban on insults to islam that'll be used to take all our free speech this whole you and
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:25.980]  global government plan to ban criticizing any religion europe party's done it we're in trouble folks
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:31.980]  google takes down our videos for no reason mildly criticizing government but is leaving this video
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:38.300]  up i'm not saying take it down but they're already censoring unbelievable it's part of a sigh of
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:43.660]  google's nsa that's on record iran's revolutionary guard commander says its troops are in syria
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:48.620]  that's roiders that's been known for months now they're just admitting it big proxy war russian
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:56.060]  spitznets iranian republican guard fighting al qaeda backed with british us and other special forces
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:02.860]  i mean this is insane and who did al qaeda kill under orders they killed the ambassador who
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.700]  do they work for they work for the criminals that run our government pakistanis try to storm
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:12.380]  us outpost one kill new york times israeli foreign minister us ignored arab radicalization ignored it
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:18.620]  it the united states israel and others run the radicalization israel created hamas 1973
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:25.180]  that's on record for islam post us is preparing for a long siege of arab unrest new york times
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:34.700]  head of uh president of um egypt calls for calm as protest grow says they're being funded by the
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:42.540]  less no kidding israeli leader makes case against iran on us tv all of this is designed stir the
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:48.140]  herbs up put al qaeda in get a civil war between shia and suni going just tell the american people
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.860]  hey that's al qaeda that's iran when iran's the opposite of al qaeda they're shiai and then say
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:59.340]  we gotta attack syria and iran because al qaeda is there and and it is true al qaeda is in syria
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:03.260]  they're in the news i'll dig it out of the stack saying we gotta have boots on the ground let's cover
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:07.500]  that first briefly with lebser terribly then we'll get into the economics then we'll tie it all
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.980]  together but webster i understand you were on yesterday and privately told me yes we've never
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:16.940]  been in a greater danger of an iran attack first syria world war three but you said i don't want
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.740]  to you know really go there because this is being used for political stuff let's just be honest
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:27.740]  geopolitically in a brief summation tying it all together up front what are we facing right now
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:34.300]  how dangerous is this period in the world what is the overall in just two minutes method to the
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:40.540]  megabanks anglo-american system program what is the end game what do they think they're going to
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:48.460]  get out of this well naturally the the war danger has been high and and remains high and it i think
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:55.500]  it focuses in particular on syria this the syrian civil war i guess by now it is a civil war really
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:02.940]  more of a of an invasion by these al-qaeda death squad proxy nato al-qaeda destabilization asymmetrical
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:07.900]  special forces attack program this this looks very much like the spanish civil war right the
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:17.020]  spanish civil war of 1936 to 1939 was the beginning of a clash between nazi germany fascist idli
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:22.700]  supporting franco and his fascists and then there was the spanish republic which was supported by
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:29.260]  the soviets and some others and you can see that was a kind of a prelude to to world war two and
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:35.820]  the spanish civil war ended in march of 1939 and then world war two began pretty much in in september
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:42.060]  so the danger is that however let's also take a step back i looked at that article in the daily
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:48.940]  telegraph and i just had to laugh when you see a headline that says british armada oh the british
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:56.300]  armada uh the massive british naval power in the gulf well this is a bad joke the british armada
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.940]  hasn't been sailing for quite a few centuries probably world war two probably the point is
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:06.060]  they mass ships before gulf one and two this has been done before that's fine on the other hand
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:12.220]  this is now this is ironic this is a scheduled exercise this is a drill now nobody knows better
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:19.180]  than i do that drills go live on the other hand the majority of drills do not go live right the
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:26.060]  majority of drills are drills it's the the one that comes along every now and then that goes live
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:30.380]  that is the one that you have to worry about but anyway we have to look at capabilities right you
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:36.380]  can't worry about intentions you have to look at capabilities and the capabilities for war are are
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:43.980]  certainly there it seems to me again that this focuses more on syria uh in the immediate sense
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:49.500]  than it does on iran if you're going to start a war with iran and i think the imperialist planners
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:56.220]  have seen this for quite a while you've got to eliminate syria above all because syria uh is a
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.660]  principal ally the really the only ally of iran in the arab world and you've got to do something
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:07.580]  about hezbollah because hezbollah is sitting there very close to israel and they have built up a
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:13.260]  tremendous capability with uh various kinds of missiles right they have the the sort of world
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:18.620]  war two type missiles but now they've got some pretty he got cut off hezbollah's supply lines
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:24.620]  from iran through syria so i think it's less likely that there's going to be a direct attack on
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:31.260]  iran until they have been thoroughly isolated and whether that works or not is now uh the big
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:36.700]  question so it seems to me there's a lot of psychological warfare and we can't always be
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:42.380]  preaching you know the end of the world for next week this doesn't work um i i would be
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:47.740]  a little bit skeptical about this hype that we see in the london daily telegraph and elsewhere
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:53.420]  because again it seems to me that let me let me stop you on that it was in 2006 or seven
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:59.580]  that i disagreed with you when you said the the iran war was on and i said it wasn't we had a big
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:04.780]  fight over that and i said it wasn't on at that time you do remember that correct yes and i'll tell
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:10.620]  you what's what stopped it then was when uh when putin made his trip to tehran and got photographed
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:16.780]  with akhman dina jad uh okay so exactly so my point is the biggest we have stopped this from
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:22.540]  happening we have stopped this from happening we we yeah we have done something well the american
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:28.860]  people yeah no the russian government the putin the the main person the biggest factor for peace
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:33.420]  in today's world is putin and there's no other way to cut it and don't be embarrassed to say so
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:39.100]  you don't have to have provides those about not liking putin like him like him or or hate him
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:44.460]  putin is the big factor for peace because he's the only one who deters the anglo americans
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:49.980]  he provides cover for the chinese and he allows this these other countries to sort of follow along
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:55.420]  and build sure and we all know why putin's involved because the road to moscow goes through
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:01.660]  demascus in tehran we'll be right back it's all grand chessboard stay with us the worst drought
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:07.180]  in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:12.380]  percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:17.340]  vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:22.220]  farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:27.580]  is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:32.380]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the

[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:25.820]  incredible mind i'm not trying to get to fight with him here uh as we went to break
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:30.780]  you know saying you know he's like hey let's not say you know we're gonna have into the world i'm
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:36.540]  not saying that then i'm like hey webster you thought back what was in in 2007 that it was imminent
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:44.620]  going to happen and it was and i see the same parallels but then some you've got open talk of
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:51.580]  the japanese and china heading towards war says us defense secretary leon panetta regardless that's
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:59.340]  an amazing headline you've got chinese leaders disappearing you've got uh coups going on zero
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:05.020]  hedge has an excellent article we've got up at info wars dot com a world on the verge and i'm
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:09.900]  going to cover this a little bit the next segment before we get into the economics uh here my point
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:15.580]  is webster the average american isn't even paying attention to what's going on to the point of thinking
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:21.580]  oh we've got to give our rights up al qaeda and i'm just pointing out al qaeda is this jihadi brigade
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:26.940]  of the globalist and i know of course you've helped expose that for decades so i'm just trying to
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:33.820]  understand here uh what is going on i mean tell us what you think is happening militarily i mean
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.860]  are you saying we shouldn't be concerned yes you have to be concerned but but again i think it's
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:43.260]  important to restate the framework also for your radio listeners who might not have heard heard the
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:48.460]  conversation yesterday i would say this is the romney campaign in other words if you want to
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:53.820]  know who's blowing up the middle east right now the romney campaign is doing that and the romney
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:59.340]  campaign means not some little group of people in boston who put out press releases and schedule
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:04.460]  campaign events but it means this complex of forces in particular in the intelligence
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.740]  community that want romney in and obama out and that seems to be the majority of the
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:15.580]  or at least the you know the most active part of the intelligence community it goes to the cia
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:23.500]  mormon mafia there's a cia mormon mafia as an fbi mormon mafia the the cia mormon mafia would
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:30.620]  come into it in the following way the ambassador in libya who happened to be at the consulate in
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:38.700]  ben gazi or actually at a safe house attached to the consulate in ben gazi was killed by this group
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:46.780]  called ansar al sharia as far as can be told so ansar al sharia is just the libyan islamic
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:52.780]  fighting group or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb under a new name and the head of that is this
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:27:00.300]  guy kumu and i've i wrote about kumu a year and a half ago kumu was part of the islamic emirate
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:06.940]  of dorna in other words a terrorist principality that have been created by this guy hasidi hasadi
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:11.500]  bel haj all these guys have multiple names the groups have multiple names you have to get used
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:18.460]  to this they're all moving targets but this this kumu appears to have given the order or
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:23.500]  actually carried it out himself so that his professionally trained veterans who have been
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:30.140]  fighting in libya a lot of them have been fighting in syria they went and killed ambassador stevens
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:36.300]  not even at the consulate as i understand it but at this uh nearby safe house now kumu was in
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:43.900]  guantanamo for five years he was trained he was uh prepared for his new career the only way you get
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:49.980]  out of guantanamo is if you swear that you're going to do what the cia tells you to do from then on
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:55.260]  for the rest of your life and that's what kumu undoubtedly did no they've had suicide bombers
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:28:00.460]  everything they come out of there they admittedly have a cia base within the base where they engage
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:06.860]  this is even mainstream news in mind control drugging they've got drugs where they can stop
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.740]  your heart and and then sit there and have you beg well i mean i'm just incredible what they do
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:19.340]  right so so if kumu kills ambassador stevens the question has to go to the cia and i would say in
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:26.220]  particular to the cia mormon mafia the the people in the cia who feel that their careers will be
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:31.500]  favored by romney and they will because they will be unbelievable mormon nepotism look i gotta say
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:37.100]  this webster i want to get into the economy we covered this for you know half an hour yesterday
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:41.580]  that's fine to get into mormon mafia all this other stuff we've already said it but this was doing it
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:45.740]  no no i know we covered it yesterday i want to get into the economy when we come back but
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:51.740]  here's the deal you were against obama now you're against romney how can it's all against the ruling
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:57.180]  class i'm against the ruling class and their main line now here's the other problem we have
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:03.820]  if if you want to take power you need to have a political movement an independent political
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:09.260]  movement with a program to take power if you're not ready to take power you're automatically
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:15.340]  reduced to trying to maneuver between two or three or whatever they are existing alternatives so
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:21.260]  we needed to be building an independent alternative over the last that didn't happen
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:27.020]  and it didn't happen so now we're reduced again to you know trying to see which is the more dangerous
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:32.620]  i would say romney is the more danger at this point simply because he's surrounded by these neocons
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:37.820]  he has no clue what i'll tell you what let's come back let's come back let's we gotta break these
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:42.860]  are hard breaks come back and do five minutes on romney again but then i really want your take
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:48.460]  you're an economist a good one i want your take on the qe unlimited that's why you're back today

[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:28.940]  something we don't know it goes on and on that's an info wars dot com a war on the verge
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:35.340]  in the middle east a world of the verge of war that's the question all right terribly
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.820]  you got the floor until we end the shower take it away with romney and what you really think's
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:43.580]  happening i respect your view doesn't mean i totally agree with it but it may be the case
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:48.860]  the system certainly starting to turn against obama at certain levels and you know in the
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:53.820]  media normally that's lapdog is like really grilling them on these ridiculous statements that
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:58.780]  you know the few protesters killed the ambassador in the navy seals ambassador susan rise libya
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:03.980]  tech not premeditated what does that mean why does the system want romney in your view and then
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:09.420]  please give us your breakdown on where the world financial system is right now and where you see
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:16.620]  qe going in the future well the uh the wall street establishment it seems uh wants romney he's
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:22.220]  he's one of them after all he's a hedge fund hyena he's a corporate raider he's a uh a vulture
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:27.820]  capitalist and he's the kind of guy that will not only give them what they want in terms of loot
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:33.740]  which obama has largely done but he'll also give them the honor in society that obama can't give
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:38.780]  them because it would screw up obama's relations with his own base they they generally object to
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.980]  obama not so much for what he does but for what he says right he's obama's got to cover his left
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:49.420]  flank by uh by bad mouthing wall street and they don't want that anymore they want everything they
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:55.580]  want the loot and the honor they want to be hailed as the saviors of the of the country so we've gone
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:40:02.140]  through i think that without the cia and without that cia mormon mafia i would i would strongly
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:10.060]  guess you couldn't have kumu and that group of uh let's say guantanamo trainees uh coming to kill
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:18.460]  the ambassador stevens in uh in ben gazi notice that the extreme reactionaries and neocons are now
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:25.260]  putting out that the ambassador was homosexual as if this somehow made this less of a crime it's a
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:31.420]  very very strange thing so you'd have to look at uh homophobic forces in the intelligence community
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:37.180]  i think it takes us back to precisely that same group so uh you mentioned the national security
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:43.980]  agency or should i say google uh you mentioned google refusing to take down this uh this uh
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:51.580]  stupid scurrilous uh film um they have merged practically with the nsa as you pointed out
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:57.580]  and let's not forget dan senior who is now one of the top advisors to the romney campaign dan
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:03.740]  senior is the guy who tells paul ryan what to say what to do on foreign policy dan senior
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:09.420]  was attached to uh to google i think in a pretty high uh post the other side of it that i think is
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:15.420]  important is where does this film come from uh forget about sam basile forget about this character
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:22.780]  nakula nakula that's the same person allegedly this is a little fish this is some kind of a drug
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:30.220]  pusher who's gone into a deal with the feds and he's therefore a controlled witness no he's the
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:37.180]  classic snitch that they use to put people in prison he's a classic cutout right but he's not
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:42.140]  this is not the essential person the person who actually signed for the for the permit to make
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:48.380]  the film and put out the casting call and actually had the premises the studio where this was done
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:55.660]  is this other guy nazrallah and nazrallah is a coptic christian the christians of egypt uh
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:42:01.740]  are the cops and he's a big coptic activist and then we get right to the to the main uh issue
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:08.140]  which is he's part of this thing called the islamophobia network and this has been written
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:14.060]  up there's a there's a study of this by the center for american progress just look up islamophobia
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:18.540]  network and you'll you'll get all the names of these people a lot of people wouldn't would know
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:25.260]  pamela geller she's sort of the chairwoman of this thing uh it's international they have gert
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:31.900]  wilders in holland a racist politician who just lost the elections at the beginning of last week
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:38.780]  and they have something called uh stop the islamization of america s i o a and then they
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:47.580]  have another one called then this is funny stop the islamization of nations s i o n so zion zion
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:53.820]  same difference i guess but you can see what this is this is a this is a uh a group of uh
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:58.860]  people i think motivated by uh by hatred right they're islamophobic but they're islamophobic
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.980]  with with a very definite uh agenda and one of the people in this group the thing that makes
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:09.420]  this most important is that john bolton appears at their rallies right they had a they had a rally
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:15.900]  this was the group that that put up a big fight about this uh mosque near ground zero near the
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:21.420]  former world trade center in lower manhattan in in august and september of 2010 they were
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:26.780]  feeling their oats they had a big conference nasrallah was a speaker the cop to essentially
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:33.980]  made the movie and then uh ambassador bolton right uh or secretary bolton now bolton is the
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:40.860]  guy who would probably be secretary of state for romney so he's meshed with these scurrilous
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.740]  individuals in the islamophobia network so i think that's pretty clear right that this that
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:51.820]  you can look at it and say this movie or trailer or whatever it is is a production of the romney
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:57.100]  campaign they did this and i think it would be important for media to uh to delve into this
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:03.740]  more because it's a it's a real scandal otherwise all of the other rioting and stuff is either
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:09.340]  spontaneous because you know there there is this capability to get these things going in a spontaneous
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:16.780]  way or it's uh the cia or you know british or nato network saying let's let's go let's go out in
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:23.020]  the streets now a couple of things that could be at work here since the person involved making the
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:29.980]  movie against muhammad is a coptic christian this sets up something really serious for egypt right
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:36.620]  coptic christians are about 10 of the population of egypt if you get some kind of an explosion there
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:42.060]  that could become really really bloody and really really ugly and that would destabilize egypt that
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:47.820]  would essentially be a civil war in egypt and that may be what these anglo-american lunatics are
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:53.740]  looking for the other thing which i think is is extremely important is you have to remember that
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:45:03.820]  saudi arabia and cutter and bachrain and kuwait and oman and probably jordan and and morocco also
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:09.580]  the monarchies of the arab world these are reactionary monarchies absolute monarchies but
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:17.660]  especially saudi arabia bachrain and maybe cutter but those that group the the gulf they are on the
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:23.420]  verge of revolution and this would be a real revolution this would not be a fake color revolution
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:29.340]  a fake arab spring that doesn't change anything sure remember a revolution means an institutional
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:35.740]  change you overthrow a monarchy that's a revolution you you end slavery that's a revolution right but
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:40.780]  in this case they probably have both right they have household slavery as well as as well as absolute
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:47.820]  monarchy one of the effects of changing the subject uh is is to help the uh the saudi royal
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:53.740]  house frankly as long as people are running around saying freedom and democracy freedom and democracy
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:59.660]  human rights that's really bad for the saudi uh monarchy right that puts the tremendous pressure
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:06.380]  on them as well as on these fakers and bachrain right the uh the the the uh royal family there
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:12.780]  and then the ones in cutter right who do al jazeera al jazeera right trumpets human rights
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:17.420]  and democracy to the world and that's an absolute monarchy with nobody just stop you and singing
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:21.740]  ends had their own producers quit and say when they're in cutter and they're machine gunning
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:27.260]  men women and children singing in will not let that go on the news a little cia anderson cooper
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:33.020]  the twit but let's just let's just stop but i'm sure but let me inject this to finish the point
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:41.180]  just just the ideas these these countries uh these monarchies use anti-israeli anti-us as as a as a
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:45.580]  way to keep themselves in power in other words if i'm out there demonstrating against the house of
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:50.140]  sahud that's bad for the house of so what they can say now is go out and demonstrate against the
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:56.140]  us of course go out you know those infidels they're no good this is a way to relieve the tremendous
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:47:02.460]  pressure building up on the saudi monarchy and these these crazy uh absolute uh monarchies and
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:07.660]  these gulf emirates no i agree with you and this is my next point we've got to get into the economy
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:12.940]  tarply i really want to get your take on that doc is that people ask why the west helped trigger
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:18.300]  some of the first parts of the air of spring that was because with their google uh predictive
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:25.020]  programming they admit that they know when dollar devaluation globally causes food prices to go up
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:29.740]  where people are making two bucks a day on average and 60 percent of their money goes to food
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:35.260]  you're not just now hungry you're starving that's going to cause unrest so they want to trigger it
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:42.060]  to try to direct it and so that's why they've tried to have it be a a sunni-based you know
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:48.300]  saudi arabian backed takeover and have it be sectarian revolution instead of economic revolution
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:53.980]  do you agree with that statement uh let me just correct a couple of things the reason the price
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:59.980]  of oil goes up and the reason the price of food goes up is speculation speculation speculation
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:06.220]  which is dollar devaluation no it's not the same thing it's direct speculation in these markets
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:11.820]  using derivatives sure but uh but but the q e's has has also made prices go up globally that's not
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:17.660]  debated um i did nobody's willing to admit none of none of the people writing in these in these
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:23.340]  financial newspapers i don't care if they don't admit it there is inflation caused by the monetization
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:28.620]  of debt yeah but the the main reason those prices are going up is because of credit derivatives
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:32.780]  and other derivatives that are used yeah but because dollars aren't worth anything everybody's
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:37.900]  rushing into farmland and food and all that that's also compounding it yeah but i don't think that's
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:42.060]  the main okay but let's not argue about little bitty points get into the economy where is it
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:46.860]  globally okay go ahead where is the economy worldwide right now with this announcement of
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:53.100]  unlimited qe yeah again i i think for the average person a certain amount of inflation is a good
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:58.780]  thing i think optimum inflation for the us right now would be five to seven percent we've got the
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:05.420]  american people crushed by one trillion dollars of consumer debt crushed by one trillion dollars of
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:10.940]  so you like the federal reserve policy of no i just think this emphasis on inflation gets gets
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:16.540]  nobody anywhere this is uh this is a you know sort of an austrian school red herring well i agree
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:20.780]  that it's not going to be that much inflation because the money's being transferred to elites
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:25.420]  and and to buy up bad paper it's being hoarded right we know there's a capital strike there's a
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:30.380]  capital strike where the american corporations are hoarding a couple of trillion dollars which
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:37.740]  they refuse to invest how about a nice uh tax on undistributed profits to give why don't these crazy
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:42.700]  corporations invest and get people going do they think they're really going to get out of a violent
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:48.300]  revolution in this country and people rioting i mean it's just crazy yeah they should be investing
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:53.580]  in productive investment plant and equipment new jobs new technology but they don't do this now let
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:50:00.140]  let's look at this qe you got to imagine the world economy or let's say the us economy the us economy
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:06.140]  is the victim of a vampire attack or we might want to say a zombie attack and the zombie attack in
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:13.580]  2007 2008 again was done with derivatives derivatives collateralized debt obligations credit default
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:18.300]  swaps these kinds of things and this is also what's what's used to drive up the uh the the uh the
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:25.900]  raw material prices since then we've had count Dracula has had his fangs in our throat and he's
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:33.020]  sucking our blood and the the answer that the federal reserve has had is what you'd call a
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:40.220]  hot money stimulus and it just says we're going to flood the banking system with with cheap money
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:44.780]  zero percent in most cases let's just stand there we gotta go to break it's a it's a hard break you
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:48.620]  know you're on the genesis network we got to go to break right here a network break we'll be right
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:52.860]  back with lefster griffin tarpley on the other side to break down exactly what's happening with qe
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:51:03.180]  unlimited he's the vampire slayer there he is von helzing the worst drought in 50 years continues
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:08.380]  and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest

[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:19.020]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business

[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:28.540]  short segment the one little segment coming up then max keiser is joining us to get into the economy
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:34.060]  in depth uh you were making the point about the vampire uh yeah it has been has been sucking on
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:40.060]  us lovingly uh telling us that uh we've got a vampire on us because we're we're bad people
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:44.620]  and but but if we'll just give the vampire more blood he'll fix everything so this this vampire
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:49.900]  is a black hole no amount of blood will ever satisfy the undead well as you said you you
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:55.340]  coined the term i think zombie banks 10 years ago or i i think that's attributed to you zombies
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:55:00.220]  are quite popular now so maybe it's fitting we're ruled by zombie banks uh webster look the the
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:06.620]  count Dracula metaphor goes like this we were attacked by count Dracula the vampire in 2007 2008
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:12.140]  and ever since then he's got his fangs in our throat now along comes Bernanke and Bernanke
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:18.860]  says oh let's give a transfusion to the poor victim except they don't give the transfusion directly
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:24.780]  into the victim us the economy they give the transfusion to count Dracula so they say let's
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:32.620]  we'll we'll we'll pipe the blood in through count Dracula and we'll make his fangs go into reverse
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:37.180]  and that blood will then arrive into the victim it doesn't work because of the black hole because
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:43.340]  of what you just said the mass of kited bankrupt derivatives in the zombie banks in the too big
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:50.540]  to fail uh money-centered banks of wall street absorbs all the liquidity uh or they take hot
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:56.460]  money that's what what the fed is generating the hot money flees overseas it goes to the
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:03.740]  hottest speculative market right be it koala lumpur or war saw or whatever it is it flies there
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:09.260]  so this is this is what also brings down the uh the dollar the dollar is weakened to some degree
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:13.420]  because of the of the effects so where is it headed you agree with Kaiser that we're gonna
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:18.700]  have a huge implosion by next April now let's see but let's just go through what the alternatives
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:24.060]  are what could you do to fight this depression one is have an immediate deflationary crash right
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:29.100]  that's what Ron Paul wanted he said let's go back to the good old days of the crash of 1920
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:34.780]  that brought the world Mussolini i'm sorry that's not a good good good one then we have
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:42.540]  a uh consumer led Keynesian stimulus which is pretty much what the the stimulus right the
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:49.500]  Obama Pelosi stimulus of 2009 paying off all their friends that's better it that has some effect
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:54.620]  but ultimately as soon as because racial mad out does does go out and buy some pants and
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:59.740]  uh you know things like that i mean there were things there were i said the main thing in there
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:06.220]  that was good was aid to the states so that the states could maintain their payrolls of policemen
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:11.900]  firemen teachers and people that we need to keep human civilization going but unfortunately that
[01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:17.740]  doesn't get you an economic recovery then the third the third possibility is this hot money
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:23.260]  which is what the fed has been doing i want the fourth possibility my fourth possibility is this
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:30.060]  take that q e three take that money and it's practically zero percent and use that to buy
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:36.860]  bonds from american states that want to build hard infrastructure but that would actually build
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:41.100]  america we can't do that that would yeah but that's what you want that's what we should be
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:47.100]  campaigning for not to abolish the fed no don't abolish the fed we nationalize it nationalize
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:51.820]  it well yeah they take the power of the purse back into congress and then give that to the states
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:55.660]  yeah it's not even the power of the purse right the power of the purse is in the treasury
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:58:00.860]  we need a national bank and the national bank in the west of the congress controls the power of
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:05.100]  the purse as you know yeah and that's what that's the way this should be in other words the treasury
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:10.140]  is one thing under congress but that doesn't let them pick winners and losers they'd rather rule
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:15.340]  a pile of skulls than live in paradise could be picking winners and losers in this sense you'd
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:21.340]  be saying zero percent credit does not go to zombie banks hedge fund hyenas anymore we've tried it
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:25.500]  for the past four years brennanke has been offered oh no they won't even give federal
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:29.420]  they won't even give the federal contracts of small businesses and the law says they should
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:32.620]  hey just stay there webster one more minute i want you to have five more minutes to finish

[02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:37.100]  know you're trying to get out solutions here and i gotta say you're gonna have quantitative easing it
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:42.060]  should go to the states and it should go to zero percent loans to the public instead of foreign
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:46.620]  banks that have hijacked our country i mean what you're saying is true i cannot disagree with you
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:51.740]  you're a hundred percent right and i want to have you back up you know things are so important
[02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:57.820]  right now if you want to come back on i'm taking off friday to take my son bird hunting i promise
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:04.860]  team forever but uh if you'd like to come on sometime next week or maybe even wednesday or
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:09.340]  thursday or something we'll see you know to continue just on solutions we did that a few weeks ago
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:13.340]  for an hour and a half people really enjoyed that talk on info works nightly news but
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:18.620]  i understand you're trying to put out solutions here but talking to you privately i mean i really
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:24.140]  want your view on this geopolitically where is the world right now i mean i see all the parallels
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:28.060]  everywhere everybody's going into conflict because of the economic depression i mean
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:33.020]  where is the world we are in a global depression or is it a global recession and how bad is the
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:37.900]  danger going into next year i asked you the time frame on on further collapse and you came up with
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:44.300]  solutions look i get you want to give a solutions i want your i want your prognosis on the economy
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:49.820]  the reason i do this is because doom sayers are a dime a dozen right every new every little
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:54.860]  newsletter has some prediction of the end of the world you're not a dime a dozen i want what you
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:59.660]  think people really people want solutions that's the the whole world history depends on getting
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:06.540]  out of a depression and that takes solutions um i would say right now we've got uh the qe3
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:12.940]  from bernanke coming into play on the european side we've got dragy and his pledge to provide
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:21.900]  support for euro bonds um you know there's always a danger when you go into september october
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:26.780]  and this the the transition from the third quarter the fourth quarter that can always blow up under
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:32.780]  these depression conditions but let's just uh where are we in a broader sense you're in this
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:40.460]  three-part process right depression dictatorship world war and we've got symptoms of all three
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:45.820]  all around us it's not coming in a neat you know one two three these these parts the phases
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:53.100]  interpenetrate unfortunately um so we've got to we've got to break out of this one of the effects
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:59.900]  of the depression part is that the anglo-american ruling class is more insane than they usually are
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:05.820]  and they're looking for utopian solutions in particular i would say the uh consultative
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:11.900]  congress conference the the the essentially the friends of syria that met in tehran iran
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:17.980]  about a month ago with 30 countries representing really more than half the world right russia china
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:26.140]  india indonesia pakistan and iran syria all kinds of countries the the isolation of iran
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:33.100]  has not worked and we've we've just had the non-aligned conference in tehran with what 130 135
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:39.260]  countries coming together uh in tehran and and and uh they're talking about world affairs in
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:45.180]  various ways the isolation of iran has not worked for the anglo-american ruling class they would
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:52.140]  have to say maybe they've come to the point of diminishing returns with the color revolution
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:04:01.500]  strategy maybe it's time to go back to the war strategy the mad dog neocon fascist aggressor
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:06.540]  stance that we had under under bush cheney and again all those guys are grouped around
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:11.020]  obama uh sorry they're grouped around they're grouped around romney they're grouped around
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:15.820]  both of them but it's like a don king fight oh no if you look at these individuals the neocons the
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:21.660]  hardcore ideological neocons they're with romney not with obama they're not with obama look at them
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:26.700]  again you've got uh you've got uh john bolton you've got dan senior you've got robert kagan
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:30.700]  robert joseph well that's what patronik says he says if they get back in they're gonna stage new
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:38.460]  nine elevens yeah if if if romney comes in on the on the 20th of january he may invade syria on
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:44.140]  february first i mean you'll have a hundred days of war with romney a vote for romney is a vote for
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:49.740]  netanyahu his bosom buddy since 1976 all right we're gonna have to talk about this next time

[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:34.220]  we are live ladies and gentlemen into another hour just had dr webster riff and tarpley on
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:38.780]  breaking down the geopolitical ramifications of what's happening in the middle east africa and
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:49.500]  central asia and beyond and of course we're now looking forward into 2013 and what is happening with
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:54.780]  the us dollar and other currencies qe unlimited announced so the federal reserve kept their
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:09:00.940]  promise in a sick way they said no qe three they promised a year and a half ago now it's qe unlimited
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:07.180]  unlimited further trillions 85 billion a month the media is saying 40 billion it's actually
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:12.620]  85 billion a month to buy up derivatives and things from golden sacks jp morgan wells fargo
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:18.140]  bank of america usual suspects and then the news liberal and conservative gets up there and tells
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:22.220]  you it's your debt you're lazy and you're not working enough even though americans work more
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:28.460]  than anybody in this world now unless you're a poor chinese slave in a sweatshop average american
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:34.300]  has two and a half jobs and less to show for it and many economists say we've lost more wealth and
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:40.060]  you know any other point in history and it's happening worldwide because the system is kleptocratic
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:46.380]  they want the casino gulag model that our next guest coined that term that is what they want
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:52.380]  and it's important to understand that the globalists are waging war against liberty and freedom
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:59.900]  period whether it's obama whether it's mit romney the same power structure there's different arms of
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:06.940]  it different groups but they basically all want the same thing and as a society we have to wake
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:12.220]  up to this and understand that they're going to pose as the saviors when they are the engineers
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:19.900]  the authors of the economic situation that we're entering now i want to be clear about this my
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:25.420]  friends when you bring in the geopolitical analysis and you bring in the west funding al-qaeda
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:31.500]  and putting them in libyan syria to destabilize those countries when you look at the west clearly
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:37.980]  allowing the killing of the ambassador to hype up anti-islamic fear to be projected on syria and
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:42.540]  iran even though they're not the authors of it i'm not defending them either it's just that it's
[02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:51.900]  known the west is running al-qaeda not syria and uh and iran show that they can give israel cover
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:56.540]  that is elements in israel to launch a war on iran then you've got to ask why why do they want that
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:11:02.940]  well they claim because iran wants to nuke them so it's a very very dangerous period we're in to
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:08.780]  say the least and we need to force real issues out there the articles that you see it info wars
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:16.460]  dot com and prison planet dot com are absolutely essential tracking every angle as it unfolds
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:21.900]  it is so important that people actually understand al-qaeda is run by the west
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:26.060]  here's some of the latest headlines is dhs preparing for false flag attack on american
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:31.740]  shopping malls neocons engineering october surprise question mark new york time spends new video of

[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:47.740]  rebels burn american flag while obama sends the millions of taxpayer money a world on the verge
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:55.340]  of war the world's already in war zero hedge that is just some of what we've got up there israeli
[02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:02.140]  envoy us will go to war in iran in 2013 how kiwi here will make the wealthy even wealthier while
[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:10.940]  causing living standards to fall for the rest of us that is just some of the news at prison
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:16.300]  planet dot com and info wars dot com now understand before we go to max kaiser we're going to him here
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:20.300]  momentarily joining us from europe part of the times he's in paris part of the time in london
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:26.700]  we'll have to ask him where he's uh where we've called his skype id from before we go to london
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:32.860]  before we go to max keiser you have to understand i'm the expert in the police state and in the
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:39.340]  covert takeover of local police the spy networks that's where i've done 17 years of research
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:44.140]  and in pioneering areas i bring you other pioneers like max keiser the inventor of the
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:48.700]  virtual stock exchange system used on most markets today i bring you people like tarpley i bring you
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:53.260]  dr paul craig roberts former head of the treasury and policy charlotte israeli had a policy department
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:58.860]  education you know ron paul you name it we bring all these experts on with with some different views
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:06.940]  but it pretty much converges on where reality's at and you need to understand that what what adds to
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:10.460]  this the reason i know we're in deep trouble because we're always hearing about iran war always
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:14.300]  hearing about collapse we're always hearing about this we know the globalists want this to be
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:21.180]  incremental but the 1.4 billion bullets the checkpoints the martial law preparations uh the
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:27.100]  digging in by governments all of this is set up to handle a foreign world war three scenario but
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:33.260]  also a domestic takeover using a global crisis as the pretext to take over domestically they've
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:37.980]  lined it all up the spies the checkpoints the reeducation centers i'm not trying to scare you
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:42.300]  i believe you have courage and will then speak out so this doesn't happen because our only hope
[02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:48.620]  is stopping it that said that's why i'm so concerned because it's more converging than just economics
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:55.340]  and al-qaeda and israel and elections there is a fundamental shift towards hot tyranny taking
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:14:00.860]  place not just here but in every industrialized country under this unified corporatist system
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:07.100]  that's anti-liberty so people better get smart people better get wise faster it's all over
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:12.140]  you've heard my basic breakdown max add any points you have to this max keiser dot com
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:19.740]  uh tv host on bbc press tv rt you name it break down your take on what i was just
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:25.180]  basically set in the table with and then let's get into qe unlimited and i guess this really
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:30.300]  adds credence to your collapse hypothesis by april of next year we're already in somewhat of a
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:35.740]  collapse but you're seeing a total collapse and define what that is max keiser thank you for joining
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:42.300]  us yeah it's great to be here yeah 28 weeks to go uh during that 20 next 28 week period
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:48.300]  looking for a total collapse i've put my my flag i planted my flag and i'm going to stick with that
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:55.100]  with that with that prediction but to follow up on this casino gulag i just sent you a story
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:15:01.180]  because there's something new that i think you need to look at uh corrections core of america
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:06.380]  which is the biggest private prison operator in america they're listed on the stock exchange
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:12.780]  they're going around america from state to state they're getting the local state governments to
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:21.580]  give them the business of running the prisons in the states in exchange that the states have to
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:29.100]  guarantee 90 occupancy rate at the prisons which means that the states have to go out and arrest
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:35.820]  people to put them into the prison at per a deal that they've made with the present prison operator
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:41.420]  to take over the prisons from the state so that's part of the casino gulag you've got the state and
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:47.660]  the corporation making a deal to they build they guarantee 90 occupancy and the only way they can
[02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:52.620]  do that is if you tell the police just go arrest people doesn't matter what if they're guilty or
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:57.740]  not just arrest them put them into jail because that's what the deal says and that's that's sweeping
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:04.300]  the nation from coast to coast in america private prison on the casino front you've got zinga which
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:10.220]  is a virtual currency company they are now aggressively transforming themselves to be able
[02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:16.140]  to do legal online gambling that's something i've been telling you will happen their business model
[02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:22.060]  so far was a trojan horse it's not a very good business model unless you work up to the point
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:28.060]  where you're doing online gambling which is what they're going to be doing now basically in the
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:33.260]  uk right now in london they're going to offer online gambling uh gambling is already legal in
[02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:38.300]  europe already legal in the uk so they'll be making money doing the gambling so the gulag casino
[02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:47.580]  economy is is is moving forward and that's the big trend i see going forward and um
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:53.740]  um yeah the the breakdown the quantitative easing quantitative easing uh to infinity and
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:17:00.060]  this being called 40 billion dollars a month uh month after to buy back mortgage back securities
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:06.060]  the the federal reserve system has basically capitulated to the speculators there's no
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:12.140]  pretense now about doing anything constructor for the economy they only do what's best for
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:18.700]  speculators speculators have huge losses on their books and to bail the speculators or the too big
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:26.780]  to fail banks as some call them the reserve is now guaranteeing zero interest rates until 2015
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:33.980]  and to buy every losing bet on the books of the banks that they have now every losing bet that
[02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:38.540]  they'll make going forward for the next three years the fed will buy it the fed will do this by
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:45.420]  swapping treasury bills for bad debts bad bonds and expanding their balance sheet from two trillion
[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:52.460]  to three trillion to five trillion and they keep increasing that which you could call a black hole
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:59.020]  of debt which has to be paid in the way that it's paid in countries around the world is by imposing
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:05.820]  austerity measures that's where the nickels and dimes are collected to pay off the debt for the
[02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:11.420]  swap that's being made and max the fed yeah and max even though this is destructive that's the
[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:17.500]  method of the madness they admit it's a post-industrial system where they're expanding their profit
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:24.140]  while destroying you to make you poor so they so they can control you and you mentioned the
[02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:30.860]  incredible immorality and corruption of the big prison companies lobbying at state governments
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:37.580]  this is in the news to give huge sentences to nonviolent people so they can get your tax money
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:43.900]  housing them so they can work for 20 cents an hour driving down everyone else's wages it is a
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:48.940]  genius plan and we now have the biggest prison population in the world and they're just getting
[02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:53.980]  started they're now arresting mothers whose children play in the front or backyard they're
[02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:59.900]  now taking children for no reason packing the prisons the people ask where are the concentration
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:06.140]  camps here they are these are the new slave camps and the so-called conservatives say
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:10.860]  good make them criminals work yeah and you wonder why you don't have a job now buddy
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:17.020]  or why you've had your pay cut you can't compete against five million people in prisons in factories
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:25.260]  right now exactly right and uh i think that what will be available in these prisons is that you're
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:32.620]  able to go online and you'll be able to participate in the casino economy to view pages on sites like
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:38.700]  facebook which are then used as collateral to justify their multi billion dollar capitalizations
[02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:43.740]  on the stock exchange so we already have that in china people in china go online and they do
[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:50.540]  what's called gold mining where they they are slave gamers they're gamers and they're enslaved
[02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:57.500]  to slave masters and their job 24-7 sometimes they game for three or four days straight and drop
[02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:02.860]  dead while they're out there trying to stay there stay there stay there erin fullen here as the food
[02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:08.220]  police shut down food co-ops the amish and small farmers americans are losing access not just a raw
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:12.860]  milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut
[02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:17.900]  yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:21.900]  but frankly i'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:25.420]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods
[02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:30.380]  and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today japanese eat miso
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:35.740]  africans eat fermented porges koreans eat kimchi and in india fermented milk is a staple for healthy

[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:20.060]  I don't know when I'm stuck in fools in prison and time keeps dragging on
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:25.340]  ladies and gentlemen what max keiser is breaking down here eloquently
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:31.180]  I know doesn't go above the heads of our old-time listeners but new listeners he's not joking
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:39.820]  the big prison companies there's three major ones a lot of subsidiaries openly lobby to throw
[02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:45.820]  people in jail for years for nothing that's why they keep non-violence in jail and release the
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:51.580]  violence because they're hard to deal with you know these big correction court people they want
[02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:56.620]  the minimum and medium they don't want the high security and they want the violence out there
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:03.500]  scaring everybody but the pot smoker oh they're going to put you to work doing all sorts of data
[02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:10.140]  entry not just making furniture and license plates they do everything now and it's Shawshank
[02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:14.300]  redemption you know where the prisoners are building the roads people are like good make them
[02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:19.100]  prisoners build roads are lazy boy yeah well you're not going to have a job building roads now
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:23.660]  so that's what's going on you think we're just competing with mexico and china and india uh uh
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:27.980]  think again you're competing with five million prisoners plus and it's growing
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:32.620]  and max getting into this i mean they're going ahead with it my point is this is a planned
[02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:39.580]  implosion this is a planned program of takeover by the oligarchs they admit it and so people
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:44.300]  like tarpoli who's a great guy he's always wants to bring out solutions the globalists don't care
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:49.820]  they're in control they're going ahead with this tell me if you agree or disagree and then break down
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:56.540]  for us uh what what this unlimited qe is going to mean your analysis of exactly where this new
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:26:02.700]  qe where this this new money transferred to the bankers is going max keiser yeah now i'll answer
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:08.060]  both questions i want to follow up on the uh prisoner story you're right the uh the prison labor
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:12.380]  in america is becoming a big problem the same governors of these states who are signing these
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:17.180]  deals with private prison operators are also complaining the federal government that the
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:24.940]  prison operators are taking or competing for jobs at the prison population now is uh people are
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:30.060]  getting arrested to go to prison to uh as a way to participate in the labor force that's about
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:34.460]  and they're working for a dollar two dollars a day but the follow-up on the gaming uh aspect i just
[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:39.420]  sent you an email to a link to a story here chinese prisoners forced to slay dragons mind
[02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:45.260]  gold and online games uh prisoners in a labor camp in northern china are forced to slay dragons
[02:26:45.260 --> 02:26:51.100]  and battle wizards and online games to earn virtual gold that the prison guards sell for real
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:56.620]  currency uh and this is uh this is how this is what's going to happen in america with companies
[02:26:56.620 --> 02:27:02.140]  like zinga and others you go to prison for as part of the deal with the prison operator then
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:09.900]  you're forced to play games to earn the credits in the games that are then converted to real money
[02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:16.300]  by the way you predicted this five years ago on my show how did you do it because max here it is
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:21.500]  chinese prisoners forced to slay dragons mind gold and online games because then they're made to go
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:26.780]  to state run or other run things for basically fake advertising hits that never really happened
[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:32.940]  just like facebook caught with bots visiting its sponsors ads just everything is fraud based it's
[02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:38.700]  total scam right well when you introduce me you say okay i introduced the virtual specialist in
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:45.500]  the virtual market that is the basis for virtual trading for virtual goods online so i i know the
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:50.860]  market very very well in my technology that you know there's an interesting history there but
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:57.260]  i'm not going to get into it but here you see in china the game market where you can play these
[02:27:57.260 --> 02:28:04.060]  virtual environments and you earn virtual trinkets and virtual swords etc in these multi-level
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:11.100]  player games they then can convert those into cash into yuan or other currencies and then that money
[02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:15.900]  is taken from the from the from the guards and the people who run the prison and there's so there's
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:22.300]  a market yuppies and trendies playing video games and paying money to get trinkets and paying money
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:31.420]  to be part of this they are financing slaves in chinese kami death camps doing this so so so the
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:39.740]  false reality is now supplanting the real reality and is slave driven right people to play farmville
[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:45.340]  which is a zinga game through facebook and they give them five hundred dollars to so they can raise
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:51.980]  virtual strawberries there are prisoners in china that are being forced to trade on these exchanges
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:58.140]  to make virtual products and virtual farming so that the prison operators can cash in the money
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:04.620]  the gold so they're earning as a way to increase it's a slave labor racket and they play these
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:10.940]  things 24-7 and there are stories now every week where people in asia who are being slave gamers
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:15.660]  are playing three or four days in a row and then they just drop dead from exhaustion and this this
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:20.860]  is happening almost also the beginning of being put into the matrix this is people plugging in
[02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:25.740]  becoming programmed we've got an 18 minute segment coming up max so i want to really get into the
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:29.900]  technicals because i know you've analyzed this federal reserve announcement the private begging
[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:34.940]  cartels announcement virtual money the federal reserve deals on virtual money it's another big
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:41.580]  virtual game exactly except they put us in prisons to fund it because at the final equation it's all
[02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:46.940]  based on tying us in to their Ponzi scheme their false reality their matrix stay there
[02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:57.260]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:24.860]  bind because he was way behind he was willing to make a deal when he came across this young
[02:33:24.860 --> 02:33:30.860]  man so we got max keiser max keiser dot com joining us we'll also give you his facebook twitter
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:37.740]  other sites here in a moment uh any other sites you'd like to plug but i want listeners to understand
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:44.700]  i spend all my time trying to understand this and trying to be accurate i mean we don't get
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:49.740]  up here and go oh well our listeners will like it more if we like mit romney so you know let's say
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:54.700]  nice things about him or people will like us if we say nice things about obama it's just okay
[02:33:54.700 --> 02:34:00.780]  what's the truth and let's cover it uh quite frankly if i had to calculate and sit here in
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:07.260]  mince words i couldn't do it there's no teleprompters there's no talking points there's just research
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:13.660]  and i look at articles like this one this is out of the times of israel i don't want to be the
[02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:20.540]  complicit in an israeli strike on iran says us army chief martin demsey warns that while it may
[02:34:20.540 --> 02:34:24.940]  delay the iranian reactor program an israeli military campaign could also unravel international
[02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:28.860]  sanctions on the taran regime well it's a lot more than that and i want to get matched as
[02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:33.980]  geopolitical take on it he was trying to finish up about this virtual reality that's what it is
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:40.380]  it's ponzi scheme operators that with with fractional reserve banking for every dollar you have in the
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:46.140]  bank you know they're loaning out ten dollars roughly now they've transcended that to just
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:50.380]  total derivatives and they don't care if you never had a deed with them and that they don't
[02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:55.820]  own your house they just come take it and the court rules it's theirs uh this is the type of stuff
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:35:00.140]  that we're dealing with now where they're just setting the precedent where foreign banks can
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:05.180]  steal trillions and not get in trouble cars i can still 1.6 billion get caught lying to congress
[02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:10.300]  doesn't get in trouble wells fargo can be caught laundering 376 billion dollars in narcotics
[02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:14.860]  running the narcotics aircraft nobody gets in trouble they pay less than a one percent fine
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:19.100]  so i'm saying oh you got caught kidnapped a little kid and chopping their head off that's a
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:24.780]  $25 ticket i mean it's it's it's a new kind of corruption i've studied history there's been some
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:31.500]  bad ones this one is is is a bunch of globalist exempt who meet in these big board rooms where
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:37.260]  no one can be blamed and everyone has plausible deniability i mean it's it's it's madness and
[02:35:37.260 --> 02:35:42.780]  it will come down it's got titanic written all over it max keiser i want you to really finish
[02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:46.700]  your point you're trying to make going to break because when music starts then the skype can't
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:51.980]  go over it causes this weird interlacing problem so the last 10 seconds of your saying wasn't heard
[02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:58.540]  finish up with that and then looking at this your collapse prediction getting into analyzing
[02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:03.900]  where the virtual qe is going another transfer to the bankers the media will tell us it's our
[02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:09.100]  debt and people will buy it i mean they'll tell us al-qaeda is coming when the government runs al-qaeda
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:14.700]  i mean if people just had any smarts they'd know we're already living in a virtual reality
[02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:21.100]  this show your website what we do are a few of the islands of half sanity i mean this is really
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:28.140]  out of control and and and now it it's becoming even crazier max keiser yeah okay if you compare
[02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:34.540]  virtual currencies that you find on game sites like zinga farm bill etc compared to the u.s dollar
[02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:42.220]  and what happens at the federal reserve bank they have one very important a common characteristic
[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:47.900]  neither one of these currencies pays an interest rate they pay zero percent interest rate now why
[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:54.620]  is this important the interest rate is the price of money it tells you what money is worth is the
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:59.900]  interest rate that comes attached to it when people in america now go to the job to work for a
[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:04.860]  living they get paid in dollars that have no interest rate attached to them whatsoever because
[02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:10.620]  they have no value whatsoever they're being debased by 40 billion dollars a month now to do the
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:15.260]  quantitative easing on top of quantitative easing one and two on top of a multi hundred trillion
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:19.900]  dollar derivatives market and top of central banks all over the world printing money willy nilly
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:25.020]  every single second of every single day at zero percent interest rate so you have only speculation
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:31.500]  to deal with no real honest living no way for banks to make an honest living lending money
[02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:35.820]  for a return based on a higher interest rate because all interest rates across the board are
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:41.580]  zero they loan money back to central banks who give them a subsidy that's taken out of the hide
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:46.460]  of the population through austerity measures yes that's true but that's not a functioning
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:51.260]  economy that's not a working economy so zero percent interest rates are the telltale sign
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:57.100]  that when you're not dealing with a currency that has intrinsic value whatsoever and one
[02:37:57.100 --> 02:38:02.780]  currency that does have intrinsic value it also pays no interest but over the past five thousand
[02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:07.340]  years it has proven itself to be intrinsically valuable is gold and silver and of course they're
[02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:11.980]  continuing to do extremely well as we've been saying on your show for a number of years because as the
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:18.940]  reserve bank continues this Ponzi scheme of paying off bad debt by printing new money by taking all
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:24.460]  this toxic securities off the balance sheets of banks and replacing it with new money then the
[02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:29.020]  people who own gold around the world of course are increasing their positions and I said on your show
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:34.860]  last time the wild card here is China China is surreptitiously accumulating vast quantities of
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:39.340]  gold the last time the government formally announced what their gold position was it was a
[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:44.700]  surprise 500 ton increase my sources tell me that by the end of the year they'll come out and say
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:49.340]  we don't have a thousand tons of gold we have two thousand tons of gold officially on our way to
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:53.740]  becoming four or five thousand tons of gold because they realize that when the global
[02:38:53.740 --> 02:39:00.060]  implosion occurs between now and April 15th and next year my window of implosion the countries
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:05.740]  with the gold are the ones who are going to survive the best the US ostensibly has eight
[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:09.820]  thousand tons of gold although there is a lot of debate as to whether that's been loaned out
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:13.740]  and they don't really own that gold anymore China is going to be on their way to owning
[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:19.500]  three or four thousand tons of gold Germany's got three thousand tons the IMF has a large
[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:24.540]  gold position that's what's going to matter once you have the implosion of this paper
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:29.420]  market current we got currency positions and they have to sit down and figure out okay what's the
[02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:35.180]  new currency grid and they have to mark to market all this paper against gold like they did at
[02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:41.980]  Bretton Woods after World War two and they're the price to adjust to account for all this paper
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:47.340]  means that gold at the minimum at the very very minimum would be seven thousand dollars an ounce
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:52.140]  you can say it could be a lot higher than that but at the very minimum if you take all the fiat
[02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:57.420]  money that's sloshing around on the Fed's balance sheet and in the system and you were to monetize
[02:39:57.420 --> 02:40:03.260]  that in a way that would account for all of the excess slush funds that are sloshing around
[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:08.620]  you come up with a revaluation at gold seven thousand dollars an ounce and that's where we're
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:13.500]  headed that's what's going to happen between now some kind of total breakdown and remodernization
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:23.180]  of gold between now April 15th of 2013 that's my window that's my target so it would be the triggers
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:28.140]  that we mentioned on the last show Alex you know we went through a number of triggers because it's
[02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:32.780]  in the globe today there are all kinds of things that are in the background the Iran Israeli situation
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:38.700]  obviously is heating up that's a potential trigger you've got the South African labor unrest which
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:42.700]  is shutting down platinum mining platinum has now been skyrocketing that's a trigger the
[02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:47.420]  LIBOR scandal remember Barclays and all these money center banks were found to be manipulating
[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:52.620]  LIBOR that has yet to fully blossom into the global scandal that it will be that's a multi
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:57.580]  hundred billion trillion dollar scandal going forward you've got drought here's key out she's
[02:40:57.580 --> 02:41:03.980]  very very key what i'm about to say before the Arab spring before the revolution in Egypt before
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:09.340]  what we saw in Cairo the price of wheat had got to eight dollars and fifty cents of bushel which
[02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:14.060]  means that the average Egyptian was paying 40 to 50 percent of their income on food well guess
[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:18.060]  where the price of wheat is now because of quantitative easing because of all the lack of
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:22.780]  nice figures around the world price of wheat is now nine dollars and fifty cents of bushel
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:27.740]  it's at an all-time high that means that these people are starving again even worse than they were
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:32.700]  before the massive revolutions that happened is that because of speculation or is it also because
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:38.060]  of just basic dollar devaluation dollar devaluation but remember when you keep interest rates at zero
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:44.700]  the cost of borrowing to speculate is zero because that's what i mean so they created a
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:50.140]  climate where they can totally take over here's my question what do you expect to play out not
[02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:55.500]  just by next april describe what this total collapse looks like and then what you see as possible
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:42:01.180]  futures going out because as brazinski's admitted three years ago and again his book this year
[02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:06.860]  people are awakening to the shadow government the banking cartel if they're not going to be able to
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:11.900]  just put in new puppets an angle in their europe or here they're announcing a banking dictatorship
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:16.460]  in europe admitting a super federal system over the countries that you and i talked about many
[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:22.780]  years ago so now so much of this is out in the open uh do they think the domestic police states
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:27.820]  they've set up are going to be able to protect them during this conversion to total tyranny
[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:32.940]  the the we go back to the beginning of the conversation now it's the the the prison
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:38.380]  business is booming america's got the biggest prison population in the world the prison business
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:43.020]  is booming and they're it's like a funnel they're just channeling people into these prisons where
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:48.700]  they enter this casino gulag economy and that's that's where we're headed and that's what people
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:54.620]  need to resist and that and then your sentence is here's the la times your sentence is to slay 500
[02:42:54.620 --> 02:43:01.500]  dragons which would take 10 years on the world of warcraft you then go play games uh on their
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:07.660]  clicking on ads for people that companies have sold ads to and they have contracts to have prisoners
[02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:14.060]  click on the ads i mean and the facebook got caught with robots clicking on them so now they
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:18.780]  won't even need humans so just get rid of them entirely i mean this is just this is insane
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:24.700]  virtual virtual mining and virtual farming because it deals with electrons and the cost
[02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:30.860]  of electrons is zero it's a highly it's a big profit business that's why the the prison labor
[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:35.980]  is not going to be building roads and the prison labor is not going to be weaving baskets they're
[02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:42.780]  going to be digitally online participating in games because the cost of producing games and the cost
[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:49.100]  of converting your time as a prisoner playing games into a virtual currency that can be converted
[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:54.620]  to dollars or yen or or other currencies is fantastically more profitable than to go out
[02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:58.940]  and build a road because building a road is still you have to get the tar you have to get the picks
[02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:02.860]  you have to go out there into the sun it actually costs money and so you have to know what you're
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:08.380]  doing you have to compete but instead you're just mega bankers putting cancer viruses and
[02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:13.180]  everybody's vaccines and fluoride in their water to dump them down and you just got everybody bowing
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:17.820]  to you because you've got unlimited digital currency that they pay you in labor to be able
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:23.900]  to use you know i saw an article in abc news last friday cut in for a second that take that thing
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:30.140]  that you just said apply to the federal reserve if you have a job that's not in prison you working
[02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:35.900]  at your local fast food restaurant if they pay you in us dollars that pays zero interest rate
[02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:41.340]  they're paying you in a gaming currency it has no value that's what i'm saying these dollars
[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:46.620]  whether it's a us dollar for the fed or it's a zing a dollar for an online gamer they're equivalent
[02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:50.540]  and so now they're going to merge the two absolutely but just stopping there again max
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:55.420]  guys are inventor of the virtual trading special system that's the backbone of much of this system
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:59.020]  today it's kind of like creating the hydrogen bomb i'm sure you're proud of yourself i'm just
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:04.940]  joking it's how they apply it but but i mean max expanding on this last friday i saw an abc news
[02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:08.860]  article guys will you print it for me because i had it in here in the weekend but i can't find it
[02:45:08.860 --> 02:45:14.700]  i meant to cover it yesterday and it was court rules police can be barred for too high an IQ
[02:45:14.700 --> 02:45:19.100]  now i've seen this story more than a hundred times the last 17 years on air i see it all the time
[02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:24.940]  but this guy lost a suit and they told him they said you've got too high an IQ and then i saw law
[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:31.260]  enforcement websites defending it saying smart people ask questions and you get bored and they
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:36.780]  basically admit it in these law enforcement sites and magazines that we want robots so here are guys
[02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:43.180]  so dumb they say it's not good to be smart and agree with the federal court ruling that if you have
[02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:49.500]  over a 100 IQ that's average folks you can't be a cop now folks it's not just cops they want dumb
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:55.020]  people that's why they put fluoride in the water which harvard admits brain damages you the elite
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:46:01.740]  are so out of control they're trying to create a sub void cattle group that they literally mine
[02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:06.220]  and feed and now the globalists have said our new issue the magazine coming up breaks this down
[02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:10.780]  that they don't even want us anymore they're going to go completely to robots that work on robots
[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:16.140]  that work on robots with the autonomous drones and all the rest of it so max put your futurist cap on
[02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:20.780]  look into the future where is all this leading because the elites are now saying we don't even
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:26.060]  want them in the prisons let's just kill everybody oh it's heading you don't have to look to the future
[02:46:26.060 --> 02:46:31.660]  look to the past look to the way europe was run before the invention of the printing press before
[02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:38.620]  the enlightenment before dito invented the encyclopedia you had dumb serfs working for as
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:45.340]  indentured serfs for the lord and master that's where we're going back to the rich the elite they
[02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:50.140]  never liked the idea of having a middle class they don't need a middle class they would prefer
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:54.700]  just having a very small group of extraordinarily wealthy and everyone else is a serf and that's
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:59.340]  where we're heading and now they said now they've said hey let's just release a bio weapon and kill
[02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:03.820]  everybody we go into underground bases and come out a year later everybody's dead and i'm telling
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:08.380]  you max i study them they're going ahead with that plan as soon as they've got their police state
[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:12.780]  in place as soon as the autonomous drones and robots are in place they're going to release the
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:19.980]  bio weapon just i have it very you know it's ironic because the the creation of the middle
[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:26.220]  class in the middle ages was the result of the bubonic plague the bubonic plague wiped out half
[02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:32.140]  the population it was only then that the lords of the matter actually had to compete for labor
[02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:37.100]  and they started to pay serfs money real money well it knocked down a lot of the entrenched elites
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:41.820]  it killed a lot of the elite that was a big plus yeah well they treat well it knocked out the labor
[02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:47.420]  force and they created this idea of paying labor which created something called the middle class
[02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:52.940]  so i mean the bio weapon destruction you're describing if it could have a silver lining in
[02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:57.820]  that it could wipe out the population to the degree where people actually have to pay for
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:03.820]  labor again but of course that would be a catastrophic way to get to robots in 1400
[02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:08.940]  well that's correct the robots and they didn't have those for 1400 correct
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:15.740]  well max i'm telling you it's a very dark future we're facing and people laugh today
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:19.100]  some of them out there they're not going to be laughing the future we can't turn this around
[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:25.820]  what's your take on on where they sent the qe3 because you know it's been different goodies
[02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:31.100]  you know not just free money but also you know just giving the money and and and buying crud
[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:35.580]  derivatives which you pointed out they've accelerated the bailouts into derivatives
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:43.260]  the problem is bigger than ever well i mean it when obama came into office in 2008
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:47.420]  he there was a fork in the road he could have either bailed out the banks or bailed out the
[02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:53.260]  homeowners he chose to bail out the banks because there was a theory there of the multiplicity of
[02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:58.940]  money effect that if you bail out the banks it increases more jobs ultimately more growth in
[02:48:58.940 --> 02:49:04.300]  the system because of the fractional reserve system the way it's constructed and uh there
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:11.820]  but that was a mistake because had he actually just written off 90% of all mortgages in america
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:18.220]  of the the people who own the mortgages it would have cost much less because at the time they said
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:23.420]  well if you did that you would have cost something like 12 trillion dollars and that's too expensive
[02:49:23.420 --> 02:49:28.060]  well guess what they are now working on spending and giving away and bailing out and printing
[02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:33.340]  upwards of 20 trillion dollars so the the the cost now of bailing out the bankers and by the way
[02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:38.220]  that's done nothing to revive the house but but max at least at least in 08 they admitted it was
[02:49:38.220 --> 02:49:44.140]  money to bankers now the media is like you lazy scum we have to give you more money they've
[02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:49.420]  actually spun it in europe and here that it's that that that it's our debt when our debt's only 15
[02:49:49.420 --> 02:49:56.700]  trillion well they need scapegoats right alex as they they ramp up the uh incinerators to get rid
[02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:03.900]  of the oversupply of people they need scapegoats we've seen that movie before yeah i'm telling you
[02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:08.780]  you know you knew george soros you've worked at the highest levels a lot of this i mean you
[02:50:08.780 --> 02:50:13.100]  know these people some of them i mean what's wrong with them because i don't think they're
[02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:17.180]  going to get out of what they're creating i mean things don't always go the way they want
[02:50:18.220 --> 02:50:23.020]  i i've i've explained my my thoughts on this before you're dealing with the mentality of
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:28.940]  this suicide banker it's similar to the suicide bomber the suicide bomber who blows themselves
[02:50:28.940 --> 02:50:35.020]  up in the name of their fundamentalist theocratic religious extremist view suicide bankers like
[02:50:35.020 --> 02:50:40.540]  jamie diamond loyte blank find bob diamond they blow themselves up and the people around them
[02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:46.300]  in the belief of their market fundamentalist views that that are informed by a misreading of
[02:50:46.300 --> 02:50:51.900]  things like adam smith they selectively read these things and to support their market fundamentalist
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:55.900]  view and they believe they're doing god's work there's there that's that's what you're dealing
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:51:01.820]  with a suicide banker and they they are going down that path and they're taking the entire economy
[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:05.900]  down with them and there's no doubt they're destroying the economy there's no doubt we've
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:11.260]  been in a depression there's no doubt they're about to make it a lot worse uh and there's no doubt
[02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:19.580]  that the economy is is is extremely frail that the unemployment numbers are continuing to look
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:26.540]  horrible that the underlying dependence on food stamps and government sort and outs is increasing
[02:51:27.260 --> 02:51:32.300]  exponentially the student loan bubble another potential trigger alex you know the subprime
[02:51:32.300 --> 02:51:37.260]  bubble was a trillion dollar bubble that burst and caused problems the student loan bubble is a
[02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:41.660]  trillion dollar plus bubble that's on the verge of busting that's another potential trigger that
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:48.780]  could overnight uh wipe out an entire um it'll class of individual and cause a problem you also
[02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:54.620]  have uh huge problems in the flash crash market the program trading the high frequency trading
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:52:01.020]  you know these reports are coming out every day now that the system is being completely dominated
[02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:08.060]  by computers trading in billions of a second in ways that are adding so much stress and so much
[02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:14.300]  complication and so much potential disaster scenarios that professionals are walking away
[02:52:14.300 --> 02:52:18.860]  professional hedge funds many hedge funds ahead of i mean all the big heads are starting to get
[02:52:18.860 --> 02:52:23.500]  out of it so many of them walk away they walk away because the risks are too great it's like
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:28.540]  putting your hand into a blender you know expecting to come out with something other than a bloody
[02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:35.100]  stump it's the risk and reward is is is not favorable and they're just not trading they're
[02:52:35.100 --> 02:52:42.540]  walking away from this nightmare what we're watching is a revolution of evil we're watching
[02:52:42.540 --> 02:52:49.020]  a revolution of fraud we're watching a revolution of insanity and a revolution of false reality
[02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:56.540]  and and and and Ponzi scams absorbing the real world this is a matrix like the birth of the
[02:52:56.540 --> 02:53:01.660]  matrix everybody wired into computers people only caring about sitcoms and sports while the real
[02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:07.580]  world goes on around them and drones kill whole villages for no reason i mean we are entering
[02:53:07.580 --> 02:53:11.980]  there's articles pouring out where all the big pharma companies know most their drugs actually
[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:16.140]  hurt people and don't help them and the vaccines they're putting the stuff in the vaccines to
[02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:21.180]  spread the disease so they can sell more and it's admitted and nobody cares that's admitted the
[02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:26.540]  fluorides killing us so they add it it's all just funny it's like a bunch of crazy people have taken
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:32.860]  over well i i mean i'll say something i'll mention something you're probably not going to like it
[02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:43.180]  though because it's very very kind of uh sub subsurface type stuff but you know i got it i
[02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:51.100]  gotta say that i am i i spent the last weekend attending the bitcoin 2012 conference here in
[02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:59.660]  london and on the surface it sounds doesn't sound good but when you get into what bitcoin is really
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:07.580]  all about alex it really is the currency of the resistance basically if we are entering into an
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:15.340]  environment of 360 degrees of surveillance of of this of us being surveyed every click of the
[02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:22.140]  mouse every every web page review every email totally read walking outside or being face scanned
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:28.860]  right if that's where we're headed then bitcoin which is which is the value of bitcoin is entirely
[02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:37.660]  tied to its crypt cryptological content it's cryptology as a currency and therefore it really
[02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:43.980]  could be the currency of resistance going forward on the surface it's it's hard to get there because
[02:54:43.980 --> 02:54:48.460]  you say okay it's a digital currency and we just talked about how bad digital currencies are and
[02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:53.260]  you know it's it's a computer driven currency and we just talked about how bad that is but
[02:54:53.820 --> 02:54:57.900]  once you get down into the surface a little bit you drill into what's really going on with bitcoin
[02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:03.500]  you find out that there's this thriving global community i'll say this there's a lot of globalist
[02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:08.940]  connected groups i won't mention that that do not like the word bitcoin they ban it on these
[02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:13.420]  government front sites out there that we know our government well i mean that's that's a good sign
[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:20.540]  right i mean because the globalists hate bitcoin because it's completely cryptologically it's it's
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:27.260]  no cost transaction you can move money around at zero cost uh it's the currency itself has a quote
[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:32.220]  like any other currency so it's like $11.80 per bitcoin but that's not the main thing the main
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:36.780]  thing is you can zip in and out of bitcoin for almost zero well listen we're gonna have to get
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:44.780]  you back on soon to talk about that but uh real quick what's your bottom line on war uh right now
[02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:51.100]  with iran i mean is is that more saber rattling or well i mean it's a fast way to increase the
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:56.140]  prison population it's like the prison owners are not happy with the rate at which they're
[02:55:56.140 --> 02:56:00.940]  increasing the prison population so let's start a few wars because that'll increase prison population
[02:56:00.940 --> 02:56:05.580]  exponentially that's so that that's where you make your money in the globalist how does the war
[02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:12.460]  start uh uh make a bigger prison population but with prisoners of war you know with prisoners of
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:19.340]  war are are are legion they're huge sure also the contracts the no bids all of it very intriguing
