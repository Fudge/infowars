[00:00.000 --> 00:27.200]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones well i tell you this
[00:27.200 --> 00:32.320]  civil war the globalists are trying to start in this country has gone from
[00:32.320 --> 00:37.120]  smoldering to explosive we've got all these clips of top democrats on
[00:37.120 --> 00:44.160]  television on msnbc on cnn at hollywood award shows rob reiner on friday
[00:44.160 --> 00:50.160]  saying we're in a civil war and we're fighting nazis and we're fighting
[00:50.160 --> 00:54.720]  russian agents and they know it's a fraud they're just branding their
[00:54.720 --> 00:59.840]  opposition is that because they are a dying party
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.320]  well last time i had these guys in uh we just kind of ran it and raved about
[01:04.320 --> 01:07.840]  anti-fun intimidating people and working for soros and trying to
[01:07.840 --> 01:11.360]  go around you know pointing guns at people and stuff and i in customary
[01:11.360 --> 01:15.440]  fashion talked to everybody but i've i've invited the guys back to actually
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.600]  get into what a civil war that went hot would look like
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.200]  the different factions that could basically break out
[01:23.200 --> 01:26.720]  because these guys won't get into their backgrounds but they have specialties
[01:26.720 --> 01:30.560]  in that that maybe one tenth of one percent of people in the military
[01:30.560 --> 01:33.920]  have had so we're going to be discussing how
[01:33.920 --> 01:39.200]  tier one military operators from from from their research their view as
[01:39.200 --> 01:42.880]  citizens think this is going to go down because the democrats have decided to
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.000]  get violent and they said they have and through their channels they announced
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  the violence and then we pointed out they have
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.360]  media matters again the mouth of soron the mouth of soros
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.680]  say it's insane it doesn't exist none of what's happening classic military tactic
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.280]  so that's all coming up in the second hour roger stone
[01:59.280 --> 02:03.440]  is going to be in the third hour it is all coming up
[02:03.440 --> 02:07.040]  today and of course we have the great jack posovic as well hosting the fourth
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.680]  hour than the war room with oan shroyer
[02:09.680 --> 02:14.000]  steven bannon complete snake on the grass the entire time
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.160]  very very saddened by that he now is a darling on cnn and they talk about how
[02:18.160 --> 02:21.280]  wonderful he is remember he was the white supremacist leader just a few months
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.840]  ago but now he's wonderful and oh he says that the
[02:25.840 --> 02:32.560]  hashtag me too will bring down trump and they just build this crescendo burning
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.160]  a few of their own hollywood people as i predicted six months ago
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.240]  and then create this wave and say well trumps gotta go
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.320]  and it's about civil war culturally between men and women
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.960]  so that's coming up today and then meanwhile etna one of the biggest
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.600]  insurance companies in the world serving 23 million to share in the us alone
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.720]  who helped write obama care to make you pay for it so they can increase the
[02:56.720 --> 02:59.440]  prices that's a dream of these big corporations you want to know who runs
[02:59.440 --> 03:03.200]  the planet it's the big banks that own the insurance companies or vice versa
[03:03.200 --> 03:06.160]  and at this right up there at the top of the capstone
[03:06.160 --> 03:12.400]  their top technician top ceo came out and said look
[03:12.400 --> 03:19.200]  we don't even look at your request when they come in for surgery or whatever
[03:19.200 --> 03:22.240]  and then it's a big firestorm oh california's investigating what do you
[03:22.240 --> 03:25.680]  mean you don't even look at it and they go well don't
[03:25.680 --> 03:28.720]  don't worry about that we'll tell you once we have congressional hearings
[03:28.720 --> 03:32.160]  and they're going to use this as a way to roll out that it's computers
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.920]  so they're so fair in fact here's a headline cnn
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.320]  california launches investigation following stunning admission by etna
[03:40.320 --> 03:44.000]  medical director now here's the real news from cnn
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.600]  getting occasionally right from what uh earlier this year
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.560]  the computer that decides if we live or die
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.120]  you see they started it out about nine years ago strangely enough when obama
[03:57.120 --> 04:00.320]  got in said what you want about bush he didn't put that in
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.040]  where it's not even bioethics boards of doctors that decide who lives and dies
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.080]  with a mix of hospital or company administrators you've got to have a
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.120]  doctor signing off on the death warrant it's the thomas
[04:11.120 --> 04:16.400]  watson computer and you cannot make up the richness of that little sweetheart
[04:16.400 --> 04:20.240]  remember they want major halls changed from lynch hall
[04:20.240 --> 04:22.960]  even though in several cases it was liberals that donated money and last
[04:22.960 --> 04:26.000]  name was the irish name lynch because it sounds like lynching
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.160]  that mental illness but then you can have it called the thomas
[04:30.160 --> 04:33.600]  watson computer that decides who lives and dies
[04:33.600 --> 04:37.120]  when he invented the first computers they're the same thing in
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.560]  german death camps on record
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.680]  so see there's people are scared to name lynch has nothing to do with lynching
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.360]  and but but oh a computer's actually named after
[04:49.360 --> 04:53.600]  the guy that got the highest award in nazi germany thomas watson the
[04:53.600 --> 04:58.000]  creator of computers and then the machine named after him carries out
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.840]  nazi tactics against veterans fuel your body with carnivore the new
[05:01.840 --> 05:04.400]  digestive enzyme product by infowars life
[05:04.400 --> 05:07.920]  digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the
[05:07.920 --> 05:10.960]  bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily
[05:10.960 --> 05:13.440]  absorbable components they also help prevent
[05:13.440 --> 05:16.480]  discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[05:16.480 --> 05:20.400]  particles in the gut digestive enzyme production declines as we age
[05:20.400 --> 05:23.440]  carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present
[05:23.440 --> 05:26.880]  in the body enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods
[05:26.880 --> 05:29.840]  again you can eat protein-heavy foods now
[05:29.840 --> 05:33.680]  while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with
[05:33.680 --> 05:36.720]  high meat diets just one pill with every high protein
[05:36.720 --> 05:39.520]  meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.040]  amino acids the building blocks to your muscles
[05:43.040 --> 05:46.560]  carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats
[05:46.560 --> 05:50.240]  and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals
[05:50.240 --> 05:54.320]  don't let a meal go to waste use carnivore by infowars life
[05:54.320 --> 06:09.760]  head to infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now that's infowarslife.com
[06:09.760 --> 06:19.760]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[06:19.760 --> 06:22.880]  all right you don't want to miss this broadcast uh we've got
[06:22.880 --> 06:27.120]  tier one patriot operators who don't even get into what they've done and do in
[06:27.120 --> 06:30.400]  the military and for other organizations uh today when they come in
[06:30.400 --> 06:33.440]  they're going to be here to talk about the second amendment a lot more but i'm
[06:33.440 --> 06:36.720]  going to try to get them to talk about what things will look like in their
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.320]  research view not from a classified perspective of cog
[06:40.320 --> 06:46.480]  uh but from just a citizen perspective with the left out there calling
[06:46.480 --> 06:50.480]  for total civil war and now saying that they put us into a civil war
[06:50.480 --> 06:54.640]  and preparing to up the amount of violence that they've already engaged in
[06:54.640 --> 06:57.440]  so that's in the second hour will intersperse a lot of breaking news
[06:57.440 --> 07:00.960]  obviously third hour roger stone will be in studio with me co-hosting right into
[07:00.960 --> 07:05.120]  the fourth hour with jack possebe another great patriot uh here uh the
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.240]  big news is that hezbollah out of iran has used the fact that the u.s has
[07:10.240 --> 07:14.320]  begun to pull out of most areas of syria do again moving up to the border with
[07:14.320 --> 07:18.240]  israel and has shot down one of their aircraft had drones and other aircraft
[07:18.240 --> 07:21.680]  coming over the airspace uh israel has
[07:21.680 --> 07:27.120]  reasonably struck back against bases uh where hezbollah was attacking from uh
[07:27.120 --> 07:31.600]  and has become large bombing runs and is now threatening basically to attack
[07:31.600 --> 07:36.240]  iran itself if they don't back down iran has come out
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.680]  and said that this is a new strategic era uh and that they'll do whatever they
[07:41.680 --> 07:44.880]  want basically iran uav that entered israel airspace
[07:44.880 --> 07:49.200]  seems to be an american stealth knockoff now that is just some of the news
[07:49.200 --> 07:52.880]  meanwhile billionaire george soros has already donated billions to overthrow
[07:52.880 --> 07:56.400]  european sovereignty and just the last week he donated
[07:56.400 --> 08:00.560]  500 000 pounds and now another 100 000 pounds to try and derail briggs it
[08:00.560 --> 08:03.600]  american investor uh defies critics to take total
[08:03.600 --> 08:08.720]  spent on keeping uk and eu uh to over 500 000 pounds
[08:08.720 --> 08:12.960]  and how is he a weird eastern european nazi collaborator
[08:12.960 --> 08:18.880]  involved in our politics and involved in sovereign politics in in the uk and
[08:18.880 --> 08:23.040]  then he's the one funding this baloney that all of us that want u.s sovereignty
[08:23.040 --> 08:26.800]  our lower taxes are russian agents
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.120]  he is the communist he has been the socialist who of course is tax exempt
[08:31.120 --> 08:34.160]  he's mega wealth to control people as it always is
[08:34.160 --> 08:37.040]  so that's simply incredible we're gonna get into that billionaires and athletes
[08:37.040 --> 08:41.840]  freeze as winter olympics uh have record low temperatures
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.480]  also vice airs documentary on black uh healing retreats for people who need a
[08:46.480 --> 08:49.600]  break from white people i talked about this last week we had the clips we
[08:49.600 --> 08:51.760]  never got to them now it's a big national news story
[08:51.760 --> 08:54.800]  but i'm gonna air some of that in the third hour roger stone they actually
[08:54.800 --> 08:57.520]  say white people shouldn't have any rights and
[08:57.520 --> 09:00.000]  shouldn't be allowed to travel and i don't like seeing them and they go you
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.520]  lease this property uh for your black retreat from a white person well that's
[09:03.520 --> 09:06.560]  okay you talk about what the public schools and the
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.720]  media have done turning some black people into beyond kkk
[09:12.720 --> 09:15.360]  i mean the kkk isn't calling for black people not being able to have
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.000]  passports or move around freely uh it is truly
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.280]  naziistic the nazi's control where you could go and what you could do it is
[09:23.280 --> 09:26.240]  it is unbelievable but it's like the left saying oh we're getting all these
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.920]  people organized these professors and msnbc we played the clips last week
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.160]  we're gonna block the military parade that trump wants to have
[09:34.160 --> 09:37.760]  because he's not going to invade new york
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.600]  or invade dc depending on where they have it that's not troops invading that's a
[09:41.600 --> 09:44.480]  parade that's not tenement square tenement square again was communist
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.040]  coming and attacking civil rights activists protesters who are
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.720]  peacefully speaking out for free speech amazing
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.520]  bunch of communists a bunch of socialists down saying oh we're going to lay in
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.360]  front of the tanks like the heroes at tenement square
[10:03.360 --> 10:06.640]  you're the left on the campus trying to borrow free speech you're the left trying
[10:06.640 --> 10:08.800]  to go after the veterans you're the people saying
[10:08.800 --> 10:11.280]  we shouldn't be able to have a parade by the way i think trump should have a
[10:11.280 --> 10:13.920]  parade because the globalists don't want us to have one
[10:13.920 --> 10:17.680]  i'm against a police state i'm against martial law i'm against civil war it's
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.000]  the democrats calling for a civil emergency calling for martial law
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.640]  calling for overthrowing the election calling for banning free speech and
[10:26.640 --> 10:29.680]  doing it at campuses all over the country as they admit they are
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.600]  banning halloween parties banning costume parties banning fiesta parties
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.760]  banning everything to have total control
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.680]  and they point their fingers at us and they say that we're the fascists no
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.360]  i support our military because our military is one of the most weight
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.160]  groups to the globalist threat and the globalists want to get control of our
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.400]  military to use it against us and it's t that we totally engage the military
[10:52.400 --> 10:55.360]  and wake the military up so they understand that duty and they
[10:55.360 --> 10:58.400]  understand it better than we do on average that's why it's a natural ally
[10:58.400 --> 11:01.840]  with the american people is our military and they want to drive a wedge
[11:01.840 --> 11:04.480]  there they're the folks that love killing cops
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.200]  they're the people that hate the military that hate flyover country that
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.200]  admittedly hate this nation but now hollywood are the ones telling you how
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.360]  all of us that are america firsters all of us
[11:15.360 --> 11:18.800]  trying to take the sabotage controls off the country trying to end the global
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.960]  of sabotage we're the traitors total bull
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.800]  the dowels jumped 307 points as stocks bounce back from their worst week in
[11:26.800 --> 11:30.960]  two years we're going to get into all of that but first
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.520]  little steven bannon has proven himself to be a classic benedict arnold in the
[11:35.520 --> 11:41.200]  vein of judice iscariot or brutus has slithered out and is giving
[11:41.200 --> 11:44.960]  interviews to see it and others saying hashtag me too he thinks will bring
[11:44.960 --> 11:48.720]  trump down oh what a tactical genius you are it was set up six
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.320]  months ago the democrats admitted that they were unpopular with women because
[11:52.320 --> 11:55.280]  of all the right connections to the clintons and the cover-ups and the
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.760]  lelita express and and and all the raping and the children and all the rest of it
[11:59.760 --> 12:06.160]  so as a facelift they started burning a few of their own and now he says women
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.720]  need to take charge of society a classic globalist talking point by the big
[12:10.720 --> 12:14.160]  multinationals who want to use you as a wedge to further break up the country
[12:14.160 --> 12:17.600]  hitler said first you get the women then you got the children so follow the men
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.160]  hitler targeted women told them they were in charge
[12:20.160 --> 12:24.640]  so the whole issue here is that this is classical advertising
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.800]  80% of advertising targets women and he's playing into that whole leftist
[12:28.800 --> 12:31.520]  talking point saying this will bring down
[12:31.520 --> 12:35.200]  trump he believes on his belly like a little
[12:35.200 --> 12:39.040]  goblin creature dragging it like a little snake in front of them hoping to be
[12:39.040 --> 12:42.320]  relevant again truly truly sickening by the
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.560]  hollywood screenwriter who posed as a patriot but he was always a globalist
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.800]  leftist we now learn let's go to that clip
[12:48.800 --> 12:51.760]  paperback release of the new book you talk about watching the golden globe
[12:51.760 --> 12:55.360]  awards with steve bannon and you got his reaction to the red carpet protest
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.560]  supporting the me too movement he said quote the antra
[12:58.560 --> 13:02.400]  anti-patriarchy is going to undo 10 000 years of recorded history
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.080]  you watch the time has come women are going to take charge of society
[13:06.080 --> 13:09.600]  and they couldn't juxtapose a better villain than trump he is the patriarch
[13:09.600 --> 13:13.440]  this is a definitional moment in the culture it'll never be the same
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.040]  going forward you know i think bannon despite all his
[13:17.040 --> 13:20.720]  flaws is a pretty shrewd analyst of american politics and particularly
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.800]  american political anxieties are national anxieties and he recognized
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.600]  in those golden globe awards that this was a movement that could potentially
[13:29.600 --> 13:33.200]  be an existential threat to republicans not just the majority in the house
[13:33.200 --> 13:38.640]  but also to president trump and there's a wonderful revealing moment of fruity
[13:38.640 --> 13:42.640]  and angst in the scene as i described bannon watching opera
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.520]  where he says look if they were to roll out a guillotine right now
[13:47.520 --> 13:50.880]  these ladies would chop off every set of balls in the room
[13:50.880 --> 13:54.800]  which is which is a blunt bannon way of saying essentially you know this me too
[13:54.800 --> 13:58.080]  movement they're coming for our manhood and i think that expressed
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.400]  a lot of the anxieties that bannon that trump the people of that political
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.320]  persuasion have about this this new rising movement of
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.200]  of women which is really a backlash to the man that that bannon calls the
[14:11.200 --> 14:14.960]  patriarch trump himself all right let's decipher that complete absolute bull
[14:14.960 --> 14:17.280]  remember we told you that was actually eight months ago
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.400]  that they were in the whole me too thing was a deal to bring down trump that
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.760]  that was obvious they now admit that that was an alfreight and shed i
[14:23.760 --> 14:26.320]  shouldn't have resigned because none of them are resigning i shouldn't have
[14:26.320 --> 14:29.040]  been you know agreed to this to be the sacrificial lamb
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.640]  so that's what's going on what's happening is multinationals know they've
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.320]  taken the country over they want to divide us from each other
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.920]  hillary was supposed to get in and in any criticism it wouldn't be that you're
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.560]  racist like it was with obama now is going to be your sexist and you don't
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.520]  like hillary and they're still going with that she says that every time she
[14:47.520 --> 14:50.800]  opens her mouth so there's just still playing
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.720]  the very same playbook they had that's why they had law and order and homeland
[14:54.720 --> 14:57.920]  all these shows already produced where there's a woman president
[14:57.920 --> 15:00.640]  and now they try to assassinate her she goes from being hillary to now
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.360]  she's a bad trump person so all of this is propaganda just basting
[15:05.360 --> 15:08.480]  emotional people men women you name it and then men
[15:08.480 --> 15:12.640]  cucks are supposed to signal to women oh i know we're bad you're in charge here
[15:12.640 --> 15:15.680]  you go work and you bring me food and i'll sit her on the couch
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.120]  and of course she leaves you about a year because you're a cuck
[15:19.120 --> 15:22.000]  i mean it's it's amazing that's not what women are looking for
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.600]  and so this this this is total fraud this is scientific warfare the attack on

[19:13.840 --> 19:18.560]  and normal breathing this is pollen blood in the 1960s researchers in france
[19:18.560 --> 19:21.440]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.280]  from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.680]  like running nose itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.080]  they began studying the effects in public trials in their public trials

[20:01.600 --> 20:17.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:17.520 --> 20:33.440]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[20:37.680 --> 20:41.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so much for joining us i am
[20:41.360 --> 20:46.720]  your host alex jones so what have i told you that major
[20:46.720 --> 20:49.680]  insurance companies for more than a decade
[20:49.680 --> 20:54.080]  have been testing and now installing system-wide
[20:54.080 --> 21:00.400]  computers that serve as bioethics boards now first they created bioethics boards
[21:00.400 --> 21:03.280]  in the last 60 70 years as part of the eugenics movement
[21:03.280 --> 21:06.720]  in western europe the uk the u.s australia new zealand
[21:06.720 --> 21:10.640]  canada you name it where a board of physicians and then a board of
[21:10.640 --> 21:13.840]  physicians and hospital or corporate executives
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.760]  would decide who gets a liver transplant or who gets
[21:17.760 --> 21:21.680]  a cadaver transplant for an achilles
[21:21.680 --> 21:25.120]  heal sounds reasonable you're a big drinker
[21:25.120 --> 21:29.040]  you're 65 years old there's a young person needs a liver who isn't a big
[21:29.040 --> 21:31.440]  drinker not their fault we're going to give you the liver first
[21:31.440 --> 21:36.400]  but once you open that door up now the computers can do whatever they want
[21:36.400 --> 21:38.880]  that's the famous clip of bill gates saying
[21:38.880 --> 21:41.840]  was it six seven years ago to the group of teachers he said if you don't give
[21:41.840 --> 21:45.520]  that old person that last year of care you can hire 10 teachers
[21:45.520 --> 21:50.240]  well he knows that's a fraud when you start cutting quality
[21:50.240 --> 21:54.720]  everything implodes you always demand more quality in your civilization
[21:54.720 --> 21:59.280]  and then that increases the level of service the level of viability the
[21:59.280 --> 22:02.320]  level of excellence and a great example i use
[22:02.320 --> 22:07.120]  this is well known by economists by the way is just 15 years ago there were
[22:07.120 --> 22:09.520]  almost no nice theaters where you could eat
[22:09.520 --> 22:13.520]  eat dinner and have a drink alamo draft house in austin texas made it ubiquitous
[22:13.520 --> 22:16.400]  wash it nationwide and then suddenly five years ago
[22:16.400 --> 22:21.120]  every theater began converting except discount theaters and now
[22:21.120 --> 22:24.400]  all the old cruddy theaters have a full bar
[22:24.400 --> 22:28.240]  and big huge relaxing seats and are better than alamo
[22:28.240 --> 22:33.120]  that's what innovation is but they teach you in a zero-sum game
[22:33.120 --> 22:36.320]  that the cake is only so big that the pizza is only so big
[22:36.320 --> 22:39.840]  and that we can't innovate our way out so
[22:39.840 --> 22:43.920]  there's been a bunch of big headlines out the last day the big scandal is cnn
[22:43.920 --> 22:47.440]  exclusive california launches investigation following
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.760]  stunning admission by etna medical director
[22:51.920 --> 22:58.320]  and the etna medical director came out and said we don't look at the reports
[22:58.320 --> 23:01.120]  and of course they're setting everybody up they said we look forward to
[23:01.120 --> 23:04.960]  testifying in california and the congress both about this and of course i
[23:04.960 --> 23:07.280]  knew what they were going to say and etna's already put out statements to
[23:07.280 --> 23:10.000]  their board they put out statements to their shareholders
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.360]  they're going fully to computers and they're going to use this stunt to say
[23:15.360 --> 23:18.480]  see it's not a human deciding who who lives and
[23:18.480 --> 23:22.640]  who dies it's a computer so everybody can wash their hands
[23:22.640 --> 23:28.880]  like punch's pilot and of course where did it start that computers
[23:28.880 --> 23:32.640]  would decide how much you were fed how much you were worked and when you were
[23:32.640 --> 23:36.320]  finally either killed or starved to death oh it was a place called
[23:36.320 --> 23:41.120]  nazi germany and the top right hand man of adolf
[23:41.120 --> 23:44.400]  hitler who received the highest award in germany above hitler
[23:44.400 --> 23:48.240]  look it up just just just type in thomas watson of ibm
[23:48.240 --> 23:52.160]  received the highest award from hitler there's photos of him receiving it
[23:52.160 --> 23:56.640]  it's like some triple iron cross with double double eagles and all that stuff
[23:56.640 --> 24:02.160]  but what's key here is ibm leads and at the va
[24:02.160 --> 24:07.040]  runs the thomas watson computers that are supposedly
[24:07.040 --> 24:12.000]  ai when it comes to making decisions and that is who created that we all
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.600]  discovered six years ago the secret death list on the va
[24:18.960 --> 24:22.800]  and i told everybody at the time
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.400]  by the way they've been pulled a surprise winning books written on this
[24:26.400 --> 24:30.080]  ibm the holocaust you name it we've had the authors on it's a fact
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.160]  hitler gave speeches with watson i mean only the person he liked as much as
[24:34.160 --> 24:36.960]  margaret sang or they had a planned parenthood why she is worship on the
[24:36.960 --> 24:39.840]  cover of time in newsweek is the best feminist ever because she said hall
[24:39.840 --> 24:43.040]  hitler and he learned he said everything he knew from her and david
[24:43.040 --> 24:47.440]  rockefeller's granddad who funded him who funds the
[24:47.440 --> 24:52.480]  colesprings harbor facility today run by ibm computers so you need to understand
[24:52.480 --> 24:55.840]  this and i'm not bashing ibm the company i got a family has worked for it
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.160]  i'm simply pointing out that this is the facts it's incontrovertible
[25:00.160 --> 25:03.440]  it's history and they think you're stupid so
[25:03.440 --> 25:06.640]  seeing in though in the last couple years and others admitted this they're
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.640]  leaving it as a mystery right now the computer that decides if we live or die
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.080]  a serious injury leaves a loved one in coma relatives may face the hardest
[25:14.080 --> 25:17.520]  decision in their lives to wait it out or turn off the life support machine
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.320]  the program may help families decide what action take
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.320]  either critically on it goes on here's another one probe finds more secret va
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.240]  waitlist in colorado washington times still going on
[25:28.240 --> 25:33.520]  trumps trying to stop it he is made a good effort to do it
[25:33.520 --> 25:36.480]  double the amount of appointments that veterans are getting but there's a
[25:36.480 --> 25:40.560]  culture in there that is very eugenical that blocks that so
[25:40.560 --> 25:45.280]  here's the facts you can look up the national health service
[25:45.280 --> 25:48.960]  uh paul watson runs every day super healthy guy he got
[25:48.960 --> 25:52.640]  what was it strep about three years ago they wouldn't let him see a doctor for
[25:52.640 --> 25:54.960]  a couple months he almost died coughing up blood
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.440]  you have to get permission to see another private doctor and pay a lot more
[25:59.440 --> 26:02.400]  so it's a two-tier system and their whole system was designed to collapse
[26:02.400 --> 26:05.680]  it's always been horrible it's always been for social control and now they
[26:05.680 --> 26:08.160]  admit it's collapsing cnn's headline today was
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.080]  after 70 years of being a model of goodness it's collapsing
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.400]  that's in the news today after 70 years after 70 years of universal health care
[26:16.400 --> 26:20.480]  is the nhs at a crisis point there's the headline and then admits that it's
[26:20.480 --> 26:24.560]  just all falling apart oh they need total control
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.880]  they need social control now to make you you know live the way they say and then
[26:28.880 --> 26:33.440]  then you'll get your health care so what did
[26:33.440 --> 26:36.640]  zika lomania will say he said after we bankrupt health care with obama care
[26:36.640 --> 26:40.400]  which is only increased prices massively we'll come in with single pair but
[26:40.400 --> 26:43.760]  it'll still be administered by big insurance companies
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.960]  and then computers so i'm gonna explain this ai computers
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.640]  autonomous computers decision-making computers is the proper term
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.000]  are already in control of your life on medical care
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.920]  they're already all the new cars coming out all the upper end are
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.600]  autonomous so robots are already in 2018
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.040]  taking your life over the military admits they're rolling out all these
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.280]  killer robots but the big killer robots aren't
[27:11.280 --> 27:13.360]  gonna be the ones that are on the battlefield
[27:13.360 --> 27:16.720]  it's the ones that decide if you live or die that run the system that tell you
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.720]  in the megadopolis when you get food where you work where you travel when
[27:20.720 --> 27:24.400]  you get the authorization to travel it's the nightmare model of the zeitgeist
[27:24.400 --> 27:28.240]  sold to socialist as this wonderful utopia we're an all-seeing robot the
[27:28.240 --> 27:33.760]  sky an electric guy runs our life but who programs it
[27:33.760 --> 27:39.360]  so there's the rest of the story and it's total control it's totally evil it
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.400]  needs to stop but they always sell it like oh
[27:42.400 --> 27:45.600]  it's just for you know if somebody's in a coma no it's not
[27:45.600 --> 27:49.680]  you'll see thousands of cases in the news i've watched parliamentary debates
[27:49.680 --> 27:52.240]  even back when tony blair was in he admitted where you could have an
[27:52.240 --> 27:57.040]  operable tumor on your skin you name it if you do within six months they make
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.000]  you wait two years and you die
[28:00.560 --> 28:03.120]  you understand that

[33:44.320 --> 33:49.120]  sister would physically attack the vice president so that that's all coming up
[33:49.120 --> 33:53.680]  uh just amazing so we're gonna be getting to all that but i wanted to show
[33:53.680 --> 33:56.640]  this article one more time there were a bunch of these last week and i barely
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.360]  mentioned it that big new studies are coming out in the u k the u s
[34:01.360 --> 34:06.880]  europe you name it where 86 to 90 plus percent depending on which study you
[34:06.880 --> 34:09.280]  look at
[34:09.360 --> 34:15.360]  of individuals in the united states and in europe and we're going to put that
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.040]  article up on screen if we can place there it is gender bending chemicals
[34:19.040 --> 34:24.240]  found in plastics and linked to breast and prostate cancer are found in 86
[34:24.240 --> 34:27.840]  percent of teenagers bodies and it goes on to say they're in adults and even
[34:27.840 --> 34:31.680]  higher levels in some cases and let's scroll down i'm going to read part of
[34:31.680 --> 34:34.720]  this article here between all a is found
[34:34.720 --> 34:37.920]  along with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[34:37.920 --> 34:44.800]  other chemicals that in samples of 94 teenagers found
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.400]  80 plus of them had high levels of the chemicals in them
[34:50.400 --> 34:56.080]  and what do they admit those chemicals do
[34:56.080 --> 35:01.920]  they admit that they gender bend and they affect the brain and they affect
[35:01.920 --> 35:09.840]  how your olfactory nerve smells the different
[35:09.840 --> 35:13.360]  scents that are put off that are part of mammalian activity
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.920]  and then it manipulates and jacks with that there's another one new scientists
[35:17.920 --> 35:21.680]  gender bending chemicals found to feminized boys
[35:21.680 --> 35:27.040]  now that's back in 2005 by the way that's when i first made the gay frogs
[35:27.040 --> 35:30.160]  comment and i said nothing against the fact
[35:30.160 --> 35:36.080]  that most of the frogs are gay the fact is they're sterile and they're dying
[35:36.080 --> 35:39.600]  they then edited that then made a joke out of it
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.440]  to then make sure no one had a serious debate about this
[35:43.440 --> 35:47.440]  but i keep going back to this because it's such a central issue
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.400]  that now they're coming out admitting all of this in 2018
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.520]  but it was already admitted back in 2005 and before
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.560]  it was only though in scholarly journals
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.360]  so what's the bottom line here i personally do things
[36:05.360 --> 36:09.280]  like take alpha power that's got natural herbs in it
[36:09.280 --> 36:12.720]  that are known to counter veil the effects of this garbage that's in our
[36:12.720 --> 36:15.440]  environment and i personally also take super
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.520]  male vitality and people say well you've got anthroplex you've got alpha power
[36:19.520 --> 36:21.920]  you've got super male which one do you like the best they're all
[36:21.920 --> 36:24.880]  different formulas they all affect things differently
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.200]  different people like them better one person i mean here in the office they're
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.080]  split between the three products some people like super male better than
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.840]  alpha power people like alpha power better than
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.240]  anthroplex people like anthroplex better than alpha power and vice versa
[36:38.240 --> 36:43.040]  so we have a his and hers combo running right now

[38:08.400 --> 38:11.520]  environment take x2 the good halogen they put the bad
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.520]  halogens in the water and the food it bio accumulates it fries your glands on
[38:15.520 --> 38:18.800]  record lowers IQs all the studies look it up yourself
[38:18.800 --> 38:22.080]  and then you take real pure iodine that we've got from deep earth crystal
[38:22.080 --> 38:25.840]  sources people are completely blown away by what it does
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.600]  i mean it is it is it is such a game changer the weight loss the energy the
[38:29.600 --> 38:33.200]  stamina it's it's crazy but if you've already got thyroid issues and stuff
[38:33.200 --> 38:35.120]  everybody should check with their physician before
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.240]  you take it even though you die without iodine they've artificially keep
[38:38.240 --> 38:41.600]  lowering the rate they say you need the government used to put a crappy form in
[38:41.600 --> 38:44.080]  the salt then they took it out because IQs had gone so low
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.200]  goiter was so bad across the country especially the midwesters are not eating
[38:47.200 --> 38:54.240]  seafood look that up yourself 15 IQ IQ boost within just a decade

[39:01.840 --> 39:07.280]  10 surprising facts about iodine absolutely
[39:07.280 --> 39:12.800]  iodine salt gave us 10 year IQ boost say researchers see just i went from memory
[39:12.800 --> 39:16.480]  and in a 10 year study it went up 15 points on average see my memory served
[39:16.480 --> 39:20.000]  here that's the same study when there's so many of these i'm not telling you
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.240]  a secret here say 15 15 points boom
[39:24.240 --> 39:28.640]  boom my memory served holds that article
[39:28.640 --> 39:32.720]  2013 and that was from the Centers for Disease Control
[39:32.720 --> 39:35.120]  because see they were having a discussion about whether they should put it
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.880]  back in the salt but oh we don't force medicate you we're a free country
[39:38.880 --> 39:44.720]  we just put hydrophoresic acid a acid based weaponized form of bad halogen
[39:44.720 --> 39:47.680]  to make sure it fries everything and fries your
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.320]  adrenals and and and fries your your
[39:52.880 --> 39:55.600]  reproductive systems it's simply incredible okay i'm gonna stop ranting

[40:01.840 --> 40:04.000]  okay let me do this let me just tell you what's gonna come up in the next
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.840]  seven because i've already been ranting here
[40:05.840 --> 40:09.680]  uh there's so much to get to house democrats give
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.040]  democrats help with winning the GOP strongholds conservatives who vow to
[40:13.040 --> 40:15.120]  stop spending keep spending we'll get to that
[40:15.120 --> 40:17.680]  this is really important i'll cover this when we come back first
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.680]  zombie bots are coming for lonely singles on valentine's day
[40:21.680 --> 40:26.480]  and i talk a lot about this most of the bots especially the target young people
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.480]  and leftist according to uh Sean parker former head of
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.320]  facebook and others most of your friends on facebook and twitter are
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.640]  fake if you're a leftist that's the real bots the
[40:38.640 --> 40:41.440]  russians came and figured out to do this
[40:41.440 --> 40:44.640]  it turned out that came on congressional hearings
[40:44.640 --> 40:51.120]  in 2016 twitter came to the russians and i forget the amount with some huge
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.240]  amount like 12 million they said why don't you spend this huge amount
[40:54.240 --> 40:57.280]  and we'll push your stories and we'll tell you what's trending and we'll tell
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.120]  you what one of your stories to push and on there was black lives matters
[41:01.120 --> 41:03.120]  second amendment not because it's a conspiracy
[41:03.120 --> 41:06.480]  like shiff says that's in the contract that rt released
[41:06.480 --> 41:09.920]  that's what they told him to push and they signed a smaller contract i forget
[41:09.920 --> 41:11.680]  to tell there's a couple hundred thousand dollars
[41:11.680 --> 41:18.000]  the point is is that the bots our facebook our twitter our youtube
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.200]  and they admit that most of the people in there are bots and that they go and
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.120]  make leftist more depressed make them more scared try to keep them in longer
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.120]  try to make them afraid to go out and then they socially engineer them
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.840]  within those echo chambers so that's coming up
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.400]  it's so critical because other media will report on this but just oh
[41:38.400 --> 41:40.960]  those so-called sweethearts you think are reaching out to you
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.520]  those things you think are actually valentine's request they're not
[41:45.520 --> 41:48.640]  there it is how twitter bots are recycling cold war techniques to so
[41:48.640 --> 41:54.080]  political division yeah it's it's it's it's twitter
[41:54.080 --> 42:02.000]  doing it at a scale unimaginable compared to
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.120]  and so they like little short things because the computers to come up with
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.800]  short things that's why they started early with only a few characters
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.280]  characters characters because people would know it was a bot
[42:13.280 --> 42:17.120]  if it got too long now the bots got better so they massively increase the

[45:18.640 --> 45:22.800]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.400]  experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose
[45:26.400 --> 45:29.680]  itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production
[45:29.680 --> 45:34.080]  they began studying the effects in public trials in their public trials
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.560]  now we are introducing the fruit of the research a fast-acting chewable tablet

[46:07.040 --> 46:10.160]  microbiome not all probiotics are made the same
[46:10.160 --> 46:13.520]  floor life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system

[46:17.280 --> 46:22.320]  for maximum effect this is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[46:22.320 --> 46:24.720]  so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic

[47:21.040 --> 47:25.280]  waging war on corruption alex jones
[47:25.280 --> 47:31.600]  should the top of the season so the facts are in
[47:31.600 --> 47:34.880]  there's been so many news articles from hre media the last decade it makes my
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.880]  head spin how the big tech companies the cia you
[47:38.880 --> 47:43.920]  name it we're developing fake news bots to go out and propaganda dies
[47:43.920 --> 47:47.840]  and shan parker came out last year and said that we're targeting helpless people
[47:47.840 --> 47:50.480]  we're controlling them we're manipulating their dopamine levels
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.160]  facebook documents came out in 2017 out of australia at the highest levels
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.440]  about how they target liberals and try to keep them alone
[47:57.440 --> 48:00.800]  and radicalized and scared their main target is
[48:00.800 --> 48:05.600]  leftist that just translates into domesticated millennial with no future
[48:05.600 --> 48:09.120]  and then the parasites that usually kind of beatnik types that feed on them and
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.920]  control them you'll see it everywhere you go to a leftist rally none of them
[48:11.920 --> 48:14.880]  will talk to anybody because they're not supposed to talk and none of them can
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.680]  talk they'll be like one communist minder
[48:17.680 --> 48:21.360]  they're usually driving a Mercedes so continuing
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.960]  here the cia's fake news campaign even the new york times last year admitted
[48:24.960 --> 48:28.560]  that uh and and the whole bots wired magazine said
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.080]  what do bots mean to the future of journalism well
[48:32.080 --> 48:37.840]  twitter is mainly leftist bots so is facebook and it's fake people advertising
[48:37.840 --> 48:40.080]  things to you it's it's all of it and there
[48:40.080 --> 48:45.920]  here's the key though it's fake bots bullying you
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.640]  when you say something that's true or patriotic or pro america
[48:50.640 --> 48:54.080]  just like veritas got the documents out of twitter
[48:54.080 --> 48:57.920]  and the employees on video saying i'll give an example we banned sharing the
[48:57.920 --> 49:00.640]  american flag and then you think you're sharing it but
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.400]  you're not we don't like white people we don't like rednecks
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.240]  now again it's mainly white people saying this just like
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.080]  hbo and just like all the stuff that's happening
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.160]  at these other platforms like vice billionaires
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.440]  that run that channel want the public to see things like this
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.520]  vice airs documentary on black healing retreats for people who need a break
[49:27.520 --> 49:30.000]  from white people and we're going to place them that the third hour today
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.280]  some excerpts it's amazing they say things in there
[49:33.280 --> 49:37.040]  that are just dumbfounding like well whites are inherently evil white
[49:37.040 --> 49:40.960]  shouldn't be able to travel outside the country
[49:40.960 --> 49:44.720]  true true brainwashing so that's going to be coming up
[49:44.720 --> 49:48.880]  as well so that's the point i'm trying to get at is
[49:48.880 --> 49:55.280]  it's fake people you're talking to it is fake bots it is fake propaganda
[49:55.280 --> 49:58.960]  and it is creating race war division culture war
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.600]  men against women women against men families against families
[50:03.600 --> 50:07.360]  america against russia but open the borders up to islam
[50:07.360 --> 50:10.160]  and don't check anybody and let them come in unvetted and
[50:10.160 --> 50:13.840]  find european countries a hundred thousand euros a year if they don't bring
[50:13.840 --> 50:17.280]  in military aged men on and on and on and throw old
[50:17.280 --> 50:20.320]  pensioners out of their sectionate housing and put islamists in it
[50:20.320 --> 50:23.760]  because they've got to advertise and sweeten the deal
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.360]  to get people to come there for the Balkanization of
[50:27.360 --> 50:33.760]  europe that is the plan and as soon as people start realizing how diabolical
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.120]  all this is and how this is planned and how this is admitted
[50:37.120 --> 50:43.360]  the sooner we can beat it because you got fake bots trying to run your life
[50:43.360 --> 50:47.360]  you've got fake bots bullying you you've got ai autonomous computers already
[50:47.360 --> 50:50.160]  running your health care already running the va already
[50:50.160 --> 50:53.600]  deciding who gets a knee surgery who doesn't
[50:53.600 --> 50:58.320]  it's here and they cause a national debate because etna comes out and says
[50:58.320 --> 51:00.400]  well humans don't review it it's machines
[51:00.400 --> 51:04.400]  everybody freaks out that's the plan
[51:05.040 --> 51:08.560]  we're under it oh now the national health service is falling apart in the u k
[51:08.560 --> 51:11.440]  it's always been horrible but now there's a problem because they're about to make
[51:11.440 --> 51:14.960]  it worse and put it under the big corporations to totally privatize it
[51:14.960 --> 51:17.680]  but it's not going to be privatization like we think of it's going to be
[51:17.680 --> 51:21.760]  privatization where computers run it all and screw everybody and only big
[51:21.760 --> 51:26.160]  mega corporations get to be in the pool
[51:26.160 --> 51:29.680]  that's the opposite of trump's free marketization where he's actually trying
[51:29.680 --> 51:33.840]  to have an open bidding process which will drive down prices in
[51:33.840 --> 51:37.280]  every single case but the more money you put behind education
[51:37.280 --> 51:41.920]  the more money you put behind health care the more the price goes up and when
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.040]  you make people buy health care like a national health
[51:45.040 --> 51:48.880]  service everybody's got to pay into what should do it drives the price up
[51:48.880 --> 51:52.080]  and when you make people buy obama care that doubles and triples prices with
[51:52.080 --> 51:55.760]  grubber saying thank god you're so dumb i was hired to double and triple prices
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.280]  thank god they have no memory they're like a goldfish
[51:59.280 --> 52:03.360]  ha ha ha you're so effing stupid like zuckerberg said about you if you do go
[52:03.360 --> 52:06.880]  along with that you are dumb aren't you
[52:06.880 --> 52:10.640]  but people that don't have any friends that sit there in a little apartment
[52:10.640 --> 52:13.680]  and are lucky if they have a job and are totally scared and watch
[52:13.680 --> 52:16.800]  cobear all night and then they go out on the street
[52:16.800 --> 52:19.440]  and and and none of them really talk to each other or friends they all just
[52:19.440 --> 52:23.200]  virtue signal they're all really alone really
[52:23.200 --> 52:26.720]  scared with the screen sickness they're all only looking at their phones when
[52:26.720 --> 52:29.600]  you see trendies walking down the street they're alone
[52:29.600 --> 52:32.640]  they're isolated
[52:32.640 --> 52:41.520]  under the smart phone spell under the smart phone sickness
[52:41.520 --> 52:45.920]  which they admit programs your brain lowers your iq lowers your brain waves
[52:45.920 --> 52:48.880]  it's incredible
[52:51.120 --> 52:55.840]  now i have so much news it makes my head spin but
[52:56.320 --> 53:00.320]  coming up we're going to have a couple really interesting really smart guys in
[53:00.320 --> 53:03.680]  studio really interesting backgrounds and i wish both of them would tell you
[53:03.680 --> 53:08.080]  more of their background but they've seen quite a few things
[53:08.080 --> 53:13.600]  and we're going to get their take on that they were here before about a
[53:13.600 --> 53:16.720]  month ago about just a magazine ad that shows
[53:16.720 --> 53:19.920]  antifa attacking and burning thing and an image of veterans
[53:19.920 --> 53:26.080]  saying not on our watch not today antifa and since then newsweek time all
[53:26.080 --> 53:29.360]  attacked the national news which only brought them more success and blew up
[53:29.360 --> 53:32.560]  in their face but now the democrats are calling for all this violence
[53:32.560 --> 53:36.400]  we're going to be discussing that coming up uh at the six afters when we're
[53:36.400 --> 53:39.920]  going to bring those folks in i've got a special report that needs to be seen
[53:39.920 --> 53:43.280]  social media giants meet for orwellian control
[53:43.280 --> 53:46.720]  that's coming up the first five minutes of the next hour
[53:46.720 --> 53:50.480]  and then we're going to uh the illusion of globalism is getting to fade
[53:50.480 --> 53:53.840]  we must reclaim our republics some really powerful pieces but what's
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.400]  sickening is steven bannon the videos up on info wars dot com
[53:58.400 --> 54:01.040]  judas is scary it meets benedict arnold they had a baby
[54:01.040 --> 54:04.720]  it'd be called stevy bannon little stevy weavy bannon
[54:04.720 --> 54:08.800]  lemon squeezy bannon uh he has come out
[54:08.800 --> 54:13.200]  and he has said oh the me too they always stage it like in private
[54:13.200 --> 54:16.480]  meeting with a reporter he he clutched himself and said the women are going
[54:16.480 --> 54:18.880]  enslave us they're too powerful they're too incredible
[54:18.880 --> 54:22.480]  they'll bring down trump i'm scared they'll cut my testicles off i i don't
[54:22.480 --> 54:25.120]  know what to do mommy mommy let's play that club again
[54:25.120 --> 54:29.120]  and and and this is just meant to hype women into this oh you want power
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.920]  oh look even the elites the bad guy that the evil man bannon is now a good guy
[54:33.920 --> 54:38.240]  and he he admits he's scared of you women power against the men i mean this is
[54:38.240 --> 54:41.280]  the most ridiculous sophomoric advertising like
[54:41.280 --> 54:44.960]  edward bernay's saying we can't get women to smoke cigarettes in the 1920s
[54:44.960 --> 54:48.560]  they said finance every feminist suffrage march and have the women smoke
[54:48.560 --> 54:51.920]  cigarettes and say my man can't stop me well that was men owned the tobacco
[54:51.920 --> 54:55.200]  companies no i was going to kill you deader than a hammer so it's the same
[54:55.200 --> 54:58.960]  total manipulation uh so here's little stevie bannon
[54:58.960 --> 55:02.160]  i don't normally play clubs twice an hour but here's here's one of the
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.120]  reporters on cnn fawning over oh yeah so
[55:07.120 --> 55:09.840]  how they built up the whole me too movement to create this
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.200]  that the obvious direction to quote empower women
[55:13.200 --> 55:16.320]  to hate trump and hate recovery and hate america
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.480]  and then celebrate the north korean's dictator sister
[55:20.480 --> 55:23.840]  who's so sexy and cool on the very same channel here it is
[55:23.840 --> 55:26.640]  in the paperback release of the new book you talk about watching the golden
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.080]  globe awards with steve bannon and you got his reaction to the red carpet
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.880]  protest supporting the me too movement he said quote the antra anti patriarchy
[55:34.880 --> 55:38.480]  is going to undo 10 000 years of recorded history you watch the time
[55:38.480 --> 55:41.280]  has come women are going to take charge of society
[55:41.280 --> 55:44.800]  and they couldn't juxtapose a better villain than trump he is the patriarch
[55:44.800 --> 55:48.640]  this is a definitional moment in the culture it'll never be the same
[55:48.640 --> 55:52.240]  going forward you know i think bannon despite all his
[55:52.240 --> 55:55.920]  flaws is a pretty shrewd analyst of american politics and particularly
[55:55.920 --> 55:59.920]  american political anxieties are national anxieties and he recognized
[55:59.920 --> 56:04.720]  in those golden globe awards that this was a movement that could potentially
[56:04.720 --> 56:08.320]  be an existential threat to republicans not just the majority in the house
[56:08.320 --> 56:13.760]  but also to president trump and there's a wonderful revealing moment of fruity
[56:13.760 --> 56:17.760]  and angst in the scene as i described bannon watching oprah
[56:17.760 --> 56:22.640]  where he says look if they were to roll out a guillotine right now
[56:22.640 --> 56:25.920]  these ladies would chop off every set of balls in the room
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.680]  but which is which is a blunt bannon way of saying they're good and we're bad
[56:29.680 --> 56:33.200]  me too movement they're coming for our manhood and i think that expressed
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.520]  a lot of the anxieties that bannon that trump the people of that political
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.440]  persuasion have about this this new rising movement of
[56:41.440 --> 56:46.320]  of women which is really a backlash to the man that that bannon calls the
[56:46.320 --> 56:50.080]  patriarch trump himself so this is trump's supposed best buddy
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.760]  now saying he's the patriarchy he's evil he's got to be brought down
[56:53.760 --> 56:57.280]  total bit of carnal behavior with this whole made-up narrative that women are
[56:57.280 --> 57:00.400]  going to be empowered if trump was taken down and this is how you're
[57:00.400 --> 57:04.240]  powerful ladies when seeing in funded the whole arab spring was part of it
[57:04.240 --> 57:06.800]  promoted it turning most of middle east over to

[57:10.000 --> 57:15.120]  thousands sold children to sex slavery cover up for radical islam
[57:15.120 --> 57:18.560]  and they're just up there saying women you're supposed to get mad at trump now

[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.560]  first this powerful report social media giants me for orwellian control
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.080]  representatives from google facebook twitter and youtube
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.680]  faced the british parliamentary committee on us soil at george

[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.760]  unchecked power to gather their users data there's an ask in the times today
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.480]  in the uk and the headline is how to win two billion friends and destroy
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.920]  civilization the biggest surveillance enterprise
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.240]  in history and this is by a very well-known journalist
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.240]  and he is is suggesting that there's whether facebook like it or not the
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.160]  position that you've got yourself into is this
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.320]  disposition it is it you hold so much data about people that you are now
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.600]  very very powerful i just wanted to know how long
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.200]  do you um do you hold people's data for that you collect about them
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.560]  do you limit yes as long as they want us to oddly enough
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.840]  after demonizing the social media giants reach the orwellian panel dove head
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.880]  first into the need to control and regulate free
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.880]  speech to accept them that there is a problem of
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.320]  bogus news misleading news disinformation and you also accept that you
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.920]  have both the responsibility to and the means to address that
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.720]  we recognize that there is a problem of misinformation and we are dedicated to
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.560]  making sure that we are um promoting authoritative
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.760]  content when it comes to news and demoting misinformation when you're
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.800]  talking about misinformation well let's face it misinformation
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.520]  disinformation fake news uh can be sort of sexy i mean people like
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.960]  ghosts they like conspiracy theories they like ufo stories and they follow it
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.560]  and this creates i would imagine a huge amount of traffic
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.240]  both propagating those theories etc and those who want to quash that so that
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.080]  would be good for you because you can then harvest the data from those people
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.760]  uh who we who are doing that doesn't it demonstrate that perhaps
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.920]  it's time for regulation it's time for rules that set out the roles of
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.000]  responsibilities and all of these things because all of this is affecting
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.720]  our society we are not the arbiters of truth
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.640]  we are not going to remove content based on that this is untrue and
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.280]  the one trend that twitter has is it's a hive of journalists of citizens of
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.320]  activists correcting the record and correcting information
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.280]  if an account was created for the sole purpose of abusing somebody that would
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.880]  cross our sole purpose abuse if it was using uh language based on a
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.240]  protective characteristic and it's hateful conduct we'd move it for that
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.400]  but the the truestness of a piece of information is not the ground upon
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.200]  the deliberate use of your platform to distribute
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.640]  absolutely false and inflammatory information uh can continue in election
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.960]  time according to what you've just said do you agree with me that twitter is
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.400]  addictive but i don't think it's uh in in our position to say that because it
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.840]  depends very much on the individual i think it's exactly your position to
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.920]  say that because it is your product we have a large
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.920]  team of what we call raiders uh 10 000 people around the globe who are
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.760]  constantly at work assessing our results against different
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.480]  queries uh are we surfacing the right kind of
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.560]  results are we surfacing results that have appropriate authority
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.800]  and they we use that those hundreds of thousands of bits of data
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.080]  from those evaluations to continue to train our systems
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.680]  this is an ongoing effort i just wanted to mention some
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.040]  research that was done recently by The Guardian that suggested that
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.440]  the largest source of news uh for false uh news channels came from youtube and
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.280]  came from these videos that tend to be recommended by the
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  next button and more research by Oxford academics demonstrated
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:25.680]  a lot of this had a far right bias so i put it to you that if that is the case
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:32.080]  uh you are indoctrinating society ultimately regulating social media
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.480]  information will ensure its own downfall credible sources
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.440]  truth and valid opinions are not exclusive to the establishment media in
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.080]  fact the opposite has become increasingly

[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:25.840]  Well, the kingpin of Hollywood, Rob Reiner says the left is in a revolution against America,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.480]  against Trump, and they're calling for more violence. Here's a little compilation of
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:59.320]  some of what they've been saying lately.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:29.200]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:59.040]  decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the secret service.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:09.080]  All right, there's so much to cover on this front that if I start talking, these guys
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.080]  will never get a word in edgewise. And some of these folks, we just flew back into Austin,
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:18.400]  so I want to get to their views of what's happening currently with Kit Cope of Spicetatical.com
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:25.080]  and of course, Lincoln Osiris, which is a joke name, a gnome deplume from Tropic Thunder.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.320]  And we're going to get these guys to hold backgrounds or anything, but they're really
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.880]  interesting fellows. And of course, my good buddy over here, Quentin Carter. But we do
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.520]  have the Democrats calling for civil war, calling for killing people, attacking people
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.840]  all over the country. You guys a few months ago did a full page spread, photos saying
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.720]  none on our watch, not today, Antifa. The media went crazy. I wanted to get you guys
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.960]  back to talk about just how you see with your backgrounds, being in the third world, being
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.240]  in dictatorships, also, you know, knowing things about different aspects of COG without
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.920]  getting classified where this country is because the Democrats put out that we're in a war.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.080]  They're attacking us. They want to overthrow things in their own venues at their own award
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.400]  shows at the New York Times. But then when we cover it, they say, you're insane. None
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.040]  of that's happening. What is that military tactic? So again, Kit Q. And of course, we've
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.600]  got Mr. Mr. Lincoln Osiris over here who wants to take it first.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:26.520]  I think that's I think that's you, Lincoln. You've got the you've got the most. You have
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.880]  the most experience with that sort of bottom line. I figured he did. He definitely does.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.920]  But bottom line is the insanity that that people will blindly follow an ideology that
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.120]  they have no idea what it is. So the Democrats are out there calling for civil war, knowing
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.360]  that they're not the ones on the line. They're trying to manipulate ignorant people to go
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:52.760]  out and fight that war for them. So the whether it's the people in Charlottesville or anywhere
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.760]  else that come out and they write and they do all this stuff, they're not doing it because
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.040]  they think that's the right thing to do. They're doing it because they've been manipulated
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.840]  by someone who has a different idea of what it is that they're doing.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.280]  Well, by sensationalism and emotion as well. Just like George Soros and them pushing the
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.360]  Black Lives Matter movement. They know that that black on black violence kills black people.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:24.320]  It never affects the ultra rich white globalist. It only helps them. That's right. And to
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.520]  be honest, some of these guys actually may believe that they're doing right. But that
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:36.560]  just kind of really helps explain the difference between our mindset and their mindset. I'm
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.800]  just concerned because there's a massive gear up and George Soros is in the news. Everyone
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.920]  are funding it and people say, Oh, well, they're a joke. I get they're a joke. Like you said
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.960]  to you, they're just the cover for this. But the Democrats aren't giving up and going along
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.360]  with the election and the recovery. They're fighting. Here's a great example. They cheered
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.040]  the North Korean dictator's sister at the opening of the Olympics and said in the news,
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.920]  we hope she kicks the vice president off the podium. They then said, Oh, Trump was a military
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.960]  parade. That's fascist. We're going to lay in front of the tanks when a parade isn't tanks
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.720]  coming into the capital city of China to crush peaceful demonstrators like Tiananmen Square.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.440]  The left are the ones trying to block free speech everywhere. They're the tanks.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.760]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know what's so strange? I just did an interview the other
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:26.320]  day regarding the very same advert that's behind us right now. And the guy that was
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.040]  doing the interview, he said to me, he said, Oh, well, you know, I'm fairly left leaning.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.520]  You know, I'm not, you know, I'm not in the socialist party like a lot of my friends.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:41.440]  And I said, wait, right there. Stop. You just said a lot of your friends are in the socialist
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:48.200]  party. Now, when I was growing up, that was a really bad word. That meant like impending
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.560]  doom. Oh, no, they're socialists. There's people here that are whole show that half
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:59.120]  of millennials, half of millennials identify as socialist or communist. Amazing. No one
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.080]  I mean, I think part of that is because they've grown up in a society where the last eight
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.440]  12 years, everything was given to them. So they think that's the norm. Like everything
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.960]  should be given to me. I deserve free college. I deserve this. I deserve that. I don't have
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.800]  to work for anything. I don't have to do anything. There's there's no military obligation. Like
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.720]  I don't have to go somewhere. Lincoln and myself both have free college. That's what
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.120]  they say. Well, it's not free at all because we both spend lots of money for many, many
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.320]  years earning it. So let me ask this question to Lincoln. Looking at this, looking at the
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.280]  battle space in America, if you're just a citizen, where do you think the country is
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.080]  right now? What do you think Trump is with the recovery? Are we turning the tide? Are
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.920]  we winning or I mean, what do you expect to happen because the left has just gone into
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.440]  a total craze mode and I'm really concerned. So we spoke about this last time I was on
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.280]  the air. They don't have anything else. I think at this point they've got to resort
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:05.880]  to this is the last resort. We our stock markets are looking great. The economy is turning
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:14.040]  around. We're at the lowest point of unemployment for blacks in history. And what do they have?
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.520]  They've got nothing but let's just create violence. If and I don't believe they say
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:26.240]  they're for free speech unless it's in opposition to what they're saying. So I think this is
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.640]  all they've got left. They're just trying to create drama. But what I don't understand
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.440]  is why. Like I really cannot fathom at all. Like what's the whole idea? All about controlling
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.600]  us. They want power over America to control the planet. It just blows my mind. I just
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.960]  can't see it. I don't understand how it works. They can't afford to have anyone look at our
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.320]  administration and think things are going well, that he's doing a good job. They cannot
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.680]  afford that. Therefore they've got to take the truth and twist it. But in your mind,
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.160]  where do you think that you stand to gain something by bringing us down? You're an American.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.360]  You're one of us. You should be sitting here. Well, that's the thing. They openly root for
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.980]  the North Korean dictator. Right. And that's what I'm saying. I need maybe some psychological
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:16.400]  expertise to tell me like why this is okay. And why are there so many young white male
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:22.120]  kids out there wearing skinny jeans and beanies right now talking about communism and all
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.680]  of this other crap that they have no idea what it is. We messed up. This is what we
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.720]  should do. This is the result of the participation trophy. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. This is what happens
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.280]  when everybody gets a ribbon. Exactly. That's what Matt and Zach, some of the producers
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.840]  say is that it's a live action role playing when they go out with guns and block people
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.800]  from going to rallies and attack people or hit a woman there with a bike lock. For them,
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.400]  it's like larping. It's not real. Right. Because there's never been a repercussion
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  for their actions because they grew up in a household where daddy didn't whip them and
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.320]  mom was like, Oh, don't be mean to him. Let's be really soft about his feelings and don't
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.920]  yell at him, but give him his phone and his computer and his car back and let him go do
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.960]  whatever instead of taking a whooping like we did as kids. If you messed up, Dr. Jones
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.520]  will war you out if you acted the way that these kids act today. But that's from that.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.000]  That's from the street level, uh, from the upper echelon, from the level controlling
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.840]  that level. You know, obviously you've, you've got your, your theories on, on why and how,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.840]  but from the, from that street level where, where all these kids are just, you know, gimme,
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.400]  gimme, gimme, and I don't have to pay for what I've done or anything. The, the blind
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.200]  following is, is really what's confusing. Exactly. They're never running to Venezuela
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.680]  or Cuba or North Korea anywhere. They're just here bitching with their smartphones and
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.960]  their new car and like, I want communism bitches. And they're like, you're like, are you kidding
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.040]  in communism? You wouldn't have anything. We'll be back to talk about then what their
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.640]  next move will be as they lose and there's a global awakening.

[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:34.960]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:44.280]  studios. We are back live. We've got big news coming up next segment, but the biggest news
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:50.360]  is right now with KitCup of Spicestatical.com. We've got Lincoln Osiris of PipeHitersUnion.com,
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:55.000]  some of the greatest t-shirts and other materials out there. But before I go any further, we're
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.160]  talking during the break, we have all these COG groups, the Democratic Party, in Atlantic
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.360]  Monthly, you name it, saying we're already shopping around the Pentagon overthrowing
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.280]  the president extrajudicially. You have Brennan, you have Clapper last year saying he'll be
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:15.120]  gone by December in October. That didn't happen. You've got Phil Mudd, the former head of counter
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.800]  terrorism at the CIA, who says he's a proud crap holder. That's a quote, two of you haven't
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.320]  seen it, saying the government's going to kill this guy about the president. My concern,
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.880]  just to you guys as citizens, veterans, as patriots, what happens if the president is
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.960]  killed? What happens if all the left's threats to do this and try to overthrow the election
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.920]  and all of this? What happens in your mind if that unfolds?
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:46.080]  I would imagine, I mean, I would imagine in the interim, right after the overthrow, there
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:52.440]  are, you got to think of, okay, well, who's in charge? Who's controlling what's going
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:58.480]  to happen next? So you would think, okay, it's just a police state. Well, then who
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.480]  runs that?
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.920]  Right. And then you start thinking of police state. You start thinking about things like
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:08.920]  that. You start talking about big government being shut down, the welfare system, free
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.240]  food, free water, free groceries, all that kind of stuff. What's going to happen in the
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.280]  inner cities? We saw it, what, two years ago when California turned off EBT for 12 hours
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:22.040]  and they started trying to burn the place down. But what happens when that system shuts
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:28.200]  down completely? And my big thing is, is what happens amongst veterans and patriots when
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.480]  something happens for whatever reason, whether he's removed or killed or whatever. And now
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.680]  someone else decides they're just going to come into our place and take what's ours and
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.520]  change that. How far is the normal person going to be pushed before they decide, okay,
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.160]  my back's against the ropes and I'm coming out swinging.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.560]  And will it even get that far? The reason I say that is, all right, you take over the
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.800]  government. How do you hold it? Yeah, yeah, that's what I can't imagine. Even for even
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:58.000]  a minute, most units, most military units, of course, they're going to have to implement
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.040]  martial law. But most units are saying, Hey, I'm not down with this. I've got a family
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.360]  at home. I'm going to go take care of my family because when the world's on fire, guys are
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.680]  thinking about home, they're thinking about their families. They're not thinking about,
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.120]  Hey, this unlawful order that was just given to me. Yeah, so it's one thing to, you know,
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.320]  kill the president. But now you've got control. How do you hold it? Yeah, I don't think it
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.840]  recovers almost impossible. We've had this conversation is that aren't going to lay down.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.240]  Right. We've had this conversation in many different countries in the middle of the
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.240]  night, random, you know, conversations between guys who do the things that we do. You know,
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:39.960]  if it came down to it, could you fire on Americans? You know, if you were put in a position for
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:46.880]  martial law, for the National Guard, for whatever is, what's the reality that federal troops
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.360]  or state troops will patrol the streets and fire on Americans? And it's just not going
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.760]  to happen. I don't believe it at all. I'll tell you what, I've done a whole lot of horrible
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:04.120]  things in the name of the country. But that is one thing I couldn't do. No, and that's
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:09.800]  why I'm not that guy. And that's why I think it doesn't recover. I don't think the system
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:15.400]  recovers at all. I don't think you can overthrow the president, take over the system and establish
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:20.840]  your own regime. I don't think so. I think you, you start that process. Everything's
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:27.920]  going to turn to, I can't curse. Crap. Bravo, Sierra. Yep. There we go. And, and we've got
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:32.000]  a, we've got a feudal system. You guys got in like 10 minutes before you went on air.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.240]  We haven't even talked for a long time there. I asked that question because that's the common
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.840]  sense answer. I figured I'd get, because I get that from other veterans and active duty.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.320]  You name it. And the only reason we're raising this is mainstream media is pushing the narrative.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.120]  This is coming. Probably overthrown. He's a Russian agent. Rand Paul's a Russian agent.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.200]  Tucker Carlson's a Russian agent. Roger Stone's a Russian agent with no proof. And then they're
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.560]  the outside globalist power trying to sell us. It's just what you just said. Kit and
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.400]  what Lincoln said and what Q said. No one's going to go along with that. And that shows
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:10.080]  the bravada and the insane disconnect of all these senile people and really crazy people
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.800]  like Michael Moore who says, we want martial law, arrest, you know, Trump, you know, bring
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.480]  in all this stuff. It's like they're the ones pushing this. And I don't think they'll ever
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:25.240]  get away with it. I'm just surprised how tolerant it's been so far when they're in the news
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.200]  saying we're going to kill everybody. We're going to overthrow. We're planning to kill
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.840]  the president. We're planning to do all this stuff. We're going after his family. And then
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:40.160]  we're all sitting here taking it. I just, I mean, there should be grand juries convened.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.200]  The FBI should be visiting people. If I was on air saying let's organize people for violence
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.720]  to start killing people over to the government. I mean, I should be visited, but, but, but
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.000]  no, they're all doing it. And it's fine. Yeah, they can go about their normal day. They go
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.360]  to work. They go home. They live their lives and they should be hemmed up. And those are
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.800]  the ones that will fall in line. March step to the beat of the drum. Those guys will fall
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:09.240]  in line. I think they want to be told what to do. Michael Moore and those guys, they
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.520]  don't think about something that because they don't live in a reality we live in. Martial
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:21.160]  law means civil unrest. It means killing and all kinds of crazy stuff. It means that there
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.600]  are people at home that don't have anything that they're going to go find it from somewhere
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.000]  else, right? I've got some food. I've got some water and the leftist elites with their
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.320]  10 foot walls out in California. Boy, guess what? Um, if, if hypothetically, if, if I
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:43.160]  needed something and I needed to go find it, I'm not going to go to an urban area of Atlanta
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.320]  to find what it is that I'm looking for. I'm going to go to some big fancy house in the
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.640]  hills with a 10 foot fence because they have everything they've ever wanted and ever needed.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.440]  And that's where I'm going to resupply myself. So when you start calling for this war, um,
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.320]  I think you're, you're not fully thinking that, you know, someone's going to come take
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:09.160]  what belongs to you because there are people out there with skills and tools and a need.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.240]  If I need to feed my family, if I need to get something to take care of them, I'll stop
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.120]  at no means to get what it is they need.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.440]  Well, take, take Bet Midler. We're going to go to break here in a few minutes. She came
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.040]  out when Rand Paul voted against the budget, which was, you know, a reasonable thing. I
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.720]  get why Trump had to do it. So to stall the economy, but, but, but, but Bet Midler came
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.440]  out and said, Oh, I wish his neighbor would have finished the job basically, you know,
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.400]  attacking him, not even knowing that Rand Paul was an opposition to Trump. They're so
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.280]  politically ignorant. They don't even know who the players are.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.240]  Well, it's all the projection as well. Uh, like, like we talked about last time, you
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:49.120]  see the Antifa guys out there. Uh, they, there's actually signs that say that their, their
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.480]  rally is supported by the Communist Party. And then it says on their website. Yeah.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:28:00.040]  And then you've got, and then you've got them calling the right communists. It's just projection.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.320]  It's, it's just, look, this is what we are. We know it's bad. We're going to tell them
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.960]  that that's what you are. And something to think about too, like the, what's being shown
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.040]  right there on the screen right now is those guys are role-playing. They're, they're not
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.840]  being serious. They don't feel that's not in their heart. They're just out there playing
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:20.040]  a game. They left their mom's basement. He grabbed some AR. It may be even some airsoft
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.400]  guy. They're not ready to kill or take the consequences of being killed whatsoever. Do
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.280]  they have any skill set or any idea of what it takes to, to pull that trigger? And they've
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.920]  got a very false sense of confidence. These guys have played too many video games. You
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:36.600]  know, they think, you know what's up. And it's like that famous quote, everybody's got
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.480]  a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, that's exactly what's happening here.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.880]  They're walking tall, looking strong, but the moment things pop off, they've got no idea
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:46.880]  what they're doing.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.600]  Henry Rollins said it, right? It's easy to hold a hammer. Do you have what it takes
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.600]  to hit the nail? That's it.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.440]  All right. We'll be back to talk about some incredible breaking news on the other side.

[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.000]  Well we got some great guys in here with us. Kit Kulp of spikestatical.com, Lincoln Osiris
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:52.160]  which is a joke name. Who by the way make t-shirts here in America for us at less of
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.920]  a price that are higher quality than we had before. So we really appreciate him right
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.960]  here in Austin, Texas. I'll leave it at that.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.160]  I know you guys don't want to talk about yourselves. You said don't even get into my bio, but obviously
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:10.200]  a lot of your bios are secret and stuff, but take Kit, you're a MMA title contender, world
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:17.480]  champion, Muay Thai, fighting for major countries, winning on and on and on, combat veteran, whole
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.960]  bunch of different secretive groups we can get into. Lincoln Osiris, I mean, wow, guys
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.800]  like this talked. What type of books could they write? He hasn't even told me any of
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.960]  the stuff he's involved or anything. He just comes on the show and gets the system watching
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:39.360]  what we're doing. It's just crazy to then see you guys committed to the country, proving
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.520]  what you stand for versus the Democrats. And I'm in here during the break going, you didn't
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.040]  see Phil Mudd on TV say we're going to kill the president. You didn't see Clapper and
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.200]  Brennan right after they were kicked out. Middle of last year, say he'll be gone by
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:56.000]  December extrajudicially. It won't be an impeachment. We're going to take him out. They're the stories
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.520]  right there. Why aren't we seeing that daily? It's only on CNN. That's what I'm saying.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.200]  On their echo boxes, they're saying we're going to kill the president. And I was told
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.680]  by sources, they said, Alex, they're stay behind networks are so scared in the Justice
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.400]  Department FBI committing these crimes. They're surrounded by good agents. They have to say
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.680]  this to look like they're still winning. Then Mudd came out last week and said, we're winning.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.520]  Stay there. Stay at your post. We're winning. So I guess that's true. It's like desperation
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.640]  is why they're saying this, but I don't want to be too arrogant because if somebody's desperate,
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.640]  sometimes they can cause some damage.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.800]  They're right. That makes sense into the corner thing. Absolutely makes sense. Dealing with
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.640]  a problem like that right now. And just so that we're not very, very dangerous individual.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:43.080]  Just so that we're not CNN and we don't put on any fake news. Yeah, there's a great
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:47.520]  bit of our combat veteran. It is a contractor has worked around the world done security.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:52.520]  Yeah, but I just, there's somebody out there right now that's going, kid, it's not a combat
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:57.800]  veteran. If a war is lying in there, whatever, like, no, fake news, simply misspoke. He is
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.240]  a contractor. He's done security high threat around the world. But I can't keep track of
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.600]  that. We know, we know, you know, which, which is actually, you know, let's you guys know
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:13.680]  out there that you can get all of that training just like these guys, you know, get all that
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:18.320]  training that all the tactical training and still do the work. Absolutely. Or your country
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.720]  and they can end up, you know, helping the folks over at the gun operation you're involved
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.600]  in. I do, I do that as well. That's like tactical. I want to get into that here in just a moment,
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.920]  but I don't want to sit here and rant. And then, and then you guys don't have time. What
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.320]  is on your mind about the country right now? Cause all I know is the left's running around
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.920]  saying they're going to kill everybody. They're going to overthrow everything. They're going
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:41.600]  to burn everything down. They're going to open up the president. I mean, I guess Lincoln,
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.480]  you could see the articles when I was calling for them on screen, the videos of them saying
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.160]  what I was saying. I know that sounds unbelievable. If true, the things I said, what do you make
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:57.160]  of those? It is very unbelievable. It is, I can't imagine that every media outlet on
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:03.200]  the planet isn't having this discussion right now. It is, it's unfathomable that someone
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.600]  would actually come out and say, Hey, we're going to kill the president. It is. And it's,
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:13.080]  I think it's a call not only on their side, but ours. It's a call to action. Let's be real
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.080]  by no means in my advocating violence. I'm not saying go out there and burn stuff down
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:23.200]  and do whatever, but I am saying that they're calling for an end to our reality. The way
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.360]  that we live, our democracy, our justice system, all these different things, they're calling
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.800]  for an end to that. They want a war and it's time for you to be prepared, whatever that
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.560]  means. If that means that you need to stock up on some stuff or that's what I'm saying
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.000]  exactly right now. I've never seen the left worldwide as wound up and out of control as
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.720]  they are. And they say they're in this existential death battle and that they're not giving up,
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:51.800]  but it actually, it actually appears as though they are moving forward with an agenda. They
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:38:00.240]  are actually trying to execute plans now. I've never before felt that we were on the
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:06.040]  verge of civil war like I do now. And that's a very scary feeling to step back. I've been
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:13.080]  to civil wars. I have seen the death and destruction in mayhem. It is very, very hard to believe
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:17.880]  that that, that we're so close to that here in the now neighbor versus neighbor. Right.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.760]  Yeah, it's scary. Which clip do we have ready? You guys have Phil Mudd saying the government's
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.840]  going to kill this guy or do you have Rob Reiner ready? Pardon me? Phil Mudd. Yeah, let's play
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.240]  Phil Mudd. He's made a bunch of these statements, but here's one of them. What was your response,
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:38.120]  Phil Mudd? A couple of surprises. Let me give you one bottom line as former government official.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.160]  Government's going to kill this guy. He defends Vladimir Putin. Their State Department and
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.520]  CIA offers are coming home. And at Langley and at Foggy Bottom, CIA and State, they're
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.320]  saying this is how you defend us. And Phil, before... Oh, that's good. And then we've got
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:55.320]  Rob Reiner just last Friday saying all these lies and then saying we're on a glide path
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:01.560]  to take over America. But the president's here. So we're in the last battle of the civil war.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:08.120]  Here's that clip of Rob Reiner. Then he gets into office and there are good people on both sides
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:15.800]  in Charlottesville. And there are people coming from f***ing countries. And it goes on and on.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:21.240]  And you see the people that he hires that are in his administration. And we see
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:30.360]  that this now becomes the last battle of the civil war. And we're fighting it right now.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:38.040]  And we're going to win. We're going to win. But we thought we were on this glide path. We've been
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:44.760]  dragged back and we're going to win because if we don't win, the promise of what this country
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:51.640]  started as, which is we are all one, we are all created equal, that promise will not be realized
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:59.880]  unless we can overcome what has happened in this last election. And I know we will.
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:03.640]  I have so much to say. Like, I don't even know where to start.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.600]  Like, what is he talking about? Backsliding and all of this craziness and...
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.280]  They're the ones who want to destroy the country.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.640]  Right. What's backsliding? The economy, jobs? They're trying to backslide it.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.200]  All of these things are doing great. Lincoln, you can hear us talking about it.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:24.280]  What do you make of Hollywood saying that we're in a civil war?
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:32.440]  Well, it's quite interesting. Hollywood, those guys are literally living in a fantasy land.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.560]  It's your job to pretend.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:37.640]  What is their job in a fantasy land? But their reality is also a fantasy land.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:43.800]  These individuals that are calling for a civil war and martial law and to take out the president,
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:50.760]  they've got no idea what that would mean. What would follow? They're not prepared for it.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.160]  They've got no idea what it would bring. There would be the first people to like...
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.880]  Everywhere left to take over, everything collapses. Why do they want to do it then?
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:05.720]  It reminds me of the... Who was it? Tom Cruise thing where he said that
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:11.000]  that his job is just as hard as like a recon marine or something like that.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.480]  Because he's been through all of the same training that they have and that kind of thing.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.880]  They're not living in reality at all.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:23.720]  If Rob Ryan wants to see civil war, he needs to jump on an airplane and take his self to Africa.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:29.480]  Go watch where people mutilate other people simply because they're from a different tribe,
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.200]  where men, women and children are killed and burned and hacked into pieces.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.760]  He doesn't know what reality of civil war is.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:43.400]  That's a word he's using based upon something he read in some liberal year book 20 years ago.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:47.400]  And he doesn't like that far. Jump on a plane down to Caracas, my friend.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.400]  There you go. There you go. Good luck with that.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:55.800]  It's just... It's emotional, fear mongering and sensationalism.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:03.160]  And that's my point is they're trying to start this war and if they do, they're completely out of luck.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.880]  When we come back, we're going to talk about Pie Pitter's Union.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:11.480]  We're talking about Spice Tactical because we've done something really exciting with these guys.
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.120]  I'm very, very honored to be involved in it.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.840]  And it's great. We're for people to get prepared and to fund the Info War.
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.600]  So we'll talk about that. But just briefly here, we go to SpiceTactical.com
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.360]  and use promo code Alex. You get 5% off on everything.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.720]  And Spice Tactical is one of the top tactical companies out there.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.160]  It's still at affordable prices, very respected, a huge following.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.120]  And a lot of the folks that listen to the show are already Spice Tactical supporters.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.160]  So be sure and check that out. They're major sponsors of the show.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.520]  That helps fund the information war at SpiceTactical.com.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.320]  You can also get great t-shirts at PiePitter'sUnion.com.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.760]  And our latest shirt of the month was printed and made by Pie Pitter's Union.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:57.160]  So find that at infowarstore.com because funding this operation is not free. We'll be back to you with us.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.480]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.280]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.080]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.720]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:16.680]  And as a longtime Info Wars listener, I want to say thanks
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.840]  for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.520]  Anthroplex, too. Thank you.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.440]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:29.320]  normal toothpaste fans. The super blue is awesome.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.640]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the Info Wars life products. They are quality.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:38.360]  I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.400]  Absolutely.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.760]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.560]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on. And if we can get our houses in order
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:44:15.000]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.200]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.800]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.080]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.640]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:37.560]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:42.600]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:50.120]  species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from Info Wars Life.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:45:16.120]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:19.240]  All right, we're back live. Roger Stone's coming up about 15 minutes in the next hour in studio
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.600]  with me, but I'm here talking to my buddies, Spikes Tactical and Piper's Union, also Quentin,
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:29.160]  the DC Mall cop. I'm a combat veteran of the DC Mall.
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.280]  I moved up. It was Atlanta. Now I'm in DC.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:36.840]  You're in the DC now. It's even rougher. Hey, seriously though, Vanessa Trump taking a hospital,
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.320]  NBC reports, as precaution efforts, suspicious letters, sent her home and the anthrax they think
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.800]  or something, and so she's been sent to the hospital. The amount of threats that family gets.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.560]  It's not about kissing Trump's ass, but he really has stood up to a lot of bullying,
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:54.920]  delivered on so many fronts. It's crazy. I want to get into Spikes Tactical, Piper's Union,
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.200]  all of this, but any other comments that you guys want to make during the breaks?
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:04.600]  In the past eight years, how many times did we hear anything about a personal attack on Obama
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.880]  or his family? Yeah, didn't happen. Never heard one. Did you never heard anything about his kids
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.520]  being threatened or his family being threatened? Or conservatives beating liberals up? Or chasing
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.560]  somebody down and beating them up? What happened to the inauguration trying to get in?
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:23.240]  Multiple things. I mean, how many times did we get in in fistfights, literal fistfights,
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:27.800]  just trying to get in the building? I mean, just getting in the mall. Yeah. Just to get in there.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:33.240]  Like, it was insane. But we never saw any of that. So, that's just proof that they'll stop at no
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:42.200]  means to disrupt our normal standard behavior by me cost. That's all I'm saying. It's not like I'm
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:46.840]  saying they're badass and scary and they're like Godzilla coming out of the ocean. They're just out
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:55.000]  of control. But they want to make us the conservative gun owner threat. They want to say we are the
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.360]  bad guys, but we're not the ones out there creating havoc and hurting people in public and, you know,
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:08.920]  beating up old ladies with bike locks and chains and pipes. So, we took a call. This is the level
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:14.520]  of intellect that we're dealing with. We took a call the other day at Spike's Tactical. We've
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:21.560]  gotten a lot of calls since our ad. And the guy in the same sentence, or not in the same,
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:34.680]  in the same phrase, said, Bible thumping, Bible thumping, gun toting, Nazis, two sentences later,
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:41.480]  you Jew loving something. Fascist. Fascist. Yeah. That's right. Like, that's what I've noticed is
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.720]  the anti-Jew folks are now anti-Nazi too. None of them make sense. It's like, if we just throw
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.400]  enough spaghetti against the wall, something's going to stay. So, I'm just going to call you every
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.880]  name that I can think of. Everything. That's like that gun shop in Washington where the guy walks in
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.960]  and goes, you sell the, and uses the K word. Right. And the guy goes, yeah, we sell their
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.720]  buddy. And then the guy just flips out, well, let's talk about this. There's a way to support
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:08.920]  the broadcast. Plus, it's a way to get high quality products. Let's talk about Spike's Tactical.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.840]  And the fact you guys are sponsors, which is great for a major gun group, but all the accessories
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.280]  you've got and the courage to promote Americana when, you know, people target folks that tell
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:19.880]  the truth, but you guys already flew your flag with the full page ads you've been running.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.680]  That's what you're all about. Tell us about Spike's Tactical and why it's so important.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:29.080]  5% off is already discounted folks. When you go there and use promo code, Alex,
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:37.080]  at spikes tactical.com. Tell us about that kit. Well, we, in actually, Spike's Tactical started
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:47.320]  September 10th, 2001, the day before the big event. And Spike himself just sought to
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:54.200]  make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford. And so that's what we've
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:51:02.200]  done. Everything, everything has a full lifetime guarantee, a no BS lifetime guarantee. And that's
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.800]  why Pipehitter's Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well. Lincoln,
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:12.280]  Lincoln, why was it that you picked? Well, a couple of years ago, we decided to,
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:18.520]  we wanted to put out a line of rifles. We wanted rifles that were high quality,
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:25.240]  that were combat rated, if you will, that we could like put our name on and really stand
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:30.360]  behind. So we looked around at quite a few companies. And to be quite honest, it was an easy
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:36.840]  decision to make. Spikes tactical is a small family owned business, not super small. They're not
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:42.040]  run out of a garage by any means, but they are not one of the giants in the industry. They stand
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:46.760]  behind their products. As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee. If you have a problem with
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:52.920]  your gun, they will fix the problem. And that is huge in today's age that is not happening with any
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:58.200]  other small for the lifetime of the gun, whether you bought it from us originally or bought it
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:03.080]  off the internet or bought it, you know, found it in a trash can. It's a spikes rifle and we'll
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:10.040]  take care of it. We decided to sit down with them. We built an entire line of guns. They're
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:16.200]  extremely high quality. We put the money where it really mattered. You're looking for the pipe
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:20.600]  hitters rifles anyway, you're looking at a high end barrel, a high end bolt, a high end trigger,
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:26.040]  everything that really important. Now we saved money by, you know, using forward jumpers and
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:30.360]  lowers for our basic line and threw on some cool stuff to make it, you know, to give it a good
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:37.080]  appearance. So you've got a very high end rifle at a very affordable price. You can't go wrong.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:42.760]  That's, I mean, we are family. As you can see by, you know, the ad that we ran with spikes tactical,
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:50.680]  we are family with them. And I can't imagine using any other rifle. Well, I know the listeners
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:54.840]  are big fans already of spike tactical and the fact you're supporting us. You're getting your
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.080]  second member, you're getting high quality rifles and accessories and you're funding the info or a
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:05.080]  total win. That's a yep. That's a double W. Right. So we're saying, you know, for info wars listeners,
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:11.560]  go to spikes tactical.com, pick out anything, pick out a t-shirt, gun parts, full receivers,
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:15.480]  whatever it is that you're looking for, anything that's there or even call the number that's
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:19.640]  associated. There's a 1-800 number on the website. You can call and order those things,
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:26.360]  give them the promo code, Alex, get a discount. And that is for any product. You want stickers or
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:34.760]  a full rifle for anything. Before I even worked for spikes tactical, the reason that I was drawn
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:41.000]  to it to the company is when I was first getting into AR's, somebody told me, okay, well, when
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.800]  you buy an AR, you're going to need to upgrade your bolt carrier group, upgrade your trigger,
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:50.520]  and make sure that you've got a really nice barrel. Those are the most important things on your rifle to,
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:56.520]  you know, once you get a bare bones rifle. Well, when I saw spikes tactical rifles and I said,
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:02.440]  oh, well, that stuff already comes upgraded. That stuff's already the highest end stuff that you
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:09.320]  can get on our basic rifles. And just so you know, there are a million rifle companies out there.
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:17.000]  And some of them are good. The large majority of them are not so good. And in the rifle business,
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.520]  you tend to get what you pay for. So you've really got to pay attention. You can go down to one of
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:27.880]  these big box stores and find a rifle for 600 bucks. And you're lucky if that thing's going to last
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:36.840]  you a year. So the quality that you get at spikes tactical is top notch. The service that you're
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:41.960]  going to get is top notch. You couldn't ask for anything more than what you're going to get at
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:46.680]  spikes tactical. Plus, we're not funded by George Soros or the globalist. So that's what I'm looking
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:52.280]  for is the very best companies that have a great quality product with all the accessories, t shirts,
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:59.240]  you know, you name it from the full rifles down to all the accessories. We're also 100% American
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:04.280]  made everything on the right. I should have added that up front. Because I've got the whole deal here.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:10.200]  I was going to say that it's 100% American made. They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:15.800]  They are strong supporters of the military. Spike gives back a lot. Well, most big companies,
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:20.920]  even small ones are intimidated because they oh my God, Alex Jones, he's too radical. So the fact
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:25.320]  is you guys are a top tier gun company, great prices, and you support the info war. It's a win-win
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:29.640]  for our audience. So we have the partnership between Patriots, Info Wars, and Spice Tactical.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:33.880]  It's 100% American made rifle company builds high quality rifles for the best price possible.

[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:12.360]  things for a lot of people and he keeps it super quiet. He doesn't allow anyone to talk about
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.160]  the things that he does as far as charity and benefit and stuff like that. He gives a ton of
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.080]  money. I'm from Florida. I've known them for many years. I've been associated with them.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:28.200]  They do a lot for the community. But one of his caveats is don't tell anybody. I'm not doing
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.680]  this because I don't want anyone to know. I'm doing this because it's what needs to be done.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:40.600]  There is a law enforcement unit that ran out of ammunition for training for a full year.
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:46.600]  I shouldn't be saying this, but I'm going through anyway. Spike bought their full year of ammo
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.920]  so that their law and training could train. But he didn't want anybody to know.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:54.920]  But there's a paradox there. If people don't talk about what they're doing and obsess on not doing
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:57:00.360]  it, then nobody knows what's going on. So there's kind of that line of people have to talk about
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:05.320]  some stuff or nobody knows what's going on. Right. So it's a tough line to ride. Trust me.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:12.440]  Beating your chest and saying, Hey, look at me. I do all this good stuff for everybody all the time
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:16.680]  when really maybe you do. Maybe you don't. And doing a lot of good stuff for people and not
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:22.440]  telling anyone. So that's why if Spike's Maddie can call me, but that's why I'm here. That's
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:29.320]  why I'm here in this chair. We're going to come back to a few more minutes and then Roger Stone's
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:34.840]  coming here to take over. I'm going to let Roger sit here and take over the whole transmission

[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:29.720]  another interesting subject oh oh it is uh i don't even get into it on air about what's because

[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:52.440]  technocracy takeover you're listening to alex jones
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:07:03.480]  the
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:11.000]  globalism is beginning to fade and once you've taken your blinders off or you could reverse that
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:16.360]  and said taking the sunglasses uh uh that the establishment doesn't want you to wear and put
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:24.440]  them on like they live you then see for yourself that you've been lied to over and over again by
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:29.720]  so-called mainstream media that's simply bought and paid for by multinational interests that have
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:35.000]  conquered this country and it doesn't mean that when you support info wars or president trump or
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:43.240]  nationalism or pre-market capitalism that you think you're perfect or you think we're perfect
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:49.720]  but we know it works a thousand times better and is what builds big open free wealthy societies
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:55.080]  now that creates the byproduct of decadence so that's certainly a real issue but globalists
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:08:00.760]  like george soros that have been openly bragging that they are funding trying to keep the uh EU
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:10.280]  in control of countries that never voted to enter it like the uk the fact that he's so brazen and so
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:16.680]  out in the open only will accelerate the planetary awakening of their tyranny with another 280
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:23.400]  north koreans crossing the border soon all eyes will be on one member of the delegation kim jong
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:29.960]  un's sister kim yo jong will become the first member of the kim ruling family to set foot in
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:36.520]  the country it's the sister of kim jong un the bloodthirsty dictator who's constantly threatening
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.680]  a nuke the us and all this and so they're there as part of a quote peace delegation because trumps
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:46.120]  put pressure on them for the first time ever a member of the ruling communist royal house
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:50.920]  communism's always royal it's no form of royalty it's the first time they come to the table because
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:09:00.120]  they understand the trouble they're in nbc abc cbs is seeing in all praised her and said she was
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:05.480]  glaring at pence and and liberals said oh we hope she attacks pence and oh she's so sexy oh she's so
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:12.600]  beautiful and then when it blew up in their face they began to remove the video look at this kim
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:19.800]  jong un's sister stealing the show at the winter olympics oh oh my gosh they keep more than half
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:26.440]  their population in slave camps and they admit that they quote take babies like you take a chicken's
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:32.760]  eggs at birth so they're not loyal to the family millions die every couple years uh they torture
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:38.280]  people to death like no one's ever seen in our media i remember blaster hole kid we traveled
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:45.000]  about four hours east of pyongyang to visit a ski resort that has significance in the recent talks
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.200]  we've been watching between the north and south over the winter olympics this we're told is a place
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:55.000]  where athletes from the north and south will be training together we were also invited here i would
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:02.200]  suspect because it is not what people expect to see in north korea a modern ski resort
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:07.720]  it's got patriotic music and videos playing from the screen here and a lot of families out enjoying
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:13.000]  themselves we've spoken to some of those families people expressing a sense of optimism that the
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.360]  two countries are speaking together a sense of pride that they will be competing together in the
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.600]  winter olympics and also some expressing a sense of greater security given a chance to ratchet down
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:32.200]  some of the tensions now you could not support a worse regime living on the planet stalin and hitler
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:38.360]  were as bad or worse per capita even kill more people but but probably not even as psychotically
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:46.520]  ridiculous i mean the north koreans are are are under total slavery if you are receiving this
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:54.760]  transmission you are the resistance welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:01.880]  and it's great to be back in the mother ship i had a whirlwind tour of the united kingdom
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:09.960]  spoke to the oxford union the cambridge union the uh the durham union society student organizations
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:15.480]  and i found a real hunger among the people of the uk to get the truth because they're not
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:21.960]  getting it from the bbc or from the guardian they make cnn and the new york times look honest
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:28.760]  they're so out of whack donald trump is uh weakening our uh law enforcement agencies our
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:35.720]  intelligence agencies uh it is it's the normal pap that is spit out inside the beltway and in the
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:43.960]  media centers in washington but ten times worse and then i had a terrific tour of florida tallahassee
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:51.640]  or lando bonita springs and naples and i must tell you the vibrance of the trump movement
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:59.960]  it is stronger and more intense than ever the support for the president now that he has
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:07.000]  pulled off a modern economic miracle we had eight years of anemic growth under barack obama
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:14.600]  uh and the president has created two million new jobs uh he has uh he has cut regulations to
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:21.880]  the bone his historic tax cuts have not even had an opportunity to get traction uh to yet
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:28.680]  have the impact that's going to turbocharge this economy and already the generic ballot
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:35.320]  for democrats in the upcoming congressional races which was somewhere a gap of around
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:42.840]  17 18 weeks ago has now dropped to just six now the key thing here is that the
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.720]  hand wringing by the country club republicans who are afraid we're going to lose the house in
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:55.000]  2018 uh they really misunderstand what's going on the democrats have have demonstrated that they
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:01.160]  have no program they hate donald trump we know that they want to impeach him we know that too
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:06.280]  but they have no constructive program for america they're not running on anything they can't even
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:12.520]  tell you what they're for so i believe if the republicans under the leadership of donald trump
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:18.760]  run for jobs in prosperity and to reasserting america's role around the world the democrats
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:25.160]  run on we hate donald trump uh we will we will hold our own in what is historically the party in
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:32.120]  power always loses a few seats the real problem of course is if country club republicans if
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:38.840]  establishment republicans cut and run if they abandon this president they do so at their own
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:45.240]  peril that in my opinion will be folly stick with the president and we will do fine in the next
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:51.320]  elections the the the sunshine soldiers that naysayers in the republican establishment
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:58.440]  are panicking much too early as someone who's been in american politics for 40 years you can't
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:03.880]  predict what's going to happen this november you can't say in february what the november elections
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:11.000]  will be like the economy is likely to be uh greatly improved and it's already pretty strong and
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:18.200]  making real progress in terms of undoing the damage of eight years of barack obama so uh
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:25.080]  uh the other interesting piece of news here today is the unveiling of the portrait by
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:32.520]  keyhand wiley the uh artist who appointed uh who painted the portrait of barack obama
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:41.080]  incredibly this artist brags about mixing his own semen in with his paint as some kind of a
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:47.400]  statement it's disgusting uh and this this photo looks like something out of the talking heads
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:54.760]  it's very strange uh the other thing that i want to touch on today is a note of sadness
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:03.560]  jeffrey bell who was a conservative activist an aide to governor ronald reagan in 1976
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:13.080]  a a seminal issue advisor for ronald reagan in 1980 a man who was a real pioneer of the supply side
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:21.000]  economics movement an advisor to jack kemp an optimist a catholic uh at one of the smartest
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:27.080]  most honest people i know now one of the main reasons why ronald reagan ran on tax cuts in 1980
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:33.320]  is because jeffrey bell decided to go to his native new jersey and challenge clifford case in
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:49.240]  republican primary and thus prove the strength of that idea rest in peace jeff bell

[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:33.800]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone sitting in for alex jones when
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:41.480]  i was in the uk uh there's a lot of discussion about the delays in the effectuating of the brexit
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:49.800]  decision by the people of that country now we see uh advocates for brexit members of parliament who
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:57.400]  supported it being subjected to an unprecedented number of death threats this is not unlike what
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:05.320]  is now happened today where uh donald trump jr who is very clearly emerging as an important
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:12.760]  spokesman for the trump reform movement his tweets are really outstanding he uh is not
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:18.520]  fettered by the white house staff can say what he really thinks we know that he is a regular
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:26.520]  watcher of info wars uh and that he uh takes alternative conservative media links and puts
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:35.240]  them out there for the legions of the president's supporters to see and to circulate now it is
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:43.400]  extraordinary that his daughter vanessa his eldest child uh had to be taken or was taken
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:49.480]  to a manhattan hospital as a precaution after she received an envelope of some kind of white powder
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:56.600]  clearly meant it meant as some type of threat this is the tolerance of the liberals this is the this
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:04.120]  is the uh this is the mindset of the increasingly violent left the same people who are threatening
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:11.320]  members of parliament over brexit are the people sending uh this kind of garbage through the mail
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:17.080]  i don't mean literally but it is interesting because and alex jones pointed this out to me
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:24.280]  the brexit vote is the same populist uprising that elected donald trump it's the same populist
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:32.680]  uprising we see across europe it is a rejection of globalism it is a rejection of the surrender
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:41.720]  of the sovereignty of free people everywhere uh and it is extraordinary that the left has two tactics
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:49.880]  censorship and threats they can't win a debate russia limbaugh was absolutely right the other day
[02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:58.040]  when he said that the uh that uh there's a major effort on the tech left to limit info wars and
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:07.400]  the other alternative media uh sites but more precisely this very cabal this kind of thinking
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:13.320]  has surrounded the president now when i was in florida for these terrific speeches in naples and
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:19.320]  tallahassee and so on a lot of trump supporters were scratching their heads about exactly what's
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:25.880]  going on with general john kelly and the white house staff and of course the rob porter scandal
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:34.520]  uh and we can report exclusively that general kelly was grooming rob kelly rob porter pardon
[02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:40.920]  me to be the incoming white house chief of staff you see uh general kelly believes that
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:45.320]  he is going to go over to run the department of defense and that general mattis will not fill
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:52.200]  out the term uh and porter was being groomed this is why i believe that general kelly overlooked
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:24:01.000]  credible reports of spousal abuse by mr porter now uh we also exclusively reported here at info
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:09.640]  wars that the president uh felt out tom barrick thomas j barrick jr of colony capital a los angeles
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:15.960]  real estate opportunity fund literally the president's closest personal friend appear
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:23.240]  and there are very few a man of enormous capability a man who uh who the president trusts and he has
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:29.400]  declined the chief of staff job but just the fact that the president is feeling people out tells me
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:39.080]  that general kelly is on the skids now uh there is uh no uh there's no rejoicing over this fact
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:46.520]  because unfortunately general kelly and rob porter and sadly hope hex who i think is a good person
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:53.080]  and a trump loyalist have been in the forefront of those keeping the info wars from the president
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:59.960]  keeping breitbart the daily caller rush limbaugh the president is not getting this news instead
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:06.200]  he's getting politico and the new york times they have done the president a disservice because
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:16.120]  the movement that elected donald trump uh had its had its vibrant message in the alternative media
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:24.200]  it is only the technological advances that that mean that are uh that uh the majority of americans
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:30.760]  are getting their news from the internet uh and therefore uh you've had the rise of a robust and
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:38.520]  vite and uh vibrant alternative media so that when the mainstream media the three major networks
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:46.520]  abc nbc and cbs and the two later the two cable news networks started trashing donald trump started
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:53.640]  being a de facto advertising for the clinton campaign there were alternative sources of information
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:26:00.920]  info wars being among the leaders is only because of that that we're able to pull off and donald
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:05.240]  trump has said it several times this wasn't his victory it was the people's victory the greatest
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:12.280]  upset in american history now uh it is vital in my opinion that the president's next chief of staff
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:19.640]  and his next communications director keep him apprised of the alternative media of the
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:26.120]  conservative alternative media we're carrying the banner for the trump administration alex jones
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:33.800]  has had the president's back every step of the way when others who are faint of heart flipped out
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:42.360]  over the nbc uh billy bush revelations alex jones never blinked either did the folks here at info
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:49.800]  wars we've got the president's back and i know that he knows that but we're doing so many good
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:56.120]  investigative reports here we are really breaking it down for the activists so that they can
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:02.840]  retweet it it's important that the president knows uh what we're doing because those things
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:09.080]  have a habit of ending up in his twitter feed and no he's not going to give up his twitter feed
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:15.480]  it's interesting that the general kelly's never been able to get control of the president's twitter
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:20.600]  feed that's because the president jealously guards it he likes it in fact i think he loves it
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:26.520]  and it allows him to communicate directly with the american people unfiltered
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:34.280]  now i've said in a hundred speeches no one puts words in donald trump's mouth no one puts ideas
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:39.960]  in his head he's his own strategist he's his own phrase maker he's his own tweet master
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:46.040]  he's his own press secretary and he's a genius he understands the new cycle like few others
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.600]  and if you want the unalloyed absolute undiluted donald trump we're gonna just follow his twitter
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:59.480]  feed he destroys the left they used to do it in 140 characters now he's got a few characters more
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:06.520]  uh it is essential that in my opinion there'd be a house cleaning that general kelly uh go on
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:12.440]  to serve the administration in some other capacity he's done some great things taking on congresswoman
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:18.200]  the congresswoman from florida for example on the immigration issue but i don't think he's
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:23.560]  serving the president well when he blocks him from information that he must have to win the
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:30.760]  greater fight now there's talk of alternatives congressman kevin mccarthy is a name that comes
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:37.000]  up newt gingrich i don't think any of those people would be the president's next chief of staff

[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:49.800]  congratulations john d dominico as someone who's known donald trumpin studied his speech patterns
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:55.800]  myself for many years you nailed it you really nailed it thank you very much roger i'm very
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:04.120]  excited to be on the show i have to tell you how are you it's it's great so uh now it's my
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:10.600]  understanding that you as an impressionist you have you've done other characters but yeah this
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:16.040]  seems to be your new calling i mean this is uh that's as good as it gets me someplace alex
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:25.880]  Baldwin is killing himself right now somewhere well i've been doing trump since 2004 uh right
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:32.040]  around the end of the first season of the apprentice when there was a big demand corporately
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:37.720]  for trump to come in and roast people and do apprentice games and things like that so i've
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:44.520]  had a really long runway with him and to learn his voice and to really get it down especially
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:49.080]  these last two and a half years yeah it's interesting i've seen other impressionists out
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:54.680]  there on the circuit and they seem to focus on the physicality of donald trump his hand motions
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:37:02.360]  and so on but you you combine the both his gestures uh and his idiosyncratic speech believe me
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:08.520]  believe me believe me he's got a lot of you know it's really interesting and you you obviously know
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:16.120]  him personally but it seems like his in the since he's announced he's become more physical and his
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:22.440]  speech has become more him it seems like he seems like he was very restricted on the apprentice
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:30.360]  blue team green team he did a good job but blue team you're fired it was kind of he seems so big
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:35.800]  in a way well i think uh that on the network television show he was using the teleprompter
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:42.440]  and now what you see is donald trump out there being donald trump and it it comes across as genuine
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:48.280]  comes across as authentic uh you know even when the president makes a mistake people say well
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:54.040]  you see that he's not one of these cookie cutter blow dried phony politicians uh he he speaks from
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:59.640]  the heart he speaks from the gut he is the best instinctual politician that's kind of an insult
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:05.640]  he's the best instinctual political leader uh in my lifetime and he doesn't rely on a giant bank
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:12.840]  of polls or focus groups to decide what to say it's it's all trump all the time you know his
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:18.200]  opponents in the primaries used to complain that why is he getting a disproportionate amount of
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:25.320]  the coverage well as you know john it's because he's interesting it's because it's because that it's
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:32.440]  real you never know what he might say it's not scripted uh but uh this is uh now you've actually
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:40.440]  appeared as trump in four feature films which is pretty amazing and and i like this you were an
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:46.200]  intern for my friend us senator arland specter right i spent a year doing that yeah i've always
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:51.800]  you know i've always had an interest it it's funny that trump has become president i've always had
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:57.560]  an interest in politics the first album i ever bought was david fries nixon a four-year fantasy
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:02.200]  which you which i would think you might be familiar with i most definitely have it yes there's no
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:08.920]  question here david fries my ever bought david fries richard nixon was incredible much better
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:14.680]  than rich little not even close not even close and he was also a great writer is uh david fry was
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:21.160]  an amazing comedic writer and gabe kaplan was on that album with him and he just he his whole album
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:27.320]  was a concept album album and it was hilarious it was just so funny and so prescient in the moment
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:31.800]  well you had the opportunity to work for arland specter i fought with him over the single bullet
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:37.240]  theory over many many martinis he would never a lot of bad yeah he would never give an inch even though
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:42.840]  he was wrong uh and he later went on and did a stand-up routine in philadelphia he always wanted
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.560]  to be a stand-up comedian when he was in the senate he sent to the library of congress for every book
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.520]  on stand-up comedy read them all and then he actually yeah he actually you can find it on youtube
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:58.120]  but he went to a club and he did a set it was it was you know it was a u.s senator trying
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:05.160]  to be a comedian but it's just something he always wanted to do well i i would think you told me that
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:11.000]  yeah you can find it on youtube it's it's pretty entertaining i would think that your uh that your
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:17.400]  career will get uh an enormous boost when the president runs for reelection i mean yeah i would
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:23.320]  i would think so i you know when he first announced it was kind of a not a slow i mean i got it since
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:29.320]  i had been doing it for so long i had done him in so many other platforms that uh when he announced
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:33.720]  i was i wanted to make sure that he was a hundred percent in the race and then right around the
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:39.880]  time he made the john mccain comment he was going up and i thought well that's interesting it's kind
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:45.560]  of counter-intuitive and i thought to myself you know if he can make it to the first if he
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.600]  can make it to the first debate i'll be set for the fall because that's how you know they book
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:55.240]  out months in advance and he's corporate things and as you well know not only did he make it to
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:00.680]  the first debate he crushed it in the first debate and the second debate and third debate and then
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:06.760]  things just started taking off and a friend of mine tom shillow who is on he's still on fox news
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:13.000]  but he was on the show red eye um he brought me on i think i did about 50 60 appearances on red
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.200]  eye as trump and then because of that i did fox and friends a number of times so it was a great
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:23.640]  platform and we did some really wonderful comedy and then some other shows picked me up and then
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:28.680]  voiceovers and the corporate stuff and it's been kind of it's pretty much taken over my there's tom
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:33.720]  right now tom shillow a very funny guy and he's right very funny guy in his own right very funny
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:39.560]  great writer too so we so we had a great run until his show unfortunately was cancelled but now he's
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:46.600]  on fox radio uh so that was uh that really got me out there early on and uh it was it was great for
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:51.480]  it was great to do comedy with him again because we had done it in the early 90s together well as
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:57.880]  you know the the the pundits in the mainstream didn't see trump coming so i can see why it started
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:02.600]  slowly they were the last people in the world who thought that he would win what was it jeb bush
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:05.640]  said you're not going to elected president you're not going to insult your way into the presidency
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:12.680]  guess what jeb wrong wrong and i don't know if this is in your notes i was on um channel
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:19.560]  four bbc matt fear they had flown me over um to dc i'm here in los vegas they flew me to dc to do
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:25.880]  a story on me and uh i had said at the end of the interview he said uh who do you think will win
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:30.680]  and i said donald trump on the landslide i said i've been on the road now for well over a year
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:37.400]  doing this character and what i have seen overwhelmingly he is going to win all right

[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:18.680]  on and forth
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:27.720]  welcome back
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:36.200]  you're on the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone you know there's nothing more pathetic
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:42.840]  than watching the mainstream media talking heads and the columnists and editorial writers at the
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:50.200]  washington post in the new york times trying to breathe life back into the russian collusion
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:48:00.360]  delusion i mean this piece by nicholas christoff is one of the most pathetic attempts to muddy the
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:07.240]  waters that i have seen reiterating a bunch of innocuous garbage about trump's connections with
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:14.200]  the russians a hundred thousand dollar facebook campaign that would be in a multimillion dollar
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:22.200]  presidential campaign tata mont to urinating in the ocean uh the donald trump jr meeting of
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:28.120]  course christoff never mentions that the russian woman lawyer who met with donald trump jr and
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:34.680]  provided nothing of interest was in the country illegally and she had no visa he even takes a
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:41.160]  shot at me recycling the same garbage that i specifically addressed in my sworn testimony
[02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:48.040]  in front of the house intelligence committee yes my communications with goose fur 2.0 which is now
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:55.240]  entirely public is innocuous it's benign and mr christoff doesn't mention that it happened
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:49:01.960]  almost six weeks after the publication of the wiki leaks disclosures regarding hillary clinton
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:08.680]  he also reiterates the same tired hackney falsehoods that i knew about julie nissange's
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:15.800]  uh a publication of john podesta's emails in advance i never said anything of the kind i did
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:22.680]  know that podesta was a bad actor because the panama papers published in january of 2016
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:28.760]  outlined his shady business dealings in russia the uranium deal the gas deal the banking deal
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:35.160]  you didn't have to be a genius to say that he would come under scrutiny in other words his time
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:42.600]  in the barrel would come nor did i have any advanced knowledge beyond what assange himself said
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:48.920]  about wiki leaks publication of hillary clinton's emails and other documents from the clinton campaign
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:56.600]  assange said this himself in numerous interviews but mr christoff ignored all of that
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:04.680]  uh then we had this extraordinary interview with christoff and this guy richard painter who is
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:10.520]  the ethics lawyer uh in the from the bush administration that's kind of like being a
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:17.000]  meat eating vegetarian this performance is one of the most incredible things i have ever seen
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:22.200]  listen to this guy blather uh and just keep insisting that things are true that have been
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:28.440]  completely discredited i want to get your reaction to build crystals tweet because we have to separate
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:34.680]  the two wall this is unprecedented it's ridiculous we don't like it it's unprofessional what is it
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:41.000]  actually doing well it's like they're modding our national security there's classified information
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:45.960]  in this my mom and the only person who's going to benefit from it being released is vladimir
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:52.600]  pooten he's going to find out more about our sources and how we knew uh the various associates of
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:57.000]  donald trump uh were collaborating with the russians i mean that's what this is about it's uh
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:04.600]  going to expose our intelligence operations uh to the benefit of vladimir pooten uh president
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:11.480]  trump's own justice department has said that the memo is misleading his own fbi including his own
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:21.080]  fbi director in version not be released uh this is an abuse uh of our intelligence apparatus
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:28.600]  pack on our intelligence apparatus for political purposes and the only winner is vladimir pooten
[02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:35.800]  america is just disgusted is it because president trump won't mind if vladimir pooten wins as long
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:42.840]  as he wins now there's real true news analysis right there look i can't believe that this guy
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:48.680]  richard painter is admitted to the bar i can't believe that he's actually teaching law school
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:54.760]  he continues to lie about russian collusion he continues to attack me among others there is
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:52:01.080]  no there there mr painter virtually everything you're saying has been disproved and then in the
[02:52:01.080 --> 02:52:09.400]  interview uh both painter and the aforementioned nick christoff go on to claim that devin newness
[02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:15.160]  the crusading and i think courageous chairman of the house intelligence committee is taking
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:23.000]  money from the russians that's a smear that's a lie that's character assassination now you see why
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:31.720]  nobody's watching ms nbc uh we've already seen uh uh joe scarborough soil himself with this nonsense
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:39.800]  but these clowns christoff and painter this is really about as pathetic as it gets i am going
[02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:46.520]  to be writing a piece for info wars counter pointing mr christoff's piece because it is so
[02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:53.800]  wrongheaded it is so recycled it's the same tired nonsense you got to wonder whether christoff like
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:53:01.720]  mike isikoff is being fed by deep state operatives so that his story can be used to prop up a false
[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:10.360]  narrative as the newness memo has told us the deep state did with mike isikoff of yahoo news
[02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:17.400]  the uh the extraordinary thing here is that the other day i was talking to michael caputo
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:24.040]  who has appeared here at info wars and uh this entire investigation has taken an extraordinary
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:30.120]  toll on his family now he has just been notified that he is going to be called back in front of the
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:36.280]  house uh judiciary committee and the house pardon me the senate judiciary committee
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:43.160]  and the senate intelligence committee now if the members of those august committees would simply
[02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:48.760]  read mr caputo's sworn testimony before the house intelligence committee they would know
[02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:55.240]  that they are wasting both his time and the taxpayers money by having him come and testify
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:54:02.040]  my own lawyers have been notified that the senate judiciary committee will call me once again i urge
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:07.960]  them to do what mr christoff should have done at the new york times read my sworn testimony in which
[02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:16.760]  i address the entire question of julian assange and wiki leaks now when i was in the united kingdom
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:24.520]  i went by the tiny cramped ecuadorian embassy to drop off my business card for julian assange
[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:29.560]  no i did not see him i didn't ask to see him i didn't ask for an appointment i did this to
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:35.800]  punk the british media indeed the mainstream media in both britain and the united states because
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:41.800]  they are among the leaders in continuing to promulgate this myth that julian assange is anything
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:50.280]  other than an honest journalist doing his job no wiki leaks is not a russian front it's a news
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:57.240]  organization a news organization with a better track record for accuracy and authenticity than say the
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:04.040]  new york times or the washington post and what about the hypocrisy of celebrating this movie
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:11.800]  the paper which is a essentially a celebration of the a courageous publication by the newspapers
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:17.800]  the new york times in the washington post of classified information that pertained to the
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:25.800]  the origins of the vietnam war so this is the same media that wants to prosecute julie assange for the
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:32.920]  the publishing of classified information yet we're celebrating the publishing of classified
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:41.880]  information in this hollywood epic extraordinary the hypocrisy doesn't end there in the lawsuit
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:49.000]  where i am being sued with donald trump by a group called project democracy and obama
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:54.520]  blessed front group which is really just using my name to raise money the president's lawyers
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:01.880]  from joan day went into court only days ago and said that there can be no conspiracy because
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:09.480]  wiki leaks publication of classified information of any information is not a crime that's what
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:15.000]  journalists do well somebody needs to tell the president's government lawyers that because jeff
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:20.760]  sessions and the folks at the justice department are continuing in their persecution of julie
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:27.720]  nissange assange is in poor health and he has now been there i believe six years in what is a very
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:34.680]  tiny cramp space don't get the idea that the embassy is opulent that columbia and ecuador share
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:42.200]  one embassy it is time for the president to order the justice department to end the persecution
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:48.840]  of julie nissange or failing that simply pardon him for any non-existent crimes that he may have
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:57.000]  committed he is the most valiant journalist of his time and he is not a russian agent this this
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:04.680]  continued insistence by john brennan and uh and james clapper oh you remember him clappers the guy
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:11.800]  who testified under oath that we have no metadata collection program and of course when edward
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:19.320]  snowden released documents showing that that was false clapper paid no penalty where is he now

[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:38.520]  sobeck who is uh who i affectionately call jumping jack flash because he's always ahead of the
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:44.520]  mainstream media in terms of breaking news in washington he's got terrific sources and he is
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:52.360]  out there every day on the ramparts way ahead of cnn and the other fake news sites so jack tell us
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:58.120]  what's going on in washington and what is the drama surrounding the white house staff shuffle
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:06.520]  well roger what i'm hearing right now so much is of course the departure of rob porter within the
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:12.120]  handling or apparent mishandling of this story uh that broke in the daily mail of his potential these
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:18.280]  alleged uh wife uh domestic abuse by his two prior ex-wives he resigned and then the white
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:23.640]  house team is seemingly putting out multiple stories regarding the timeline of his resignation
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:31.400]  and how it was handled by chief of staff john kelly it now seems to me that the real target of all
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:37.640]  of this is not was not rob porter but the target seems to be to hang this as a news for chief of
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:43.320]  staff kelly and get him out of there well my sources tell me that kelly is telling others
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:48.120]  that he's toast so i think he's reading the handwriting on the wall what's surprising to
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:55.000]  me is that i i know rob porter's father roger porter served in the bush administration i have

[03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:34.920]  the amazing the great roger stone who was hosting just prior to me the breaking shocking news the
[03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:41.000]  situation that we're dealing with right now the possible terrorist attack on donald trump
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:47.640]  junior his wife venessa trump rushed to the hospital possible exposure by a white powder
[03:06:47.640 --> 03:06:54.040]  substance certainly reminiscent of the anthrax scare of 2001 immediately following the 9-11
[03:06:54.040 --> 03:06:58.440]  attacks these envelopes were sent to members of congress were sent to members of the senate were
[03:06:58.440 --> 03:07:04.760]  were all going around capital hill there's still a special mail procedure at capital hill to go
[03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:12.520]  and investigate envelopes because of that scare from 2001 17 years ago almost 17 years ago she
[03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:19.080]  did apparently it seems that she opened the envelope was exposed was coughing felt nauseous
[03:07:19.080 --> 03:07:24.760]  called 9-11 rushed to the hospital two other individuals were also reported to have been
[03:07:24.760 --> 03:07:31.000]  exposed to this powder they are also being brought to the hospital because they want to make sure
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:37.240]  that everything is going to be okay that everything is certainly going to be okay with her the police
[03:07:37.240 --> 03:07:45.560]  have announced so far that they have determined that the substance was they in their words innocuous
[03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:51.720]  and innocuous white substance they have not come out to officially deny it was of course anthrax
[03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:57.560]  or or that type of powder but details are still coming in as we go so we're certainly going to
[03:07:57.560 --> 03:08:04.680]  be keeping a very close watch on this situation however the one thing i want to explain to folks
[03:08:04.680 --> 03:08:11.000]  is that leftists now to include even some members of the mainstream media or contributors to the
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:17.800]  mainstream media are making jokes about this they're laughing about this a domestic terrorist attack
[03:08:17.800 --> 03:08:24.680]  or possible domestic terrorist attack on the first family we have here a huffington post writer a
[03:08:24.680 --> 03:08:30.840]  former writer for them is now joking that she's going being brought to the hospital due to a
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:36.840]  coke binge this is something that that she just posted this this former writer of huffington post
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:43.160]  on twitter immediately after the hospitalization of the president's daughter-in-law no idea what
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:48.200]  her mental her what her health state was no idea was going but the first joke was what's the over
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:52.520]  under and i'll read this what's the over under that it was just her coke dealer dropping off the
[03:08:52.520 --> 03:08:58.280]  usual but she did too much and this is a cover story so conspiracy theories but because you'd
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:05.480]  have to be on the drugs to be married to uday and also they're they're all lying attention uh
[03:09:05.480 --> 03:09:11.640]  that word happy to cause distractions so uday of course a reference here to the murderous and brutal
[03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:21.240]  son of saddam hussein uday hussein a complete sociopath known for committing violent acts sexual
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:28.120]  assaults uh extreme brutality to his own citizens and that is what they're comparing comparing
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:35.160]  donald trump jr a patriot who has been falsely accused and falsely defamed of being a a traitor
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:41.240]  to his country to being a traitor to his father for all of these things uh all of it for committing
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:48.440]  the cardinal sin apparently of supporting his father for president this is the left ladies and
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:54.280]  gentlemen you know we we talk a lot about how we say you know i one one thing i read on twitter
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:59.160]  sometimes is daily reminder that the left once you and your family dead alex talks about that
[03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:05.320]  sort of thing all the time and he gets attacked oh now she's now she's put up a uh a thing saying
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:11.480]  well i i just made a dumb twitter joke but but you should know that they have a history of coke
[03:10:11.480 --> 03:10:17.480]  abuse and you should just pretend this is not worse than the administration i mean she's she's
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:23.320]  put up a non-apology here basically deleted the tweet put up a non-apology calling it a snowflake
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:30.440]  dog whistle that is sounded as a distraction uh no miss dublin the only attention that we're
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:37.080]  trying to call to is the fact that white powder was sent in an envelope opened by vanessa trump
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:44.120]  the daughter-in-law of the president of the united states it was addressed to her husband it was
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:49.320]  addressed to her husband donald trump jr right so she's saying that she's not and you can look
[03:10:49.320 --> 03:10:53.880]  here at the great article on info wars dot com she says i'm not a contributor for huffington post
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:57.640]  but then you can and she's she's going back at paul joseph watson he and i were calling this out
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:03.160]  and then you could scroll down and here's her profile page on huffington post tara dublin if
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:07.640]  you're a writer living uh living in portland organ so there there it is huffington post
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:13.240]  has her up as a contributor now she might be lazy and has not contributed anything recently to the
[03:11:13.240 --> 03:11:18.760]  to the huffington post and that's really on her but the fact remains that she is a contributor
[03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:23.240]  to the huffington post still has articles on their website so because we know that huffington post
[03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:27.080]  has taken down articles in the past when they didn't like their contributors david seamen of
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:32.440]  course who wrote an article about hillary's health was a contributor to the huffington post he was
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:37.560]  that that was completely deleted it was memory hold because they didn't want anything anyone
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:43.640]  to be questioning hillary during the 2016 election so her contributor posts are still up on huffington
[03:11:43.640 --> 03:11:50.280]  post so i really am confused this is like if you guys remember not too long ago uh just about a
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:58.360]  week ago really when a cnn contributor was making a joke about the train crash the republican train
[03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:03.240]  crash that was carrying republicans and their families their wives their children out to a
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:10.680]  retreat in west virginia there was a train crash and a cnn commentator uh made some horrific joke
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:14.920]  about the whole thing said that that he thought it was great didn't you know basically praised it
[03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:21.320]  and was mocking it and making jokes and then cnn cnn came back and said oh well he's not a contributor
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:27.800]  for us yet we went to the cnn website the cnn uh vice president even came out and responded to me
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:32.600]  said jacky this this guy is wrong you know this guy isn't a contributor we went to cnn's website
[03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:38.120]  we went to cnn's website and found that he had posted and i can't remember the guy's name at the
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:40.840]  top of my head i'm sorry i'm sorry producers i can't remember his name at the top of my head
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:49.320]  he had posted articles uh columns on cnn within the past two weeks within the past two weeks he
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:55.000]  had articles on cnn's site sam stein was also out there uh was putting up stuff and yet cnn had
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:13:00.520]  the audacity to claim that he was not a contributor oh keith boykin that was the guy yes keith boykin
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:08.040]  he said uh he said is this a metaphor for american politics today right yet cnn said and and we found
[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:14.680]  video of him talking with anderson cooper recently not years ago recently yet cnn told us that he
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:18.520]  was not a contributor that he was not a commentator even though his articles were hosted on their
[03:13:18.520 --> 03:13:24.120]  website and we had video of him with uh you know with anderson cooper that would be like me saying
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:29.480]  that i have no connection whatsoever to info wars i certainly do i'm here as a guest host right now
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:37.160]  like doing doing the fourth hour right so again this is what cnn does this is what the left
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:43.480]  does they lie they simply lie and when one of their own notice how fast they eat their own by the way
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:47.800]  and how they don't stand up for each other and how they don't defend each other then the minute one
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:13:52.600]  of their own screws up the minute one of their own goes over the line they immediately throw them to
[03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:57.480]  the wolves they have no backing of them whatsoever and they even deny the fact that they had a
[03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:03.800]  relationship with that person despite shocking and clear evidence to the contrary in the form of
[03:14:03.800 --> 03:14:09.160]  articles hosted on their websites and forms of in terms of videos so this this shows you who we
[03:14:09.160 --> 03:14:16.520]  are dealing with when it comes to the left their ability seemingly uh endless ability to lie to
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:25.560]  obfuscate to spread myths truths and disinformation and is and also to mock to laugh at a gory
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:31.960]  grisly situation of course the first case being a train crash the second now being a potential
[03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:37.560]  potentially fatal situation where again we do not know the facts at this point they say it was
[03:14:37.560 --> 03:14:42.280]  an innocuous substance they have not said what the white powder was they have not officially uh and
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:46.360]  i'm going to check as we go over the break here i'm going to check to make sure uh if there are any
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:52.200]  official statements that have come out yet from from uh the hospital regarding venessa trump here
[03:14:52.200 --> 03:14:57.000]  we go another one saying donald's it's a pity that don trump jr didn't open it right the junior
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:02.680]  didn't open it and this this envelope folks i wanted to remind you this envelope was addressed to
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:10.920]  donald trump jr a father of five the son of the president of the united states this is what's going
[03:15:10.920 --> 03:15:16.840]  on in the united states this is what's going on in america this is what the left has come to in our
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:22.680]  country right they're celebrating about it again we have no information regarding who sent it we
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:28.360]  have no information regarding uh how this came out what exactly was in the envelope we pray of
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:32.920]  course we keep venessa trump and her and don and his entire family all the kids in our prayers
[03:15:32.920 --> 03:15:37.560]  secret service whether they were involved uh it seems likely that they may have also been involved
[03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:44.920]  in this we pray that everyone is okay that is who we are will the left apologize for their
[03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:51.240]  statements and will the left join us in praying for peace and safety jack was over stick right here

[03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:16.200]  powder envelope addressed to donald trump junior was postmarked from boston so it was
[03:21:16.200 --> 03:21:23.560]  postmarked from boston and that it included an angry note so again for people saying that this
[03:21:23.560 --> 03:21:27.960]  may have just been an accident may have been something else in there this does appear to be
[03:21:27.960 --> 03:21:33.800]  either some sort of threat related to politics or some type of prank in that sense hopefully
[03:21:33.800 --> 03:21:40.200]  just a prank but of course the situation is still being being discussed one of my sources one of
[03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:46.120]  my very close sources i've just been in touch with they seem to indicate they think that everyone
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:53.240]  has been stabilized at the hospital right now i'm in direct contact with a source but i haven't
[03:21:53.240 --> 03:21:57.560]  been able to get the the final a okay from everyone yet so i want to hold off on that
[03:21:57.560 --> 03:22:01.880]  until there is an official statement to let everybody know it does appear that donald trump
[03:22:01.880 --> 03:22:06.760]  juniors children his five children were not at home at the time being in the middle of the day
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:12.440]  so it seems they may have been at school when this happened hopefully none of them of course
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:18.200]  were involved this breaking story a lot of developments going on what make sure to stay
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:22.280]  here because we never know hopefully the situation doesn't take a turn for the worse
[03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:28.360]  hopefully you can stay with us and we'll be able to report very very soon that everything was okay
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:35.800]  that it was just a threat but it's possible it's also possible that this may have been a test
[03:22:35.800 --> 03:22:42.360]  that this may have been a test run to see what type of response level there would be from the
[03:22:42.360 --> 03:22:47.720]  secret service what whether or not an envelope could make it all the way through any layers
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:53.080]  of security that they have and it clearly did in this case to be able to be opened by not donald
[03:22:53.080 --> 03:22:57.160]  trump junior not the president's son but the president's daughter-in-law venessa trump so
[03:22:57.160 --> 03:23:03.000]  it seems that whatever security procedures are in place they have been penetrated this is
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:09.240]  a penetration of the security the secret service network revolving around the trump family the first
[03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:16.120]  family and absolutely represents a clear and present danger just in terms of the security breach
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:21.800]  alone the fact that one of this this is why for example if you go see trump at a rally if you go
[03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:26.840]  see the president at one of his rallies they will tell you if you bring something if you bring a
[03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:30.920]  letter some people bring books some people bring artwork and they say well i want to give this
[03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:35.000]  letter to the president and it might just be a trump fan and say i i wrote this great letter i
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:38.760]  want to give it to the president can i give it to him you can't give that to them it is secret
[03:23:38.760 --> 03:23:45.400]  service protocol to not accept any object any object foreign object that is handed to them at a
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:50.680]  rally that does not go through testing to get to the first family and certainly in this case to get
[03:23:50.680 --> 03:23:56.840]  to the president so again i'm not knocking the secret service detail around president trump
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:24:02.040]  june or excuse me donald trump jr his family but it does seem that the security measures
[03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:07.480]  do need to be reviewed they do need to be checked because this was a security penetration
[03:24:08.600 --> 03:24:14.360]  this was what it what it's called it's an infiltration of their security okay it's a compromise
[03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:20.680]  it's this is called compromise the first family has been compromised i bro i was covering the story
[03:24:20.680 --> 03:24:28.120]  a few weeks ago as well when people were hacking uh the twitter accounts of of people who followed
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:31.640]  real donald trump on twitter they followed the president's twitter account well there was this
[03:24:31.640 --> 03:24:37.720]  this group called the turkish hacker army and the turkish a cyber army was hacking people
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:43.320]  who followed who donald trump followed then they were able to use those hacked accounts
[03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:47.880]  eric falling was one of them gretta bin sustrin they were able to use these hacked accounts david
[03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:54.440]  clerk to send messages to the president through direct message the direct message function on
[03:24:54.440 --> 03:24:59.320]  twitter now if he had clicked on any of the links that they sent or the photos or the videos that
[03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:05.800]  they had sent he then may have downloaded malware from the turkish cyber army uh which
[03:25:05.800 --> 03:25:08.600]  potentially has connections to the turkish government it seems they're certainly very
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:13.880]  supportive of urdogan the president there so he then the president of the united states think about
[03:25:13.880 --> 03:25:18.040]  this there would have been malware from the turkish cyber army on the president's of united
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:22.920]  states phone or any platform that he was using to access twitter of course he usually access it
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:27.640]  from his phone then that could have been set up as a surveillance function that could have been set
[03:25:27.640 --> 03:25:33.640]  up for access into his text messages his other direct messages with people who and more more
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:38.760]  more more shockingly they could have taken control of president trump's twitter account
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:43.960]  if they had taken control of president trump's twitter account imagine just imagine
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:50.600]  what they could have tweeted out that would have certainly sent the entire world into a
[03:25:50.600 --> 03:25:56.840]  head spin that would have had massive implications for world security and world stability so these
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:02.920]  are the things we are talking about these are the cases of essentially and here's the here's
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:06.840]  the article you guys can go see if you go check out my medium site medium.com back slash jack
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:11.960]  posovic where i talked about this i actually just i actually talked to the turkish cyber
[03:26:11.960 --> 03:26:16.360]  hackers because it turns out that they follow some of the accounts that they hacked were people who
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:21.160]  followed me so i sent messages to them and essentially got an interview with a few of them
[03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:26.520]  they gave me their manifesto in turkish i had it professionally translated i broke this story i put
[03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:31.720]  the exclusive out there they are pro urdogan they are against what the united states is doing they
[03:26:31.720 --> 03:26:35.960]  are trying to push back on this and they were using highly effective cyber techniques to do this
[03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:41.640]  they were able to compromise the security of the united states of america this is the issue folks
[03:26:41.640 --> 03:26:44.520]  this is the issue that came up today with this compromise on the president's son
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:51.080]  hopefully not anything in terms of the will come of this hospitalization of venezia trump
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:59.240]  we of course keep her in our prayers so a lot of heavy stuff there folks a lot of heavy stuff
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:06.920]  but i do want to take a very quick second before the segment ends and remind you that we can't

[03:33:33.240 --> 03:33:36.360]  a lot of stuff going on today a lot of news coming out here
[03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:40.680]  washington dc we're talking about the things that are going on in the white house we're talking
[03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:44.440]  about the things that are going on in new york city this possible terrorist attack against
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:51.880]  donald trump junior but there's also there's also news from europe and that is something
[03:33:51.880 --> 03:33:56.920]  that is being completely overlooked right now in the face of this north korean charmer charm
[03:33:56.920 --> 03:34:02.120]  offensive of course the propaganda being repeated by the new york times and cnn from kim jong-un's
[03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:08.200]  sister they're completely overlooking a lot of and there's a there's cnn's new logo sort of a
[03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:12.280]  meme that uh that i put up yesterday just popped it up there i think this is what we should call
[03:34:12.280 --> 03:34:18.840]  cnn's new logo as they as they push out um their their propaganda story and their propaganda
[03:34:18.840 --> 03:34:24.520]  friends over at north korea and i'd like to just take a quick second to remind everybody
[03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:30.680]  that who exactly this person is and what exactly it is that she supports this is they're saying
[03:34:30.680 --> 03:34:35.160]  kim jong-un's sister stealing the show at winter olympics they're reporting on her as if she's
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:42.120]  uh simply the sister of a duly elected president of a democratic country or or whether she's someone
[03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:49.080]  who's a senior advisor to a prime minister no she is the sister of a brutal tyrannical dictator
[03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:58.280]  a communist totalitarian genocidal maniac and why do i say genocidal because i've read the stories
[03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:04.120]  about the korean concentration camps that are in north korea harvard university press put this out
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:09.320]  and i read this in a video last last night harvard university press put out a book called the little
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:15.480]  black book of communism uh this came out several years ago but at that point they had estimated
[03:35:15.480 --> 03:35:22.840]  that over 1.5 million prisoners had died in the concentration camps of north korea the
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:31.080]  concentration camps that are run by kim yo jong's family people are have said survivors have excuse
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:37.080]  me holocaust survivors have said that north korea's prisons are even worse than the than the
[03:35:37.080 --> 03:35:43.800]  circumstances of the nazi concentration camps like auschwitz they're actually saying the human
[03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:51.960]  and experimentation that goes on in north korea the cremation of bodies the brutal rape and assault
[03:35:51.960 --> 03:35:58.680]  of women in these prisons and by the way if you become pregnant if one of these women become
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:04.840]  pregnant after being raped they're then executed because it is against the rules to be pregnant
[03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:11.480]  in one of the north korean concentration camps these are this is the holocaust of our day
[03:36:12.360 --> 03:36:20.840]  that's going on right now today in north korea prisoners who looked like walking skeletons
[03:36:20.840 --> 03:36:29.720]  logging camps in cyberia where prisoners are kept under extreme conditions and are forced to work
[03:36:29.720 --> 03:36:35.800]  in these logging camps in the bitter cold i mean can you imagine what february and north korea or
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:43.160]  cyberia is like right now unimaginable the and of course you know that the the camps where they're
[03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:49.240]  kept they don't have uh they don't exactly have central heating or insulation or any of the different
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:55.400]  that ways to keep them them warm okay these missile test sites that are very close up to north korea
[03:36:56.360 --> 03:37:01.720]  that missile test set test site they're very close to the city of of nanjin and ham hong
[03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:08.120]  so north korea we're talking as well about these concentration camps up there these are the camps
[03:37:09.160 --> 03:37:16.520]  the kim yo jong's family owns runs and treats the people there the political prisoners many of them
[03:37:16.520 --> 03:37:22.520]  like slaves if you would defect from north korea your entire family will be sent to one of these
[03:37:22.520 --> 03:37:31.160]  camps your entire family but the media roiders new york times cnn they called her a a prim young
[03:37:31.160 --> 03:37:37.720]  woman with a high forehead and hair half swept back with quiet gazes they described the head held
[03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:45.000]  high as she worked in these are people these are people who run concentration camps these are slave
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:50.200]  owners to put it in another way in another sense anyone who defects their family is immediately
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:56.280]  sent to the concentration camp no question about it uh any female who's in the every almost 100% of
[03:37:56.280 --> 03:38:05.320]  the females in these concentration camps are are sexually assaulted or raped almost 100% but of course
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:11.960]  when kim yo jong comes down the entire who is by the way one of the heads of the north korean
[03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:19.160]  propaganda department okay this is her job her actual job is to spread propaganda for north korea
[03:38:19.160 --> 03:38:25.800]  for their communist regime across the world the entire media does it for her now look folks we
[03:38:25.800 --> 03:38:30.680]  know why they're doing this we know they're doing this because kim yo jong and the kim family is
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:36.840]  against trump and so the media thinks well if we're against trump too the left the left side of the
[03:38:36.840 --> 03:38:42.280]  media i should say the old media so if we're against trump we should then praise the regime of north
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:48.280]  korea and praise this uh uh representative of it now you look you look at the these cheerleaders
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:52.200]  in north korea the 200 cheerleaders these are slaves by the way i want to i want to make sure
[03:38:52.200 --> 03:39:00.680]  everyone is 100 clear when i say this these are slaves they are forced in there they are forced
[03:39:00.680 --> 03:39:06.120]  to perform these acts if they do not perform these acts uh horrific abuses will happen then
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:10.120]  we talked about ude who's saying earlier today that is what would happen to these cheerleaders
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:15.640]  and if any of them so much as was suspected of trying to defect to south korea
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:22.920]  they'd be disappeared within seconds within seconds before being brought back
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:27.480]  or after being upon being brought back to the north korea which is known as the hermit regime
[03:39:27.480 --> 03:39:33.400]  you know a lot of people a lot of people talk about what's to be done about the north korean
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:37.960]  situation whether we can use diplomacy or we have to use military force north korea of course
[03:39:37.960 --> 03:39:44.120]  has the fourth largest standing army in the world that's because they put so much of their economy
[03:39:44.120 --> 03:39:49.960]  so much of their country's wealth into maintaining that military because number one they have to keep
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:56.440]  down the people inside and created the world's most horrific totalitarian police state uh far
[03:39:56.440 --> 03:40:01.160]  harsher far worse than anything you'd find out of hollywood in terms of dystopian movies
[03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:06.760]  and number two because they know that any incursion by north korea by the united states
[03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:12.760]  or excuse me south korea or the united states would lead to their downfall so if that regime ever
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:17.960]  was under the threat or felt that they were under the threat of collapse from either invasion by
[03:40:17.960 --> 03:40:25.080]  south korea invasion by china p s people have have suggested uh or a u.s military action there is no
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:31.240]  question there is no question that north korea would launch their full might of their ballistic
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:37.560]  missiles on all of their enemies to include everyone in south korea to include uh us bases
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:44.440]  in guan in guam and japan again folks this regime was threatening to nuke the united states
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:51.240]  about six months ago it was just over the summer it was just over the summer they were threatening
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:57.960]  to uke the united states but suddenly cnn and new york times love them and see and they want to
[03:40:57.960 --> 03:41:02.920]  they want to praise these people who are just threatening to nuke us and wipe our territory
[03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:10.280]  of guam off the face of the map so and i would also like to state though uh just in regards
[03:41:10.280 --> 03:41:14.440]  to their nuclear arsenal that which they would certainly use north korea also has an extremely
[03:41:14.440 --> 03:41:20.840]  active chemical weapons program those chemical weapons would almost certainly be used within
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:26.920]  the first hours if not minutes of any conflict between the north and the south militarily and
[03:41:26.920 --> 03:41:30.680]  we're not talking about their icbm's their intercontinental ballistic missiles we're
[03:41:30.680 --> 03:41:36.520]  talking about srbm's uh short range ballistic missiles pretty much the entirety of the country
[03:41:36.520 --> 03:41:41.960]  of south korea would be within range of any one of these missiles because folks we're not talking
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:47.080]  about two countries the size of the united states and china here we're talking about two countries
[03:41:47.080 --> 03:41:51.640]  that are about the size of two u.s states this would be like the state of ohio declaring war
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:57.160]  on the state of indiana right everything they have is right next to each other the two capitals of
[03:41:57.160 --> 03:42:04.360]  soul in pyeongyang are extremely close to each other so any situation that led to military conflict
[03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:11.800]  we'd have to understand we would have to accept millions dead on both sides of the border and
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:18.120]  if we're trying to peacefully unite the peninsula or peacefully unite it we need to be very careful
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:25.560]  about what exactly it is that we're willing to do to get to that situation and that's why
[03:42:25.560 --> 03:42:32.040]  we need to be very careful about using military force but at the same time we cannot allow the
[03:42:32.040 --> 03:42:37.960]  north koreans to threaten us with their nuclear arsenal jack posovic talking about very complex
[03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:42.680]  north korea issues and the media's complete capitulation to communist propaganda the walter
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:47.800]  doranti award is certainly certainly up for grabs and i think cnn is going to get it uh come back
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:55.000]  let we've got one more segment left here on a big fourth hour of info wars introducing cell force
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:43:02.120]  by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce
[03:43:02.120 --> 03:43:08.440]  over 95 of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your
[03:43:08.440 --> 03:43:14.360]  cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:21.000]  your mitochondria don't run at 100 efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:26.600]  top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these
[03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:32.680]  reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful
[03:43:32.680 --> 03:43:38.120]  available on the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these
[03:43:38.120 --> 03:43:45.640]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info

[03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:42.280]  day gift from the info wars store isn't that right so i wanted to talk break down an issue
[03:49:42.280 --> 03:49:47.240]  out of europe right now that's going on that's not getting a lot of press however it has to do
[03:49:47.240 --> 03:49:52.600]  with russia and that's kind of what struck me is so surprising because russia has led the
[03:49:52.600 --> 03:49:58.840]  headlines for any other story that's going on right now did you know did you know that russia
[03:49:58.840 --> 03:50:07.720]  is building another pipeline to germany another pipeline directly to europe now you'd think wait
[03:50:07.720 --> 03:50:12.760]  a minute i keep hearing about russia all day long from these democrats in the us senate and the us
[03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:18.040]  house why aren't they saying anything why aren't they saying a word about this pipeline jack are
[03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:23.480]  you fake news no right here germany has just granted the pipeline permits okay so they need
[03:50:23.480 --> 03:50:29.080]  to get permits to build this thing out it's a connection between moscow and brussels essentially
[03:50:29.800 --> 03:50:33.240]  with the european union really moscow and berlin with merkel's government
[03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:39.080]  putin is getting his way with this pipeline this is completely said it's called the Nordstrom
[03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:44.840]  Nord Stream 2 excuse me not Nordstrom Nord Stream 2 is built through the Baltic Sea and it's going to
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:51.400]  be a gas prom run line connecting a natural gas transfer from russia into germany so i want to
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:57.560]  remind folks that just because merkel is out there all day long talking about russia
[03:50:57.560 --> 03:51:00.680]  saying that and we've got the map of it here for you all to see it goes right through the
[03:51:00.680 --> 03:51:07.800]  Baltic there bypassing estonia lithuania latvia poland and then back into directly into germany
[03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:13.640]  even though even though merkel and these dem these democrat leftists say they're so anti-putin
[03:51:13.640 --> 03:51:21.400]  she still is stuck on natural gas and still the political ramifications of her not supporting
[03:51:21.400 --> 03:51:27.240]  this huge pipeline deal with russia i don't think would be enough for her party uh or her
[03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:32.120]  newly formed coalition to be able to go through it with anything they would absolutely be run out
[03:51:32.120 --> 03:51:36.360]  of town because if people understand this that the price of gas the price of just going to fill
[03:51:36.360 --> 03:51:42.520]  up your car in europe is so much so that's why they're even willing to turn over to the russians
[03:51:42.520 --> 03:51:48.440]  turn over to putin to get this out regardless of knowing that any chance putin wants he can
[03:51:48.440 --> 03:51:55.320]  simply turn off that switch and he can simply cut it off so imagine the leverage now that russia
[03:51:55.320 --> 03:52:01.560]  is going to have over putin and there's a lot of people saying there's a lot of people saying
[03:52:01.560 --> 03:52:07.560]  that is russian gas good for america well one thing that i would point out is that america
[03:52:07.560 --> 03:52:12.920]  in many ways is becoming energy independent and actually a net exporter of energy under the
[03:52:12.920 --> 03:52:18.920]  trump administration so many american states now to include pennsylvania my home state are actually
[03:52:18.920 --> 03:52:24.600]  exporting energy from natural gas from fracking that's going out across the world but these are
[03:52:24.600 --> 03:52:28.840]  the same democrat senators that are usually saying we need to stand up to russia we need to stand up
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:36.280]  to putin but when it comes to an actual situation where russia is cutting into a potential exporter
[03:52:36.280 --> 03:52:42.520]  for our energy right so we're going to become net energy exporter by 2022 which will be hopefully
[03:52:42.520 --> 03:52:49.160]  during trump's second term we're on that pace so why then why are the democrat senators who are
[03:52:49.160 --> 03:52:56.600]  normally so up in arms about russia not saying a single word about russia building this pipeline
[03:52:57.480 --> 03:53:04.040]  which could go to a potential customer a potential market for american energy folks
[03:53:04.040 --> 03:53:11.400]  this is the type of situation that president trump has been talking about for 30 years for 30 years
[03:53:11.400 --> 03:53:16.600]  saying that other countries are laughing at us the way we get treated the way we get screwed
[03:53:16.600 --> 03:53:21.240]  out of deals the way we don't understand what's really going on in the world we pay attention to
[03:53:21.240 --> 03:53:27.080]  these phony russia collusion allegations etc etc meanwhile russia is building a pipeline to germany
[03:53:27.080 --> 03:53:33.480]  and our companies are states that are trying to get their new newfound natural gas out of the country
[03:53:33.480 --> 03:53:38.600]  that are trying to find more export markets for it are being shut down because russia is being
[03:53:38.600 --> 03:53:44.520]  used now of course russia is a lot closer but you'd think that there would be some pressure from the
[03:53:44.520 --> 03:53:49.720]  us at least diplomatically to say hey wait a second think of the security implications the
[03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:54.840]  national security international security implications of signing such a crucial natural resource
[03:53:54.840 --> 03:54:00.600]  agreement with the kremlin but it's not to be found so rex tillerson the u.s. secretary of state
[03:54:00.600 --> 03:54:05.240]  said something about it he gave a speech recently the government of poland gave him a huge speech
[03:54:05.240 --> 03:54:09.960]  urging germany not to do this but where's the u.s. ambassador to germany on all of this
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:14.520]  has anyone heard about the u.s. ambassador to germany all this oh wait that's right we don't
[03:54:14.520 --> 03:54:22.440]  have a u.s. ambassador to germany and why is that well because richard grenl who was approved to be
[03:54:22.440 --> 03:54:30.040]  nominated by the house excuse me by the senate has been it's been refused to come up for a confirmation
[03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:38.200]  vote by chuck schumer and mitch mcconnell so we've got richard grenl who is a an extreme patriot a
[03:54:38.200 --> 03:54:44.520]  huge trump supporter he happens to be a gay republican so this would be trumps first gay ambassador
[03:54:44.520 --> 03:54:49.880]  and possibly are our first openly gay ambassador to have to look that one up so why are they holding
[03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:55.880]  him up why is chuck schumer holding him up why won't he allow allow this to happen we just
[03:54:55.880 --> 03:55:04.200]  heard about berlin's cia as well this massive corrupt spying scheme that was that had that
[03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:09.640]  had gone on where essentially cia agents were paying russians uh saying that they were going to get
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:14.840]  this these naked pictures of trump naked video of trump and a bunch of nsa tools and the guy
[03:55:14.840 --> 03:55:20.040]  handed over and said he didn't actually have any of that this russian agent completely troll he
[03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:26.120]  trolled them he just he trolled them folks he allowed them to be able to to give them a hundred
[03:55:26.120 --> 03:55:32.120]  thousand dollars and said and they were working on their way towards a million dollars in in terms of
[03:55:32.120 --> 03:55:37.000]  our cia giving this guy money he didn't actually have any of these secrets he didn't have any
[03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:42.200]  he didn't have any pictures of trump any video of trump he didn't have anything other than publicly
[03:55:42.200 --> 03:55:47.800]  available documents so they the cia paid this guy a hundred thousand dollars and he handed them a copy
[03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:52.600]  of the trump dossier and said cc look what i've got now if you guys just give me a hundred thousand
[03:55:52.600 --> 03:55:58.040]  more dollars i'll give you better information you just just just keep paying me and the more you
[03:55:58.040 --> 03:56:05.880]  pay me i'll get more money folks i think anybody can realize what's going on there this is a guy
[03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:10.600]  who is trying to make a buck and realize that he could do bar intelligence agencies because the fact
[03:56:10.600 --> 03:56:16.200]  he was russian and because of all the russia hysteria out there and he got a hundred thousand
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:23.320]  dollars for it now that operation went down in germany had it been done in germany that means
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:29.640]  that the u.s. ambassador would have had oversight of it but we don't have a u.s. ambassador we don't
[03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:35.240]  have richard grannell there supporting our u.s. policies supporting u.s. diplomacy whether it's
[03:56:35.240 --> 03:56:40.520]  helping our states find an export market for our natural resources that we want to sell this energy
[03:56:40.520 --> 03:56:45.080]  that we want to sell to actually bring money back into our country after we've used it use the energy
[03:56:45.080 --> 03:56:51.480]  of course for ourselves our own resources this is what we're talking about unleashing the american
[03:56:51.480 --> 03:56:58.520]  economy unleashing the untapped potential of america but again because of politics because of
[03:56:58.520 --> 03:57:04.200]  chuck schumer and to an extent mitch mcconnell for not getting richard grannell where again he's
