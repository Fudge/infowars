[01:43.200 --> 01:50.280]  very politically astute me going back into the 1980s very aware of the New
[01:50.280 --> 01:57.800]  World Order and of course an extremely popular band you know really influenced
[01:57.800 --> 02:02.360]  a lot of the modern music that we see both rock and roll what you've called
[02:02.360 --> 02:07.320]  techno all this stuff are really big granddaddies of all of that and I
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.880]  noticed that there's a lot of people twittering around the office excitedly
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.280]  over the fact I think almost everybody in the office turns out our big ministry
[02:16.280 --> 02:20.760]  fans and of course a few years ago they with a lot of courage came out with a
[02:20.760 --> 02:28.280]  9-11 truth album and if you go back to the early 1990s they had albums out
[02:28.280 --> 02:34.520]  dealing with the New World Order it's about right and wrong good and evil
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.440]  sampling George Herbert Walker Bush and his world government calls and so the

[02:58.400 --> 03:02.480]  devalued the big ratings agencies that work for the private banking families
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.800]  holding the United States hostage the mainstream corporate whore media that's
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.160]  really not mainstream anymore the dying dinosaur media that still thinks it's
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.600]  dominant it's a proper assessment and I myself have to stop using that term
[03:15.600 --> 03:22.600]  mainstream media they are running around lying saying oh my gosh the people in
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.400]  the house you know they just want America the default no no there's a debate
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.920]  on how much taxes are gonna be raised on and what the spending cuts are but the
[03:31.920 --> 03:37.320]  media is just like why won't the Republicans give in and do the right
[03:37.320 --> 03:41.560]  thing and not have the country go bankrupt and and by the way I'm not
[03:41.560 --> 03:47.640]  saying the Republicans are good either their plan is better than Obama's but
[03:47.640 --> 03:51.440]  that's like saying well Obama only wants to shoot you in the head a hundred
[03:51.440 --> 03:54.560]  times the Republicans only want to shoot the country in the head ninety times
[03:54.560 --> 03:59.600]  and Ron Paul's on record saying all of this is deck chair rearranging on the
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.840]  Titanic all of this is putting perfume on a pig or lipstick all of this is is
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.560]  is much ado about nothing it's really a question with the Republicans and
[04:09.560 --> 04:14.440]  Democrats to their banker masters how are we gonna skin this Republic you know
[04:14.440 --> 04:21.240]  there's more than one way to skin a cat and how are we gonna do it and the
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.320]  Republican plan is just cut off a little more of the swap to the public who
[04:26.320 --> 04:30.880]  are already having the swap they're being given being less and less their
[04:30.880 --> 04:36.040]  inflation and other things and pay more to the foreign bankers and Obama says
[04:36.040 --> 04:42.160]  no let's rape more of the middle class and keep swapping the public I'll break

[11:02.760 --> 11:06.000]  companies to force people to buy it and to have federal control over what
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.520]  procedures you can have just like the National Health Service in England here's
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.200]  one in an independent article dealing with this cataracts hips knees and
[11:14.200 --> 11:21.360]  tonsils National Health Service begins rationing operations and it just goes
[11:21.360 --> 11:25.280]  on that you're not going to get the hip and knee replacements and less we say
[11:25.280 --> 11:29.560]  so you're not going to get cataract operations you're not going to get
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.480]  tonsilectomies when you need them you're not going to get grommets to improve
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.400]  the hearing and children yeah I mean you don't need a hearing aid funding's also
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.280]  been cut in some of the IVF treatments for the national it just goes on and on
[11:43.280 --> 11:46.480]  here and of course this has been going on for many years I remember six seven
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.360]  years ago I played clips here on air because I had to catch it and tape it
[11:50.360 --> 11:57.520]  somewhere in our labyrinth of uncronical piles of hard drives and data tapes but
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.760]  I've watched a bait in the House of Commons and they would get up and in
[12:02.760 --> 12:07.440]  Prime Minister's questions and they would say Prime Minister Blair and then
[12:07.440 --> 12:11.900]  they would read the name of their constituents my constituents died two
[12:11.900 --> 12:17.560]  days ago 19 months ago they were they requested the brain surgery that is 97
[12:17.560 --> 12:21.800]  percent operable is done in the first month but instead they waited more than
[12:21.800 --> 12:26.320]  a year and a half and died Tony Blair yes I'm fully aware of that and I'm just
[12:26.320 --> 12:33.480]  sorry that's the way it is hmm next question my constituent had a broken
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.640]  leg and they would refuse to fix it it was a compound fracture they did not do
[12:37.640 --> 12:42.640]  the surgery and now they were dying of gain green had to have the leg removed
[12:42.640 --> 12:49.080]  I'm sorry that's just the way it is and and you get up here and you explain
[12:49.080 --> 12:51.960]  to people hey in these countries where they have socialist health care it is
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.280]  rationed you do know that and the big companies that are in the private rationing
[12:57.280 --> 13:00.720]  control they make even bigger profits and it's about eugenics and death panels
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.480]  they're like shut up you wild-eyed scumbags well here's the book written
[13:04.480 --> 13:09.680]  by Tom Jashal calling you know that if you're blind get a cane or if you're got
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.200]  a bad knee get a cane I mean they actually say that and this is all about
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.240]  getting new taxes and then the bankers steal it out the backdoor it's like no
[13:18.240 --> 13:21.400]  matter how much money you give the VA it all gets stolen out the backdoor they
[13:21.400 --> 13:25.200]  don't give the troops good health care on average worse in the world this is
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.720]  how it works and I just see these articles everywhere and now I can play
[13:29.720 --> 13:35.000]  the clip I probably played it 15 times you can just search Bill Gates says
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.640]  death panels are needed and he goes he says well they aren't really death
[13:38.640 --> 13:42.880]  panels but you don't give an old lady care you can hire 10 teachers and there's
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.160]  like all the he's talking to a government group they're like it's
[13:47.160 --> 13:51.720]  triggering this predator function the brain hey you kill old ladies you get
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.120]  money of course these fools that are you know 40 something years old the
[13:55.120 --> 14:00.040]  audience are like you know soon you'll be you know having your your health care
[14:00.040 --> 14:03.600]  cut and and so that's how they do it they get everything communalized
[14:03.600 --> 14:07.720]  everything in a big pile and then they steal the money out the backdoor you use
[14:07.720 --> 14:15.480]  the control for social engineering and then tell the public hey if you if you
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.200]  live just like we say do everything we tell you and you're part of a quote in
[14:19.200 --> 14:22.520]  group then you might get some health care but the bureaucrats are going to
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.680]  decide and that's exactly where they want us just like now with the debt
[14:26.680 --> 14:33.720]  limit they can openly hold everybody hostage and say go deeper into the banks
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.640]  of debt or you won't get all these goodies and then the lion's share of the
[14:38.640 --> 14:43.320]  quote debt that we've signed on to over 90% is not owed by the American people
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.960]  it's not defense it's not social security it's it's it's none of this most
[14:48.960 --> 14:56.160]  of the tax money is siphoned off for interest on the creation of money since
[14:56.160 --> 15:04.560]  1913 almost 100 years ago 98 years ago since 1913 private banks took over the
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.240]  issuance of currency and credit and for a dollar to be created a dollar of debt
[15:09.240 --> 15:14.400]  is created to them that's pretty good business if you can get it and that's
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.200]  why everything is about bankrupting us everything is about getting us into debt
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.240]  because we were going into debt to them over nothing but now they've created the
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.960]  derivatives 12 years ago over a thousand trillion worldwide they say the USO
[15:27.960 --> 15:31.840]  six hundred trillion the Washington Post reports and why do we owe it because
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.120]  the politicians said too big to fail and signed us on to it saying the whole
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.880]  economy will be brought down total tyranny martial law total collapse
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.200]  blood and streets cats and dogs living together I'm talking about wrath of God
[15:44.200 --> 15:47.880]  type of stuff to quote ghostbusters that's what they said in Greece a few
[15:47.880 --> 15:50.400]  months ago that's what they said in Ireland a few months ago that's what
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.640]  they said in Iceland that's what they say here in the US three years ago and
[15:53.640 --> 15:58.680]  now they're right back to it and then government gives in and see the public
[15:58.680 --> 16:01.080]  right now this whole debt limit thing and being taught about dollar
[16:01.080 --> 16:05.040]  devaluation and then and being threatened with total default and total
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.080]  collapse the public's being set up now that oh it was our 14 trillion in debt
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.600]  that we actually through welfare and through entitlements and defense really
[16:14.600 --> 16:20.520]  do oh through Treasury bills to people that have bought it really is 14 trillion
[16:20.520 --> 16:27.840]  dollars we owe and then you find out that the city of New York Manhattan years
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.200]  ago had over a trillion dollars in liquid slush funds in the comprehensive
[16:32.200 --> 16:37.480]  annual financial reports you find out that there are families Russian media
[16:37.480 --> 16:40.760]  estimated the oligarchs and turned out to be Rothschild France that was even the
[16:40.760 --> 16:46.280]  financial times of London control three hundred trillion dollars and that was a
[16:46.280 --> 16:54.480]  decade ago that was 2001 a decade ago so the bankers have created 1.5
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.640]  quadrillion they they got everybody to tie their pension funds to it to tie
[16:59.640 --> 17:03.040]  your real investments to it and now they hold everybody hostage and they keep
[17:03.040 --> 17:10.160]  taking us deeper down this road of give us more power give us more control or
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.800]  you will be destroyed financially but you notice now that it it's like a young
[17:15.800 --> 17:18.800]  woman and a guy in a parking lot puts a gun to her and he says get in the car
[17:18.800 --> 17:23.680]  I'm gonna kill you well honey he's planning to take you to a shack where
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.520]  he's gonna slowly rape and torture you over a couple months and what psychopaths
[17:27.520 --> 17:31.920]  call using you up and feeding off the begging and the crying and the pleading
[17:31.920 --> 17:35.680]  that's like Beethoven to these people it's horrible to normal people it's
[17:35.680 --> 17:38.840]  beautiful to them it's the same thing for the bankers they're psychopaths
[17:38.840 --> 17:43.760]  they've interbred psychopathic traits with each other for thousands of years
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.720]  and they call themselves another species the eugenicists all their
[17:47.720 --> 17:51.840]  literature and they are they are psychologically and spiritually it's
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.920]  like the Morlocks and the Eloy htls admitted that was a analogy or a
[17:56.920 --> 18:03.040]  parable of life and you're blind to them just just like a woman the guy puts a
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.000]  gun to her and she gets in the car and you know she would be better to scream
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.920]  and yell and he he might even pump around into her but generally they don't
[18:09.920 --> 18:13.400]  want to get caught they'll let you go and run or even worse guy pulls up the
[18:13.400 --> 18:18.040]  yellow Volkswagen it's been Bernacke hey get in with me honey I'm wearing a suit
[18:18.040 --> 18:23.040]  these guys in suits are safe you get in the car with them and next day you're
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.800]  chained down and he's biting chunks out of your back you see and so that's what
[18:27.800 --> 18:30.680]  they're saying they're saying you know get in the car well we're now in the car
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.360]  and they pulled a gun out and they're saying now now now listen you're signed
[18:34.360 --> 18:38.280]  on to our derivatives or I'm gonna shoot you well you better just knock the
[18:38.280 --> 18:41.600]  window out of the car you better try to jump out you better attacking you better
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.160]  grab the steering wheel you better run it off the road it doesn't mean that
[18:45.160 --> 18:50.840]  you're gonna be able to even get out of this now but at least you're gonna run
[18:50.840 --> 18:53.960]  the car off the road and he's gonna have to shoot you and you got a chance of
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.280]  getting away or you can go to the shack and I know America just like with
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.560]  Nazi Germany and the Soviets and the Chinese and all of it you want to go to
[19:02.560 --> 19:07.920]  the shack and you're not gonna wake up till Ted Bundy aka New World Order is
[19:07.920 --> 19:12.720]  been raping you for about two weeks and biting chunks out of you and put
[19:12.720 --> 19:16.400]  cigarettes out in your eyes now I know that's what you're really looking for
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.480]  and I know you like government killing 200 plus mill last century and so you're
[19:21.480 --> 19:25.000]  you've you've allowed it because you won't admit these are psychopathic
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.600]  hardcore criminals okay only a full awakening to the full nightmare gives us
[19:31.600 --> 19:35.040]  any chance of beating these people and that's why I don't mince words and I
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.920]  don't play games and that's why I don't even worry about my own life my own name
[19:38.920 --> 19:44.760]  I don't have fear you know why because I realize it's all a trick it's a game we
[19:44.760 --> 19:48.680]  don't have a future they're already jacking our water our food most of us

[23:55.280 --> 24:19.280]  home away from home.
[24:25.280 --> 24:40.320]  you see it's a mathematical societal historical fact that if you allow
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.160]  corruption to grow and if you get rid of checks and balances in government
[24:44.160 --> 24:49.760]  whether it's Rome Germany or the United States today that you will be
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.780]  absolutely and totally and completely enslaved because even if you have
[24:54.780 --> 24:58.320]  moderately corrupt people that get away with corruption over time the more
[24:58.320 --> 25:03.600]  avarice filled and cunning get into all of those positions and then you get a
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.880]  Mal a Hitler a Stalin a Fidel Castro and we've seen Hugo Chavez transform
[25:08.880 --> 25:14.920]  completely into a lying dictator with stage elections and arrest and the shut
[25:14.920 --> 25:18.800]  down a political speech and that there's a flotilla of laws I'll get to later in
[25:18.800 --> 25:25.840]  the broadcast where just outside of law they are shutting down free speech total
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.120]  internet tracking I happen to have here into my knowledge no gun dealer has put
[25:30.120 --> 25:34.120]  this out we actually have the ATF letter directly from a gun dealer known
[25:34.120 --> 25:39.520]  personally to yours truly where they command them to surveil and report on
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.720]  their customers outside of law and this is basically indentured servitude it
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.240]  turns them into confidential informants and so you're ordered to be their
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.280]  informant similar to some of the sections of the Patriot Act where they
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.040]  order you to surveil people and they're not telling anyone and if you find out
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.360]  that the FBI is broken into your house without a warrant under sneak and peak
[25:59.360 --> 26:02.920]  provisions then you can't tell anyone that they've broken in well that's
[26:02.920 --> 26:09.000]  basically what this is the ATF saying you now work for us you're like a crack
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.960]  dealer we've busted and it's outside of law and if this is put up with that
[26:14.960 --> 26:20.160]  people don't stand up against this and I got to tell you you know it even takes
[26:20.160 --> 26:24.960]  courage in this police state for the gun dealer to give this to me and it's a
[26:24.960 --> 26:30.120]  testament that these haven't these letters haven't come out today and that
[26:30.120 --> 26:33.760]  tens of thousands of gun dealers have been sent these the last few weeks and
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.480]  that none of them have the courage to even leak it I mean you need to see the
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.680]  gun dealers come out and say this is illegal together or next they're gonna
[26:41.680 --> 26:45.400]  be telling you to do even more like they did in Phoenix other areas where the
[26:45.400 --> 26:52.400]  government comes in and says hey you are going to ship guns to these people we
[26:52.400 --> 26:55.400]  tell you to and videotape the whole thing and the people are like well I
[26:55.400 --> 26:58.640]  don't want to do that and they said you better do it and they did it so this is
[26:58.640 --> 27:02.400]  all part of like the mafia coming to your grocery store and saying you're gonna
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.240]  start paying me a cut and instead of beating the person's brains out with a
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.640]  baseball bat it's not a lot of mafia in the south and Texas in places because in
[27:10.640 --> 27:14.440]  the past people would kill you in the north folks put up with it as soon as
[27:14.440 --> 27:17.600]  immigrant populations came in from eastern and southern Europe who were
[27:17.600 --> 27:20.840]  accustomed to that and the predators would prey on people that have been
[27:20.840 --> 27:24.960]  taught how to bend over but here in Texas you come into somebody's place they
[27:24.960 --> 27:28.040]  don't care they're just gonna kill you I mean the old days my grandpas were
[27:28.040 --> 27:31.640]  nothing special they weren't the toughest guys in the world well maybe maybe
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.680]  they kind of were but the point is you know they were the types of people that
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.240]  just if somebody did anything to them they were very nice and friendly you
[27:39.240 --> 27:41.880]  were gonna get your head stomped in and if you pulled a gun they were gonna kill
[27:41.880 --> 27:48.840]  you now that's what old Texas was you see now in America the mafia comes the
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.360]  bombers of Oklahoma City and they tell people to do this and everybody just
[27:53.360 --> 27:56.920]  just just just grovels we need to legally do something about these criminals
[27:56.920 --> 27:59.680]  that have been caught shipping guns to the Mexico to now blame the Second
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.760]  Amendment and execute this now I had Ted Anderson here and Dilling Pulse coming
[28:03.760 --> 28:06.960]  up and I have to get him on about 35 after so I've got to cover this financial
[28:06.960 --> 28:11.520]  news with Ted at the end of this segment the start of the next GDP at 1.3
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.400]  growth that's a complete joke with cook numbers but with inflation I mean that
[28:16.400 --> 28:22.280]  means we have a negative growth rate of about 8% gold soars Dow plunges Apple
[28:22.280 --> 28:25.200]  has more cash in the US government exactly how the bankers wanted to
[28:25.200 --> 28:32.680]  position us consumer confidence at two year low Q1 crashed to just 0.4 and
[28:32.680 --> 28:37.240]  again they're teaching us right now that the dollar is going to die we're
[28:37.240 --> 28:42.080]  going to go into a depression because we didn't raise taxes we're all being
[28:42.080 --> 28:45.200]  taught how it's our fault the global crash will be the 14 trillion we owe
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.160]  not the 1.5 quadrillion created by the bankers and I wanted to bring Ted
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.280]  Anderson up here today with a Friday gold deal that's going to run through the
[28:54.280 --> 28:57.360]  weekend but also to talk about the economy but Ted before we go to break
[28:57.360 --> 29:01.360]  people need to protect themselves gold and silver it's only gone up you bought
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.320]  it months ago when it went down a little bit you're running out and it's
[29:05.320 --> 29:08.000]  already gone up some because you're selling stuff that you know you bought
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.440]  as it went back up it's time for folks to take advantage of the gold and silver
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.720]  deals and protect themselves from the banksters to some extent I know folks
[29:15.720 --> 29:18.160]  wish they would have bought silver when it was $5 an ounce or gold when it was
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.880]  300 like I told you you know now Ted tell us where gold and silver are right
[29:21.880 --> 29:28.360]  now yeah gold hit a high today of 1633 80 silver hit a high or hit a high of 40
[29:28.360 --> 29:32.160]  49 I mean gold has hit a high it's never seen before now it's getting to be

[32:58.160 --> 33:08.080]  slash Alex
[33:08.080 --> 33:12.080]  It's just one-bonding, just to play the king
[33:12.080 --> 33:16.080]  I put the capsules crumble, then you're left with just a name
[33:16.080 --> 33:18.080]  Where's your crown, king?
[33:18.080 --> 33:22.080]  I feel not
[33:26.080 --> 33:27.080]  Where's your crown?
[33:27.080 --> 33:32.080]  Okay, we have gotten the secret because it's not been released
[33:32.080 --> 33:35.080]  and they're telling the gun dealers not to let the public know
[33:35.080 --> 33:40.080]  Now the ATF comes and says, hey, we don't have a law
[33:40.080 --> 33:48.080]  but we're going to order you that you cannot sell somebody more than two guns in a week, two or more guns
[33:48.080 --> 33:53.080]  and then you have to call us like it's a crime so we can then go harass them at their homes
[33:53.080 --> 33:56.080]  and this has now begun. I've talked to people who of course are scared
[33:56.080 --> 34:04.080]  who go by two rifles because they're on sale at Academy, Walmart, local gun shop, whatever the case is
[34:04.080 --> 34:07.080]  and the ATF and FBI come to your house
[34:07.080 --> 34:11.080]  if you buy now it's even 500 rounds of ammo they're coming to your house
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.080]  like you're a criminal and they're saying, oh, because of the carnage in Mexico
[34:15.080 --> 34:17.080]  when it was the government that shipped the guns into Mexico
[34:17.080 --> 34:20.080]  so they don't care they got caught running this false flag against the Second Amendment
[34:20.080 --> 34:23.080]  they're going ahead with it
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.080]  and I was given this document by a Texas gun dealer who I know personally
[34:28.080 --> 34:30.080]  I'll leave it at that
[34:30.080 --> 34:37.080]  and I've got Aaron Dykes back there doing a report on it
[34:37.080 --> 34:43.080]  we got James Dillingpole coming up, popping in to talk about four new climate gates
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.080]  one of the biggest is Polar Bear Gate
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.080]  also NASA's had to admit that the heat is going out of the atmosphere into space
[34:51.080 --> 34:55.080]  and it's the sun, the Hadron Collider found that it's true that it's ions out of space
[34:55.080 --> 34:59.080]  that are causing cloud nuclei and are mainly associated with heating
[34:59.080 --> 35:03.080]  again, it's premeditated fraud from these people
[35:03.080 --> 35:06.080]  and the whole house of cards is falling in on them right now
[35:06.080 --> 35:08.080]  so we're going to be talking to Dillingpole in a moment
[35:08.080 --> 35:10.080]  I want to go back to Ted Anderson
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.080]  Ted market plunges it open on GDP debt issues
[35:14.080 --> 35:19.080]  that's even a cooked GDP number of 1.3 because they're using cooked inflation numbers
[35:19.080 --> 35:25.080]  if you average it for real inflation we're down...grows down by negative 8
[35:25.080 --> 35:29.080]  economy grows at sluggish 1.3, consumers pull back
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.080]  ahead of Obama's jobs councils moving jobs and economic infrastructure to China
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.080]  including their giant multi-billion dollar year x-ray business
[35:38.080 --> 35:42.080]  in fact now we're hearing that a lot of the naked body scanners are going to be China made
[35:42.080 --> 35:47.080]  you got to love it man, frying us in microwave ovens made in China
[35:47.080 --> 36:00.080]  and then it just boggles the mind sometimes to realize that this is going on
[36:00.080 --> 36:03.080]  so that's some of the financial news we've got
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.080]  I want to get into what Ron Paul's been saying about all of this a little bit later
[36:06.080 --> 36:09.080]  but briefly Ted Anderson what are today's golden silver offers
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.080]  I want to be very clear for people
[36:12.080 --> 36:16.080]  I am proud that I've been promoting golden silver for 14 years
[36:16.080 --> 36:19.080]  and in that time frame again silver's gone from $5 to over 40
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.080]  gold's gone from 300 and something to what is it now
[36:23.080 --> 36:26.080]  1600 and something today exploding upwards
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.080]  and it's not that golden silver's really gone up
[36:29.080 --> 36:31.080]  I mean I've got articles here today we're all over the country
[36:31.080 --> 36:33.080]  they're robbing every form of scrap metal
[36:33.080 --> 36:39.080]  bronze urns at Thiefsteel 100 bronze vases off headstones at cemetery
[36:39.080 --> 36:45.080]  there's grave robbing going on railroad rails being jerked up
[36:45.080 --> 36:47.080]  I mean this country's in a depression
[36:47.080 --> 36:50.080]  and you got almost 50 million people on food stamps
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.080]  that's 50 million in soup kitchen lines every day
[36:52.080 --> 36:54.080]  but it's digital so they're hiding it
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.080]  and it's all been planned
[36:56.080 --> 36:59.080]  and I just hope people will get into golden silver today
[36:59.080 --> 37:02.080]  so Ted tell folks the golden silver you have
[37:02.080 --> 37:05.080]  yeah right now the Franks are at $354
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.080]  of course you get Bob's full year subscription for that
[37:08.080 --> 37:13.080]  like brings us to about 975 gold that's like almost half a spot
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.080]  British sovereigns are at 444
[37:16.080 --> 37:18.080]  Alex that American dream video
[37:18.080 --> 37:20.080]  I was listening to a show on the way in
[37:20.080 --> 37:23.080]  they're talking about well why don't we just pay the principal off
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.080]  are we just talking about the interest on debt
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.080]  you can't pay the principal off it'll cause an economic crisis
[37:29.080 --> 37:32.080]  it'll cause the depression we'd like you've never seen before
[37:32.080 --> 37:34.080]  because we have to continue to go into debt
[37:34.080 --> 37:36.080]  because it comes through the bank
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.080]  as simple as that you need to have this American dream video
[37:40.080 --> 37:43.080]  people are crazy not to order this thing
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.080]  right now $85 gets you two silver dollars
[37:46.080 --> 37:49.080]  you know what's happening in the silver market right now
[37:49.080 --> 37:53.080]  you get the video and it's like a presentation that's entertaining
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.080]  at the same time you understand the system by the time it's done
[37:56.080 --> 37:58.080]  and you're going to be able to hand it off to your friends
[37:58.080 --> 38:00.080]  that they'll want to watch it too
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.080]  just because it's that kind of entertainment
[38:02.080 --> 38:04.080]  and you know it's like that
[38:04.080 --> 38:07.080]  I don't know it's one of the best tools I've found
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.080]  to wake up people that I have out there
[38:10.080 --> 38:12.080]  I want everybody listening to me order it
[38:12.080 --> 38:14.080]  and Ted because of inflation
[38:14.080 --> 38:16.080]  real inflation and commodities going up
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.080]  thieves, strip, live copper wiring
[38:18.080 --> 38:20.080]  from 14 schools in town
[38:20.080 --> 38:21.080]  I see this every day
[38:21.080 --> 38:23.080]  start of school you're threatened
[38:23.080 --> 38:24.080]  two men are resident for stealing
[38:24.080 --> 38:26.080]  guardrails from roadway
[38:26.080 --> 38:28.080]  thieves ransacked DC firehouse
[38:28.080 --> 38:30.080]  and meanwhile the government's telling us
[38:30.080 --> 38:32.080]  inflation's not up or not in depression
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.080]  and crime isn't up
[38:33.080 --> 38:35.080]  I mean there's robberies happening
[38:35.080 --> 38:37.080]  at coffee shops I go to
[38:37.080 --> 38:39.080]  restaurants I mean here in Austin
[38:39.080 --> 38:41.080]  there is crime exploding
[38:41.080 --> 38:43.080]  they're raising taxes laying off cops
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.080]  the cops that are left or right in tickets
[38:45.080 --> 38:47.080]  for revenue generation
[38:47.080 --> 38:49.080]  this country is going to hell in a handbasket
[38:49.080 --> 38:51.080]  and Obama's answer is
[38:51.080 --> 38:53.080]  go deeper into debt with the bankers
[38:53.080 --> 38:55.080]  by signing on to their derivatives
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.080]  now we've got the deal where you get two silver dollars
[38:57.080 --> 38:59.080]  the free book and free video and shipping
[38:59.080 --> 39:00.080]  that's an insane deal
[39:00.080 --> 39:02.080]  folks should get the
[39:02.080 --> 39:04.080]  American dream packages it's called
[39:04.080 --> 39:06.080]  that's the name of the film
[39:06.080 --> 39:08.080]  but what are some of the gold and silver coins
[39:08.080 --> 39:10.080]  that we're going to James Dillingpole
[39:10.080 --> 39:12.080]  what are some of the other special radio listener
[39:12.080 --> 39:14.080]  specials that you're going to hold through Sunday night
[39:14.080 --> 39:16.080]  well very popular is
[39:16.080 --> 39:18.080]  the American Eagle right now currently at
[39:18.080 --> 39:20.080]  1744 the bags of
[39:20.080 --> 39:22.080]  survival dimes they're the
[39:22.080 --> 39:24.080]  old junk sober bags they're currently right now
[39:24.080 --> 39:26.080]  at $3,083
[39:26.080 --> 39:28.080]  you gotta realize it almost takes
[39:28.080 --> 39:30.080]  31 dimes old new dimes
[39:30.080 --> 39:32.080]  to buy one constitutional
[39:32.080 --> 39:34.080]  silver dime now that's where that's how bad
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.080]  things are getting there's a lot of things
[39:36.080 --> 39:38.080]  that I have right now I would
[39:38.080 --> 39:40.080]  just call the British sovereigns of the Franks
[39:40.080 --> 39:42.080]  are nice because they're small and they're
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.080]  you know it's it's more of a smaller piece
[39:44.080 --> 39:46.080]  of gold you can use to trade for groceries
[39:46.080 --> 39:48.080]  this type of thing the big one ounce coins
[39:48.080 --> 39:50.080]  I mean right now they're at 1,700 bucks
[39:50.080 --> 39:52.080]  Alex when we first started working on them
[39:52.080 --> 39:54.080]  they're closer to 200 you know back then
[39:54.080 --> 39:56.080]  it you know you could buy
[39:56.080 --> 39:58.080]  it bought a lot less now it buys a lot
[39:58.080 --> 40:00.080]  more you need fractional pieces so
[40:00.080 --> 40:02.080]  probably the Frank at 354
[40:02.080 --> 40:04.080]  is the best buy
[40:04.080 --> 40:06.080]  all right Jed well the toll free number for folks to
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.080]  call to take advantage of this deal is

[40:32.080 --> 40:34.080]  thank you so much Ted Anderson yeah thanks
[40:34.080 --> 40:36.080]  Alex you bet oh Ted I almost forgot
[40:36.080 --> 40:38.080]  so what is gold exactly right now I know
[40:38.080 --> 40:40.080]  it soared to all-time records again today
[40:40.080 --> 40:42.080]  breaking its records of last week but
[40:42.080 --> 40:44.080]  what is it right now
[40:44.080 --> 40:46.080]  well let me just refresh you real quick I'll tell you
[40:46.080 --> 40:48.080]  where it's at we're presently right now

[40:50.080 --> 40:52.080]  1624
[40:52.080 --> 40:54.080]  and it's seen a high today so far of
[40:54.080 --> 40:56.080]  1633-80
[40:56.080 --> 40:58.080]  never seen that price before yet this is the highest
[40:58.080 --> 41:00.080]  it's ever been all right thank you Ted Anderson
[41:00.080 --> 41:02.080]  okay shifting gears for the balance
[41:02.080 --> 41:04.080]  of the hour I'm gonna be honest I can barely
[41:04.080 --> 41:06.080]  think right now after reading this ATF
[41:06.080 --> 41:07.080]  letter
[41:07.080 --> 41:09.080]  where did my ATF letter go I mean I just
[41:09.080 --> 41:11.080]  want to run out of here and go shoot a special video
[41:11.080 --> 41:13.080]  and write a news article about this because this is
[41:13.080 --> 41:15.080]  so incredible but that's coming up we've also
[41:15.080 --> 41:17.080]  got Al Jorgensen
[41:17.080 --> 41:19.080]  the founder and head of

[41:31.080 --> 41:33.080]  hour coming up we'll cover the waterfront with him
[41:33.080 --> 41:35.080]  but going to
[41:35.080 --> 41:37.080]  London Telegraph writer
[41:37.080 --> 41:39.080]  best-selling author his new books out watermelons
[41:39.080 --> 41:41.080]  the green movements true colors I would call them
[41:41.080 --> 41:43.080]  banker melons because they're communists that
[41:43.080 --> 41:45.080]  communize your wealth to give to the offshore banks
[41:45.080 --> 41:47.080]  but it's always a sorrows behind every great
[41:47.080 --> 41:49.080]  coming
[41:49.080 --> 41:51.080]  but polar bear gate and I've got a report here
[41:51.080 --> 41:53.080]  there's three other big breaking things that
[41:53.080 --> 41:55.080]  show total fraud and lies
[41:55.080 --> 41:57.080]  I mean basically they say
[41:57.080 --> 41:59.080]  give all your money to Al Gore and kill yourself
[41:59.080 --> 42:01.080]  and the earth will be saved so Al Gore can
[42:01.080 --> 42:03.080]  have you know some more 20,000 square foot houses
[42:03.080 --> 42:05.080]  but this polar bear gate goes right
[42:05.080 --> 42:07.080]  to the White House
[42:07.080 --> 42:09.080]  and I want to break it down I mean you know the hoax
[42:09.080 --> 42:11.080]  that polar bears can't swim well now it's that
[42:11.080 --> 42:13.080]  they can't swim long distances and
[42:13.080 --> 42:15.080]  this has all been exposed as a calculated
[42:15.080 --> 42:17.080]  fraud and James Dillingpole
[42:17.080 --> 42:19.080]  joining us break it down please sir
[42:19.080 --> 42:21.080]  from this point of view
[42:21.080 --> 42:23.080]  this is a guy called Charles
[42:23.080 --> 42:25.080]  Nornit
[42:25.080 --> 42:27.080]  who works for the Bureau
[42:27.080 --> 42:29.080]  of Ocean Energy Management
[42:29.080 --> 42:31.080]  Regulation and Enforcement
[42:31.080 --> 42:33.080]  and this guy
[42:33.080 --> 42:35.080]  has been in charge of a budget
[42:35.080 --> 42:37.080]  worth around
[42:37.080 --> 42:39.080]  50 million dollars
[42:39.080 --> 42:41.080]  now how did he get
[42:41.080 --> 42:43.080]  to be put in charge of this budget of 50 million
[42:43.080 --> 42:45.080]  dollars
[42:45.080 --> 42:47.080]  basically in
[42:47.080 --> 42:49.080]  2004
[42:49.080 --> 42:51.080]  he came up with this amazing
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.080]  report which showed that
[42:53.080 --> 42:55.080]  these polar bears had drowned
[42:55.080 --> 42:57.080]  apparently
[42:57.080 --> 42:59.080]  they'd been exhausted by swimming
[42:59.080 --> 43:01.080]  too far away
[43:01.080 --> 43:03.080]  from the landmass
[43:03.080 --> 43:05.080]  and it was all somehow to do
[43:05.080 --> 43:07.080]  with man-made global warming
[43:07.080 --> 43:09.080]  and this story
[43:09.080 --> 43:11.080]  was picked up by Al Gore
[43:11.080 --> 43:13.080]  he remember how he used it in
[43:13.080 --> 43:15.080]  his propaganda film
[43:15.080 --> 43:17.080]  Reunion Truth
[43:17.080 --> 43:19.080]  there was that graphic of a drowning polar bear
[43:19.080 --> 43:21.080]  again killed because
[43:21.080 --> 43:23.080]  of man's greed and selfishness
[43:23.080 --> 43:25.080]  and global warming
[43:25.080 --> 43:27.080]  and then it led
[43:27.080 --> 43:29.080]  to the polar bear
[43:29.080 --> 43:31.080]  being declared
[43:31.080 --> 43:33.080]  a threatened species
[43:33.080 --> 43:35.080]  so this guy Charles Nornit
[43:35.080 --> 43:37.080]  was instrumental
[43:37.080 --> 43:39.080]  in having the polar bear
[43:39.080 --> 43:41.080]  declared the poster child
[43:41.080 --> 43:43.080]  of the global warming movement
[43:43.080 --> 43:45.080]  so it was the symbol
[43:45.080 --> 43:47.080]  of everything we were doing wrong
[43:47.080 --> 43:49.080]  and even though in Arctic areas
[43:49.080 --> 43:51.080]  there are numbers of what doubled in the last 50 years
[43:51.080 --> 43:53.080]  and they're known as vicious
[43:53.080 --> 43:55.080]  1200 pound rats
[43:55.080 --> 43:57.080]  that are just running around everywhere
[43:57.080 --> 43:59.080]  it's true
[43:59.080 --> 44:01.080]  but in the last 50 years
[44:01.080 --> 44:03.080]  the polar bear population
[44:03.080 --> 44:05.080]  has increased 5 fold
[44:05.080 --> 44:07.080]  I'm sorry
[44:07.080 --> 44:09.080]  it was about 5,050 years ago
[44:09.080 --> 44:11.080]  it is now estimated to be around
[44:11.080 --> 44:13.080]  now why do you not call that
[44:13.080 --> 44:15.080]  an endangered species
[44:15.080 --> 44:17.080]  I call that an infestation
[44:17.080 --> 44:19.080]  I call that almost a vermin
[44:19.080 --> 44:21.080]  I call that a polar bear problem
[44:21.080 --> 44:23.080]  but no way
[44:23.080 --> 44:25.080]  is the polar bear in any day
[44:25.080 --> 44:27.080]  it's the same thing with bald eagles
[44:27.080 --> 44:29.080]  they teach kids they're almost dead
[44:29.080 --> 44:31.080]  you go on a cruise to Alaska
[44:31.080 --> 44:33.080]  and I think the bald eagles can eat bird
[44:33.080 --> 44:35.080]  but they take you to the dump on tours
[44:35.080 --> 44:37.080]  where you watch them eating their favorite food
[44:37.080 --> 44:39.080]  diapers
[44:39.080 --> 44:41.080]  in that tree eating all the fish
[44:41.080 --> 44:43.080]  it's just bald eagles
[44:43.080 --> 44:45.080]  growing up in Dallas there's bald eagles all over the place
[44:45.080 --> 44:47.080]  but no there's no bald eagles
[44:47.080 --> 44:49.080]  give Al Gore all your money
[44:49.080 --> 44:51.080]  Lord Rothschild needs it
[44:51.080 --> 44:53.080]  I think you know Alex
[44:53.080 --> 44:55.080]  that the environmental movement
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.080]  has a pretty good record of playing
[44:57.080 --> 44:59.080]  fast and loose with the facts
[44:59.080 --> 45:01.080]  on endangered species
[45:01.080 --> 45:03.080]  well they're also constantly been caught over and over again in the US
[45:03.080 --> 45:05.080]  dumping species
[45:05.080 --> 45:07.080]  that aren't endangered overall
[45:07.080 --> 45:09.080]  and they are endangered
[45:09.080 --> 45:11.080]  and they've been caught over and over again releasing animals
[45:11.080 --> 45:13.080]  and then finding them
[45:13.080 --> 45:15.080]  well you've got your Texas land
[45:15.080 --> 45:17.080]  haven't you which has been causing trouble
[45:17.080 --> 45:19.080]  we have a cave bug here
[45:19.080 --> 45:21.080]  used to steal hundreds of thousands of acres
[45:21.080 --> 45:23.080]  from private citizens
[45:23.080 --> 45:25.080]  and then the green fascist
[45:25.080 --> 45:27.080]  then turned around years after once they got the land
[45:27.080 --> 45:29.080]  and sold it and own it personally
[45:29.080 --> 45:31.080]  they are absolute supreme rulers of this area
[45:31.080 --> 45:33.080]  there's the snail data
[45:33.080 --> 45:35.080]  there's the california delta smelt
[45:35.080 --> 45:37.080]  there's the spotted owl
[45:37.080 --> 45:39.080]  that stopped any forestation
[45:39.080 --> 45:41.080]  any deforestation
[45:41.080 --> 45:43.080]  happening
[45:43.080 --> 45:45.080]  on the Pacific coast
[45:45.080 --> 45:47.080]  you know
[45:47.080 --> 45:49.080]  these are animals
[45:49.080 --> 45:51.080]  are used by the environmental movement
[45:51.080 --> 45:53.080]  as a way of
[45:53.080 --> 45:55.080]  essentially
[45:55.080 --> 45:57.080]  in their war against the capitalist system
[45:57.080 --> 45:59.080]  and this is exactly what happened
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.080]  in Alaska
[46:01.080 --> 46:03.080]  well it's a war against anyone's private property
[46:03.080 --> 46:05.080]  that isn't theirs
[46:05.080 --> 46:07.080]  they're exempt from all the rules like general electric
[46:07.080 --> 46:09.080]  now let's talk about polar bear gate
[46:09.080 --> 46:11.080]  because this goes right to the heart of them
[46:11.080 --> 46:13.080]  well I think what's interesting about this case
[46:13.080 --> 46:15.080]  is number one
[46:15.080 --> 46:17.080]  how is it that this guy
[46:17.080 --> 46:19.080]  is being
[46:19.080 --> 46:21.080]  prosecuted or investigated at least
[46:21.080 --> 46:23.080]  you know this guy works
[46:23.080 --> 46:25.080]  for a federal agency under the
[46:25.080 --> 46:27.080]  Obama administration
[46:27.080 --> 46:29.080]  you would have thought that
[46:29.080 --> 46:31.080]  any guy working for a federal
[46:31.080 --> 46:33.080]  administration
[46:33.080 --> 46:35.080]  who comes up with a story
[46:35.080 --> 46:37.080]  showing that man is evil
[46:37.080 --> 46:39.080]  and we're endangering the environment
[46:39.080 --> 46:41.080]  he would have thought he'd be given at the very least
[46:41.080 --> 46:43.080]  a congressional medal of honor
[46:43.080 --> 46:45.080]  for his service to the cause
[46:45.080 --> 46:47.080]  of green lunacy
[46:47.080 --> 46:49.080]  but don't forget the Obama administration
[46:49.080 --> 46:51.080]  is in it up to the hilt
[46:51.080 --> 46:53.080]  with eco fascist values
[46:53.080 --> 46:55.080]  you know you've got people like Lisa Jackson
[46:55.080 --> 46:57.080]  at the EPA
[46:57.080 --> 46:59.080]  you've got Carol Browner
[46:59.080 --> 47:01.080]  this is John Holdren
[47:01.080 --> 47:03.080]  you've got all these crazy eco loons
[47:03.080 --> 47:05.080]  in the Obama administration
[47:05.080 --> 47:07.080]  so what is this guy doing being
[47:07.080 --> 47:09.080]  prosecuted
[47:09.080 --> 47:11.080]  I think it can only mean
[47:11.080 --> 47:13.080]  or rather investigate it
[47:13.080 --> 47:15.080]  it can only mean that whatever this guy has done
[47:15.080 --> 47:17.080]  it is really a quite serious
[47:17.080 --> 47:19.080]  case of fraud
[47:19.080 --> 47:21.080]  this is not a guy whose innocent
[47:21.080 --> 47:23.080]  innocent research has been
[47:23.080 --> 47:25.080]  corrupted and misreported
[47:25.080 --> 47:27.080]  distorted by the media
[47:27.080 --> 47:29.080]  this guy must be guilty
[47:29.080 --> 47:31.080]  of some kind of serious
[47:31.080 --> 47:33.080]  malfeasance
[47:33.080 --> 47:35.080]  now I've been looking at the interview
[47:35.080 --> 47:37.080]  transcript of
[47:39.080 --> 47:41.080]  the inspector general
[47:41.080 --> 47:43.080]  who's been investigating his case
[47:43.080 --> 47:45.080]  and it's quite obvious
[47:45.080 --> 47:47.080]  reading the transcript that this guy
[47:47.080 --> 47:49.080]  Charles Maudit has been
[47:49.080 --> 47:51.080]  guilty of the most
[47:51.080 --> 47:53.080]  outrageous
[47:53.080 --> 47:55.080]  junk science you know he's taken the case
[47:55.080 --> 47:57.080]  of these bears
[47:57.080 --> 47:59.080]  these polar bears that he may or may not
[47:59.080 --> 48:01.080]  have seen
[48:01.080 --> 48:03.080]  drowning from an aeroplane
[48:03.080 --> 48:05.080]  and he has three polar bears
[48:05.080 --> 48:07.080]  and he's used these three polar bears
[48:07.080 --> 48:09.080]  he's extrapolated from this
[48:09.080 --> 48:11.080]  that the polar bear
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.080]  is in grave danger
[48:13.080 --> 48:15.080]  and remember here
[48:15.080 --> 48:17.080]  we've got this guy getting a budget of
[48:17.080 --> 48:19.080]  50 million pounds
[48:19.080 --> 48:21.080]  and so dollars to play with
[48:21.080 --> 48:23.080]  now if you or I went and robbed a bank
[48:23.080 --> 48:25.080]  robbed 50 million dollars
[48:25.080 --> 48:27.080]  from a bank
[48:27.080 --> 48:29.080]  I think we know what would happen to us
[48:29.080 --> 48:31.080]  yet in the environmental
[48:31.080 --> 48:33.080]  movement in the wonderful
[48:33.080 --> 48:35.080]  boondoggle of federal funding
[48:35.080 --> 48:37.080]  it's perfectly okay to use
[48:37.080 --> 48:39.080]  junk science
[48:39.080 --> 48:41.080]  in order to create a scare story
[48:41.080 --> 48:43.080]  in effect to be
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.080]  steal from the taxpayer
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.080]  50 million bucks to be wasted
[48:47.080 --> 48:49.080]  on further eco research
[48:49.080 --> 48:51.080]  that's somehow okay
[48:51.080 --> 48:53.080]  I didn't think so
[48:53.080 --> 48:55.080]  well
[48:55.080 --> 48:57.080]  what
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.080]  where does it go from here
[48:59.080 --> 49:01.080]  well I hope
[49:01.080 --> 49:03.080]  I hope that this is a sign
[49:03.080 --> 49:05.080]  that you know we've seen
[49:05.080 --> 49:07.080]  the other evidence of NASA report as well
[49:07.080 --> 49:09.080]  I hope this is yet further
[49:09.080 --> 49:11.080]  a further sign
[49:11.080 --> 49:13.080]  that the green
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.080]  Ponzi scheme is
[49:15.080 --> 49:17.080]  finally collapsing
[49:17.080 --> 49:19.080]  you know if this guy is being
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.080]  investigated but it suggests to me
[49:21.080 --> 49:23.080]  that people are starting
[49:23.080 --> 49:25.080]  to run scared you know people are starting
[49:25.080 --> 49:27.080]  to think hang on a second
[49:27.080 --> 49:29.080]  we cannot get away with this scam
[49:29.080 --> 49:31.080]  any longer we are going to be found out
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.080]  so we may as well
[49:33.080 --> 49:35.080]  start prosecuting the bad guys
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.080]  now before we get
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.080]  blamed for it ourselves so people
[49:39.080 --> 49:41.080]  from these funds cover their backs
[49:41.080 --> 49:43.080]  doing their due diligence
[49:43.080 --> 49:45.080]  writing wrongs while they still
[49:45.080 --> 49:47.080]  care
[49:47.080 --> 49:49.080]  now there's a bunch
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.080]  of other scandals going on right now
[49:51.080 --> 49:53.080]  NASA's come out with data showing
[49:53.080 --> 49:55.080]  that the earth is offgassing the heat
[49:55.080 --> 49:57.080]  and that the models are frauds we already knew
[49:57.080 --> 49:59.080]  that they've been caught fixing the models
[49:59.080 --> 50:01.080]  and setting them up over and over again
[50:01.080 --> 50:03.080]  you've got the whole situation
[50:03.080 --> 50:05.080]  at the Hadron Collider where it showed
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.080]  that basically the other studies
[50:07.080 --> 50:09.080]  that it's the sun driving warming
[50:09.080 --> 50:11.080]  and the different particles
[50:11.080 --> 50:13.080]  that's sitting into the atmosphere forming cloud
[50:13.080 --> 50:15.080]  nuclei that's come out there's one other
[50:15.080 --> 50:17.080]  scandal I mean their entire
[50:17.080 --> 50:19.080]  thing is being rounded but they don't care
[50:19.080 --> 50:21.080]  they're all over the news holding up penguins
[50:21.080 --> 50:23.080]  and polar bears saying they're all dying
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.080]  and give your money to Al Gore and Lord Rothschild
[50:25.080 --> 50:27.080]  so they're going to have more jets and yachts
[50:27.080 --> 50:29.080]  and more royal trains or we're all dead
[50:29.080 --> 50:31.080]  yeah although you know
[50:31.080 --> 50:33.080]  I sometimes wonder whether
[50:33.080 --> 50:35.080]  every time we
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.080]  make a big deal about the new research
[50:37.080 --> 50:39.080]  showing that their
[50:39.080 --> 50:41.080]  theory is bunk I think
[50:41.080 --> 50:43.080]  in a way we're playing their game
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.080]  because they want to persuade us
[50:45.080 --> 50:47.080]  that this is an issue that can be resolved
[50:47.080 --> 50:49.080]  through science and actually
[50:49.080 --> 50:51.080]  we know that this
[50:51.080 --> 50:53.080]  has nothing to do with science
[50:53.080 --> 50:55.080]  this is a political process
[50:55.080 --> 50:57.080]  this is a bunch of hardcore people that want your property
[50:57.080 --> 50:59.080]  and to run your life we'll be right back
[50:59.080 --> 51:01.080]  that's what it's about that's what
[51:01.080 --> 51:03.080]  hey Bill pick up line 3
[51:03.080 --> 51:05.080]  it's Brian hey Brian what's up
[51:05.080 --> 51:07.080]  thanks hey Bill I just
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.080]  received my shipment of the safety net
[51:09.080 --> 51:11.080]  our full year emergency food system
[51:11.080 --> 51:13.080]  I can't tell you how great it feels
[51:13.080 --> 51:15.080]  to personally not have to worry anymore
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.080]  especially with the growing threats
[51:17.080 --> 51:19.080]  to our everyday food supply
[51:19.080 --> 51:21.080]  Brian not only are you getting
[51:21.080 --> 51:23.080]  4,320
[51:23.080 --> 51:25.080]  nutritionally dense delicious food
[51:25.080 --> 51:27.080]  servings but the individual serving
[51:27.080 --> 51:29.080]  price is just $1.43 per meal
[51:29.080 --> 51:31.080]  it's truly great tasting food
[51:31.080 --> 51:33.080]  and amazing prices
[51:33.080 --> 51:35.080]  the variety is also a huge bonus bill
[51:35.080 --> 51:37.080]  it's like having access to a full menu
[51:37.080 --> 51:39.080]  of impressive food
[51:39.080 --> 51:41.080]  the variety is a safety net for those
[51:41.080 --> 51:43.080]  worried about the coming food shortages
[51:43.080 --> 51:45.080]  and how their families can prepare
[51:45.080 --> 51:47.080]  it's great knowing I'm covered for the future
[51:47.080 --> 51:49.080]  but I gotta go Bill and get all this food unloaded
[51:49.080 --> 51:51.080]  with scorching heat devastating
[51:51.080 --> 51:53.080]  US cropland there's never been a better time

[51:59.080 --> 52:01.080]  today this is Alex Jones
[52:01.080 --> 52:03.080]  with 5 good reasons you should consider
[52:03.080 --> 52:05.080]  buying a solar power generator
[52:05.080 --> 52:07.080]  number one new climate legislation
[52:07.080 --> 52:09.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill
[52:09.080 --> 52:11.080]  number two our new energies are
[52:11.080 --> 52:13.080]  wants to control how much power
[52:13.080 --> 52:15.080]  your electric company allows you to have
[52:15.080 --> 52:17.080]  it's true total government control
[52:17.080 --> 52:19.080]  of electricity in the name of smart grid
[52:19.080 --> 52:21.080]  technology is coming
[52:21.080 --> 52:23.080]  number three in some areas of the country
[52:23.080 --> 52:25.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[52:25.080 --> 52:27.080]  and now new socialist legislation
[52:27.080 --> 52:29.080]  is only compounding the problem
[52:29.080 --> 52:31.080]  number four dangerous weather is always
[52:31.080 --> 52:33.080]  a threat to local grids
[52:33.080 --> 52:35.080]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[52:35.080 --> 52:37.080]  due to related onages
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.080]  number five a solar power generator
[52:39.080 --> 52:41.080]  provides powerful backup insurance
[52:41.080 --> 52:43.080]  and peace of mind folks I really believe
[52:43.080 --> 52:45.080]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[52:45.080 --> 52:47.080]  from science one of my oldest sponsors

[54:13.080 --> 54:19.080]  I hurt myself today
[54:19.080 --> 54:24.080]  to see if I still feel
[54:24.080 --> 54:29.080]  I focus on the pain
[54:29.080 --> 54:35.080]  the only thing that's real
[54:35.080 --> 54:40.080]  the needle tears the hole
[54:40.080 --> 54:45.080]  the old familiar sting
[54:45.080 --> 54:50.080]  try to kill it all away
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.080]  but I remember everything
[54:56.080 --> 55:02.080]  what have I become
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.080]  my sweetest friend
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.080]  everyone I know
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.080]  goes away in the air
[55:15.080 --> 55:20.080]  okay going back to James Dillingpole
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.080]  finishing your point James
[55:23.080 --> 55:25.080]  you're saying don't even debate this on science
[55:25.080 --> 55:27.080]  because they've been proven to be total
[55:27.080 --> 55:29.080]  fraudsters they're internal emails
[55:29.080 --> 55:31.080]  it's all I mean look
[55:31.080 --> 55:33.080]  no carbon taxes on China building
[55:33.080 --> 55:35.080]  three coal power plants a week
[55:35.080 --> 55:37.080]  and then the US can't have three a year
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.080]  and GE's moving everything to China
[55:39.080 --> 55:41.080]  I mean this is monopoly man stuff
[55:41.080 --> 55:43.080]  I mean they're just shutting us down
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.080]  because they've decided to move their operations to China
[55:46.080 --> 55:48.080]  I mean it's just robber bearing behavior
[55:48.080 --> 55:50.080]  and then Al Gore and all these other people
[55:50.080 --> 55:53.080]  are just disgusting scumbags
[55:53.080 --> 55:57.080]  the science is a complete red herring
[55:57.080 --> 56:02.080]  because the fact is that organizations like the IPCC
[56:02.080 --> 56:04.080]  have arranged it in such a way
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.080]  that real scientific debate
[56:07.080 --> 56:09.080]  isn't allowed to take place
[56:09.080 --> 56:11.080]  in fact what they want now
[56:11.080 --> 56:13.080]  is to create a situation where there is
[56:13.080 --> 56:15.080]  no null hypothesis
[56:15.080 --> 56:18.080]  in other words the burden of proof
[56:18.080 --> 56:20.080]  this is what Kevin Tremberg says
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.080]  the burden of truth should now be
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.080]  on us evil climate change deniers
[56:26.080 --> 56:29.080]  to prove that climate dangerous man made
[56:29.080 --> 56:31.080]  climate change is not happening
[56:31.080 --> 56:34.080]  well you can't prove a negative
[56:34.080 --> 56:36.080]  so even though every day
[56:36.080 --> 56:39.080]  spectacular new evidence emerges
[56:39.080 --> 56:43.080]  that the man made global warming theory
[56:43.080 --> 56:49.080]  is just flawed and entirely untrustworthy
[56:49.080 --> 56:51.080]  no matter how new evidence comes through
[56:51.080 --> 56:54.080]  you still have this great big machine
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.080]  this political machine
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.080]  this business machine of rent seeking
[56:59.080 --> 57:01.080]  rent seeking corporatists
[57:01.080 --> 57:06.080]  the machine involving all these green NGOs
[57:06.080 --> 57:08.080]  like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.080]  you know it's going to be very very hard
[57:11.080 --> 57:15.080]  to derail this massive massive gravy train
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.080]  which is rolling all along
[57:17.080 --> 57:19.080]  there is so much money to be made out of
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.080]  it's a mafia system where you've got to pay them
[57:21.080 --> 57:23.080]  a cut of everything and then all their insiders
[57:23.080 --> 57:26.080]  are exempt and then meanwhile real environmental crises
[57:26.080 --> 57:31.080]  like all these trans genetic part human part animal clones
[57:31.080 --> 57:33.080]  oh that's not an issue just Dillingpole
[57:33.080 --> 57:36.080]  why are you so selfish why don't you just kill yourself
[57:36.080 --> 57:39.080]  and give your money to Al Gore to save the penguins
[57:39.080 --> 57:40.080]  yeah that's exactly it
[57:40.080 --> 57:42.080]  Dillingpole why are you so selfish
[57:42.080 --> 57:43.080]  Jones why are you so selfish
[57:43.080 --> 57:46.080]  they always have to make it personal
[57:46.080 --> 57:48.080]  it always has to be about people making
[57:48.080 --> 57:51.080]  deliberately wrong lifestyle choices
[57:51.080 --> 57:53.080]  they've got the moral high ground
[57:53.080 --> 57:55.080]  is bloodsucking Nazi maggots
[57:55.080 --> 58:00.080]  yeah it's like apparently you and I
[58:00.080 --> 58:03.080]  and your listeners we secretly know the truth
[58:03.080 --> 58:05.080]  but we lie about it because we're so selfish
[58:05.080 --> 58:07.080]  I mean this is just not the case at all
[58:07.080 --> 58:09.080]  we just happen to have a handle
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.080]  on some kind of scientific reality
[58:12.080 --> 58:15.080]  a reality which the warmest have abandoned
[58:15.080 --> 58:17.080]  a very very long time ago
[58:17.080 --> 58:19.080]  well James you know what they did
[58:19.080 --> 58:21.080]  at Copenhagen two years ago
[58:21.080 --> 58:23.080]  they had a ruling that the sun does not heat the earth
[58:23.080 --> 58:25.080]  and they said so and everybody knows
[58:25.080 --> 58:26.080]  the sun doesn't heat the earth
[58:26.080 --> 58:28.080]  you're a freak man okay
[58:28.080 --> 58:30.080]  and I want you to apologize
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.080]  I apologize the listeners for that sick person
[58:32.080 --> 58:34.080]  who thinks the sun affects the earth
[58:34.080 --> 58:36.080]  James Dillingpole I want to have you back soon
[58:36.080 --> 58:38.080]  to talk about your new book
[58:38.080 --> 58:40.080]  thank you for joining us
[58:44.080 --> 58:48.080]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:50.080 --> 58:52.080]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[58:52.080 --> 58:54.080]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:54.080 --> 58:57.080]  number one new climate legislation
[58:57.080 --> 58:59.080]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.080 --> 59:01.080]  number two our new energies are
[59:01.080 --> 59:03.080]  wants to control how much power
[59:03.080 --> 59:05.080]  your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.080 --> 59:07.080]  it's true total government control
[59:07.080 --> 59:09.080]  of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:09.080 --> 59:11.080]  technology is coming
[59:11.080 --> 59:13.080]  number three in some areas of the country
[59:13.080 --> 59:15.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:15.080 --> 59:17.080]  and now new socialist legislation
[59:17.080 --> 59:19.080]  is only compounding the problem
[59:19.080 --> 59:21.080]  number four dangerous weather is always
[59:21.080 --> 59:23.080]  a threat to local grids
[59:23.080 --> 59:25.080]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[59:25.080 --> 59:27.080]  from weather related onages
[59:27.080 --> 59:29.080]  number five a solar power generator provides
[59:29.080 --> 59:31.080]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[59:31.080 --> 59:33.080]  folks I really believe in the solar powered
[59:33.080 --> 59:35.080]  generators offered by Solutions from Science
[59:35.080 --> 59:37.080]  one of my oldest sponsors

[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.080]  Big Brother
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.080]  mainstream media
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.080]  government cover-ups
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.080]  you want answers?
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.080]  well so does he
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.080]  on the GCN radio network
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.080]  and now live from
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.080]  Austin Texas
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.080]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.080]  alright we're scheduled to have
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.080]  Al Jorgensen the founder of ministry
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.080]  super politically aware
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.080]  I don't know even what you call it
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.080]  I mean the granddaddies have so much of the techno
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.080]  trance
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.080]  rock music
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.080]  and talk about the new world order
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.080]  9-11 inside job all of it he's coming up
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.080]  the next segment
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.080]  look
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.080]  I don't have words to describe this
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.080]  when Bob Chapman saw I'm going to get more into it
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.080]  but I've got Paul Watson
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.080]  doing an article on this and Aaron Dykes
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080]  and I'm pretty distracted right now
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.080]  I'm going to be honest with you
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.080]  because this is such tyranny this is so hardcore
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.080]  the mind manipulation
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.080]  that's been done even on gun owners
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.080]  and the second amendment
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.080]  self-defense lobby is incredible
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.080]  ok
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.080]  a year ago we found out
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.080]  this is to California they were quietly
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.080]  ordering by word of mouth
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.080]  ATF coming into office
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.080]  saying if you sell two or more
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.080]  rifles
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.080]  anything above a 22 what they call high power
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080]  or semi-auto
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.080]  and by the way gun buyers when you finally
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.080]  get into a gun shop I tend to buy more than one
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.080]  in fact that's why I don't get near gun shops
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.080]  but you buy a couple guns
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.080]  you already go through the FBI instant check
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080]  they already know what's going on
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.080]  how many guns
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.080]  you're not a felon
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.080]  and you get the gun
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.080]  and that's out of control
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.080]  they always expand the gun laws
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.080]  so A they already are running the check
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.080]  so
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.080]  why is the ATF doing this
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.080]  this is the nature of tyranny
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.080]  if Obama could shut down power plants without congressional
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.080]  approval he's a dictator
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.080]  he can launch wars without congressional approval
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080]  he's a dictator if he can raise debt ceiling
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.080]  what she's talking about doing he's a dictator
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.080]  and it's not that he's even a dictator
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.080]  it's once
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.080]  all the power is centered in one place
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.080]  so and these points aren't even
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.080]  in A through Z
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.080]  aren't even the most important in order
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.080]  so they're doing this
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.080]  where they're basically turning you into a confidential
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080]  informant and this is what the ATF
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.080]  did in Arizona and other states
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.080]  they would come in
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.080]  and they would say you're going to sell guns to these guys that are coming in
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080]  they're going to take them to Mexico
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080]  they're like I don't want to do that and they say we're the ATF
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.080]  do what you're told so they could ship the guns
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.080]  into Mexico and now
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.080]  come out with this program
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.080]  to harass people that are buying guns
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.080]  to go after people that are going
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.080]  to get guns
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.080]  so let me just calmly go to the points here right now
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080]  A, there isn't a law
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.080]  and the government's doing this outside of law
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.080]  and did it by word of mouth
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.080]  now we've got the letter they issued July 12th
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.080]  to gun shops from Texas
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.080]  to California
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.080]  the entire southwest
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.080]  so there's
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.080]  that issue
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080]  that this was all done
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.080]  outside of law
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.080]  and that if they can set the precedent to come in
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.080]  and order you to do things
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080]  and command you in the letter
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.080]  with no law
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.080]  the sky's the limit they've set the precedent
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.080]  that they're dictatorial
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.080]  it's called authoritarian dictatorial
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.080]  that's what dictatorship is
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.080]  secondarily as I said
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080]  they already know that you don't have a criminal background
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.080]  and that you bought these guns
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.080]  that's the FBI instant check
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080]  it's self-unconstitutional but see it's always more
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.080]  so they know that
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.080]  and
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.080]  there's also the fact that
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.080]  they're telling people by word of mouth
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.080]  don't talk about this
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080]  so it's this behind the scenes secret agent type deal
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.080]  and then here's the biggest one
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080]  then they want to chill the second amendment
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080]  they then send ATF
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.080]  and FBI or both
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080]  and I've confirmed this from gun dealers
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.080]  in the office
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.080]  to your house when you bought two rifles
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.080]  and imply that you're a terrorist and evil
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.080]  and put you on a list as part of intimidation
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.080]  and then of course the biggest issue
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080]  remember it's the government that shipped
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.080]  the guns into Mexico
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.080]  to track them back here
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.080]  to then do this program outside of law
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.080]  and remember Obama said earlier in the year
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080]  he's going to do gun control quote by stealth
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.080]  victim disarmament by stealth
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.080]  and that they were going to use
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.080]  outside of law
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.080]  use EPA regulations to shut down power plants
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.080]  same thing and so this is a total
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.080]  dictatorial criminal
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.080]  power grab
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.080]  intimidating people that are buying guns
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.080]  intimidating the gun shops outside of law
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.080]  when it's the government that criminally
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.080]  shipped the guns into Mexico
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.080]  to then cause a crisis and blame the second
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.080]  amendment inside the United States
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.080]  remember Mexico has a total gun ban
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.080]  and they've got one of the highest crime rates in the world
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.080]  so this has all been calculated
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.080]  very very carefully
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.080]  we've got a big gas coming up after the break
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080]  stay with us

[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080]  detergents that give you rashes

[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.080]  tyranny is here
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.080]  the grim future foretold in 1984
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.080]  has become reality
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.080]  it really says that the state is god
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080]  the united states is now recognized globally
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.080]  this film conclusively proves
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080]  the existence of a secret network
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.080]  of police and police

[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080]  obviously i saw
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080]  that album dealing with 9-11 truth
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.080]  and he was wondering how 20
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080]  years ago
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080]  or more now was he talking about the
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.080]  new world order and global
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080]  government and all of these issues
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080]  and get a view on
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.080]  really his political ideas
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080]  and what ministry has really stood
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.080]  for al good to have you here on the
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.080]  show with us
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.080]  we're just broadcasting
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.080]  worldwide there's so much to talk about
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.080]  but you said out of the gates that you
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.080]  have a bone to pick with me so let's
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.080]  get it out here on the table right now
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.080]  because you're rock and roll man
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.080]  rock and roll slap jones around some
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.080]  i'm gonna slap you around too go ahead
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.080]  well i'm sure you will
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080]  but i've been listening all morning
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.080]  and
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.080]  i've been listening to this gold chilling
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.080]  which is very blend beckish
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.080]  because
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080]  okay
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.080]  it's twelve apocalypse whether it's the
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.080]  magnetic shift with a solar flare
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.080]  or an asteroid that the government
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.080]  is telling us that's coming because
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080]  they don't want chaos
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.080]  you really think
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.080]  gold is going to get you through
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.080]  those days
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.080]  so obviously the banking system
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.080]  is done
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080]  after an apocalyptic hell
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.080]  you think that
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.080]  by buying supplies and gold
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.080]  that you're not going to be targeted for
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080]  having gold and having rampaging
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080]  marauders
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.080]  and stacking your house which is what's
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.080]  going to fall into anarchy
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.080]  is going to keep you safe
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.080]  really i think this is just
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080]  another scam
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080]  of just like making money for certain people
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080]  a certain few the gold traders
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080]  unlike
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080]  oh you have to have that as a safety net
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080]  what's the safety net after
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.080]  a post apocalyptic future
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.080]  what is the safety net
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080]  i would say by
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080]  batteries, water and
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080]  maybe a few guns
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.080]  that's your safety net
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.080]  maybe a few guns
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.080]  like a few hundred guns
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.080]  which you've been dealing on
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.080]  this morning with the new ATF rule
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.080]  which
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.080]  okay so just go extra time
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.080]  and buy four underground
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.080]  and two guns
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.080]  twice a week
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.080]  really
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080]  if you want to be prepared for that
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.080]  gold and silver
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.080]  is not the answer
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.080]  who's going to take gold
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.080]  on precious resources
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.080]  when resources are so scarce
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.080]  and there is no banking system
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080]  gold and silver are a farce
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.080]  this is another conspiracy
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080]  to get people to spend money
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080]  to make a select few a lot of money
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080]  alright let me counter
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.080]  that i think that's fair
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080]  let me respond to that Al
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.080]  all i know is
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.080]  i was a silver and gold purchaser
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.080]  before i ever had sponsors
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080]  and i have a sponsor who i know
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080]  has really great deals and that's where i
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080]  buy my gold and silver
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.080]  i bought silver and a lot of what i bought
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080]  was it five six dollars an ounce
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.080]  now it's about forty i bought gold
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080]  a lot of what i have at three hundred four hundred five hundred
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080]  it's at sixteen hundred
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.080]  they're killing the dollar
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080]  hold on hold on
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.080]  that's like saying i shouldn't have kids
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080]  because somebody might hurt them
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080]  or they might die in a car wreck
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.080]  but to say that marauders might come
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.080]  take my guns listen i'm not turning
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.080]  my gold into the government
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080]  i'm not turning anything to marauders
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.080]  i'm gonna kill them i'm gonna kill marauders
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.080]  listen gold can be worthless
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080]  and dollars can be worthless
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.080]  what's gonna be worthwhile is
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.080]  survival techniques if you want to live in that world
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.080]  me i got my gloss nine
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.080]  and i'm gonna
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080]  wait till my food runs out
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.080]  after twenty twelve and i'm gonna put
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.080]  a gloss nine or a burrata to the roof of my mouth
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080]  and have a big party
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080]  and go out in a peaceful way
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.080]  so you really think it's the end of the world
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.080]  i don't think it is
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080]  well i really do
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.080]  and i'm not one of these
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.080]  it's really funny i have a
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.080]  twenty twelve tattoo
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.080]  and i got it
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.080]  like three days before this
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.080]  initial crisis of
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.080]  some sex thing
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080]  like the world was gonna end a few months ago
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.080]  and
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080]  i'm going if the earth starts rumbling
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.080]  i'm gonna go the first thing i'm doing
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080]  is i'm going to the tattoo shop
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080]  and getting a rebate of my twenty twelve tattoos
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.080]  well al now it makes sense
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.080]  if you really think that it's the end of the world
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.080]  then yes
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.080]  well i see that
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.080]  i hate to quote r-e-m
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.080]  but it's the end of the world as we know it
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.080]  and there's no doubt about that
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.080]  well listen we disagree on that
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.080]  al i want to talk about it
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.080]  but that's a pretty bold accusation earlier
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.080]  and i do need to counter it here
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.080]  so you're here you said it and then i want to hear your role
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.080]  because you're here and i want to hear your ideas
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.080]  you're a very interesting person
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.080]  i admire your music and your art
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.080]  but now i understand absolutely
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080]  if you think the world's ending
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.080]  in the next year and a half
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.080]  i don't think the world's ending
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080]  i think the world is gonna change dramatically
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080]  well there's no point in getting golden silver
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.080]  if you think the world's gonna end
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.080]  but it's been a great investment
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080]  and i believe in it and i do have survival people on
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080]  okay well listen my monitor man
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.080]  has a lot of money
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.080]  tied in gold you know what he just did with it
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.080]  like as of yesterday
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.080]  he sold it all
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.080]  and you know what he bought
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.080]  bread batteries and water
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.080]  that's a lot of bread batteries and water
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.080]  yeah
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080]  a lot of bread batteries and water
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.080]  because he wants to survive in that climate
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.080]  what about that gold tooth al
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.080]  you got a gold tooth that's a scam
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.080]  yeah i got a gold tooth
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.080]  you can't get off me
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.080]  but the marauding bands
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.080]  of like rampagers
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.080]  and anarchists
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080]  just trying to survive
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.080]  you know we'll overrun the compound
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.080]  with food and water
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.080]  and gold and take yourself
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080]  i mean you know
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.080]  that's fine
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.080]  i'm fine with that
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.080]  El Paso is pretty apocalyptic looking
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080]  why do you live in El Paso
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080]  does it suit your Diablo essence
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.080]  well
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.080]  El Paso is an interesting city
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.080]  it's always been an outlaw city
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.080]  when the spanish conquistadors came here
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.080]  and i mean we have like
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080]  we have churches here
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.080]  like from like 1590
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.080]  and things like this
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.080]  of people passing through to california
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.080]  that's what they call it El Paso
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.080]  the pass between the mountains before you go west
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.080]  and
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.080]  it's always been an outlaw town
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.080]  the world's largest like
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.080]  Harley distribution here
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.080]  so it's pretty much
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.080]  bikers and outlaws
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.080]  and i seem to fit in here
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.080]  for whatever reason
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.080]  and i like it here
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080]  i've been here nine years
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.080]  i've got a tattooed on my neck
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080]  the name of the city
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.080]  and i plan on staying
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.080]  so you know there's where we're at
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080]  now it does look like something out of road warrior
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.080]  in El Paso when you drive in
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.080]  hills and all the radio towers
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.080]  and like wreckage and junk
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.080]  all over the sides of the road
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.080]  and then the city and the people
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.080]  it is beautiful in an ugly way
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.080]  El Paso is a very interesting town
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.080]  now i want to get away from this in a moment
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.080]  but i want to go back to something Al
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080]  i know we're going to be here after 2012
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.080]  we're going to defeat the new world order
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.080]  we're going to defeat their designed
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.080]  implosion of the world economy
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.080]  and we're not going to turn
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.080]  you know the only way we're going to defeat the new world order
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080]  is for the people to finally get
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.080]  so fed up by the republicans
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080]  destroying the middle class
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080]  to where people have no money
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.080]  here's what cracks me up about the republicans
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.080]  it's such short term sightedness
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.080]  okay
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.080]  let's put the piggyback
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.080]  on to like
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.080]  the middle class
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080]  so the middle class has nothing
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.080]  and the CEOs make everything
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.080]  okay
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.080]  although in a few years
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080]  they're going to buy their product
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080]  while they're making record profit bonuses
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.080]  every year
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.080]  okay and at the end of that
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.080]  who's going to buy their product if no one has money
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080]  so therefore
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080]  they're thinking short term cash grab game
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080]  and they're not thinking long term
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080]  about a sustain
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080]  an economy
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080]  they're thinking short term cash grab which is what's happening
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080]  it's cannibalistic
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080]  it's a cannibalistic economy
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.080]  no
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080]  short sided economy
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080]  these freshmen
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.080]  and the republican congress
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.080]  have been reading way too much
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.080]  and rant
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  if I don't get my way I'm going to blow up the building
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080]  and that's what they're doing
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080]  that's what they're doing
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.080]  you may hate obama you may think he's just
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.080]  scumbag and all that you know what
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.080]  he's dealing with the realities of washington
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.080]  and it's not easy for anybody
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080]  it was easy for w
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.080]  because of his bloodline
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.080]  and this and that and people like fell
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.080]  into line just like you know goose step
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.080]  but with obama
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080]  a black president oh my god
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080]  no we can't have this
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080]  so
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.080]  we'd rather blow up the building
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.080]  as an rant said
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.080]  than pursue with policies
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.080]  that might actually do good
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.080]  I'm thinking
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.080]  if we had a democratic congress
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.080]  and a democratic president
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.080]  and I mean congress and senate
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.080]  we would have infrastructure right now
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.080]  we would have
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.080]  the things that would
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.080]  make this country grow and leave things
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.080]  for our future
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080]  as of right now the short
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.080]  sided terms of the CEOs
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.080]  which is the republican overlords
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.080]  just want
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.080]  immediate cash and they'll build
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080]  their bunkers here's
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.080]  here's a good point
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080]  okay bush is so cozy bush
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.080]  was so cozy with the
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080]  parties and all this stuff
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080]  yet him and the
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080]  CIA director woosie
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.080]  under the Clinton administration
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.080]  both have solar powered houses
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.080]  now why is it good enough for them
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080]  but not good enough for us
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.080]  well again we're talking
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.080]  to the founder of ministry al
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.080]  look
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080]  I totally agree that the republican
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080]  leadership are bad
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.080]  but obama is
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.080]  they're just misinformed
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.080]  and they're talking to their overlords
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.080]  well they're running everything
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.080]  and even the overlords
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.080]  don't see that if you destroy
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.080]  the middle class
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.080]  there is no consumption
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.080]  and people don't
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.080]  consume the overlords
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.080]  sure they have CEO record bonuses
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.080]  but that's not only in the last couple years
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.080]  because there's no one there to buy anything
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.080]  Al this is a plan
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080]  post industrial economy you're saying
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.080]  they don't see what they're doing I can give you
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080]  handbooks the white papers
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080]  where this has been planned for at least 50 years
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.080]  what we're entering it's called
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080]  a post industrial world
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080]  they hate the middle class the ultra rich
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.080]  have always sought to destroy it
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.080]  so there's a giant underclass
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.080]  and a tiny group on top and all I'm saying is
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.080]  versus the rhetoric
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.080]  and reality obama
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.080]  has continued all
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.080]  of the bush policies
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.080]  but right right right right I agree
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.080]  I agree but what's Obama
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.080]  against an established
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.080]  entrenched oligarchy
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.080]  okay so
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080]  from community organizer
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080]  to like try to do what's right
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.080]  versus these satanic people
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.080]  it's a pretty difficult path
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.080]  I'm going to cut him some slack
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080]  for right now okay
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.080]  like I just hope they don't
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.080]  inject the alien bloodline
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.080]  DNA into him as well
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.080]  so he acts
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.080]  in accordance with his overlords
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.080]  but he's burning up
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.080]  as much of a fight as he can
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.080]  and you know I'll leave it at that
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.080]  I mean really what we're dealing with
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.080]  is not government at all
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.080]  but like really shortsighted
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.080]  well this is what makes me think
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.080]  that 2012 is an actual reality
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.080]  it's not the minds
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.080]  of some like crazy paintings
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.080]  of a guy in a spaceship on a tomb
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.080]  or anything it's the fact that
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.080]  okay here we go
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.080]  here's a guy
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.080]  that has
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.080]  a website
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.080]  named Darren McClung
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.080]  and it's called
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.080]  2012 supplied
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080]  okay and
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.080]  this guy is selling things
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080]  survival kits
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.080]  for the masses
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.080]  yet he has a really hard time
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.080]  getting these supplies because
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.080]  the government keeps buying it off
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.080]  all each month
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080]  okay so
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.080]  how does that tell you
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080]  I mean you've seen the movies
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080]  like anything from contact
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.080]  Armageddon
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.080]  whatever
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.080]  the government knows
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.080]  something's going on
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080]  yeah what's going on is they're buying
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.080]  all the supplies
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.080]  yes they are
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080]  they've been building a giant COG system
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.080]  for 60 years
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.080]  underground bases
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.080]  norad, Cheyenne, mountain
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.080]  2012 for at least 15 years
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.080]  for mass gun confiscations
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.080]  riots total shutdown
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.080]  because they have
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080]  planned the implosion of the global
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.080]  economy to build the global
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.080]  government on top of it
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.080]  that we will pay our carbon taxes to
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.080]  they are destroying
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.080]  the planet through economic
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.080]  warfare the globalists took
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.080]  over to shut off
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.080]  now see I have a bone to
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080]  take with you on that too
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.080]  so the ions from space are coming
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.080]  and they're warming up our planet
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.080]  we're not helping it
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.080]  listen it now
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.080]  reach 7 billion people today
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.080]  on this planet okay
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.080]  by 2012 there will be 7.5
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.080]  billion people that's too many
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.080]  people for the resources
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080]  okay it's like the same
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080]  thing as the dinosaurs they didn't have
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.080]  a global
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.080]  positioning and satellites and
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080]  rockets and all that to destroy an asteroid
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.080]  but they were overpopulated
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.080]  and when they're overpopulated
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.080]  and they have no other
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080]  skills they're going to go down
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.080]  the dinosaurs are overpopulated now
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.080]  yes yes yes the top 1%
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.080]  have all their
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.080]  bunkers and all that that's why it's a giant
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.080]  cash grab now fossil fuel
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.080]  is just
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.080]  a completely irrelevant thing right now
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.080]  like I said Bolshevulvi have
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.080]  their solar panel houses and
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.080]  generators waiting for the apocalypse
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.080]  because the 1% will survive
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.080]  and then we'll have a new
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.080]  society
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.080]  after 6 to 7 billion
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.080]  people die
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.080]  in the next apocalypse
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.080]  and they'll have their cushy home
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.080]  and then they'll start another system
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.080]  the same as the one that we have
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080]  Al do you want to know my view on this
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.080]  because I've really studied it in depth
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.080]  and I know you've done some studying
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.080]  and talking about the new world order before I was
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.080]  so I understand you've got some deep political
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.080]  ideas here but
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080]  they have implanted through the
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.080]  fake Christian groups that it's the end of the world
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080]  Jesus is coming back so stand down
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080]  to corruption they've used the 2012
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080]  stuff for 30 years and planted
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.080]  as a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080]  to expect total collapse
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080]  and devastation because they
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.080]  are launching their operation
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.080]  to depopulate
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.080]  on schedule in the next decade
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.080]  and 2012 I agree
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.080]  I agree I agree except
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.080]  for the fact that they're talking
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080]  about finances
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.080]  I'm talking about people
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.080]  people are going to die they're so
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.080]  callous to the whole notion
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.080]  of 6 to 7 billion people
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080]  dying as long as they
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080]  make their money and they have their push
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.080]  bunkers ok with revival kids
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.080]  but they don't care yeah they've been
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.080]  planning for the economic collapse
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080]  for 30 years but they haven't been planning
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080]  and nor do they care
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.080]  about the populace ok
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.080]  so you know I mean call me
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.080]  left wing on that one I'm right wing
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080]  on this thing well let me back you up on something
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.080]  I've confirmed with
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.080]  top construction companies
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.080]  that are listeners some of which have been
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.080]  guest here that
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.080]  every CIA
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.080]  high level person every person that's worth
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.080]  hundreds of millions or billions
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080]  and in the upper echelon
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080]  within the last 5 years
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.080]  have built bunkers everywhere
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080]  and have bunkers underneath their houses
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080]  and are totally
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080]  freaked out so
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080]  I believe from
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.080]  things that they've said and done they're going to
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.080]  they're looking at releasing airborne
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080]  Ebola that's weaponized
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.080]  it'll kill 99% of people
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.080]  and probably that'll be like
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.080]  the least of our worries trust me
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080]  that sounds horrible
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.080]  and it doesn't but that'll be
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.080]  the least of our worries and it's so funny
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080]  that the 1% that ran
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.080]  the world before after
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080]  end of the world as we know it
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.080]  we'll run it again that's what freaked me out
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.080]  so if we want
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.080]  to tax the rich go ahead and tax the rich
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.080]  that's what I say
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.080]  let them pay for some
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080]  care of like
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080]  giving us our last few years
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080]  as we know it
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080]  because there will be survivors
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080]  and survivors do
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.080]  they break into anarchy they break into groups
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.080]  they break into tribalism
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.080]  and so
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.080]  like gold and silver is going to hold you off of them
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.080]  no
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.080]  they'll just kill you and take your gold and silver
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.080]  well that's giving up
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.080]  and look then you can cast
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.080]  well it's not giving up it's not giving up because human beings will survive
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.080]  and how do they survive
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.080]  they band together they make groups
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080]  they make gangs
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.080]  which is why like I see the appeal
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.080]  of gangs amongst the youth
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.080]  today is because it gives them a sense
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080]  of purpose and it's the same thing
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.080]  it's going to happen
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.080]  whether it's like a magnetic
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080]  polar shift a solar flare
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.080]  or an asteroid that the government isn't telling
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080]  it's about one or the other
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.080]  there's going to be some crap in the fan
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080]  coming up soon
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.080]  coming up soon one way or the other
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.080]  okay like right now
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.080]  I could see if I try to build
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.080]  China into the main enemy
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.080]  that's not our main enemy
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.080]  our main enemy is ourselves
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.080]  and our greed because the 1%
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.080]  now and the 1%
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.080]  that will run out after the apocalypse
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.080]  will be the same people and it's the same greed
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.080]  Al Jorgensen
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.080]  greed is the core of
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.080]  not like
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080]  external sources
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.080]  Al just to be clear here though
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.080]  I believe that things are not going to be
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.080]  as bad as a lot of people
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.080]  think during 2012 it is
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.080]  going to be artificial just like the collapse
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.080]  is designed they have Warren Buffett
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.080]  everybody come out
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.080]  just like the republicans
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.080]  make this an artificial crisis
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.080]  tell me greed doesn't rule this planet
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.080]  just tell me that
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080]  I want to hear that from your mouth
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080]  tell me greed does not rule this planet
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.080]  well I mean that's like saying tell me the sky in blue
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.080]  but Al that's not even what I'm saying here
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.080]  the republicans
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.080]  the people holding it up are the tea party
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.080]  who aren't fully informed
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.080]  but they see us being completely bankrupted
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  if we don't cut spending
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.080]  then they have all the billionaires out
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.080]  they don't pay hardly any taxes
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.080]  raise my taxes
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.080]  but you get the tax plan
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080]  they're exempt offshore
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.080]  and they're going out for folks making
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080]  125,000 individually
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.080]  in a family that's not rich Al
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.080]  listen man
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.080]  I've got an offshore account
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.080]  I've made my money in music
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080]  I'm ready to go
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.080]  I'm living good
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.080]  I'm living large
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.080]  but I'm worried about the rest of the population
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.080]  so why don't you put a loophole
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.080]  for an offshore account
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.080]  why don't you put a loophole
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.080]  or not a loophole
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.080]  close the loophole
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080]  of offshore account
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.080]  and just in that
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.080]  to make this prosperous
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.080]  for the last few years
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.080]  Al stay there we gotta go to break
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.080]  we're gonna come right back after the break
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.080]  stay with us

[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.080]  Our new energy czar
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:15.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.080]  It's true
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.080]  Total government control of electricity
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.080]  In some areas of the country
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.080]  and now new socialist legislation
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.080]  is only compounding the problem
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080]  Number 4
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.080]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.080]  Number 5
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.080]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.080]  insurance and peace of mind
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.080]  offered by Solutions from Science
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.080]  One of my oldest sponsors

[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.080]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun

[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.080]  You've heard Alex explaining how the
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.080]  Silver Lung's generator infuses the
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.080]  respiratory system with your
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.080]  self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.080]  Yet many are unaware of the entire
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.080]  function of the Silver Lung system
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.080]  and how it has been designed to deliver your
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.080]  silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.080]  My name is Mario Safaldi
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.080]  and I'm the developer of the Silver Lung's generator
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.080]  Not only does the Silver Lung system produce
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.080]  endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.080]  It also comes equipped with the proper

[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080]  We are back live
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.080]  Al Jorgensen, of course the founder of
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.080]  Ministry is our guest for the rest of the
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.080]  hour, then Bob Chapman coming up on The
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.080]  Economy
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.080]  Look, we're having discussions
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.080]  during the breaks and I kind of want to
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.080]  repeat that now here on air and I'm like
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.080]  Al, I understand the ultra rich
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.080]  are avoiding almost all taxes
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.080]  but it's the ultra rich
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080]  that are promoting, let's get the rich
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.080]  on all these TV shows, they're promoting
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.080]  this idea, then they're going to bait
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.080]  and switch it in the tax plans they've put out
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.080]  and literally gang rape
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.080]  people making
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.080]  quarter million, half million, a million dollars
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.080]  a year that actually is funding the economy
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.080]  You got the head of his economic council
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.080]  the head of GE
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.080]  moving their X-ray
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.080]  factories to China
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.080]  You've got
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.080]  General Motors using billions
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.080]  to move its plants in the bailout
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.080]  to China and Brazil, this is globalism
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.080]  and so all I'm saying is
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.080]  I understand hey the rich
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.080]  are basically exempt from taxes
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  all I'm saying is they're baiting and switching it
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.080]  and if you look at the actual plans
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.080]  not the rhetoric, it goes after the middle
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.080]  class and so as Ron Paul
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.080]  has said, the Republican plan
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.080]  will bankrupt us down the road
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.080]  and the Obama plan will
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.080]  because none of them are talking about the
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.080]  $1,500 trillion the bankers
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080]  created in fake derivatives that they got
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.080]  both parties and the same thing
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.080]  in Greece and everywhere else to sign on to
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.080]  so I'm saying
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.080]  I agree with you about 75% there too
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.080]  but
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.080]  the problem is that the Ron Paul
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.080]  plan, the Libertarian plan
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.080]  so like Democrats and
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.080]  Republicans are both screwed
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.080]  also doesn't take into effect
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.080]  okay
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.080]  I know you just had a segment on
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.080]  polar bears swimming across whatever
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.080]  and who cares and this and that
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.080]  but I care
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.080]  in the sense that the entire
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.080]  eastern table will be under 6 feet of water
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.080]  and there will be trillions of dollars
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.080]  lost in that when Greenland
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.080]  melts okay so
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.080]  forget the polar bear let's just talk about
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.080]  taxes okay so
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.080]  I do agree I'm basically a Libertarian
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.080]  but
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.080]  the point is that the first person
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.080]  like Rick Perry, the governor of
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.080]  Texas okay
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.080]  Mr. Secessionist, Mr.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.080]  like guns in every
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.080]  bar and you know
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.080]  concealed weapons permits across the states
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.080]  I have weapons
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.080]  but I don't take them across states
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.080]  and I don't bring them to bars for God's sake
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.080]  but
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.080]  illegal immigration
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.080]  another big thing oh we gotta stop that
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.080]  yet if we do that
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.080]  then it doesn't drive the wage down
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.080]  of the middle class
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.080]  and we don't have workers
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.080]  willing to do that so
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.080]  that the Republican party is full of
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.080]  hypocrisy okay so
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.080]  Rick Perry anti-immigration
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.080]  and anti this and that but all those
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.080]  things like this affect
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.080]  courts which make money
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.080]  the one percenters
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.080]  alright they make money off
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080]  it so I'm sure there's a lot
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.080]  of pressure back and forth in the Republican
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.080]  party which is why they can't even pass the
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.080]  painter bill right now but Al
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.080]  Al listen
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080]  Rick Perry was Al Gore's chief of staff in Texas
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.080]  he was for forced inoculations
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.080]  he passed sanctuary
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.080]  cities and then claimed he was trying to get
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.080]  rid of them there's two Rick Perry's
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.080]  there's the rhetoric
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.080]  of Rick Perry just like there's the rhetoric
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.080]  of Obama and then there's the real Rick Perry
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:52.080]  there's the real Obama
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.080]  well what I tell you you know David Ike
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.080]  what does that tell you
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.080]  politician or the mouthpiece
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.080]  for the people in control
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.080]  okay
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.080]  yes so what does that tell you
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.080]  I mean what does that tell you that Obama says
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.080]  one thing Perry says another thing
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.080]  what does that tell you
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.080]  listen I just watched David Ike
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.080]  documentary The Matrix the other day
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.080]  and you were mentioned
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.080]  you know that
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.080]  yeah man I know David he's
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.080]  he's been on the show a lot
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.080]  alright well
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.080]  David Ike
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.080]  I agree with about 75 percent of him
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.080]  and
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.080]  the same the same as you
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.080]  okay so
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.080]  we're not ancestry
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.080]  this is a good interview folks are
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.080]  folks are glued right now listen I
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.080]  want to talk about
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.080]  your political awakening because you listen to
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.080]  stuff you guys did 20 25 years ago
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.080]  and I mean it is really
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.080]  politically sophisticated
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.080]  back when nobody was talking about world
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.080]  government new world order all this stuff
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.080]  I mean what was your
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:58.080]  process of
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.080]  seeing the world or waking
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.080]  up or were you born awake
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.080]  well it's very similar to David Ike
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.080]  where he was a soccer star
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.080]  and
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.080]  all I wanted to do was I wanted to ride
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.080]  rodeo I was a bull rider
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.080]  and
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.080]  I wanted to be a baseball player but I tore out
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.080]  my knees so then I went to bull riding
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.080]  but something was nagging at me
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.080]  that something is not right here
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.080]  okay something is not right and it's not
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.080]  what CNN tells you which is
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.080]  another point I have to make which is so funny
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.080]  that the Pentagon finally
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.080]  repeals don't ask don't tell
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.080]  and yet our media centers whether
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.080]  it's Fox
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.080]  CNN
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.080]  or even MSNBC
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.080]  is basically don't ask don't
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.080]  tell they don't ask the hard questions
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.080]  and they don't tell you the hard answers
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.080]  so
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.080]  don't ask don't tell them the media don't
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.080]  ask don't tell is gone in the military
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.080]  no they lie by omission yeah
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.080]  yeah I find that rather ironic
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.080]  but at any rate I knew
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.080]  something was wrong
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.080]  I just I just didn't know what
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.080]  so I started digging into it
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.080]  and started realizing blood lines
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.080]  and things like that which I know
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.080]  okay Holy Grail, Mr. Mad
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.080]  blah blah blah and this is all a bunch
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.080]  of bull crap
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.080]  no no they're really into all that
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.080]  they're obsessed with breeding and that's why every
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.080]  president in the last hundred years has been totally
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.080]  related and they're all related to the
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.080]  royalty of England and they only
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.080]  interbreed with each other and it's a
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.080]  psychopathic control freak
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.080]  unfeeling
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.080]  you know psychopaths run it
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.080]  that under them is an army of sociopaths
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080]  and sadists
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.080]  and those of us that are
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:38.080]  good people and have love
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.080]  we need to wake up and start really realizing
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.080]  what we're facing and stop being blind
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  but it stopped in English
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.080]  English came later it actually came from the
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.080]  matter of engine you know I know it goes back all the way
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.080]  yeah it goes back a ways
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.080]  well give us your view then
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.080]  you've got the floor your view of who runs
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.080]  the new world order 9-11
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.080]  everything I mean spill the
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.080]  guts here well well
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.080]  the bloodline but like if you look at 9-11
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.080]  it's no different than Pearl Harbor
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.080]  Roosevelt had three days at
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.080]  baths he was trying to find a way to get us
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.080]  into World War II because we were
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.080]  isolationist we didn't really care we
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.080]  didn't see how it mattered to us because it
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.080]  wasn't a global economy back then
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.080]  and and so he let it
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.080]  he allowed it to happen he sacrificed
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.080]  our people in order
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.080]  you know ends to a mean
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080]  type of thing or means to an end
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.080]  and and the same
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.080]  thing with 9-11 and Bush it's a
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.080]  means to an end
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.080]  like Obama the reason that
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.080]  he's involved in this bloodline is
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.080]  what what what is
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.080]  sixth cousin of Cheney through his mom's side
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.080]  or something yes he's got some bloodline
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.080]  so he's allowed
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.080]  to rule they're not happy
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080]  about it but he's allowed
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.080]  to rule allowed
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.080]  and that's a big word
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.080]  allowed because what does that mean
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.080]  I mean that somebody else is calling
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.080]  the shots and they're allowing
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.080]  somebody to be president
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.080]  the supposed
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.080]  most you know important person
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.080]  in the world so
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.080]  you know I mean what we have here
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.080]  is I mean I go back
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.080]  to like Zachariah
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.080]  Pitchin and Graham Hancock
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.080]  and I go back to
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.080]  you know even
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.080]  like okay I mean that's what got me hooked
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.080]  Chariah to the gods
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.080]  yeah yeah I mean
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.080]  well amongst other books but that's what
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.080]  got me hooked on the stuff and I started
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.080]  reading more stuff on it
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.080]  Graham Hancock is another great great
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.080]  person
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.080]  as far as like alien bloodline
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.080]  and uh and and we
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.080]  can't believe that because religions
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.080]  if we know we go down and that's not
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.080]  problem you notice now they're having to admit
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.080]  oh there's these Neanderthal
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.080]  and we've done the DNA and it turns out
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.080]  northern Europeans are the highest
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.080]  concentration of Neanderthal
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.080]  and oh the genetic DNA is different
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.080]  and then now you find out for 20
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.080]  years or longer they've made
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.080]  thousands and thousands of cross human
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.080]  animal clones but
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.080]  keep the details secret
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.080]  I mean we're not in Kansas anymore
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.080]  and what you're saying Al put words in your
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.080]  mouth correct me if I'm wrong we've never
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.080]  been in Kansas
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.080]  no we've never been in Kansas and we've
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.080]  never been in human race
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.080]  or human race only through DNA altering
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.080]  by species
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.080]  different than us and the species
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.080]  that that are different than us
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.080]  were the Anunnaki
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.080]  I'm a big 12 planet theory which is
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080]  why I'm uh my label
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.080]  is called 13 planet which is like
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.080]  well that's 12 planet
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.080]  I've even got weirder ideas so I'm 13
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.080]  planet
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.080]  called 12 planet they saw the 8
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.080]  visible planets they didn't see Pluto
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  they saw the moons of
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.080]  our moon and then three gas giant
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.080]  moons which made it 12 planets
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.080]  uh through the first telescope
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.080]  so that's why it's 12
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.080]  planet and now we know there's
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.080]  hundreds of Pluto size objects
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.080]  out in the Kuiper belt now
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:00.080]  so there is all sorts of
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.080]  exactly and I think
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.080]  uh the government knows
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.080]  what I'm gonna hit us down because uh
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.080]  I mean you see
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.080]  you know Hollywood sometimes is this
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.080]  complete crap i.e.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.080]  Smurf movie or whatever but uh
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.080]  sometimes they get it right
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.080]  like I worked with Steven Spielberg
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.080]  who did close encounters of the third kind
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.080]  and I worked with him on
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.080]  AI artificial intelligence
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.080]  although uh
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.080]  I used to have a joke with him I told him
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.080]  like the band didn't want to do the film
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.080]  because we thought AI stood for
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.080]  Antoine Truder and it was a porno film
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.080]  but uh anyways
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.080]  oh man
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.080]  well he got a joke on that
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.080]  he actually like he would come over
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.080]  the new AI every day like
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.080]  okay okay okay but it's a family show
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.080]  Al Al going back here tell
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.080]  I forgot you worked on AI
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.080]  uh how was ministry involved in that
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.080]  well it's funny
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.080]  we got a call from Stanley Kubrick
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.080]  at my house and
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.080]  uh and he's like he really
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.080]  wants us to be the band
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.080]  in the flesh bear and he really
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.080]  wants us to write the music for the film
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.080]  and I'm like yeah right
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.080]  and I hung up I thought it was a prank call
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.080]  and they called back
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.080]  and they like
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.080]  and here's Mr. Kubrick
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.080]  and I talked to Stanley Kubrick before he died
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.080]  and he was like no
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.080]  you're the perfect embodiment of the film
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.080]  that I want to make and then he died
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.080]  and Spielberg took it over
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.080]  and put that damn teddy bear in
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.080]  uh you know with the kid
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.080]  you know because he liked that ET
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.080]  and the children saving the day thing
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.080]  and uh and the teddy bear
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.080]  and that teddy bear was a mess man
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080]  that thing would like go down like every 10 minutes
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.080]  it'd be like the bear is down
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.080]  everyone takes 10 the bear is down
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.080]  until we'd be like
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.080]  back there you know sloughing
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.080]  beers you know like uh waiting
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.080]  for the bear to come back up like
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.080]  you know I know Stan Winston just died
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.080]  rest in peace but uh you know
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.080]  the uh
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.080]  the uh creator of the
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.080]  teddy bear and many other special effects
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.080]  you know icon that we have in our lexicon
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.080]  but uh
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.080]  I was really pissed I didn't get along
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.080]  with Stan Winston because of that bear
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.080]  and uh what did you think
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.080]  of Stanley Kubrick's mysterious
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.080]  death you know he refused to cut
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.080]  27 minutes out of Eyes Wide Shut
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.080]  stuff the elite did not want seeing because
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.080]  of course as we know that
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.080]  he knew Eyes Wide Suck
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.080]  Suck
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.080]  he knew it sucked and this
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.080]  this treatment that I got
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.080]  I still have
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.080]  the treatment of the original
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.080]  was much more about the intricacies
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.080]  of Jude Law
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.080]  in the new city being a male prostitute
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.080]  and that was half the movie
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.080]  and Spielberg took it and made it
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.080]  like half teddy bear
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.080]  and and this uh Donnie
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.080]  Osmond, Joel, Haley, something
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.080]  or whatever kid uh which is
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.080]  a good kid by the way he's a big menace
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.080]  man but um at any
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.080]  rate you know he made it all about teddy bears
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.080]  kids when Kubrick's
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.080]  message was really
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.080]  profound. Now I understand that
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.080]  he took it and turned it into a Spielberg
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.080]  plastic thing but but but going
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.080]  back to Eyes Wide Shut
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.080]  but wait but wait Spielberg's a good guy
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.080]  I mean I actually like him and he's so pro
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.080]  well he's certainly talented yeah
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.080]  I'm not just saying this because of security
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.080]  I really he
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.080]  taught me more about filmmaking
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.080]  than I've had in like 20
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.080]  years of like you know trying
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.080]  to do it on my own within like you know
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.080]  two hours I already knew
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.080]  more about filmmaking with him I mean
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.080]  the guy's talented it's just that
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:36.080]  uh that teddy bear girl being nuts
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.080]  I understand and then
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.080]  well the teddy bears is now
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.080]  in the ash heap of history
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.080]  but what about
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.080]  Stanley Kubrick that's who I'm really interested in
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:48.080]  that's one of my favorite director you know what
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.080]  of mine obviously on the inside track
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.080]  everything you know he ever produced
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.080]  was basically archetypal for real stuff
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.080]  he believed it was going on the whole obelisk
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.080]  you know 2001 space
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.080]  Odyssey it goes on and on
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.080]  high up with the illuminist and the
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.080]  MO is he wouldn't cut
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.080]  27 minutes out of Eyes Wide Shut
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.080]  that dealt with the elite and
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.080]  that then he you know had the heart attack
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.080]  he knew that was
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.080]  mistake he knew that was mistake
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.080]  he knew first of all getting a
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.080]  Scientologist to play the lead
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.080]  role was mistake
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.080]  I mean he knew that was a mistake
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.080]  that's why he wanted to really come back
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.080]  with AI and the treatment that
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.080]  I got was like just
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.080]  mind-blowing and
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.080]  and then I dealt with Spielberg
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.080]  it's a really
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.080]  funny story actually when
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:38.080]  we first met Spielberg they lined us up
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.080]  like meeting the queen the whole band
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.080]  right he'd ignore this for like
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.080]  three days just casting us like really
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.080]  weird glances like these guys
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.080]  and like all his costume and stuff
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.080]  and he'd never worked with anyone but John Williams
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.080]  for his sound scores
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.080]  and so he didn't know what to
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:56.080]  make of it he doesn't listen to rock he
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.080]  listened to classical his biggest
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.080]  story in the rock is U2
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.080]  he thinks U2 is okay
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.080]  alright so he comes to meet us
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.080]  and we all have to have our head bowed
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.080]  like the queen I was at the end of the line
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.080]  and the rest of the band shook his hand
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.080]  and all his stuff did you cut scene
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.080]  yeah no I'm
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.080]  serious this is true and for
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.080]  the rest of the band like you know
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.080]  nodded their head and shook his hand
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.080]  and I was at the end in full costume
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.080]  and I went like
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.080]  Steven baby
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.080]  Spam's gonna walk today
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.080]  we're not doing this because
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.080]  we were told by Cooper
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.080]  that AI was called anal intruder
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.080]  and it was a porn
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.080]  film and we just
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.080]  can't do this film and his handler
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.080]  that would sit next to him taking notes
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.080]  as he's going through shaking hands
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.080]  Spielberg goes walking
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.080]  off and his handler goes going
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.080]  wait wait there's a mistake Mr Spielberg
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.080]  oh my god oh my god
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.080]  and then I had to run with him and there's
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.080]  50 pounds of like makeup and
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.080]  like gear that they had me wearing
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:00.080]  and just go wait I was just kidding
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.080]  I was just kidding
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.080]  you know and
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.080]  he finally came back and then me and him
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.080]  got to be friends so
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.080]  I'm never just a word about Steven Spielberg
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.080]  except for the fact
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.080]  that I know what the original treatment was
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.080]  that movie and
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.080]  wow that movie would have been a statement
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.080]  and the rest of it was like
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.080]  a really baddie T
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.080]  and I told Spielberg that to his face
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.080]  so it's not like you know I'm like
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.080]  oh my god spilling the beans
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.080]  no no I understand Al Jorgensen
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.080]  now back to Stanley Kubrick
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.080]  well what do you think of films like
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:36.080]  Eyes Wide Shut and the fact that
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.080]  it's skull and bones
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.080]  Bohemian Grove the people that are claiming
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.080]  they're big crits and conservatives
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.080]  speaking of gay sex are engaged
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.080]  in that and all sorts of satanism
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.080]  let's
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:50.080]  let's go to Bohemian Grove
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.080]  I'm into that that's just like
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.080]  well listen the whole republican
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.080]  party is based on hypocrisy
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.080]  alright I'm sorry it is
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.080]  it's based on hypocrisy first of all
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.080]  they go they're pro-life
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.080]  okay yet
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.080]  they're the ones that procure
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.080]  wars that end life
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.080]  until countless
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.080]  civilians but they're pro-life
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.080]  they're more worried about the fetus
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.080]  at inception than they are about
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.080]  a full grown adult with a wife
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.080]  and kids they want to cut veteran
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.080]  benefits they want to cut everything
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.080]  yet they want to start wars so they're not
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:26.080]  pro-life okay so
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.080]  so that's just BS
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:30.080]  right from the start I mean
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:32.080]  they're hypocrisy
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.080]  waiting to happen to the republican party
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.080]  and I'm not a democrat either
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.080]  because listen

[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.080]  and had broken the codes
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  and let it happen
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.080]  9-11 when you really look at it
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  hijackers trained at US bases

[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:42.080]  well, i remember i was living in Austin at the time
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.080]  and i remember
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080]  i remember waking up
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.080]  to some disturbing news
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.080]  and i watched the visual
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.080]  and i thought
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.080]  did i change the channel while i was asleep
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.080]  because this is the Saturday night live spoof
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.080]  i couldn't believe it
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  and then i started digging into that
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.080]  and
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.080]  realizing that it's the same overlords
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.080]  that i've been talking about
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.080]  with our mouthpiece
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.080]  president
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:14.080]  that resurrected something
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.080]  to what you said
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.080]  a 30-year plan
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.080]  to destroy the markets
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.080]  and then resurrect them or whatever
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.080]  and yeah, i mean
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.080]  it all made sense right away
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.080]  right away, it took me about 10 minutes
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.080]  to realize there wasn't a Saturday night live spoof
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.080]  and no offense to the victims
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:34.080]  of that because i certainly
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.080]  had no way to mean their pain and loss
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.080]  but just
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.080]  you can understand where i'm coming from
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.080]  i thought it was a joke
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.080]  are you kidding me
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.080]  and then realizing
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:48.080]  where it's coming from
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  okay, forces the mouthpiece
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.080]  change the puppet master
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.080]  and then there's the overlords
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.080]  so
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.080]  it kind of started to make sense to me
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.080]  to rebuild
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.080]  the economy got up to $14,000 on the Dow during push
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.080]  alright
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.080]  working on our credit card
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.080]  which is now in debate
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:10.080]  the Republicans were so happy to vote for
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.080]  while Bush was in office
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.080]  $14,000
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.080]  on the Dow
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.080]  now by the time we're done by the end of this week
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.080]  we'll be down below 11
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:22.080]  okay
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.080]  and this is all part to make Obama look bad
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.080]  it's going to bad fire on the Republicans
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.080]  i think people are just
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.080]  going to not even know who's lying
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.080]  and just vote Democratic next year
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:34.080]  well, i mean Al, come on
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.080]  you're right about the Republicans
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.080]  they positioned us along with the bankers
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.080]  for default
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.080]  we're already technically defaulted
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.080]  so they are playing politics here
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.080]  and the whole thing's a distraction at the end of the day
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.080]  because of the hyperinflation
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:50.080]  that's already beginning
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.080]  do you believe we've been lying and killing things?
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.080]  this is all true
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.080]  you're absolutely right
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.080]  but if we had a Democratic congress
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.080]  and a Democratic senate
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.080]  do you really think
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080]  we're just going to spend money
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.080]  on failures
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.080]  and run this country into the ground
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.080]  and just have our great-great-great
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.080]  grandchildren and dad
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.080]  and like default and all that
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.080]  no, they're going to start building infrastructure
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.080]  Republicans don't want to do
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:20.080]  they're going to start repairing things that need to be repaired
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.080]  Republicans don't want to do
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.080]  is it going to mean higher taxes for the wealthy?
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:26.080]  yes
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.080]  sorry, on the wealthy
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.080]  no, no, you're right
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:32.080]  they're going to get people like Al
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.080]  they're going to come after you
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:36.080]  but they're going to leave the Rothschilds and Rockefellers alone
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.080]  back in one minute
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.080]  stay with us
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.080]  you are listening to GCN

[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.080]  hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:56.080]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:58.080]  opportunity
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.080]  and recognized risk
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.080]  the cow bin pure soap company
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:04.080]  can save you thousands of dollars
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:06.080]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:08.080]  that are triple concentrated
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.080]  and twice as good as what you're using now
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.080]  soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.080]  that contain no useless
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:16.080]  dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.080]  or antibacterials
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.080]  your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.080]  that give you rashes
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.080]  itching sores
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:26.080]  and deteriorating clothing called lint
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.080]  if you want something better
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:30.080]  than what you had before
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.080]  you have to do something you've never done before
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:34.080]  getting a free catalog is easy

[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.080]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:20.080]  Alex Jones
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:22.080]  well Al Jorgensen
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.080]  the founder and head of
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.080]  Ministry
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.080]  and next time he comes to Austin
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.080]  he says he's going to come to studio with us
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.080]  so that's going to be exciting
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.080]  you know what adds a lot of credibility
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080]  to him thinking something really bad is coming
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.080]  and I hope it's not the case
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.080]  is that I've been out in Wemberley
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:42.080]  in places and there's all these
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.080]  scientists and former government people
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.080]  even who are young
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.080]  who've been out there 10, 15, 20 years
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.080]  saying these are our doomsteads
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.080]  it's all going to implode
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.080]  and then I run into microbiologists and they say
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.080]  well you're right about everything Alex
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.080]  but the point is
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:00.080]  they are setting up for something big
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.080]  and I believe
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.080]  that they're instituting it
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.080]  but who knows what they really know
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:08.080]  five of the six reactors at Fukushima
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.080]  blew up within a week
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.080]  they knew it had happened worse than Chernobyl
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  and they tried and told us everything was fine
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.080]  Al what's your take on all of this craziness
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:18.080]  well I
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:20.080]  do think something's coming
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.080]  if anything for the fact that like I said
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.080]  Dennis McClung
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.080]  2012supplies.com
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.080]  playing on the
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.080]  survivalist
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.080]  instinct
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:34.080]  selling everything from gas mask
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.080]  to like you know
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.080]  homegrown garden kids, hydroponics all this shit
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.080]  sorry I said
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.080]  shit anyways
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.080]  I'm trying
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.080]  but
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.080]  the government
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.080]  has bought most of the stuff
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.080]  he's having a hard time finding supplies
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.080]  why is the government buying
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.080]  all the supply
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.080]  supplies
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  and not letting
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.080]  free enterprise
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.080]  this isn't just Obama
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.080]  oh Obama's
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.080]  going to ruin us all
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:10.080]  we've been planning this for a long time
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:12.080]  now like I said
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.080]  how it comes by
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.080]  I don't know
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.080]  and what a magnetic ship does
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.080]  I don't know it depends on the continental
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.080]  plate ship
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.080]  what a solar flare does
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.080]  well obviously that screws up our electronics
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.080]  what an asteroid does
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.080]  is not telling us about
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:32.080]  we're supposed to have a close one in 2029
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:34.080]  within 100,000 miles
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.080]  blah blah blah
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.080]  I might not
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.080]  but I just find it
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.080]  amusing
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:44.080]  that the government is buying up all the
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  survival supplies
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.080]  I mean don't you find that weird
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.080]  well
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.080]  I hope that you're wrong
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  I hope that it's not going to be this complete collapse
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.080]  I mean they do
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.080]  I hope that I'm wrong too because
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:02.080]  like I said I'm not spending my life
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:04.080]  in some road warrior world
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.080]  I'm going to defend my spruce supplies
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.080]  with AR-15s
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.080]  and 16s
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  collision costs
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.080]  blocks, gas masks
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  grenades
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.080]  is that a way to live
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.080]  I'd rather throw a party
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.080]  and put a burrata through my roof of my mouth
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.080]  and just call it a day
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  Al don't do that
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.080]  at the first sight of trouble
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.080]  I mean if things get bad roll with it
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.080]  it's going to be entertaining
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:34.080]  with roving hordes
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:36.080]  I really don't find
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:38.080]  protecting my compound
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.080]  with a large squad
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080]  against marauding survivalists
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.080]  and tenders
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:46.080]  as a wife
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:48.080]  which is why I
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.080]  kind of like
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:52.080]  rebuke you
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:54.080]  maybe falsely
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.080]  but for like his gold and silver
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.080]  really going to matter
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:00.080]  is anything going to matter
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.080]  that in every case in history
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.080]  gold and silver and copper
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.080]  and guns and food and whiskey
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.080]  and cigarettes
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.080]  and nylon stockings and makeup
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.080]  stuff like that

[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.080]  they're not going to mess with something with 10 foot walls
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.080]  and razor wire because they know
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.080]  that there's machine guns on the other side of it
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.080]  hey

[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.080]  10 foot walls seem like 2 foot walls

[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.080]  to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:08.080]  this is our last chance to not
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:10.080]  relive history as we're finishing off
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.080]  this agenda that we're pulling
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.080]  the rug from underneath the americans at home
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:16.080]  I have tremendous influence
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:18.080]  on our president in congress
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.080]  and they really are calling the shots
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:22.080]  I think it's incumbent upon
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:24.080]  all of us as american citizens
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.080]  to pay attention
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:28.080]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.080]  of our nation the criminal off-shore
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.080]  cartel held bent on destroying
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:34.080]  sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:36.080]  constructing world government
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:38.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.080]  they're asking for more matches and the congress
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.080]  is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:44.080]  today seems like nobody does care
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.080]  and right now in washington dc
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.080]  we have seen a fall

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.080]  and we're going to bob Chapman and he said
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:18.080]  I love talking to knuckleheads
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:20.080]  and of course if you want to visit the websites
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:22.080]  it's facebook.com

[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.080]  and of course it's Al Jorgensen
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:30.080]  from his compound
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:32.080]  he described it as a waco compound
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:34.080]  minus all the strangeness
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.080]  out in El Paso, texas
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:38.080]  that I said
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.080]  it's strangely beautiful and ugly way
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.080]  and he said yeah it's beautifully creepy
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:44.080]  El Paso
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:46.080]  it just it conjures
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:48.080]  it conjures weird feelings when you're there
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:50.080]  so this place is like bokeh
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.080]  and big band I mean it's like right out of a western
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:54.080]  but with all the craziness
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.080]  on top of it bob Chapman
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:58.080]  waiting in the wings but we have a bunch of calls
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:00.080]  I said you want to take calls
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.080]  said I love talking to knuckleheads
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:04.080]  I said really he said yeah let's talk to the knuckleheads
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.080]  and so
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:08.080]  let's talk to Jay in Illinois
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.080]  quick question or comic because we got to go here in a minute
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.080]  go ahead Jay
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:14.080]  hey how's it going Al
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.080]  thanks a lot for having me
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.080]  that's my home state you know
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:20.080]  oh I've been a huge fan
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.080]  for a long time I just got a quick question
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:24.080]  what's in the works for ministry
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.080]  and if you don't have anything coming up
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:28.080]  I think maybe you should start your own radio show
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  because this interview is just rocking man
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.080]  well
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:34.080]  like I courted
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:36.080]  ministry and recording
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.080]  and all the stuff last year
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:40.080]  because I was throwing up blood
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:42.080]  and then I went to the hospital
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:44.080]  same day as Brett Michael said
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:46.080]  is like brain aneurysm
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:48.080]  I was getting defibrillated
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.080]  in some hospital room
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.080]  because I've wound up there dead
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:54.080]  and it turned out I had 13 ulcers
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:56.080]  and that explains why
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:58.080]  last three tours I've been
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:00.080]  cuking up blood and that's why I said
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:02.080]  I was going to stop recording and all that
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:04.080]  because I just wasn't healthy enough to do it
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.080]  but now
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.080]  after about a year later I've been working out
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:10.080]  I quit smoking, quit drinking
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.080]  drugs 10 years ago
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.080]  and so it looks like I'm all ready to go
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:16.080]  my doctor gave me a go ahead
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:18.080]  so never say never
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:20.080]  oh it is
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.080]  is that breaking news here
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:24.080]  the return of ministry
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:26.080]  that's breaking news
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:28.080]  but I don't know if the return of ministry will see
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.080]  I'm just saying that my doctor gave me a clearance
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:32.080]  that like
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.080]  I'm full go for all things
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.080]  apocalyptic and less
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:38.080]  alright
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.080]  go ahead and go to Joe and Louisiana
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.080]  you're on the air, go ahead
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:44.080]  hey Al, long time fan here in New Orleans
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.080]  I saw you last time when you all came down here
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:48.080]  you put on a great show
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:50.080]  I wanted to add a point to that
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:52.080]  you mentioned David Ike
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:54.080]  and I've been reading him for a while
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:56.080]  and I listen to Al Jones
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.080]  one thing I can't seem to understand
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:00.080]  is that keep on saying that all these
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:02.080]  Obama administration people are
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:04.080]  into Zionism
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.080]  I can't find anything
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.080]  the words Alan Greenspan
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:10.080]  and Rami Manuel and all these
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:12.080]  fellows are admitting that they are Zionists
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:14.080]  is this a secret?
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:16.080]  I mean how are these being connected?
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:18.080]  can y'all help me up with this?
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.080]  well how do they make
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:22.080]  just listen
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.080]  there's like 3 words follow the money
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:26.080]  follow the money
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:28.080]  follow the money alright
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.080]  and where's our money coming from
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.080]  like why don't we crack down on Saudi Arabia
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:34.080]  for their human rights practices
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:36.080]  follow the money
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:38.080]  why don't we crack down on Israel
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:40.080]  for their completely
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:42.080]  insubordinate stance
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.080]  on having a people have the right
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:46.080]  to self-govern
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.080]  follow the money
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.080]  well my issue is throughout history
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.080]  every government is corrupted out of control
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.080]  and the people don't get
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:56.080]  angry and focused
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.080]  government's on control
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:00.080]  it's the overlords that are out of control
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:02.080]  it's just the mouthpieces
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.080]  so yeah great
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.080]  okay good so the government
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.080]  ties with Israel why?
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.080]  because we have vested interest in that
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:12.080]  not just the government
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:14.080]  it's the overlords
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.080]  Joe thank you so much for the call
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.080]  two quick ones and we're going to let
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.080]  Al get out of here
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:22.080]  and I look forward to him coming he says he'd love to come
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:24.080]  in studios we look forward to it
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:26.080]  Dan in Florida you're on the air go ahead
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:28.080]  yeah hi Alex thanks a lot
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:30.080]  for having me
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.080]  now you had mentioned
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:34.080]  you know what
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:36.080]  how far as gold and silver is
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:38.080]  I guess I could see that
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.080]  you know in a totally wiped out
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:42.080]  post-apocalyptic world
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.080]  where nothing is left
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:46.080]  there's no economic system to speak of
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:48.080]  but I'm a disabled veteran
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.080]  and when I got hit to this through Alex's
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.080]  show
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.080]  about a year and a half ago
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:56.080]  the real state of the economy
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:58.080]  what's really going on
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:00.080]  and what the differences are
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:02.080]  I started buying
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.080]  gold and silver
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.080]  actually gold and silver
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:08.080]  because
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:10.080]  if they decide
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:12.080]  to just wave their magic wand
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:14.080]  on August
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:16.080]  second or something and make all the
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:18.080]  disabled vets and whoever
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  the hell else is dependent on them
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:22.080]  if they decide to wave their magic
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.080]  wand and make us all homeless
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.080]  and hungry I've got a three month supply
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.080]  and I got several thousand dollars
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:30.080]  worth of silver that I've accumulated
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  well let me ask you if you bought silver
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:34.080]  a year and a half ago that was at about 25
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:36.080]  or 20 now it's at 42
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:38.080]  right now
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:40.080]  my whole deal is
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.080]  my whole deal is
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:44.080]  I mean look I understand if it is going to be
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:46.080]  total Armageddon gold and silver aren't going to matter
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:48.080]  and the Bible says they'll throw their jewels
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.080]  out in the street and beat themselves
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:52.080]  on the head and try to hide under rocks
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:54.080]  my whole issue is I've got faith
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:56.080]  I don't think that's the case
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:58.080]  gold and silver aren't perfect but compared to fiat currencies
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:00.080]  run by the criminal bankers
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:02.080]  it's as good as gold and it's
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:04.080]  been great advice and I stand by it
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:06.080]  now as for going after Glenn Beck
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.080]  I actually looked at that with Congressman Wiener
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:10.080]  I mean this is the guy that basically
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:12.080]  exaggerated and made stuff up about
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:14.080]  Beck some of the deals I
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:16.080]  I'm gonna hand this to you
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:18.080]  okay well
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.080]  I mean listen the issue here is
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:22.080]  I looked at those gold line deals and yeah
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:24.080]  Midas is a lot better
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:26.080]  the sponsor I've got
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:28.080]  but a lot of what Wiener said it turned out wasn't
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:30.080]  true and so I just think this
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:32.080]  demonization of gold because they want to keep you in paper
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.080]  and all I'm saying is you ought to rethink
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.080]  that because look
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:38.080]  when I started plugging gold it was 300
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:40.080]  now it's 1600 and 20 something
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:42.080]  I think that's pretty good advice
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:44.080]  okay so you're on a Walmart
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.080]  post-apocalyptic
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.080]  and there's riots in the parking lot
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:50.080]  trying to loot it and then the National Guard
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:52.080]  guarding a Walmart
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:54.080]  and you're in there with your one gold coin
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:56.080]  to buy some canned food
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:58.080]  you really think that's gonna work
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.080]  I mean is this really
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.080]  I don't think it's going to the total
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:04.080]  apocalypse situation
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.080]  but yes in a depression
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.080]  just like my grandfathers
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.080]  you know here in Texas
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:12.080]  their dads
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.080]  well it was actually my grandmother's
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:16.080]  dad and then on
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:18.080]  the other side well the point is
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.080]  they didn't turn their gold in when Roosevelt said
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:22.080]  turn it in for paper
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.080]  and that's smart and you know what else to do
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:26.080]  it's smart that you invested in
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:28.080]  silver and gold my disabled friend
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.080]  or my war veteran friend
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:32.080]  but
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.080]  better now and buy
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:36.080]  batteries, guns
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.080]  food
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:40.080]  and anything else you can
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:42.080]  if you want to survive in that world
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:44.080]  because gold
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.080]  is not going to mean
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:48.080]  a lot to you
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:50.080]  I actually agree with you
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:52.080]  need a lot of things
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.080]  you're on your own
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:56.080]  rather high
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:58.080]  I would sell
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:00.080]  at this record high price today
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:02.080]  I would sell and buy
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.080]  a supply
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:06.080]  I agree with you that first you need
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.080]  water, food, guns
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.080]  a rid out, friends
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:12.080]  that comes first but then
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:14.080]  gold and silver because
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:16.080]  I don't believe there's going to be a total
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.080]  complete collapse
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:20.080]  who's going to take it and if they know you have gold
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:22.080]  who's going to come to your house
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.080]  and take that gold
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:26.080]  well number one my gold isn't at my house
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.080]  well you understand what I'm saying
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.080]  if it's in a bank that's even worse because
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:32.080]  they're all going to be shut down
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:34.080]  I don't even have that much to begin with
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.080]  but the point is I mainly got silver
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:38.080]  but then boy is that done well
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:40.080]  let me tell you eight times what it was
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:42.080]  nine times the gold is only four and a half
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.080]  what's that going to do with the entire
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:46.080]  because I don't believe it's going to
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:48.080]  collapse in the total arm again
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:50.080]  when the monetary system
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.080]  fails
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:54.080]  then what do you do?
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:56.080]  when the monetary system
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:58.080]  fails Al
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:00.080]  in the depression
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:02.080]  in every other case
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:04.080]  the Romans
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:06.080]  1800 years ago
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:08.080]  in one of their collapses
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:10.080]  the people that did have the old currency
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:12.080]  they became the new wealth
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:14.080]  I mean we got history
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:16.080]  except that I don't think
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:18.080]  there's going to be a new currency
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:20.080]  same as the old new currency
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:22.080]  that's my premise
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.080]  okay wrong or right
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:26.080]  you may be right I may be wrong
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:28.080]  but I'm just saying that I don't think
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:30.080]  that the new monetary system
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:32.080]  is going to be the same as the old
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:34.080]  therefore gold is over
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:36.080]  it's a scam as much as the money
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:38.080]  markets the dollars
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:40.080]  there are industrial metals
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:42.080]  coppers going up everything
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:44.080]  is going up because the value of the dollar
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.080]  is going down Al
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:48.080]  that's what we're saying it's not that you
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.080]  you have the gold
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.080]  and the people say well what do you do with it later
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.080]  you cash it in for whatever the new digital
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:56.080]  currency is
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.080]  there's going to be no banks
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:00.080]  so where do you cash it in?
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:02.080]  the globalist
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:04.080]  there's going to be implosions
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:06.080]  for the globalist the Rothschilds
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:08.080]  the Rockefellers the queen of England
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.080]  the Dutch queen
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:12.080]  please
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:14.080]  like I said
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.080]  I agree with about 75% of you Alex
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:18.080]  I really do
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.080]  I really like your show
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.080]  but this one I got to put my foot down
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.080]  I really don't think there's going to be a monetary system
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:26.080]  very soon
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:28.080]  and that includes
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.080]  so you believe total absolute collapse
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.080]  people are making money
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:34.080]  hand over fist right now on that
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:36.080]  and look at the price
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:38.080]  we're at 1,700 today
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:40.080]  I mean really
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:42.080]  really and what's that going to do for you
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:44.080]  on a Walmart to try and get food
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:46.080]  what's that going to do for you
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:48.080]  Al, Al, Al
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.080]  we predicted it all
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.080]  we're right we're not bad because we were right
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:54.080]  they're devaluing the currency
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:56.080]  Al
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:58.080]  well currency is nothing
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:00.080]  currency is nothing we all know that
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:02.080]  and globalist over here
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  they're astute bad now
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:06.080]  but what I'm saying is it's not going to

[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:02.080]  Question
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:04.080]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:06.080]  be used to read our minds?
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:08.080]  Author Jose Calazzo answers yes
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:10.080]  in his two new books
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:12.080]  America's New Slavery
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:14.080]  For more than 13 years
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:16.080]  Author Jose Calazzo has been trying to prove
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:18.080]  that the US government
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:20.080]  has the capacity to read a person's thoughts
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:22.080]  with a revolutionary technology
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:24.080]  known as fMRI
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:26.080]  functional magnetic resonance imaging
[02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:28.080]  and there is proof that it exists
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:30.080]  America's New Slavery
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:32.080]  explores this technology
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.080]  and it's many possible applications
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:36.080]  in national security
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:38.080]  Who has access to it?
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:40.080]  How is it being used?
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:42.080]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:44.080]  These and many other questions
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:46.080]  are answered in America's New Slavery
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.080]  the new books by Jose Calazzo
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.080]  available on

[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:58.080]  America's New Slavery
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:00.080]  All Americans should be concerned
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:02.080]  Will I have garlic breath
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:04.080]  after I take Alley C?
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:06.080]  We get that question all the time
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:08.080]  about the world's best garlic extract
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:10.080]  Alley C and the answer is
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.080]  Alley C contains stabilized allicin
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:14.080]  nature's antimicrobial agent
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:16.080]  and the active ingredient in crushed garlic
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.080]  with scientifically proven and double-blind studies
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:20.080]  using low doses of allicin
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.080]  greatly reduces the number,
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:24.080]  severity and duration of common colds
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:26.080]  Our powerful Alley C contains
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:28.080]  300 milligrams of stabilized allicin
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:30.080]  Just one tablet of Alley C
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:32.080]  is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:34.080]  It's effective against asthma,
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:36.080]  MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections
[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:38.080]  and helps lower high blood pressure
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:40.080]  and high cholesterol
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:42.080]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  Boost resistance to infection with nature's
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.080]  Alley C. For more information

[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.080]  Well folks, the real interesting radio
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:08.080]  is going on behind the scenes
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:10.080]  and we've got Bob Chapman
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.080]  waiting and I apologize to Bob
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:14.080]  he just always comes home
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.080]  and we've got breaking news
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:18.080]  Al is our guest of course
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.080]  the founder of Ministry
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:22.080]  facebook.com
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:24.080]  ministry Al Jorgensen
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:26.080]  and he's been talking to his wife during the break
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:28.080]  and it's just really interesting
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:30.080]  talking to him, he just sprung on me
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:32.080]  but he didn't want to plug it on ever for some reason
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.080]  he was inviting me down to their compound
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:36.080]  for fried chicken down in El Paso
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:38.080]  and they were also telling me
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:40.080]  he's got a country album coming out soon
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:42.080]  and he's going to send us a copy
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:44.080]  so we'll definitely have him on for that
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:46.080]  but you said you'd want to come back soon
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:48.080]  you'd even get into the bushes and their bloodline
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:50.080]  so Al give us one minute on that
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.080]  and then we'll let you go because you're busy
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:54.080]  Well, George H.W.
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:56.080]  was not the start of like the
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:58.080]  CIA as we speak
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:00.080]  and funny how
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:02.080]  when he was vice president
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:04.080]  Reagan tried to get assassinated
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:06.080]  and it's funny how when Reagan
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:08.080]  said there's no way George
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:10.080]  was the president candidate
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:12.080]  he met with the Trilateral Commission
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:14.080]  and the next day George Bush
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:16.080]  was his vice president candidate
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:18.080]  and then he tried to get assassinated a year later
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:20.080]  because they just wanted to put George
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:22.080]  in line
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.080]  his father was Prescott Bush
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:26.080]  senator of Maine and the head of UBS bank
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:28.080]  which funded the
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:30.080]  entire Nazi war effort
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:32.080]  well not entirely because
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:34.080]  Kors and Volkswagen and Krupp
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:36.080]  and a lot of other German companies
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:38.080]  doing their share but
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:40.080]  it was the U.S. Army
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:42.080]  and anyways we'll go into that next time
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.080]  but I've got the whole lineage of the Bush family
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:46.080]  on record
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:48.080]  so we'll talk again
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.080]  well Al I appreciate you coming on
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.080]  and we'll talk to you soon
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:54.080]  alright Alex it's been a pleasure
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:56.080]  and I'm a big fan

[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:08.080]  alright and Austin too thank you
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.080]  wow I tell you
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:12.080]  I remember being a teenager in college
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:14.080]  listening to ministry and I still listen to it
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:16.080]  and we played his bumper music here sometimes on the show
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:18.080]  and just amazing having him on
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:20.080]  I apologize to Bob Chapman

[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:36.080]  of what really is important in the news
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:38.080]  I read it religiously a lot of it's also
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:40.080]  some of our news articles and research
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:42.080]  Bob listening to
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:44.080]  Al from ministry
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.080]  he thinks there's going to be a total collapse
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:48.080]  so why would you want golden silver
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.080]  and I know they're still listening what would you
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:52.080]  say to them
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:54.080]  well even if there's a total
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:56.080]  collapse it's going to have to be
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:58.080]  some way that people can
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:00.080]  communicate with one another plus
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.080]  there's the business of living
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:04.080]  shelter
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:06.080]  food
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:08.080]  access to clean fresh water
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.080]  and
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.080]  probably
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:14.080]  gas
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:16.080]  or something to start fires with
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:18.080]  and these are the things that people think about
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:20.080]  when they think about
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:22.080]  having problems breakdowns
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:24.080]  in society and so
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:26.080]  an easy way
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:28.080]  to
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.080]  get things from one another
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:32.080]  is to have
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:34.080]  golden silver coins
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:36.080]  and a great variety of them as well
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:38.080]  and
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:40.080]  of course there's the investment value
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:42.080]  during the interim period
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  and so
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.080]  there's plenty to get ready for
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:48.080]  and I think
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.080]  that what you had to say Alex
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:52.080]  was perfectly correct
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.080]  and I'll just add a little bit
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:56.080]  to it
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:58.080]  for me it's really simple
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.080]  I don't believe there's going to be a total
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:02.080]  collapse we are going to be in a long term
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:04.080]  globalist post-industrial
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:06.080]  depression that will never end
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:08.080]  as they make us wards of the state
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:10.080]  unless we beat them but I know
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:12.080]  we're going to beat them and they have
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:14.080]  psychically wounded the world
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:16.080]  with the fake Christian end of the world
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:18.080]  stuff that's government financed
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:20.080]  Rockefeller financed on record
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:22.080]  world council of churches
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.080]  and with the 2012
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:26.080]  August agnostics
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.080]  and New Agers
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:30.080]  and of course things are imploding on 2012
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.080]  they've always planned to do it that way
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:34.080]  I don't think it's an asteroid
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:36.080]  this is their move to implode the global economy
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:38.080]  and the Rand Corporation said 12 years ago
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:40.080]  get rid of posicomintatus
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:42.080]  we're going to need it
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:44.080]  through the economic implosion that they designed
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:48.080]  and that's all correct
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.080]  and we're in the middle of it right now
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:52.080]  and how long it will last nobody knows
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:54.080]  you could be right it could last
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:56.080]  for years and years
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:58.080]  but I do know that they're facing
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:00.080]  some very difficult problems
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:02.080]  and
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:04.080]  if they can't overcome them
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:06.080]  and they continue to get exposed
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:08.080]  as to what they're up to
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:10.080]  and what they're
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:12.080]  in the game is
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.080]  then by the time they get there
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:16.080]  the people aren't going to buy it
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:20.080]  well
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:22.080]  I am going to
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:24.080]  the globalist
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:26.080]  we have unlimited resources
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:28.080]  humanity has developed so many technologies
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:30.080]  that they've shelved
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:32.080]  and they admitted their own documents
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:34.080]  they are purposefully cutting off the resources
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:36.080]  to the globe
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:38.080]  they are purposefully blocking people getting solar power
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.080]  at their homes
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:42.080]  they are purposefully getting us in a dependent
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:44.080]  position
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:46.080]  Bob I want to get into the old debt ceiling
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:48.080]  the latest huge developments
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.080]  we are on the march
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:52.080]  the empire is on the run
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:54.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:56.080]  radio network

[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:00.080]  this is Alex Jones
[02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:02.080]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:04.080]  to spot savings
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:06.080]  opportunity and recognize risk
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:08.080]  saving means to make money
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:10.080]  the cow been pure soap company
[02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:12.080]  can save you thousands of dollars
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:14.080]  and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:16.080]  that are triple concentrated
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:18.080]  and twice as good as what you are using now
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:20.080]  soaps made from vegetable
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:22.080]  and coconut oils
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:24.080]  that contain no useless dyes
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:26.080]  perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:28.080]  your risk is the hundreds of
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:30.080]  hazardous toxic detergents
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:32.080]  that give you rashes
[02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:34.080]  itching sores
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:36.080]  and deteriorating clothing called lint
[02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:38.080]  if you want something better
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:40.080]  if you want something you've never had before
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:42.080]  you have to do something you've never done before
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:44.080]  getting a free catalog is easy

[02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:34.080]  remember the government doesn't own the sun
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:36.080]  so go to mysolarbackup.com

[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:06.080]  when you're out on the road
[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:08.080]  the last place you want to be is on the road
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:10.080]  but if the unfortunate happens
[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:12.080]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:16.080]  there's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:20.080]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:24.080]  they so pride in every stitch
[02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:28.080]  guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:32.080]  they put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:34.080]  where you need it most
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:38.080]  blue diamond gussets got it
[02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:40.080]  others don't
[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:42.080]  we turned jeans inside out
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:44.080]  diamond gusset jeans
[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:46.080]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.080]  our Defender motorcycle jeans
[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:50.080]  combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:52.080]  so you can ride all day with confidence
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:56.080]  order yours at gusset.com
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:58.080]  and gusset jeans got it
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:00.080]  others don't
[02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:08.080]  well we had Al Jorgensen on
[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:10.080]  for an hour and a half
[02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:12.080]  Friday special here
[02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:14.080]  and I didn't know what to expect from that
[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:16.080]  ended up getting in contact
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:18.080]  with his little bird here in Austin
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:22.080]  and that was a fun interview
[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:25.080]  that guy has seen a lot of things
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:29.080]  we didn't even get into one-tenth of his exploits
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:32.080]  but you know it's important to have guests on like that
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:35.080]  from time to time because
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:38.080]  it then also reaches out to an even wider audience
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:41.080]  and of course that's why he came on this broadcast as well
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:45.080]  now Bob Chapman was formerly in military intelligence
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:47.080]  of course fighting the Russians
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:49.080]  then over the years he became the biggest private
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:51.080]  silver and gold broker
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:53.080]  in the world
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:55.080]  then of course he had the largest
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:56.080]  most successful newsletter
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:57.080]  a lot of folks claim that
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:33:59.080]  but you can go back to the history he did
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:01.080]  he helped publish of course the seminal book
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:04.080]  that I don't know it was like 6-7 million copies out there
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:06.080]  none dare call it conspiracy with Gary Allen
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.080]  he published the
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:11.080]  Gary Allen report
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:13.080]  just want you to know the great work
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:16.080]  of Bob Chapman and he's been forced of course
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:18.080]  due to harassment and things
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:21.080]  to take himself out of the United States
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:23.080]  to live to fight another day
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.080]  and he joins us now
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:27.080]  Bob I want to get into the economy
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:29.080]  but Paul Watson's listening right now
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:31.080]  because he's going to do an article so is Aaron
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:33.080]  and they want me to decipher
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:35.080]  this happens a lot
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:37.080]  you know the guys bring me research
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:39.080]  but then when I've researched something I kind of
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:41.080]  call them or write out notes and they do the research
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:43.080]  to confirm everything I've said and do an article
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:47.080]  but I've got some big breaking news here
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:50.080]  that quite frankly
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:52.080]  I couldn't even really think
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  during the last few interviews
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:56.080]  with Dillingpole and Jorgensen
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:58.080]  because I was so upset by this
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:00.080]  what I've learned
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:02.080]  what the ATF is doing
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:04.080]  this is such hardcore tyranny
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:06.080]  and so in about 5 minutes
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:08.080]  I'm going to get into this report Bob
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.080]  and then get your take on it
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:12.080]  but we're multitasking here on air
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:14.080]  because Watson's waiting right now so is Aaron
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:16.080]  for this breakdown
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.080]  and then I want you to add to it of course
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:20.080]  just as much as I see her even more
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:22.080]  and we'll glean the key to it
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:24.080]  that's hidden in plain view
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:26.080]  that no one in the mainstream media
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:28.080]  is putting out via deception
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:30.080]  but the ATF is
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:32.080]  we knew about this quietly going on a year ago
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:34.080]  by word of mouth
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:36.080]  they were just ordering it
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:38.080]  then it came out July 11th
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:40.080]  they were doing it in the Associated Press
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.080]  and then now we've got the letters that went out
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:44.080]  after the AP article
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:46.080]  on July 12th
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:48.080]  July 11th when they first put it out
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:50.080]  and we have the aftermath
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:52.080]  when you buy guns down
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:54.080]  the ATF is visiting
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:56.080]  your house as a form of intimidation
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:58.080]  against lawful behavior
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:00.080]  but that's not even the issue
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:02.080]  I mean it's big but it pales
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:04.080]  next to them doing this outside of law
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:06.080]  they're just doing it
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:08.080]  it's called authoritarianism
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:10.080]  dictatorial
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:12.080]  tyranny but Bob
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:14.080]  I'm going to try to just shut up for 5 minutes
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:16.080]  on the debt ceiling the economy
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:18.080]  what's really going on
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:20.080]  Ron Paul says the Republican plan will destroy us
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.080]  the Obama plan will destroy us
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:24.080]  they create this false debate
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:26.080]  where people pick a side
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.080]  when they're bought and paid for by the same people
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:30.080]  so Bob you've got the floor please give us an economic breakdown
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:34.080]  well I think
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:36.080]  the summit the whole thing
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:38.080]  you have within the
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:40.080]  Republican ranks
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  the Tea Party people
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:44.080]  elected some 87
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:46.080]  of them
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:48.080]  and they're pulling on one direction
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:50.080]  saying well we want long term solutions
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:52.080]  and
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:54.080]  we want certain things
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.080]  in the
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:58.080]  language of legislation
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:00.080]  on the other side you have the
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:02.080]  Democrats on the left
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.080]  who
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:06.080]  back the president
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:08.080]  but there's one issue that most of them
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:10.080]  don't back them on
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:12.080]  and this is very interesting
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:14.080]  and I don't think
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:16.080]  many people caught on to this
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:18.080]  you know they could have voted on this
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:20.080]  and they could have gone through
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:22.080]  with some cuts
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:24.080]  I mean they went from 9 trillion dollars for 10 years
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:26.080]  down to 1.7
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:28.080]  it's
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:30.080]  ridiculous it's not even
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:32.080]  a bill but what's behind
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:34.080]  this is
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:36.080]  the most important thing they want to
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.080]  accomplish and if they can't
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:40.080]  get that accomplished in the next few days
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:42.080]  there will be an extension
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:44.080]  and they can legally make an extension
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:46.080]  and what they're after here
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:48.080]  is
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:50.080]  cutting Social Security and Medicare
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:52.080]  this is what they're after
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:54.080]  they'll start off by doing that
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:56.080]  then they will increase
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:58.080]  the reductions
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:00.080]  in those two areas
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:02.080]  that means older people
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.080]  and probably
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:06.080]  70, 75, 80 percent of them
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:08.080]  live on Social Security
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:10.080]  and if they're cutting it back
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:12.080]  we have inflation at the same time
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:14.080]  which is now running 10.6 percent
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:16.080]  and it's going to get lots worse
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:18.080]  they're going to be in a position
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:20.080]  those retirees
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:22.080]  where they just can't eat
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.080]  and that's going to affect their health
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.080]  now on the other side of that
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:28.080]  we have
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:30.080]  the Medicare issue
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:32.080]  and not only are they going to cut back
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:34.080]  but they're going to have their death panels as well
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:36.080]  so you don't eat
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:38.080]  you get sick
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:40.080]  they take a look at you, you're 82 years old
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:42.080]  they think maybe you'll live another
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:44.080]  four years
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:46.080]  and it's going to cost them half a million dollars a year
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:48.080]  they're not going to treat you
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:50.080]  they're going to go home
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:52.080]  and try to take the best care of yourself you can
[02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:54.080]  because we don't have the money to treat you
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:56.080]  and once the public is sold on an idea
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:58.080]  we then go into the British phase
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:00.080]  where they go no cataract surgery
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:02.080]  no knee surgery
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:04.080]  no life into a national health service
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:06.080]  and they ration it, it is eugenics
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:08.080]  and I read the article in the first hour
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:10.080]  where they're not even doing basic medical care
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:12.080]  yeah that tumor is 100 percent operable, die
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:14.080]  just go home and die
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:16.080]  but it's 100 percent operable
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:18.080]  but if you wait six months I'm going to die
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:20.080]  sorry, go die
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:22.080]  I mean it's so cold blooded
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:24.080]  imagine the government running our healthcare
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.080]  I'm sorry Bob go ahead
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:28.080]  well you're right Alex
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:30.080]  and I want to impress upon the people
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:32.080]  that
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:34.080]  the people who today
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:36.080]  are 55 or older
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:38.080]  they're going to get rid of you as quickly
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:40.080]  as possible
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:42.080]  to save money
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.080]  and then during the interim when they're cutting all this money out
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:46.080]  a good part of it will go to the
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:48.080]  military industrial complex
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:50.080]  so that we can have more wars
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:52.080]  which will get
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:54.080]  people's minds thinking in a different
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.080]  direction as well as great
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:58.080]  profits for these companies
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:00.080]  and also
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:02.080]  they will
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:04.080]  continue to cut back
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:06.080]  in the availability of medicines
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:08.080]  I mean we've seen a lot of reports just in
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:10.080]  the last few months where hospitals
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:12.080]  can't get this, that and the other thing
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:14.080]  and sometimes it's because they don't have
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:16.080]  the money to pay for
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:18.080]  the things
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:20.080]  outside the country, Greece is a good example
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:22.080]  they own millions and they
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.080]  they can't get any more drugs
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:26.080]  and things that they need to save people's lives
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:28.080]  and so this is where they
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:30.080]  had it, they're going to use the money someplace else
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:32.080]  they're going to cut back
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:34.080]  and they're going to get rid of people
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:36.080]  and so this is what this is all about
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:38.080]  and they want to make that
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:40.080]  part of the package
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:42.080]  and then the Republicans have a debate with Obama
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:44.080]  when there's not much real difference in the plan
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:46.080]  so people think that's the only
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:48.080]  choices instead of riding off the
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:50.080]  1.5 quadrillion
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:52.080]  getting back to Congress controlling the currency
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:54.080]  slashing taxes across
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:56.080]  the board raising interest rates
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:58.080]  we'd be boom town
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:00.080]  I mean the globalists admit and document for document
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:02.080]  as you know Bob, their problem is keeping
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:04.080]  economy slow
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:06.080]  consolidating them, they're waging war
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:08.080]  against the engine of wealth that is
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:10.080]  liberty. Absolutely
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:12.080]  and you
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:14.080]  couldn't have put it any better
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:16.080]  and so for those of you
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:18.080]  who didn't know, that's what they're up to
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:20.080]  and the debt extension
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:22.080]  is expose factor
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:24.080]  they're going to do that
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:26.080]  but when, when they get what they want
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:28.080]  and they may not get what they want
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:30.080]  because everybody in the Beltway knows
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:32.080]  what they're up to
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:34.080]  and the fellows who are conservative to
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:36.080]  right wing, you might call them
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:38.080]  Tea Party people
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:40.080]  they're not going to put up with that
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:42.080]  and the leftists are going to say, hey
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:44.080]  wait a minute, you know, my constituency
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:46.080]  three quarters of the people
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:48.080]  around Social Security and Medicare
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:50.080]  you're going to be kidding me, I can't vote for that
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:52.080]  and so
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:54.080]  they're at loggerheads here and this is what's holding
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:56.080]  everything up and they're not going to tell
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:58.080]  you about it, certainly not the media
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:00.080]  which they control and that's what the game is
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:02.080]  all about. In fact, the interpretation
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.080]  of this is so widespread
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:06.080]  in differences
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:08.080]  it's
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:10.080]  surprising right now
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:12.080]  Gold and Silver are up
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:14.080]  as a reflection of there's not going to be a deal
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:16.080]  and
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:18.080]  the Gold and Silver shares are down
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:20.080]  because the traders think
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:22.080]  in the shares
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:24.080]  there is going to be a deal and it just shows
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:26.080]  you how confused these people are
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:30.080]  Bob, what does it signify
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.080]  that in the middle of the summer, you've been in this business 50 years
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:34.080]  but in the middle of the summer
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:36.080]  that's very rare to have Gold and Silver spiking
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:38.080]  I would guess, correct me if I'm wrong
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:40.080]  it'll probably go up a little bit more
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:42.080]  then go down a little but then we're going to see
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.080]  2000, I mean
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.080]  a couple years ago you said $2,000 Gold
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:48.080]  is easy in the next 2-3 years
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:50.080]  people laughed at it now it's happened
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:52.080]  you predicted with total precision
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:54.080]  3-4 months ago you said
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:56.080]  they're saying no QE3, baloney
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:58.080]  they're already doing it quietly with
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.080]  monetization and now
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:02.080]  he said yes, we're going to probably do QE3
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:04.080]  I mean you really
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:06.080]  are the most on target person
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:08.080]  that we interview so where do you see
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:10.080]  Gold going?
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:12.080]  If you look
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:14.080]  at the base that was formed in Silver
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:16.080]  Silver being the leader of the pack
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:18.080]  right now
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:20.080]  you will see it tested 8 times
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:22.080]  the $32.5
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:24.080]  to $36 level
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:26.080]  now normally
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:28.080]  and Gold tested and held as well
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:30.080]  now normally if a test 2 or 3 times
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:32.080]  it's terrific
[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:34.080]  4 times unusual
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:36.080]  8 times
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:38.080]  very seldom
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:40.080]  and if you look back in history
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:42.080]  about the formations of support
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:44.080]  you will find
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:46.080]  that is usually
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:48.080]  followed by an increase
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:50.080]  of 100 to 150%
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:52.080]  in Gold and Silver
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.080]  so it's as simple as that
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:56.080]  so 16 to 16 to $3200
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:58.080]  announced
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:00.080]  and 35 and 35 or 70
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:02.080]  and that's where they're going
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:04.080]  on the short term and that's
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:06.080]  why one of the reasons why
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:08.080]  we're having a spiking in Gold and Silver
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:10.080]  unusually, unusual
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:12.080]  in the summer
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:14.080]  number 2, the other reasons
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:16.080]  are
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:18.080]  Gold is real money
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:20.080]  and people have realized it
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:22.080]  and they are abandoning other currencies
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:24.080]  the only exception is Swiss franc
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:26.080]  they look at Europe it's a dog's breakfast
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:28.080]  they look at the United States it's a disaster
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:30.080]  who would want to hold those currencies
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:32.080]  and the rest of the world just follows
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:34.080]  so you have Gold
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:36.080]  replacing the dollar
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:38.080]  is the world reserve currency it's been going on
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.080]  for three years
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:42.080]  number 3 is inflation
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:44.080]  10.6%
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.080]  that's the result of QE1
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:48.080]  and
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:50.080]  stimulus 1
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:52.080]  next year we'll get the result
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:54.080]  of stimulus 2 and QE2
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:56.080]  that'll take us up to 25 or 30%
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:58.080]  and if we get a good strong QE3
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:00.080]  of 2.3 trillion
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:02.080]  which I think we will
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:04.080]  then we're looking at 50%
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:06.080]  well what about with
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:08.080]  cook numbers
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.080]  they're claiming that growth is 1.8
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:12.080]  when you add in real inflation
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:14.080]  am I correct to say that's a negative economy
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.080]  growth of 8%
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:18.080]  or is it 6%
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:20.080]  well first of all
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:22.080]  you can use inflation and back out of it
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:24.080]  and by doing that
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:26.080]  you're saying
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:28.080]  of that 1.8%
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:30.080]  1.8%
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:32.080]  was caused by inflation
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:34.080]  so we get zero but
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:36.080]  we just had
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:38.080]  about
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:40.080]  1.8 trillion that we know of
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:42.080]  that was pumped in the economy
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:44.080]  by the Fed and by the
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:46.080]  legislature and under the $62 billion
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:48.080]  and let me correct that
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:50.080]  so if we hadn't had that
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:52.080]  where would it be
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:54.080]  it'd be minus 5%
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:56.080]  so your point is well taken
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:58.080]  and earlier today they were saying 1.8
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:00.080]  now the government's adjusted to 1.3
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:02.080]  and of course they claim unemployment
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:04.080]  10%
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:06.080]  or lower when the main line
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.080]  outfits say 22%, 23%
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:10.080]  California 30%
[02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:12.080]  now listen here's the deal
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:14.080]  earlier out of the gates
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:16.080]  Al said look I'm a big fan
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:18.080]  but I think the end of the world's basically coming
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:20.080]  and this gold thing's dumb
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:22.080]  and I think you ought to sell it
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:24.080]  and I said okay come on here and say that
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.080]  because I know he's listening too
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:28.080]  and he's not a bad guy I want to explain this to people
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:30.080]  look we said by gold
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:32.080]  when it was 300
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:34.080]  and it's 1600 and something
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:36.080]  we said by silver when it was 5
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:38.080]  it's 40 something listen it's a law
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:40.080]  of economics
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:42.080]  throughout 6000 years of the court
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:44.080]  history that when governments hyperinflate
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:46.080]  the currencies commodities
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:48.080]  explode namely gold and silver so
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.080]  again
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:52.080]  they can manipulate things down in short
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:54.080]  term they can always give
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:56.080]  gold or silver a haircut but it always races
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:46:58.080]  back up I wish
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:00.080]  that I could say folks dump your gold
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:02.080]  and silver because they're bringing back good
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:04.080]  monetary policy because I'd rather have an economy
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:06.080]  and be in a good
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:08.080]  position we're saying gold and silver
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:10.080]  because we're in a desperate situation
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:12.080]  and because it's been engineered
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:14.080]  and it's not a panacea
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:16.080]  but it's the best thing out there
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:18.080]  if your ship's going under and you've just got
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:20.080]  some broken planks
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:22.080]  to get on that's what you've got
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:24.080]  it's not another ocean liner to jump on
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:26.080]  but it's not perfect
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:28.080]  and yeah the government could try to come take it
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:30.080]  the government you know it's like saying don't have kids
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:32.080]  the CPS might try to come take them
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:34.080]  you know don't sail across on the Mayflower
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:36.080]  your kids may die when they get to Plymouth Rock
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:38.080]  well yeah half of them did die
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:40.080]  you know what I'm a Texan
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:42.080]  I'm an American I'm a trailblazer
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:44.080]  my ancestors were
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:46.080]  super hardcore get it done
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:48.080]  people and I'm a shadow of
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:50.080]  who they are growing up in this slob society
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:52.080]  but let me tell you
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:54.080]  let me tell you I've still got the
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.080]  feelings of greatness in me
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:58.080]  and so does everybody else listening
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:00.080]  and so stop thinking it's all over
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:02.080]  stop talking about blowing your head off
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:04.080]  stop talking about giving up
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:06.080]  it's exciting
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:08.080]  we've become blubber creatures
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:10.080]  because we've had it too easy
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:12.080]  this is part of the cycle
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:14.080]  it's going to be fun
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:16.080]  make it fun
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:18.080]  if they strike me down it's fun
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:20.080]  it's fun to be real
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:22.080]  it's fun to have fire
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:24.080]  it's fun to get to this ATF thing
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:26.080]  well obviously going to overdrive it
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:28.080]  Paul Watson standing by and so is Aaron
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:30.080]  for me to give them the breakdown of this
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:32.080]  and again they're smart as I am or smarter
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:34.080]  but on this they've asked me for a breakdown
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:36.080]  to do the article so I'll give you the breakdown
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:38.080]  of why this is so huge with the ATF
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:40.080]  but I want to bring Ted Anderson up here
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:42.080]  if you believe in what we're doing
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:44.080]  you should buy gold and silver from Midas Resources
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:46.080]  plus I know it's Ted's silver deal
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.080]  the brokers who are great guys
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:50.080]  all they're doing is taking calls for this deal
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:52.080]  and Ted's actually losing money on it
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:54.080]  two silver dollars
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:56.080]  a book that retails for 1995
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:58.080]  a film that retails for 995
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:00.080]  a film
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:02.080]  a book, two silver dollars
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:04.080]  and free shipping for $85
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:06.080]  that is losing money
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:08.080]  as a lost leader
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.080]  because Ted wants to get the word out
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:12.080]  I happen to know Ted behind the scenes
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:14.080]  is financing every type of libertarian organization
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:16.080]  spending all his money
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:18.080]  literally obsessed with these issues
[02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:20.080]  you'd call up and buy the other gold and silver deals
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:22.080]  where Ted makes 3-4%
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:24.080]  because hey, that's the thing
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:26.080]  is that we are free market people
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:28.080]  and if you believe in what we're doing buy my books
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:30.080]  buy my videos, buy them all
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:32.080]  but I'll tell you with these deals Ted's offering
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:34.080]  there is no profit
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:36.080]  and quite frankly the brokers are sick of taking
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.080]  half their phone calls for these deals
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:40.080]  where they can't actually try to make some money
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:42.080]  it's ridiculous
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:44.080]  it's ridiculous
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:46.080]  Ted buys gold and silver
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:48.080]  no one is going to race right back up
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:50.080]  he's busy now having to buy it out in the future
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:52.080]  six months because it's so hard to get
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:54.080]  and then he's competitive
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:56.080]  now the fifth biggest gold and silver broker
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:58.080]  in the US from nowhere
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:00.080]  30 years ago because he's
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:02.080]  competitive and he sells it to you
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:04.080]  when it's
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.080]  high
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:08.080]  at the old low price
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:10.080]  that's how Ted makes his little profit
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:12.080]  you add his 2, 3, 4, 5%
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:14.080]  of profit on it when the market's up
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:16.080]  ehhh
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:18.080]  if he was buying it now he'd be losing money
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:20.080]  this is a tiny margin business
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:22.080]  and it finances
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:24.080]  it finances what we do
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.080]  and quite frankly it doesn't finance much these days
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:28.080]  because he didn't make that much money
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:30.080]  even though he's selling tens of millions of dollars of gold
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:32.080]  he doesn't make a very big profit
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:34.080]  so you need to give Ted Anderson a call at
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:36.080]  800-686-2237
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:38.080]  800-686-237
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:40.080]  tell him I want the radio specials
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:42.080]  in fact there's no point with Ted sitting there to even
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:44.080]  show him now because I gotta come back with the ATF news
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:46.080]  with Bob Chapman and this is the big one
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:48.080]  but the point is I love it when I get attacked
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:50.080]  for promoting gold
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:52.080]  you know we got a new employee in there that told me a few years ago
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:54.080]  he bought gold and silver and that's the only reason he's a float
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:56.080]  financially because it went up in so much in price
[02:50:56.080 --> 02:50:58.080]  I'm proud of pitching gold
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.080]  I'm proud of the deals my disresources
[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:20.080]  offers I love it
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:48.080]  I'm proud of the deals my disresources
[02:51:48.080 --> 02:52:02.080]  I'm proud of the deals my disresources

[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:12.080]  of being poked pinched and gouged
[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:14.080]  while carrying concealed
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:16.080]  the super tucked deluxe is the most comfortable

[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:34.080]  have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers
[02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:36.080]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:38.080]  they've been available since 1986
[02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:40.080]  yet the financial industry won't recognize

[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:44.080]  gold has outperformed paper investments

[02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:08.080]  you know, we predicted everything
[02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:10.080]  the bailout was a robbery
[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:12.080]  we told you the economy would further implode
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:14.080]  it's all design, we have all their documents
[02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:16.080]  they've done it over and over again in other countries
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:18.080]  I'm watching these criminals do this stuff
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:20.080]  and I just
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:22.080]  it never ceases to amaze me
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:24.080]  that when you're right about stuff
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:26.080]  that's when you're bad, when you're wrong
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:28.080]  that's when you're good
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:30.080]  but with Bob Chapman
[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.080]  the main radio show is going to end in 5 minutes
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:34.080]  we're going into prismplanet.tv
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:36.080]  and internet stream overdrive
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:38.080]  into the next hour with Bob if you can do it
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:40.080]  I haven't even asked him yet
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:42.080]  I got so upset by this ATF news that I got
[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:44.080]  before the show today
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:46.080]  that
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:48.080]  I haven't even eaten today
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:50.080]  and I've been up since 6am
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:52.080]  and I just got a splitting headache
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:54.080]  oh, I haven't eaten yet
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:56.080]  I cut myself shaving folks
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:58.080]  and I don't even cover it up when I go on TV
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:00.080]  the point is
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:02.080]  is that I am beyond all this
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:04.080]  side garbage
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:06.080]  and the news I got
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:08.080]  is so lawless
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:10.080]  so evil
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:12.080]  let me just ask Bob before I go to this news
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:14.080]  and get his take on it
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:16.080]  Bob, can you stay 20 minutes to the next hour?
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:18.080]  yes
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:20.080]  okay, good, because I got you on late
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:22.080]  okay
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:24.080]  here's the deal
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:26.080]  okay
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:28.080]  let me just dig out this news item here
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:30.080]  and I'm looking for my Associated Press
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:32.080]  article
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:34.080]  I have something with it
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:36.080]  ATF require gun buyer information
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:38.080]  on border
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:40.080]  oh, on the border, that sounds reasonable
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:42.080]  when you read the headline
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:44.080]  no, this is from Texas
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:46.080]  all the way through to California
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:48.080]  Nevada, Arizona
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:50.080]  New Mexico
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:52.080]  no law
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:54.080]  they're just ordering gun shops
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:56.080]  if someone buys two or more guns
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:58.080]  to report on them
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:00.080]  now, this was secretly going on a year ago
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:02.080]  and then in July
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:04.080]  Obama announced
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:06.080]  and these are the issues
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:08.080]  because I'm looking for my
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:10.080]  notes that I
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:12.080]  wrote on this, here it is
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:14.080]  this is so big
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:16.080]  I can hardly talk
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:18.080]  and it just happens and it's like it's no big deal
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:20.080]  for everybody
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:22.080]  outside of law
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:24.080]  they make a secret rule
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:26.080]  last year and start ordering people
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:28.080]  to call the ATF
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:30.080]  they're already doing an instant check
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:32.080]  they already know how many guns they're buying
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:34.080]  they already do a background check with the FBI
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:36.080]  when you're there
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:38.080]  they check your driver's license, everything
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.080]  it's already registration
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:42.080]  why then do they do this?
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:44.080]  because it's about setting the precedent
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:46.080]  to be able to have the ATF
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:48.080]  set the precedent and Congress do nothing
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:50.080]  what did Obama say last year and this year
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:52.080]  he said don't worry to his base
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:54.080]  I'm not going to do it through Congress
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:56.080]  I'm going to do it quote by stealth
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:58.080]  I'm going to go after guns by stealth
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:00.080]  that's all over the news, this is it
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:02.080]  now he's talking about an executive order
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:04.080]  to put you on a no-gun buy list
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:06.080]  and he's going to do that in the next few weeks reportedly
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:08.080]  where they just signs an executive order
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:10.080]  and says what Rahm Emanuel called four years ago
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:12.080]  that we're going to put you on a no-gun buy list
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:14.080]  if we feel like it, no judge, no jury
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:16.080]  no reason why you got on
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:18.080]  can't find out why you got on
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:20.080]  so this is the start of this
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:22.080]  they're like okay we're going to order gun dealers
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:24.080]  to do something that's pointless
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:26.080]  that it makes them basically informants
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:28.080]  indentured servants
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:30.080]  like they're a crack dealer and the cops say
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:32.080]  we're not going to bust you
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:34.080]  Bill or John or whatever your name is
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:36.080]  but you have to
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:38.080]  start informing on people so they're treating them
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:40.080]  like criminals in this
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:42.080]  secret police thing it's a secret police
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:44.080]  where they show up
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:46.080]  and they tell them you've got to start
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:48.080]  reporting on people now here's the big news
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:50.080]  I've confirmed for multiple gun dealers
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:52.080]  and people in this office
[02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:54.080]  that when you
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:56.080]  it's happening to Austinites
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:58.080]  that when you buy two rifles
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:00.080]  which a lot of people do when you go to the gun shop
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:02.080]  I've bought three or four guns before
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:04.080]  I'm treating you like a criminal now
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:06.080]  the ATF comes to your house
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:08.080]  and demands to be let in without a warrant
[02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:10.080]  and starts intimidating you and asking you if you're a terrorist
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:12.080]  and it looks like they're doing it to libertarians
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:14.080]  and conservatives it's not the illegal aliens
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:16.080]  they ship the guns and that's the bigger issue
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:18.080]  they
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:20.080]  the government ship the guns
[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:22.080]  and they do the illegals
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:24.080]  to then blame the Second Amendment
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:26.080]  we told you about this over a year ago
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:28.080]  and now it's confirmed so they've got a lot of utzpa
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:30.080]  now
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:32.080]  they're harassing gun owners and treating them like criminals
[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:34.080]  they're operating outside of law
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:36.080]  this is gun control by stealth
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:38.080]  outside the law
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:40.080]  we're going to come back and give Bob's take on this
[02:58:40.080 --> 02:58:42.080]  and I have the letter I have the letter
[02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:44.080]  no one
[02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:46.080]  thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:48.080]  visit GCNlive.com
[02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:50.080]  today
[02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:52.080]  you may be arrested
[02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:54.080]  and or subject to other police action
[02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:56.080]  tyranny is here
[02:58:56.080 --> 02:58:58.080]  the grim future foretold in 1984
[02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:00.080]  has become reality
[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:02.080]  it really says that the state is god
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:04.080]  the united states is now recognized globally
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:06.080]  as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:08.080]  on earth
[02:59:08.080 --> 02:59:10.080]  this film conclusively proves the existence
[02:59:10.080 --> 02:59:12.080]  of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:14.080]  now being expanded nationwide
[02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:16.080]  this documentary exposes
[02:59:16.080 --> 02:59:18.080]  how the continuity of government
[02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:20.080]  program has established an all powerful
[02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:22.080]  shadow state
[02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:24.080]  police state 4 chronicles the sickening depth
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:26.080]  to which our republic has fallen
[02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:28.080]  prepare to enter the secret of world
[02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:30.080]  of emergency dictatorship
[02:59:30.080 --> 02:59:32.080]  body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies
[02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:34.080]  stage terror
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:36.080]  and cameras on every street corner
[02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:38.080]  it's only the beginning of the new world orders
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:40.080]  hellish plan
[02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:42.080]  the police state isn't coming
[02:59:42.080 --> 02:59:44.080]  it's here
[02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:46.080]  at infowars.com

[02:59:54.080 --> 02:59:56.080]  direct from austin
[02:59:56.080 --> 02:59:58.080]  you're listening to the alex jones
[02:59:58.080 --> 03:00:00.080]  broadcasting network
[03:00:06.080 --> 03:00:08.080]  alright 20 minutes to overdrive with bob
[03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:10.080]  chatman if you just joined us i'm going to continue
[03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:12.080]  breaking this down
[03:00:12.080 --> 03:00:14.080]  but it's par for the course
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:16.080]  and what is the headline
[03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:18.080]  at the drudge report
[03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:20.080]  i have a secret plan on the debt ceiling
[03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:22.080]  well they've already told us it's 14th amendment
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:24.080]  reconstruction powers but not against the states
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:26.080]  it's presidential dictatorship
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:28.080]  of eluces s grant against the congress
[03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:30.080]  launching wars without congress
[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:32.080]  carbon taxes without congress
[03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:34.080]  gun control without congress
[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:36.080]  without law
[03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:38.080]  and then gun ride scripts are like
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:40.080]  well yeah the atf says now we got to do this
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:42.080]  it's about training you to do what they say
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:44.080]  and i'm going to get i'm going to read the letter
[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:46.080]  that's never been seen it's going to be published at prismplanet.com
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:48.080]  and infowars.com
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:50.080]  from an austin gun dealer
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:52.080]  and again the bigger story here is not even that they're doing this outside law
[03:00:52.080 --> 03:00:54.080]  they're coming and harassing
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:56.080]  and treating like criminals people that go through
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:58.080]  the instant check and go through the already
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:00.080]  unconstitutional garbage
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:02.080]  bob am i right to be completely freaked out by this
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:04.080]  oh absolutely
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:06.080]  and it's happening in many fields as you pointed out
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.080]  it's the abrogation of the constitution
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:10.080]  and i was
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:12.080]  watching judgment
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:14.080]  napolitano
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:16.080]  the other day
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:18.080]  and he said that
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:20.080]  the ability
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:22.080]  of the president
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:24.080]  to use executive order
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:26.080]  to
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:28.080]  extend the debt
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:30.080]  commitment of the government
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:32.080]  is totally unconstitutional
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:34.080]  and so we have one unconstitutional act
[03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:36.080]  after another
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:38.080]  and everybody in congress just stands there
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:40.080]  and does nothing but the exception
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:42.080]  of a handful of people
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:44.080]  and the reason why is they've all been paid off
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:46.080]  they've sold us out
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:48.080]  it's dreadful
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:50.080]  and it's going to continue
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:52.080]  you know i can remember the first run on i had with ATF
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:54.080]  and it wasn't with
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:56.080]  me
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:58.080]  what they were doing was going around
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:00.080]  and trying to find
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:02.080]  people who knew me
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:04.080]  so that they could threaten them
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:06.080]  to spy on me
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:08.080]  now we're talking
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:10.080]  1960s
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:12.080]  1970s
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:14.080]  and they went so far
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:16.080]  in front of mine
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:18.080]  who is now deceased
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:20.080]  who was a gun dealer
[03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:22.080]  in a gunsmith
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:24.080]  etc
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:26.080]  they went into the story head
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:28.080]  in glendale california
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:30.080]  two of them
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:32.080]  from the ATF
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:34.080]  and they told him he was to spy on me
[03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:36.080]  and
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:38.080]  he was older at that time
[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:40.080]  and
[03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:42.080]  had that steel armor in his mind
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:44.080]  as well as his body
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:46.080]  and he said
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:48.080]  i'll tell you what
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:50.080]  this is the last guy in the world
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:52.080]  that you want
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:54.080]  that i would want to spy on
[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:56.080]  and he's a friend of mine
[03:02:56.080 --> 03:02:58.080]  he said if i were you guys
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:03:00.080]  i would get out of here and go try to pursue
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:02.080]  something else because there's nothing
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:04.080]  that he's doing to try
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:06.080]  well he never saw them again
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:08.080]  but the point is this
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:10.080]  this has been going on for years
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:12.080]  and you as usual cut directly to the issue
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:14.080]  if you study criminal investigations
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:16.080]  and things and how intelligence
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:18.080]  agencies operate they are now
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:20.080]  outside of law
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:22.080]  with this government
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:24.080]  order from obama without law
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:26.080]  saying we're going to start going and demanding
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:28.080]  that secret forms be filled out
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:30.080]  on all your customers
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:32.080]  and if they go along with this
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:34.080]  it's going to be more and more
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:36.080]  this is how they operate
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:38.080]  and this is turning them all
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:40.080]  into confidential informants
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:42.080]  to act like gun purchases
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:44.080]  are illegal when they already know
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:46.080]  exactly what guns people are getting
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:48.080]  and how many through the FBI
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:50.080]  nicks it's about saying
[03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:52.080]  we do things outside congress
[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:54.080]  as obama said
[03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:56.080]  we're going to get the guns by stealth
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:58.080]  they're doing it and they're testing
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:00.080]  and they will, they've announced
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:02.080]  they're going to announce an executive order
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:04.080]  and the gun grabbers
[03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:06.080]  it's going to be a no gun by list
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:08.080]  just like the no fly list
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:10.080]  that the chief of staff
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:12.080]  said they would do
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:14.080]  they're doing it
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:16.080]  and they're terrorists
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:18.080]  that ship the guns into Mexico
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:20.080]  that have killed three border patrol
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:22.080]  and five cops at least
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:24.080]  to then blame it on the second amendment
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:26.080]  and when they get caught
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:28.080]  they go ahead with it bob
[03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:30.080]  that's the issues
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:32.080]  and then when they put me on that list
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:34.080]  and I can't buy any guns
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:36.080]  I know where to get them
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:38.080]  I'll go to the Naco Traficantes down in Mexico
[03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:40.080]  and they can sell them to me
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:42.080]  because they got them from the BATF
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:44.080]  from the first place
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:46.080]  it's unbelievable bob stay there
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:48.080]  stay there, I want to get more into the economy
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:50.080]  but finish up with this ATF
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:52.080]  on the other side
[03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:54.080]  they're muscling and threatening gun dealers
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:56.080]  to do things they tell them
[03:04:56.080 --> 03:04:58.080]  and you got a mafia
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:00.080]  gun grabbing creature
[03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:24.080]  we have everything for true total preparedness
[03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:50.080]  we have everything for true total preparedness
[03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:52.080]  we have everything for true total preparedness
[03:05:52.080 --> 03:06:20.080]  you have everything for true total preparedness
[03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:24.580]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at infowars.com
[03:06:24.580 --> 03:06:31.580]  You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level
[03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:35.080]  We need your help to spread the word like never before
[03:06:35.080 --> 03:06:41.080]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness
[03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:45.080]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[03:06:45.080 --> 03:06:51.080]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination
[03:06:51.080 --> 03:06:54.080]  The war is here, it's an info war
[03:06:54.080 --> 03:07:00.580]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984
[03:07:00.580 --> 03:07:04.080]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor
[03:07:04.080 --> 03:07:07.580]  Both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician, Doc asks
[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:15.080]  Why does the United States spend more money on healthcare by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:07:15.080 --> 03:07:21.080]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life
[03:07:21.080 --> 03:07:28.080]  and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition, not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects
[03:07:28.080 --> 03:07:30.080]  This is clearly a deadly recipe
[03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:34.080]  The good news is Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans
[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:39.080]  who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system
[03:07:39.080 --> 03:07:43.080]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare
[03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:47.080]  and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message
[03:07:47.080 --> 03:07:52.080]  Visit infowarsteam.com and listen to Dr. Wallach's deadly recipes lecture
[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:56.080]  It makes a lot of sense and I want you to join our info wars team
[03:07:56.080 --> 03:08:01.080]  Go to infowarsteam.com, that's infowarsteam.com
[03:08:01.080 --> 03:08:04.080]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk
[03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:08.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[03:08:18.080 --> 03:08:24.080]  When you go up to PrismPlanet.tv where we've been streaming the live radio show today in video living color
[03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:31.080]  You'll notice there were two shows yesterday, not just a three hour 30 minute radio show
[03:08:31.080 --> 03:08:41.080]  but also a two hour TV show, an info war special report, not the new show but a round table discussion
[03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:46.080]  with Mike Adams of Natural News and of course Sheriff Richard Mack
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:51.080]  and that's an example of things to come and what we're doing
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:56.080]  I'm normal, I'm normal
[03:08:56.080 --> 03:09:00.080]  It's normal when you've studied history, when the government is announcing
[03:09:00.080 --> 03:09:03.080]  now we're going to start censoring the internet anytime we want
[03:09:03.080 --> 03:09:06.080]  Yeah, we're going to make ISP store all the data on you and give it to us without warrants
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:09.080]  That's going to the House of Representatives
[03:09:09.080 --> 03:09:12.080]  Yeah, we're going to go into more debt to foreign banks
[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:14.080]  Yeah, we're going to steal the pension funds
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:17.080]  Yeah, we're going to raise the taxes and cut the services
[03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:21.080]  Yeah, we're going to have the ATF ship guns into Mexico
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:26.080]  publicly blame the Second Amendment and then have them outside of law
[03:09:26.080 --> 03:09:30.080]  under a federal order
[03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:34.080]  In fact, give me a document cam shot please on this right now for PrismPlanet.tv viewers
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.080]  It's about to go up on infoworks.com and prismplanet.com
[03:09:38.080 --> 03:09:40.080]  They say we are now ordering
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:43.080]  Now remember they tried this last year without even having an order
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:45.080]  They just said you will report to us, here's where you do it
[03:09:45.080 --> 03:09:49.080]  when somebody buys two or more rifles
[03:09:49.080 --> 03:09:51.080]  Again, you're already having your background checked
[03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:53.080]  You're not a criminal, they don't have any other law
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:56.080]  Even though Congress passed an unconstitutional law
[03:09:56.080 --> 03:09:58.080]  Again, let me have a close shot here
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:02.080]  Even though Congress passed an unconstitutional law, the point is it's the law
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:04.080]  But they don't have a law on this front
[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:07.080]  So, giving you a document cam shot of this article
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:09.080]  We can zoom in a little bit more please
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:12.080]  U.S. Department of Justice
[03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:15.080]  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
[03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:17.080]  Washington, D.C.
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:19.080]  ATF.gov
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:22.080]  Dear Federal Firearms Licency
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:24.080]  A license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:26.080]  This is a 68 gun control act
[03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:31.080]  To assist its efforts in investigating and combating the illegal movement of firearms
[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:33.080]  Along and across the southwest border
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:39.080]  ATF is requesting licensed dealers and pawnbrokers in Arizona, California, and Mexico and Texas
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:47.080]  To submit records, information concerning multiple sales of certain rifles
[03:10:47.080 --> 03:10:50.080]  Okay, let me read that again, we're going to go to Bob
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:54.080]  To assist in its efforts in investigating, investigate yourself, you shipped them there
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:59.080]  Tens of thousands and combating the illegal movement of firearms across the southwest border
[03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:03.080]  ATF is requiring, there's no law that's just ordering you
[03:11:03.080 --> 03:11:07.080]  License dealers and pawnbrokers in Arizona, California, and Mexico and Texas
[03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:10.080]  If this stands, if Congress doesn't stop these criminals
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:13.080]  Who should all be in jail right now for doing this
[03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:16.080]  And perjuring themselves and being caught, then the sky's the limit
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:19.080]  That's what this is, they already know the guns, they already know who got what
[03:11:19.080 --> 03:11:23.080]  They just are seeing, hey, we're going to outside law tell you to do something
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:26.080]  That's how tyrants test you
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:30.080]  Is requiring licensed dealers and pawnbrokers in Arizona, California, and Mexico and Texas
[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:34.080]  To submit records, information concerning multiple sales of certain rifles
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:37.080]  And see, they need that call to open the investigation
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:41.080]  To use that as the probable reason to come harass you at your house or business
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:44.080]  They're doing it if you buy ammo now
[03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:49.080]  ATF has the authority to issue the letter to collect such record information
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:52.080]  From federal firearms licensees, FFLs
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:55.080]  Now listen, ATF has the authority to issue the letter
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:59.080]  To collect the record information from federal firearms licensees
[03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:04.080]  Under 18 USC 93 G5 and the authority has been delegated
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:08.080]  By the ATF acting director of the chief of national tracing center
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:14.080]  And it turns out that does not give them the authority to order someone as an indentured servant
[03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:17.080]  The law says an instant check
[03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:20.080]  The Supreme Court ruled on that in Mac vs. US
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:24.080]  You must submit to, this is just a total lie, a total fraud
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:29.080]  You must submit to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:32.080]  Report some multiple sales or other dispositions
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:34.080]  That means whatever they come and tell you
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:37.080]  Anything they tell you, see, it has a little caveat
[03:12:37.080 --> 03:12:40.080]  Report anything we say you work for us now
[03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:45.080]  Or other dispositions, whenever, at one time or during any five consecutive business days
[03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:49.080]  You sell or otherwise dispose of two or more semi-automatic rifles
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:51.080]  Cable of accepting a detachable magazine
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:54.080]  And with a caliber greater than 22
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:12:58.080]  Putting 223, 5.56 caliber to an unlicensed person
[03:12:58.080 --> 03:13:03.080]  You are required to report all such sales that occur on or after August
[03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:06.080]  You or the criminals get them, they break into your house to get them
[03:13:06.080 --> 03:13:10.080]  By August 14, 2011, now this has already been going on
[03:13:10.080 --> 03:13:13.080]  Even though this says it kicks in later, and here's the big news
[03:13:13.080 --> 03:13:18.080]  They are going to the houses of people and demanding without warrants to be let in to see the gods
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:23.080]  People are all too scared to talk about it and harassing them and getting them in their face
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:27.080]  You must continue reporting multiple sales for the rifle subject to this demand letter
[03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:31.080]  Until we provide a written notice to stop, just do what we say, you work for us now
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:34.080]  So this means licensed gun dealers now work for the government
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:37.080]  This is indentured servitude, read the Declaration of Independence
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:44.080]  You are now an enforcer for them, you're now a deputy dog of the dirty ATF
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:49.080]  Hard information must be submitted on ATF form 3310.12
[03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:52.080]  Report a multiple sale or other disposition of certain rifles
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:57.080]  No letter in the close of business on the day, the multiple sale or other disposition takes place
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:01.080]  And then they tell them in private, don't tell people we're having you do this either
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:05.080]  It's like they told folks, sell the guys to who we're sending to get them
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:07.080]  And don't say anything, we're going to videotape it
[03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:11.080]  It was their agent coming to get it anyways
[03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:16.080]  You have a form, you've got to fill out, be advised in addition to the record information required by this letter
[03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:20.080]  Licensees remain obliged to submit reports of multiple sales of other dispositions
[03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:25.080]  When the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of pistols or revolvers
[03:14:25.080 --> 03:14:27.080]  Or any combination thereof
[03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:32.080]  Oh, see the news is saying high powered rifles, really 22 above
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:36.080]  And now it's pistols and revolvers, that's other big news, that's not in the AP article
[03:14:36.080 --> 03:14:39.080]  This is basically all guns
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:44.080]  Bob Chapman again, I'm hyperventilating here because they're harassing the gun owners
[03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:50.080]  ATF harassing gun owners that buy two or more guns, handguns, rifles, you name it
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:55.080]  There's no law, they give a fake code
[03:14:55.080 --> 03:14:59.080]  Gun control by stealth outside the law
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:02.080]  And we can find the articles where they were already doing this last year
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:05.080]  Quote ordering them, it was like ATF orders the headline
[03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:13.080]  Gun dealers report people buying more than one gun, I think was the headline
[03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:16.080]  I mean, Bob, they can just do whatever they want under this
[03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:21.080]  And this signals the implementation by stealth that Obama said to his gun grabbers, don't worry
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:23.080]  I'm going to do this outside Congress
[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:27.080]  What should be done about this, Bob Chapman?
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:34.080]  Well, first of all, they're looking at all weapons, but particularly I think what they call assault weapons
[03:15:34.080 --> 03:15:41.080]  That's why that 5.56 millimeters is mentioned there
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:51.080]  The only thing you can do is go to Congressman and Senator and tell them that you don't want this sort of thing to happen
[03:15:51.080 --> 03:15:56.080]  It's wrong, it's illegal, and do something about it
[03:15:56.080 --> 03:16:02.080]  Well, it allows them to open criminal investigations on people that have done nothing wrong
[03:16:02.080 --> 03:16:05.080]  This is a witch hunt
[03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:08.080]  It's happening in many phases of government
[03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:13.080]  It's the evolutionary process that leads to dictatorial government
[03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:15.080]  And that's really what we've got
[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:19.080]  I mean, the President and even Congress looks the other way
[03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:23.080]  The President does all sorts of things that are illegal
[03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:27.080]  But nobody seems to care in Congress
[03:16:27.080 --> 03:16:29.080]  We have to make them care
[03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:36.080]  There are 37 people who just got elected by the Tea Party, so to speak
[03:16:36.080 --> 03:16:39.080]  Why don't we push them to stop this?
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:43.080]  I'm sure, first of all, they probably don't even know about it
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:45.080]  And it's up to you to tell them about it
[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:49.080]  In fact, I would draft a letter in three or four lines
[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:54.080]  The ATF is doing this, it's illegal, I want it stopped
[03:16:54.080 --> 03:16:58.080]  Well, here's the deal, the angle here is
[03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:03.080]  Obama's stealth gun control goes live
[03:17:03.080 --> 03:17:07.080]  Gun purchasers harassed
[03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:13.080]  Obama launches a witch hunt against US gun owners
[03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:20.080]  Begins visiting homes of people that buy two or more rifles or handguns
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:24.080]  And then just point out that they were already ordering this last year
[03:17:24.080 --> 03:17:26.080]  So now they've issued a letter
[03:17:26.080 --> 03:17:31.080]  And they're going into gun shops, they're going into gun shows
[03:17:31.080 --> 03:17:34.080]  Where it's mainly licensed dealers, we have private sellers
[03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:36.080]  Who are allowed to sell the guns they've got
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:39.080]  And the people show their ID, everything
[03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:42.080]  It's an illegal alien, it's fake, the ATF sends them in
[03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:44.080]  And they send grandpas to jail
[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:47.080]  I mean, we are witnessing their stealth assault
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:51.080]  And then remember, Bob, these are the people, as you said, caught shipping the guns in
[03:17:51.080 --> 03:17:53.080]  And then lying to Congress
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:55.080]  I mean, where is the Attorney General getting in trouble?
[03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:57.080]  Where are they? They've been caught lying, Bob
[03:17:57.080 --> 03:18:00.080]  Their own agents blew the whistle
[03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:04.080]  It goes on all day every day, they just don't care
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:08.080]  And if you can't work it through Congress sooner or later
[03:18:08.080 --> 03:18:13.080]  Someone's going to come to one house and they demand to go in
[03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:15.080]  And someone's going to say no
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:17.080]  And there's going to be a confrontation
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:20.080]  And there's going to be some dead ATF people
[03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:24.080]  That's what it's going to happen, and it's going to spread
[03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:28.080]  Well, you know, I've tried to be peaceful about this
[03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:30.080]  And we want to have things be peaceful
[03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:33.080]  But this is what kicked off Lexington and Concord
[03:18:33.080 --> 03:18:35.080]  This is what started the Republic
[03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:37.080]  They put up with so much abuse, but at the end of the day
[03:18:37.080 --> 03:18:40.080]  They said, you're not taking my guns, redcoats
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:42.080]  And the redcoats shot a bunch of people
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:45.080]  And turned them in the martyrs, and it was on
[03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:50.080]  And it's a good sign that a lot of ATF people are blowing the whistle now
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:54.080]  They realize this is getting, I mean, we got a scumbag president criminal
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:58.080]  Raping the country outside of law, shipping guns to Mexico
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:00.080]  And using it to come after our guns
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:03.080]  And it's time for the ATF agents to come out with their union
[03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:06.080]  And say, we're not doing this anymore, we're not criminals
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:09.080]  It's time to say no to Hitler
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:13.080]  It's time to say, Bob, you agree it's time to start saying no
[03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:16.080]  Absolutely, absolutely
[03:19:16.080 --> 03:19:18.080]  And we can go through Congress
[03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:22.080]  And if they don't do anything, it's going to degenerate
[03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:25.080]  And anybody in law enforcement will tell you that
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:28.080]  And they certainly don't want to be on that end of it
[03:19:28.080 --> 03:19:33.080]  And if I was an ATF employee, I certainly wouldn't want to be there now
[03:19:33.080 --> 03:19:36.080]  Because sooner or later, they're going to try to go into homes
[03:19:36.080 --> 03:19:38.080]  And they're going to get killed
[03:19:38.080 --> 03:19:41.080]  Well, Bob, you know how many veterans there are that don't care about living
[03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:44.080]  And who have totally committed that they're going to go out
[03:19:44.080 --> 03:19:47.080]  In a blaze of glory if people try to take their guns
[03:19:47.080 --> 03:19:49.080]  And that's going to be called the terrorism
[03:19:49.080 --> 03:19:51.080]  This has all been planned
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:55.080]  Let's not allow this clash between the police and military and the people
[03:19:55.080 --> 03:19:58.080]  Bob, God bless you, we'll see you back live Sunday
[03:19:58.080 --> 03:20:00.080]  4-6pm on the Sunday Transmission
[03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:18.080]  Thank you so much
