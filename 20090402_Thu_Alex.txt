[00:49.120 --> 00:57.760]  You're listening to GCN the world leader and independent talk radio
[01:04.600 --> 01:07.200]  Big brother mainstream media
[01:07.960 --> 01:10.520]  Government cover-ups you want answers?
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.520]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:16.520 --> 01:19.480]  And now live from Austin, Texas
[01:20.120 --> 01:22.120]  Alex Jones
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.040]  We have filmmaker author economist successful businessman
[01:40.040 --> 01:46.920]  George Humphrey joining us for an hour and a half at the last hour and a half of this transmission today
[01:47.320 --> 01:52.560]  It is Thursday already the second day of April 2009
[01:52.720 --> 01:55.680]  We have four hours laying out before us and yes
[01:55.680 --> 02:01.400]  I am going to have wide open phones all the way through the full four hours today
[02:01.960 --> 02:04.760]  Including when George Humphrey is in studio with us
[02:04.760 --> 02:08.840]  The toll-free number to join us on any news item any issue
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.800]  I love the different directions that listeners take us in the number is
[02:12.800 --> 02:19.840]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[02:20.680 --> 02:22.680]  Every week or so
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.640]  I will type the term new world order in to a search engine
[02:29.440 --> 02:31.760]  and hundreds and hundreds of
[02:31.760 --> 02:35.760]  Mainstream news articles will pop up from CNN the New York Times
[02:35.760 --> 02:41.760]  You name it saying yes, there's a new world order. Yes, it's world government run by private banks
[02:41.760 --> 02:48.760]  But this will save you these are the good guys. They know how to fix the crisis which they have engineered
[02:49.760 --> 02:51.760]  And here's CNN last night
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.760]  Analyst crisis may lead to new world order
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.760]  Here's another one out of the New York Times yesterday
[02:59.760 --> 03:02.760]  A world in need of a new world order
[03:02.760 --> 03:05.760]  This is just Googling it last night. I haven't done it yet this morning
[03:05.760 --> 03:11.760]  I'm there's probably 30 40 today when I say hundreds a week. I'm not exaggerating and it's the same thing
[03:11.760 --> 03:15.760]  Oh, yes, we need this new global government. It will save us
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.760]  And everyone's so thankful now of CNN and Fox. They're admitting it's a world government run by bankers
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.760]  And Fox is even criticizing it. Oh, we've been endorsed by Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.760]  All these other people they're coming out admitting it's true. Oh, we can talk about it now. They say it's okay
[03:35.760 --> 03:40.760]  They weren't stupid. They knew world government was being set up in the last 20 years
[03:40.760 --> 03:42.760]  They knew it was all being developed
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.760]  They're having to now try to keep some of their credibility by admitting it
[03:47.760 --> 03:52.760]  I want apologies from all of these people, but you're not going to get that fact if you listen to Sean Hannity
[03:52.760 --> 03:54.760]  I'm going to play the clip again today because it's so important
[03:54.760 --> 03:59.760]  He's on there with Dick Morris. It's like, well, these people are crazy, but they were right
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.760]  They're crazy because they know how to read Council on Foreign Relations documents
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.760]  They're crazy because they read UN documents. They're crazy because they read State Department documents
[04:08.760 --> 04:11.760]  They're crazy because they read Club of Rome documents
[04:11.760 --> 04:14.760]  They're crazy because they read Declassions documents
[04:14.760 --> 04:18.760]  Because they read Club of Rome documents. They're crazy because they read Declassified Pentagon documents
[04:18.760 --> 04:24.760]  They're crazy because they read Army War College documents where they teach all the Army captains
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.760]  In Black Ops, Special Ops, and Intelligence how to stage terror attacks
[04:29.760 --> 04:32.760]  And every Army captain out there listening
[04:33.760 --> 04:38.760]  Who's been an Army captain in the last eight years knows you were issued those manuals
[04:38.760 --> 04:41.760]  And you know you're taught how to stage terror attacks
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.760]  And we will talk about it and we will link to the Army manual and we will discuss it
[04:47.760 --> 04:53.760]  So, you know, being called almost eight years ago a kook before 9-11 even happened
[04:53.760 --> 04:55.760]  Saying they were going to blow up the World Trade Centers
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.760]  Look, I'm only stating the evidence, the facts, and now Michael Savage can come out and say
[05:02.760 --> 05:07.760]  The government's going to stage a big terror attack in the U.S. to bring in martial law
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.760]  Now the good news is the fact that we laid the groundwork
[05:12.760 --> 05:15.760]  The fact that we told people what was going to happen before it happened
[05:15.760 --> 05:17.760]  The fact that we've been right on every major issue
[05:21.760 --> 05:24.760]  Now people are listening to us about what we're telling them is coming next
[05:24.760 --> 05:26.760]  And they're actually looking at our evidence
[05:26.760 --> 05:29.760]  And I'm going to tell you right now, it hit me like a ton of bricks last night
[05:29.760 --> 05:33.760]  They are going to stage terror attacks in this country
[05:33.760 --> 05:36.760]  They are going to do it and I'll tell you why when we get back
[05:36.760 --> 05:41.760]  So you get ready folks and they are going to try to bring in hard martial law
[05:41.760 --> 05:45.760]  They're going to try to arrest me and a lot of other people
[05:45.760 --> 05:52.760]  It's a guarantee they're going to move with physical force against the American people
[05:52.760 --> 05:59.760]  Unless we bust our butts to expose the terrorist program now
[05:59.760 --> 06:03.760]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[06:03.760 --> 06:06.760]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.760]  While taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[06:09.760 --> 06:12.760]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[06:12.760 --> 06:14.760]  And others are absorbed into the skin
[06:14.760 --> 06:18.760]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[06:18.760 --> 06:21.760]  And is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron
[06:21.760 --> 06:25.760]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus
[06:25.760 --> 06:31.760]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first
[06:31.760 --> 06:37.760]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria
[06:37.760 --> 06:40.760]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally

[06:58.760 --> 07:05.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[07:05.760 --> 07:11.760]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[07:11.760 --> 07:18.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[07:18.760 --> 07:22.760]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election
[07:22.760 --> 07:34.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist
[07:36.760 --> 07:39.760]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government
[07:39.760 --> 07:46.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda
[07:46.760 --> 07:54.760]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[07:54.760 --> 07:58.760]  The Obama deception, the people strike back
[08:03.760 --> 08:10.760]  Let's go to the heart of the matter, life changed tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial
[08:10.760 --> 08:16.760]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world and that having a clogged colon is good for you
[08:16.760 --> 08:22.760]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy, that there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air
[08:22.760 --> 08:26.760]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you
[08:26.760 --> 08:32.760]  Not get the tea, change your body and life from unhealthy to healthy

[08:46.760 --> 08:52.760]  Or order online at GetTheTea.com, that's GetTheTea.com
[08:52.760 --> 09:03.760]  Life changed tea, the tea that changes how you feel
[09:23.760 --> 09:30.760]  I know that the private banking group that is hijacked this nation in almost every other country in the world
[09:30.760 --> 09:39.760]  Is going to stage huge terror attacks on a planetary scale in Europe, in the Middle East, in Israel, in the United States, in North America, in Asia
[09:39.760 --> 09:51.760]  When enough pieces of information converge together understanding the enemy's past, human history, their operations, their goals, the pathology they follow
[09:51.760 --> 09:58.760]  A problem reaction solution, create the crisis, hype up fear, the public says, what are they going to do about it?
[09:58.760 --> 10:05.760]  And they say, okay, we have a solution, which is more power, more control for the elite, more tyranny
[10:05.760 --> 10:15.760]  And it's very simple, the New World Order, I've analyzed it from every angle, I've analyzed every facet of it
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.760]  They are not going to be able to get away with getting the New World Order off the ground
[10:21.760 --> 10:29.760]  There is no way that they are going to be able to set up this open world government, openly ruled by a private banking cartel
[10:29.760 --> 10:38.760]  That taxes and regulates every facet of our lives without staging terror or a huge war
[10:38.760 --> 10:40.760]  Period
[10:40.760 --> 10:49.760]  And again, thousands of pieces of data and research going, people ask me, well, how do you know this? How do you understand this?
[10:49.760 --> 10:59.760]  You just have to have your head in the game, 15, 16, 17, 18 hours a day, studying the enemy to be able to understand the basics
[10:59.760 --> 11:06.760]  Or many of you that have been listening to this show for many years, or who have worked in government, or who are historians in your own right
[11:06.760 --> 11:11.760]  Who have been doing some of the same research, you understand why
[11:11.760 --> 11:19.760]  And I can oversimplify all of it, but there's just so many nuances that add into the total
[11:19.760 --> 11:23.760]  But it's very simple
[11:23.760 --> 11:33.760]  The globalist, even with the most ignorant, dumb-down, unfocused people that are watching American Idol
[11:33.760 --> 11:44.760]  The globalist know that the people are aware of the fact that it's the private banks and the private banking cartels that have engineered the economic crises
[11:44.760 --> 11:55.760]  They know that, they understand that
[11:55.760 --> 12:09.760]  And so how are they going to pose as our saviors and set up this open-world government system and get the people to go along with it?
[12:09.760 --> 12:16.760]  You see, one crisis won't work. They can't just engineer the financial collapse and then haunt show the whole thing
[12:16.760 --> 12:22.760]  And as things get worse and worse, because that's their plan, their stated plan, have the public go along with it
[12:22.760 --> 12:26.760]  They can get the power. They've got the power
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.760]  But how are they going to sell the public on doing it?
[12:30.760 --> 12:37.760]  Well, they're going to let the economy get worse and worse and worse, and then every month say, you have this even more power and we can fix it
[12:37.760 --> 12:49.760]  And the public says, no, you're criminals, and they say, okay, the economy just got worse, 700 to something thousand people lost their job in March
[12:49.760 --> 12:55.760]  And then, oh, we know what's good for you, even though in the polls 98% of you don't want this, we're going to go ahead and do it
[12:55.760 --> 12:58.760]  And then things get worse
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.760]  But you have to understand from their perspective, things are getting better
[13:02.760 --> 13:10.760]  Consolidation of power, vertical integration of wealth, surveillance and control of society
[13:10.760 --> 13:19.760]  And the New World Order, again, has written hundreds of books and white papers bragging the head of the CFR in 92 for the Club of Rome
[13:19.760 --> 13:26.760]  As one of their officers writes, as one of their corporate officers writes a huge white paper, republished last year by the Council on Foreign Relations
[13:26.760 --> 13:34.760]  Stating, we use staged fake terror as one of the pincers to enslave the public and bring in world government
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.760]  And we use phony environmentalism and carbon tax as the other pincer, a pincer
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.760]  You know, those big beetles, the pincer beetle has the big jaws, it goes and grabs a bug, it's going to eat
[13:46.760 --> 13:50.760]  That's what a pincer attack is, it's where they grab you
[13:50.760 --> 13:59.760]  You know, if you run up and grab somebody with both your arms and tackle them, roll them up and tackle and slam them down the ground, that's a pincer attack
[13:59.760 --> 14:07.760]  So they got the phony war on terror as one arm and they got their phony environmental land grabbing and the rest of it as the other
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.760]  And you bring those two things together, you've got total control over society
[14:12.760 --> 14:19.760]  And they're brainwashing the children to spy on their parents and brainwashing the children that taking a shower is bad or taking a bath is bad
[14:19.760 --> 14:27.760]  And it's in the New York Times where it shows kids bossing their parents around and the parents are saying, thank God my kids boss me around, oh they're so environmentally sensitive
[14:27.760 --> 14:38.760]  No, that's just a way to get you to acquiesce to having your kids be in little secret police thugs right out of the Soviet Union or in fiction land, 1984
[14:38.760 --> 14:46.760]  But let me just try to simplify it, and it's not that the general audience doesn't get it or that most of the audience is smarter than I am
[14:46.760 --> 14:59.760]  But that's a fact, it's that there's a lot of new listeners every single day, a lot of new stations carrying the show and I want this message to get through them loud and clear
[14:59.760 --> 15:09.760]  The globalist, the private banking cartels that own Europe and the United States and dominate most of the planet outside of the west are stalling
[15:09.760 --> 15:20.760]  They're in the mud up to their axles, Europe is in rebellion, the original 15 members of the European Union all want out, the few countries where they've somehow gotten a vote
[15:20.760 --> 15:29.760]  It's been widely rejected, France and most recently Ireland and a few other nations
[15:29.760 --> 15:39.760]  When they had a 50th anniversary for the Euro march, I keep talking about this because it's so key, I watched it on the foreign television on the satellite
[15:39.760 --> 15:49.760]  Literally no one came out for EU funded multi-million dollar parades in every capital
[15:49.760 --> 16:00.760]  It was the jugglers and the floats and the ballerinas and then police lining, cordons and no one was there, no one
[16:00.760 --> 16:14.760]  Now how are you going to sell a system where everybody hates it, nobody likes it, you're not allowed to vote, you're not allowed to have your sovereignty
[16:14.760 --> 16:22.760]  How are you going to get away with that, how are you going to get away with the North American Union, you know, again they claim they founded the European Union nine years ago
[16:22.760 --> 16:31.760]  That was the public launch of it but they had the 50th anniversary two years ago, from 57 to 2007
[16:31.760 --> 16:46.760]  The European Union was set up, the treaties were signed, the agreements were done in 1957, the Treaty of Rome, you can go read the 1000 page thing if you want
[16:46.760 --> 16:56.760]  Think about that, it's the same thing, we've been in the North American Union since March 24th, 25th when they signed it at Baylor University in Waco, Texas
[16:56.760 --> 17:03.760]  Vicente Fox and Paul Martin and George W. Bush
[17:03.760 --> 17:09.760]  We even got the agreements, got the documents and the first thing it says is keep it secret from the public
[17:09.760 --> 17:19.760]  I mean these are treasonous traders destroying our country, ending it, we are in the North American Union
[17:19.760 --> 17:34.760]  You've got to watch Jackasses on CNN and Fox tell me I'm a cuck and I'm making it up when I have the official stamped release through Fourier lawsuits documents
[17:34.760 --> 17:42.760]  Now I said I'd simplify it, I want to go to your calls and cover a ton of important news, it's just, that's only one facet of it
[17:42.760 --> 17:52.760]  How are they going to force everybody into this when they don't want it? How are they going to force an attack on Iran when nobody wants it?
[17:52.760 --> 18:03.760]  How are the new world order criminals going to get the American people to go along with basically having their taxes massively increased at every level
[18:03.760 --> 18:20.760]  Via the income tax only one area with the public gutting of the internal revenue code and all of the write-offs, education, housing, capital improvements, I mean it's all over
[18:20.760 --> 18:34.760]  If he's able to do this, the OECD who's running the G20 meeting right now, that's the big corporation that set up the bankruptcy of Europe from World War II, you know it as the Marshall plan
[18:34.760 --> 18:41.760]  It's really the OECD, private corporation, a receivership arm, is saying the U.S. and Europe is going into receivership
[18:41.760 --> 18:51.760]  To the very bankers that we're bailing out, because you're not bailing them out, they shut off the currency, they shut off the credit, everything shuts down and they say okay give us
[18:51.760 --> 19:00.760]  $12.8 trillion of U.S. money alone, it's over $10 trillion in Europe and the rest of the world, all the money they've given, so that's $20 something trillion right now
[19:00.760 --> 19:15.760]  And that's in six months, Bloomberg yesterday, $12.8 trillion, $200 billion short of the gross domestic product of the United States, I mean they are going for broke, they are bankrupting and looting everything
[19:15.760 --> 19:27.760]  And they know they're going for broke, they know it's unpopular what they're doing, they know it's criminal what they're doing, they know it is the biggest heist in human history
[19:27.760 --> 19:37.760]  And that's why you got North com standing by with the troops, that's why they're openly announcing martial law is a good thing on the news everywhere and pushing it in movies and sitcoms and dramas and fiction and nonfiction
[19:37.760 --> 19:45.760]  That's why they're militarizing police, that's why they're increasing the number of police every year by hundreds of thousands and millions total in the last decade
[19:45.760 --> 19:53.760]  That's why all this is happening, they're building more prisons, because they are conquering this country
[19:53.760 --> 20:05.760]  And when the bankers conquered the former Tsarist Russia with their hired thugs, the Bolsheviks, openly funded by the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve, publicly, that's mainline history
[20:05.760 --> 20:10.760]  They killed 40-something million people just during the takeover
[20:10.760 --> 20:17.760]  So let me explain something to you folks, they are going for broke, point of no return, they've dropped the hammer
[20:17.760 --> 20:27.760]  Okay, there's no going back in this, the fight is on, and I just wanted to be clear for everybody out there
[20:27.760 --> 20:36.760]  They are going all out 110% against humanity, it is worse than I can even articulate or explain here on air
[20:36.760 --> 20:44.760]  So when we get back, I'm going to break down why they have to stage a terror attack and or a giant war
[20:44.760 --> 20:52.760]  Now they could wild card a bio attack in there and claim it was naturally occurring, they'll probably blame it on some guy with a beard in a cave somewhere
[20:52.760 --> 21:00.760]  So we're going to break down the future, I'm projecting the lines into the future, we will tell you what's coming when we get back
[21:00.760 --> 21:06.760]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner
[21:06.760 --> 21:15.760]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929, many didn't make it and millions ended up in soup lines becoming vagrants begging for food
[21:15.760 --> 21:27.760]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming, we have been warned, and right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late
[21:27.760 --> 21:31.760]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[21:31.760 --> 21:37.760]  Why? And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage? Supplies are running low
[21:37.760 --> 21:43.760]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the arc was in the days of Noah

[23:19.760 --> 23:24.760]  Well Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election
[23:24.760 --> 23:35.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism
[23:35.760 --> 23:54.760]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government, this film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[23:54.760 --> 24:06.760]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.

[24:47.760 --> 24:59.760]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[25:17.760 --> 25:21.760]  Independence
[25:21.760 --> 25:31.760]  Ain't there bodies down on a bloody war and liberty for their descendants
[25:31.760 --> 25:35.760]  I'm gonna get Steve Boss on this show, what an amazing artist
[25:35.760 --> 25:41.760]  Thanks to the renegades, for free today
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.760]  For free today
[25:44.760 --> 25:55.760]  Thank God
[25:55.760 --> 25:59.760]  It wasn't for all those fighting tyranny
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.760]  Lord knows where
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.760]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine
[26:08.760 --> 26:16.760]  Now, your calls are coming up, we got Brendan in New Jersey saying troops outside Burger King, now they're just making their presence known everywhere
[26:16.760 --> 26:23.760]  DWI checkpoints, mass shootings, everything just to condition you, that's coming up in your calls
[26:23.760 --> 26:26.760]  A ton of important news today
[26:26.760 --> 26:28.760]  Look, it's very simple
[26:28.760 --> 26:34.760]  Everything the globalist is doing is unpopular, it's designed to implode the economy to make you dependent on the system
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.760]  They can then force one-child policies on you, constrict the economy because we're, quote, producing too much
[26:39.760 --> 26:46.760]  This is what the Club of Rome, UN, all of them have bragged about for years how they would engineer this crisis to bankrupt the middle class
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.760]  So no one can resist the elite, they use poverty as a tool of control
[26:52.760 --> 26:56.760]  And then every time you try to resist or protest, they are provocateurs
[26:56.760 --> 27:01.760]  Again, that's a form of staged terror to demonize the rest of the peaceful protesters
[27:01.760 --> 27:08.760]  So the peaceful protesters' message doesn't get out on the media, all that you hear about is a few punks protected bashing out windows
[27:08.760 --> 27:10.760]  Another form of problem reaction solution
[27:10.760 --> 27:17.760]  Or give up your property or the earth will die, or let us tax your factory or business or the earth will die
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.760]  It's the same story, bad things are going to happen if you don't do what we say
[27:22.760 --> 27:27.760]  But on every front, the globalists are unpopular, on every front they're being unmasked and exposed
[27:27.760 --> 27:31.760]  And every time in history when they get cornered and their agenda gets slowed
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.760]  And at every point when they're trying to make a big change, they bring in crises
[27:36.760 --> 27:41.760]  They engineered World War I, they engineered World War II on record to set up the League of Nations in UN
[27:41.760 --> 27:50.760]  The Rand Corporation and others last year said they want a war on the order of World War III to bring in the new world order
[27:50.760 --> 27:57.760]  And if they attack Iran, Israel or NATO or anybody else, the United States launches an attack
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.760]  It will widen at least into a theater war with surrounding nations
[28:02.760 --> 28:06.760]  And they will use that crisis to say, look we've got to make all these changes because we're at war
[28:06.760 --> 28:09.760]  They could release a bio weapon, bird flu or anything else
[28:09.760 --> 28:13.760]  We know that they have a history of that, we know they've been preparing for that
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.760]  They could shut down the internet and claim that China did it
[28:17.760 --> 28:22.760]  And it's now come out that the feds and NSA are taking over the entire internet infrastructure
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.760]  Including private hub companies, that's in the Washington Post
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.760]  Their cyber security head two weeks ago quit saying this is a threat to freedom
[28:30.760 --> 28:33.760]  This is a military takeover of America and he quit
[28:33.760 --> 28:36.760]  Trying to get him on the show by the way
[28:40.760 --> 28:43.760]  So they are going to go after the internet with a false flag attack
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.760]  Claiming foreign enemies did it to shut it down in the name of protecting what's left of it
[28:47.760 --> 28:52.760]  That's clear, bio weapons releases, terror attacks
[28:52.760 --> 28:58.760]  They could go for something as big as a low yield nuclear weapon in a major U.S. or European city
[28:58.760 --> 29:01.760]  I'm telling you that's what they've really been priming the subconscious for
[29:01.760 --> 29:04.760]  And programming people in the media, so that's one of the major threats
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.760]  I would say Chicago, San Francisco, points like that are big targets
[29:09.760 --> 29:13.760]  New York, Dallas, Cleveland, Denver
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.760]  Because the globalists even write white papers listing the targets they think quote Al Qaeda is going to hit
[29:19.760 --> 29:21.760]  And that means the targets they're really going to hit
[29:21.760 --> 29:24.760]  And then any of their operatives get caught staging the attack
[29:24.760 --> 29:27.760]  They'll say, oh part of a drill, here it's official drill, see
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.760]  Well they always run a drill at the exact same time, exact same place with the exact same action
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.760]  And then even comes out later because in case people in intelligence who are good
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.760]  In the government leak it, they say, well of course we already released the fact we were having a drill
[29:43.760 --> 29:48.760]  That's what they always say, oh guess what, we were running drills on hijacked jets flying in the World Trade Center in Pentagon
[29:48.760 --> 29:51.760]  The exact same time, exact same targets, who to thunk it
[29:51.760 --> 29:55.760]  Oh we were doing a drill in England on 7-7 of the exact same trains
[29:58.760 --> 30:01.760]  Exact same bus being bombed at the exact same time, exact same location
[30:03.760 --> 30:04.760]  Who would have thought it
[30:04.760 --> 30:09.760]  And I'm telling you right now
[30:09.760 --> 30:17.760]  That there is no way, because the economic crisis they've engineered is to get control of the financial system and bankrupt everybody
[30:17.760 --> 30:20.760]  But then they have to have the political cover to get away with that
[30:20.760 --> 30:26.760]  Because it's clearly the banks that engineered the crisis who are now getting all the power out of it
[30:26.760 --> 30:35.760]  So how are they going to get the public to stand out, how will they get the military and the police to move against the public when they order them to do so?
[30:35.760 --> 30:44.760]  Well that means terror attack, or war, or both, or bioweapon attack, or all three and cyber attack, all four at once
[30:44.760 --> 30:49.760]  I'm telling you this is their attack profile, prepare yourselves
[30:50.760 --> 30:54.760]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[30:54.760 --> 30:57.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[32:00.760 --> 32:06.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[32:06.760 --> 32:12.760]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[32:12.760 --> 32:19.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[32:19.760 --> 32:23.760]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election
[32:23.760 --> 32:35.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist, who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist
[32:36.760 --> 32:40.760]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government
[32:40.760 --> 32:47.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda

[34:24.760 --> 34:31.760]  A phone and actor out of love, writers on the store

[34:41.760 --> 34:50.760]  J.K. Long holiday, let your children play
[34:50.760 --> 34:56.760]  If you give this man a ride, sweet memory will die
[34:56.760 --> 35:21.760]  A killer on the road
[35:21.760 --> 35:31.760]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no harsh chemicals, no harsh chemicals, no harsh chemicals, no harsh chemicals
[35:31.760 --> 35:59.760]  A killer on the road
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.760]  They are reckless, they are wild, they are bold
[36:03.760 --> 36:12.760]  They're not going to get away with what they're doing unless they stage terror attacks, and then that's not going to work either
[36:12.760 --> 36:15.760]  So we're between a rock and a hard place, and so are the elite
[36:15.760 --> 36:18.760]  This is a very, very serious time
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.760]  Coming up, I'm going to go through all this news
[36:20.760 --> 36:24.760]  Tax Dodgers multiplies underground economy
[36:24.760 --> 36:27.760]  Cushions job cuts
[36:27.760 --> 36:30.760]  Tea parties are spreading all across the nation
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.760]  Analysts crisis may lead to new world order, CNN
[36:34.760 --> 36:38.760]  Here's another one, New York Times, a world in need of a new order
[36:38.760 --> 36:44.760]  G20 summit, Europeans demand threatens to wreck deal, and what do they want?
[36:44.760 --> 36:46.760]  A global government with total regulatory power
[36:46.760 --> 36:52.760]  That's the real action that's happening, not a 500 billion is going to be served out in central banks
[36:52.760 --> 36:55.760]  It's got a trillion more last week
[36:55.760 --> 36:58.760]  Also, Senate legislation with federalized cyber security
[36:58.760 --> 37:02.760]  Rules for private networks also apply
[37:02.760 --> 37:06.760]  But then, I go back to two weeks ago
[37:06.760 --> 37:09.760]  UPI and Associated Press
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.760]  U.S. cyber security had quit citing growing role of spy agencies
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.760]  Threat to U.S. democracy
[37:17.760 --> 37:19.760]  So we're going to break down that
[37:19.760 --> 37:22.760]  Also Geithner, announcing CEOs, reviving economy
[37:22.760 --> 37:26.760]  They're going to see other corporations, other banks
[37:26.760 --> 37:29.760]  Not just fire, they had a GM
[37:29.760 --> 37:31.760]  This is total takeover
[37:31.760 --> 37:33.760]  So they're telling the corporate world, you do whatever we say
[37:33.760 --> 37:35.760]  You go under our control
[37:35.760 --> 37:41.760]  This is what happens when the IMF and World Bank take over a third world or second world or old world nation
[37:41.760 --> 37:43.760]  They first give loans to the country
[37:43.760 --> 37:46.760]  They tell them in the agreements, you're not supposed to pay this back
[37:46.760 --> 37:48.760]  You're going to pay 25% interest compounded
[37:48.760 --> 37:50.760]  Once the interest runs up where it can't be paid back
[37:50.760 --> 37:52.760]  The country's imploded
[37:52.760 --> 37:54.760]  And then they sign another IMF World Bank deal
[37:54.760 --> 37:57.760]  To allow all their natural resources, their companies
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.760]  Everything to be taken over through the executive of that nation, generally a dictatorship
[38:02.760 --> 38:03.760]  Same thing here
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.760]  So a select intergroup of banks are ruling the United States
[38:07.760 --> 38:10.760]  Grabbing and strip mining and looting
[38:10.760 --> 38:13.760]  And engaging in corporate takeovers and then slicing these countries up
[38:13.760 --> 38:20.760]  And these companies up and selling them for pennies on the dollar to their buddies
[38:20.760 --> 38:21.760]  Oh boy, this is amazing
[38:21.760 --> 38:23.760]  So we're going to play that clip and get into that
[38:23.760 --> 38:25.760]  That's just some of what I've got here in front of us
[38:25.760 --> 38:27.760]  But right now, let's go to your calls
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.760]  Brendan in New Jersey, since he's been on hold for 20 minutes
[38:30.760 --> 38:33.760]  The troops have left, but he said troops outside Burger King
[38:33.760 --> 38:34.760]  Go ahead, Brendan
[38:34.760 --> 38:36.760]  Hi, how are you, Alex?
[38:36.760 --> 38:37.760]  Pretty good
[38:37.760 --> 38:39.760]  Yeah, basically I just wanted to call in
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.760]  I feel like you saying that I feel so acclimated because
[38:43.760 --> 38:46.760]  Just a few years ago, the situation that I encountered today
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.760]  Would have caused in my mind a huge reaction today
[38:51.760 --> 38:53.760]  It was all, yeah, yeah, there are troops on the streets
[38:53.760 --> 38:55.760]  I was driving just to go return a cable box
[38:55.760 --> 38:59.760]  And I saw some troops just right outside Burger King
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.760]  They were walking around taking pictures with a bunch of little children
[39:03.760 --> 39:09.760]  Really, it seemed like they were doing their best to put themselves out there
[39:09.760 --> 39:11.760]  And engage in interaction with the public
[39:11.760 --> 39:14.760]  So I circled them for a while, I filmed them
[39:14.760 --> 39:17.760]  And I went over to them and I'm a writer for a school newspaper
[39:17.760 --> 39:20.760]  So I was going to try and just get them to give me whatever information they could
[39:20.760 --> 39:23.760]  And I told them hi, introduced myself and that
[39:23.760 --> 39:27.760]  I had heard that the Army was doing a lot of outreach programs lately
[39:27.760 --> 39:31.760]  With the public and that my school Rutgers was very much interested in doing the same thing
[39:31.760 --> 39:33.760]  So I was wondering if I could interview them to do a story
[39:33.760 --> 39:35.760]  It seemed like a great opportunity
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.760]  And as soon as I introduced myself, he really seemed a bit reticent to talk
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.760]  But when I explained that I sort of was on their side
[39:44.760 --> 39:47.760]  They seemed to get a little bit more friendly
[39:47.760 --> 39:50.760]  Anyway though, they told me that they were just passing through
[39:50.760 --> 39:53.760]  To take one of their companies from one fort to another
[39:53.760 --> 39:57.760]  But they were there for quite some time, like an hour and 45 minutes
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.760]  Well, they've announced from California to New York
[40:01.760 --> 40:03.760]  That they're going to have martial law in different cities
[40:03.760 --> 40:05.760]  With the Army running things
[40:05.760 --> 40:08.760]  And they just announced it and it's connected to other places like it's no big deal
[40:08.760 --> 40:11.760]  These are all key mayors with Obama
[40:11.760 --> 40:13.760]  Who are doing this, just acclimating
[40:13.760 --> 40:15.760]  And again, at drunk driving checkpoints
[40:15.760 --> 40:17.760]  Oh, the Marines, the Army are here
[40:17.760 --> 40:19.760]  Oh, at Carrex, oh, the helicopter landed, they're here to help
[40:19.760 --> 40:22.760]  What's wrong with the Army helping at Carrex?
[40:22.760 --> 40:25.760]  But the Pentagon admits, for those that just tuned in
[40:25.760 --> 40:28.760]  Army War College, Army Times, they're 20,000 regular troops
[40:28.760 --> 40:32.760]  To engage the American people in combat operations
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.760]  It is official
[40:34.760 --> 40:36.760]  Again, you have a shooting, they pop up
[40:36.760 --> 40:38.760]  This has been done covertly
[40:38.760 --> 40:41.760]  See, this could all sound reasonable, people could rationalize it
[40:41.760 --> 40:45.760]  I've interviewed Marine Corps captains who were covertly doing gun confiscations
[40:45.760 --> 40:48.760]  With police in Norfolk, Virginia
[40:48.760 --> 40:51.760]  In the late 80s, 87
[40:51.760 --> 40:55.760]  So we understand this is a large covert operation, go ahead
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.760]  And it's only accelerating, too, that's the thing that I've noticed
[40:59.760 --> 41:02.760]  You used to hear a few years ago, every once in a while
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.760]  There would be some troops somewhere and they were operating in a very limited capacity
[41:06.760 --> 41:10.760]  And nowadays, every other day, you just hear about troops everywhere
[41:10.760 --> 41:15.760]  All the time, and basically, I'm a writer for a school newspaper, The Targum
[41:15.760 --> 41:18.760]  And I've just been writing a column every other week
[41:18.760 --> 41:21.760]  And I'm trying to alert people to these, I call the column
[41:21.760 --> 41:23.760]  An Inconvenient Truth, a play on Al Gore's movie
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.760]  To these real inconvenient truths, the things we actually need to be paying attention to
[41:27.760 --> 41:30.760]  So I've been thinking for quite some time
[41:30.760 --> 41:34.760]  Tell us the name of your, no, tell us the name of the paper and how people read your column
[41:34.760 --> 41:39.760]  Okay, the paper is The Daily Targum, it's the second oldest, excuse me
[41:39.760 --> 41:43.760]  College newspaper in the country, it's won several awards
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.760]  The column is called An Inconvenient Truth, just like the name of Al Gore's movie
[41:48.760 --> 41:52.760]  And it basically discusses the New World Order, all of their plans
[41:52.760 --> 41:55.760]  Talks about TARP and its infiltration
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.760]  Of the pluralism through elite power models and so on
[41:58.760 --> 42:02.760]  You can Google it, just type in T-A-R-G-U-M
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.760]  And then my name, Brendan Kaplan, and it's B-R-E-N-D-A-N
[42:06.760 --> 42:08.760]  Kaplan, like the S-A-D Kaplan
[42:08.760 --> 42:10.760]  Well, Brendan, that's how we're going to defeat the globalist
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.760]  Millions of people like you out there with school newspapers, local papers
[42:14.760 --> 42:18.760]  Letters to the editor, access TV, calls to talk radio, a neighborhood newsletter
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.760]  Micro FM's, micro AM's, that's how we're going to do it, good to hear from you
[42:22.760 --> 42:26.760]  And again, we're not against the individual troops or military
[42:26.760 --> 42:31.760]  Remember, I'm the crazy guy who would run into military checkpoints on the highways
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.760]  And fly to urban warfare drills, you know, it's crazy to do that
[42:35.760 --> 42:38.760]  And show the troops training to take your guns
[42:38.760 --> 42:41.760]  And give them questionnaires, will they fire on U.S. citizens?
[42:41.760 --> 42:43.760]  That's been in the mainstream news
[42:43.760 --> 42:46.760]  This is creeping death, this is how nations fall
[42:46.760 --> 42:49.760]  The United States cannot fall from without, it can only fall from within
[42:49.760 --> 42:52.760]  And almost every other nation in history falls from within
[42:52.760 --> 42:55.760]  With corrupt elites using the military and police
[42:55.760 --> 42:58.760]  To slowly crack down and then set up a police state
[42:58.760 --> 43:00.760]  And then they rob the middle class
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.760]  But they fool with the media, the middle class to feel like they're part of the establishment
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.760]  They're part of the system and they roll all this out with good sounding reasons
[43:11.760 --> 43:13.760]  To acclimate you
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.760]  But it's all so they can get your pension funds and then tell you one-child policies
[43:17.760 --> 43:20.760]  And force inoculations on you with cancer viruses
[43:20.760 --> 43:23.760]  Just a fact, because the globalist are you, Genesis
[43:23.760 --> 43:27.760]  On a separate issue, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this
[43:27.760 --> 43:30.760]  I have talked to multiple Hollywood people
[43:30.760 --> 43:33.760]  And I also know people who worked at PETA
[43:33.760 --> 43:36.760]  For short periods of time and then found out how crazy it was
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.760]  And I remember ten years ago on air laying this down
[43:41.760 --> 43:44.760]  From inside sources and people couldn't believe me
[43:44.760 --> 43:47.760]  But then it's come out in the last three years on mainstream news
[43:47.760 --> 43:50.760]  PETA at its locations everywhere orders its employees
[43:50.760 --> 43:53.760]  And volunteers to go adopt animals
[43:53.760 --> 43:55.760]  And then even do it with fake names to get more
[43:55.760 --> 43:59.760]  And then with pleasure, it's like a ritual, they euthanize them
[43:59.760 --> 44:01.760]  People thought I was crazy when I talked about that
[44:01.760 --> 44:03.760]  There's mainstream news everywhere
[44:03.760 --> 44:06.760]  It is a eugenics death cult
[44:06.760 --> 44:08.760]  They believe in human extinctionism
[44:08.760 --> 44:13.760]  They're really the public front of the animal liberation front
[44:13.760 --> 44:18.760]  And the Center for Consumer Research has done a big report on it
[44:18.760 --> 44:21.760]  95% of the animals, this is up on infowars.com
[44:21.760 --> 44:27.760]  They adopt, they secretly kill
[44:27.760 --> 44:30.760]  And I've talked to people that worked there
[44:30.760 --> 44:33.760]  And they got into a high level of it very quickly in administration
[44:33.760 --> 44:37.760]  And behind closed doors, it's really just mental illness
[44:37.760 --> 44:41.760]  Gobbling hamburgers, beef steaks, laughing, giggling
[44:41.760 --> 44:48.760]  Well, it's kind of like you always hear about the anti-child molestation groups
[44:48.760 --> 44:52.760]  Over and over again, the director, it turns out, is a child molester
[44:52.760 --> 44:55.760]  It's kind of like that movie, Dragnet
[44:55.760 --> 44:58.760]  Where the preacher that's fighting paganism is the pagan leader
[44:58.760 --> 45:02.760]  That's exactly how this stuff works
[45:02.760 --> 45:07.760]  Just like the Christian conservative leaders who were so against the homosexuals
[45:07.760 --> 45:17.760]  Meanwhile, it's homosexual orgies with the world leaders, the conservatives at Bohemian Grove
[45:17.760 --> 45:19.760]  I mean, how many congressmen have you heard about?
[45:19.760 --> 45:22.760]  How many of these Homeland Security State directors have you heard doing this?
[45:22.760 --> 45:27.760]  I mean, the Texas Youth Commission, it goes on and on
[45:27.760 --> 45:31.760]  You've had all these congressmen who are leading the groups against child abuse
[45:31.760 --> 45:37.760]  Child sexual abuse, and it turns out they're sending Texas to their pages
[45:37.760 --> 45:40.760]  This is how they operate, it's a bunch of perverts
[45:40.760 --> 45:43.760]  And they don't like people that just want to live their lives and
[45:43.760 --> 45:46.760]  Like a good barbecue sandwich and fishing or something
[45:46.760 --> 45:49.760]  They think we're idiots, we're weirdos
[45:49.760 --> 45:55.760]  I'm a weirdo because I like a full grown good looking woman like my wife
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.760]  And I like the full normal deal, that's what I like
[46:00.760 --> 46:04.760]  I'm a weirdo, folks, I just enjoy life
[46:04.760 --> 46:08.760]  And see, that's what these weirdos do, they get control of society
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.760]  Cults are always run by psychopaths and weirdos and perverts
[46:12.760 --> 46:16.760]  And that's all the new eloder is, is a banking cult, a bunch of sick control freaks
[46:16.760 --> 46:20.760]  I said I'd go to your calls, listen to this, PETA kills animals
[46:20.760 --> 46:22.760]  And the news is spreading like wildfire
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.760]  Last week we published new government records showing that people for the ethical treatment of animals
[46:27.760 --> 46:33.760]  By the way, they believe all dogs, cats, all, that you shouldn't be allowed to own a animal
[46:33.760 --> 46:36.760]  And that they're really invasive species, dogs have been engineered by humans
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.760]  Cats have been bred, they all must die, that's the internal view
[46:44.760 --> 46:47.760]  Last week we published new government records showing that people for the ethical treatment of animals
[46:47.760 --> 46:51.760]  PETA operates a dog and cat slaughterhouse in Norfolk, Virginia headquarters
[46:51.760 --> 46:53.760]  And the news started spreading fast
[46:53.760 --> 46:56.760]  In the last 24 hours, hundreds of thousands of blogs and newspaper readers
[46:56.760 --> 46:59.760]  Have been briefed on PETA's longstanding animal death program
[46:59.760 --> 47:03.760]  Discussion forums are now teaming with angry pet lovers
[47:03.760 --> 47:09.760]  Who want to see PETA pay the price for its unrepentant hypocrisy
[47:09.760 --> 47:12.760]  In case you missed last week's announcement
[47:12.760 --> 47:17.760]  Here's a breakdown of the latest statistics from the Daily Mail in London
[47:17.760 --> 47:22.760]  Since 98, more than 20,000 pets handed to PETA have been put down
[47:22.760 --> 47:29.760]  In 2008, official figures show that the charity put down 2,124 animals that had been given to them
[47:29.760 --> 47:35.760]  Figures, remember they caught one guy throwing hundreds of animals in a dumpster?
[47:35.760 --> 47:39.760]  This was like two years ago, figures obtained by Virginia Department of Agriculture reveal
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.760]  That last year PETA killed five pets a day, that's just in one office
[47:43.760 --> 47:48.760]  The charity which collects over 25 million pounds, that's 50 million bucks
[47:48.760 --> 47:52.760]  Donations does not run an adoption shelter
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.760]  Amazing, but as the most high-profile animal welfare agency in the US
[47:56.760 --> 48:02.760]  Many people take unwanted cats and dogs to their main offices in Norfolk, Virginia
[48:02.760 --> 48:04.760]  And let me tell you, they get off on it
[48:04.760 --> 48:07.760]  They pressure their employees to go adopt animals
[48:07.760 --> 48:11.760]  And they take them in the back and just inject them and get a weird look on their face
[48:11.760 --> 48:13.760]  I mean, these are some sick freaks, folks
[48:13.760 --> 48:18.760]  And see Peter Singer, the big professors, like their dean or whatever
[48:18.760 --> 48:25.760]  And he writes books saying old people are worthless, retarded children are like dumb mackerel
[48:25.760 --> 48:28.760]  Adults should be able to kill their babies up to one year
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.760]  In fact, I didn't cover it last week, just Google Obama Administration official says
[48:33.760 --> 48:36.760]  You should be able to kill babies, pull that up
[48:36.760 --> 48:39.760]  She says, oh, it should be legal until a year to kill them
[48:39.760 --> 48:42.760]  See, that's how crazy this is, I don't even cover it
[48:42.760 --> 48:45.760]  Yesterday, I mentioned all these BBC articles and other things
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.760]  Where they say we need to kill half the population of England to 30 million
[48:49.760 --> 48:53.760]  We need to reduce the US population, Obama's headlady
[48:53.760 --> 48:56.760]  I mean, I can't even cover it all, these people are eugenicists
[48:56.760 --> 48:59.760]  The Nazis got their system from England and the US
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.760]  Do you understand that's why they're putting fluoride in your water and cancer viruses in your vaccines
[49:04.760 --> 49:07.760]  And I'm sorry, that's scary
[49:07.760 --> 49:10.760]  But until we grow up and admit how hardcore these criminals are
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.760]  Things are only going to get worse around here
[49:13.760 --> 49:15.760]  When they get their world government in place
[49:15.760 --> 49:17.760]  And they think they've got enough cops and military in place
[49:17.760 --> 49:20.760]  That are brainwashed to follow what they give them orders to do
[49:20.760 --> 49:22.760]  They're going to set off a bunch of terror attacks
[49:22.760 --> 49:24.760]  And the cops are going to follow the orders
[49:24.760 --> 49:28.760]  And it's going to lead to death camps real fast
[49:28.760 --> 49:31.760]  The time for living and denial is over
[49:31.760 --> 49:34.760]  Alright, let's go to calls
[49:34.760 --> 49:38.760]  Tom in Wisconsin, go ahead Tom
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.760]  Hey Alex, thanks again for everything that you do
[49:42.760 --> 49:44.760]  You spread a lot of very good information
[49:44.760 --> 49:47.760]  Please don't thank me, I have no future if I don't fight these people
[49:47.760 --> 49:48.760]  Everybody understand that
[49:48.760 --> 49:52.760]  We are basically slaves at best, dead at worst
[49:52.760 --> 49:55.760]  In a ditch with somebody shooting us in the back of the head if we don't beat this
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.760]  Sorry, go ahead
[49:56.760 --> 49:58.760]  Well no, you're absolutely right
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.760]  I worked at a big manufacturing printing company
[50:03.760 --> 50:05.760]  For a long time, actually a little over a year
[50:05.760 --> 50:06.760]  It was a long time for me
[50:06.760 --> 50:10.760]  But I would tell people as I was just discovering this information
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.760]  I would try and basically warn them that this was coming
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.760]  I was basically predicting to them that this economic collapse was coming
[50:19.760 --> 50:21.760]  And none of them wanted to believe it
[50:21.760 --> 50:23.760]  And they all wanted to live in denial
[50:23.760 --> 50:25.760]  And basically act like they didn't care
[50:25.760 --> 50:30.760]  And in the other situations that I've been into
[50:30.760 --> 50:33.760]  I've had one person tell me that the meek will inherit the world
[50:33.760 --> 50:35.760]  And the thing that I keep going to is
[50:35.760 --> 50:38.760]  If the meek are in delusion
[50:38.760 --> 50:40.760]  They're not going to inherit nothing
[50:40.760 --> 50:42.760]  They're going to get dead real quick
[50:42.760 --> 50:48.760]  And I just want you to speak to where you actually see this going
[50:48.760 --> 50:50.760]  I know the new world order is going to fail
[50:50.760 --> 50:56.760]  But it's only going to fail if the people are willing to actually reject the systems of control
[50:56.760 --> 51:00.760]  Listen, it's going to fail because people are going to deny, deny, deny
[51:00.760 --> 51:04.760]  And then as they get enslaved and as things get worse and worse
[51:04.760 --> 51:05.760]  They're going to be forced to resist
[51:05.760 --> 51:07.760]  And the elite always kill each other
[51:07.760 --> 51:10.760]  So it will collapse through that
[51:10.760 --> 51:15.760]  So you think that the elite are basically going to cannibalize the top of the pyramid
[51:15.760 --> 51:17.760]  Let me explain something
[51:17.760 --> 51:21.760]  The elite hate to see a good looking, healthy, clean cut family
[51:21.760 --> 51:23.760]  They hate seeing you healthy
[51:23.760 --> 51:26.760]  They get off on you getting cancer
[51:26.760 --> 51:30.760]  They get off on you getting horrible degenerative diseases from all the crap they put in the food and water
[51:30.760 --> 51:32.760]  They brag about it
[51:32.760 --> 51:33.760]  They revel
[51:33.760 --> 51:35.760]  They enjoy the joy of evil
[51:35.760 --> 51:37.760]  They just revel, sir
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.760]  To them, dead children in cages is beautiful
[51:41.760 --> 51:43.760]  To them, dead maggot covered
[51:43.760 --> 51:49.760]  Have you seen what the most popular art is fetching in every auction the most money now?

[53:00.760 --> 53:03.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[53:03.760 --> 53:06.760]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[53:06.760 --> 53:09.760]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[53:09.760 --> 53:12.760]  That's just as powerful, just as strong
[53:12.760 --> 53:14.760]  Just as well-funded
[53:14.760 --> 53:17.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[53:17.760 --> 53:20.760]  That Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[53:20.760 --> 53:22.760]  While Obama's already fudging
[53:22.760 --> 53:25.760]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election
[53:25.760 --> 53:28.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[53:28.760 --> 53:31.760]  A personality cultist who is imposing the program
[53:31.760 --> 53:35.760]  Of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[53:35.760 --> 53:37.760]  That's fascism
[53:37.760 --> 53:38.760]  It's not about left or right
[53:38.760 --> 53:40.760]  It's about a one-world government
[53:40.760 --> 53:43.760]  This film documents who Obama works for
[53:43.760 --> 53:45.760]  The lies he is told

[53:55.760 --> 53:57.760]  The Obama deception
[53:57.760 --> 54:00.760]  The people strike back
[54:00.760 --> 54:03.760]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs
[54:03.760 --> 54:05.760]  As the dollar continues to fall in value

[55:00.760 --> 55:08.760]  No matter how hard you try you can't stop us now
[55:08.760 --> 55:16.760]  No matter how hard you try you can't stop us now
[55:16.760 --> 55:33.760]  There's atomic age, there's atomic age, there's atomic age
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.760]  Alright, let's go back to, I gotta hurry, I said I'd take a lot of calls, man
[55:37.760 --> 55:38.760]  I am going to
[55:38.760 --> 55:41.760]  Just there's so much information I want to get out there to people
[55:41.760 --> 55:43.760]  We're in deep trouble folks, but not if we fight back
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.760]  Take these little slime bag criminals and put them in the present where they deserve to be
[55:48.760 --> 55:51.760]  But you gotta get your guts back, you gotta get your fury back
[55:51.760 --> 55:57.760]  Let's go ahead and go back to Tom, finish up Tom
[55:57.760 --> 56:03.760]  Well, I think you made a really good point about the illegal aliens earlier in the show
[56:03.760 --> 56:11.760]  About how they are truly free in the sense that they have solid family structures
[56:11.760 --> 56:14.760]  And they're rejecting these mechanisms of control
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.760]  That the American people, the citizens of the United States of America
[56:18.760 --> 56:22.760]  Openly accept and bow to
[56:22.760 --> 56:25.760]  And that's why the police just leave them alone
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.760]  An example, again, an illegal alien in a Winnebago without driver's license or insurance
[56:30.760 --> 56:32.760]  They let them go 98% of the time, that's admitted
[56:32.760 --> 56:34.760]  But a citizen, they seize it and auction it and love it
[56:34.760 --> 56:38.760]  Because they know the citizens have been trained to be domesticated animals
[56:38.760 --> 56:42.760]  And I guess what I'm trying to get at in calling today is
[56:42.760 --> 56:50.760]  I would really like you to comment on how deep into this do you think that we are going to go
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.760]  In terms of the suffering, in terms of the people being deprived
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.760]  Thomas Jefferson said, tyranny, tyrants will take you as far as you let them
[56:59.760 --> 57:02.760]  They will go all the way to hell
[57:02.760 --> 57:06.760]  I mean, they will take you just to levels unimaginable, Tom, thanks for the call
[57:06.760 --> 57:09.760]  Fabian in Canada, you're on the air, Fabian
[57:09.760 --> 57:11.760]  Hey, hello
[57:11.760 --> 57:12.760]  Hey
[57:12.760 --> 57:13.760]  Hey, how's it going?
[57:13.760 --> 57:14.760]  Good
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.760]  Good, I got a question about the comprehensive annual financial reports in Canada
[57:19.760 --> 57:20.760]  Yes
[57:20.760 --> 57:23.760]  Do you know anything about them?
[57:23.760 --> 57:27.760]  Well, when we started exposing them with Walter Birian and others in the late 90s
[57:27.760 --> 57:33.760]  Every county, every city, every state in western Europe, the United States, Canada, England, Australia
[57:33.760 --> 57:38.760]  Water districts, school districts, you name it, tens of thousands of governmental systems
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.760]  And quasi-governmental systems were publicly issuing them on the internet
[57:42.760 --> 57:44.760]  And putting in hard copies for anybody that requested them
[57:44.760 --> 57:50.760]  And the state of Texas had close to a trillion extra cash, separate off books and investments
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.760]  And the pension funds through government had it
[57:54.760 --> 57:56.760]  And that's what they've stolen with the derivatives
[57:56.760 --> 57:59.760]  They weren't about to let the people ever actually get that
[57:59.760 --> 58:03.760]  And so, yes, it's the double set of books, you just have to Google the name of your town or city
[58:03.760 --> 58:06.760]  And comprehensive annual financial report
[58:06.760 --> 58:08.760]  And you will be reading it
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.760]  I've got the more recent ones from Alberta and Canada
[58:12.760 --> 58:20.760]  They began excising them by 2000, though, not putting as much meat in there, but yes
[58:20.760 --> 58:26.760]  Okay, because I can't find anything back behind 98 to actually see those numbers
[58:26.760 --> 58:29.760]  Like you guys talk about on the Walter Breen and stuff
[58:29.760 --> 58:33.760]  Well, I mean, if you see my film, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed
[58:33.760 --> 58:34.760]  Yeah, I have, yeah
[58:34.760 --> 58:40.760]  We show you the official state of Texas and the official city of Manhattan, New York state
[58:40.760 --> 58:45.760]  Small school districts where you might have 500 students total
[58:45.760 --> 58:50.760]  You know, we'll have 35 million extra cream money that's totally off budget
[58:50.760 --> 58:53.760]  See, they distract you with a discussion of budget
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.760]  While over here you have the real set of books called Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports
[58:58.760 --> 59:03.760]  And the mafia invented this in the 30s in Chicago and they took over the city completely
[59:03.760 --> 59:07.760]  A double set of books and then the Pentagon adopted it in 50
[59:07.760 --> 59:12.760]  And then it went worldwide then, it's called the Chicago 1313 model
[59:12.760 --> 59:13.760]  Nice
[59:13.760 --> 59:16.760]  I was also hoping to talk about Jay Ingram for a second
[59:16.760 --> 59:18.760]  Jay Ingram, who's that?
[59:18.760 --> 59:22.760]  He's on the Daily Planet, he's a big reporter of global warming
[59:22.760 --> 59:27.760]  Well, is he saying we have to give up all of our freedoms or we're dead or something?
[59:27.760 --> 59:31.760]  Yeah, pretty much, you know, he's all for the overpopulation eugenics and...
[59:31.760 --> 59:35.760]  Alright, stay there, I'm gonna come back in 70 seconds, let you finish up real quick
[59:35.760 --> 59:39.760]  And then we'll get to Joshua, Brian, Fred, Will and many others
[59:42.760 --> 59:44.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN

[59:48.760 --> 59:51.760]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones
[59:51.760 --> 59:54.760]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[59:54.760 --> 59:56.760]  And today that's more important than ever
[59:56.760 --> 59:59.760]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key
[59:59.760 --> 1:00:02.760]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread
[1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:06.760]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:00:06.760 --> 1:00:08.760]  In any emergency if you simply prepare
[1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:11.760]  No one is gonna take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:17.760]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:21.760]  Or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices

[1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:42.760]  Again, 800-409-5633

[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:16.760]  On the GCN Radio Network
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:19.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:21.760]  Alex Jones
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:24.760]  1-800-259-9231
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:26.760]  That is the toll free number to join us
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:28.760]  Wide open phones throughout the show today
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.760]  Tons of vital news and information
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:33.760]  Torch Humphrey in studio coming up in about an hour and a half
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:35.760]  A lot of open phones then as well
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:37.760]  Alright, finishing up Fabian in Canada
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:40.760]  Yeah, there's all these big newspapers and publications
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:43.760]  I don't know about the particular publication
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:45.760]  That you're talking about, but it's all over the news
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:49.760]  World leaders saying, we've got to cut our populations by 50%
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:51.760]  That's what they tell the public
[1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:54.760]  And we've got to have a one-child policy, attacks on children
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:56.760]  That's why they want to destroy the economy
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:58.760]  So you can't afford to have children
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:00.760]  Phony feminism was about getting women out of the house
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.760]  So the state would raise the children
[1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:04.760]  So they could tax the man and the woman
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:07.760]  That's in their own documents, Gloria Steinem was a CIA officer
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.760]  She wrote about that in two books
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:12.760]  Funded Miss Magazine to destroy the family
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.760]  And all just be homeless and nobody cares about you
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:15.760]  Nobody can defend you
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:17.760]  The world's a dangerous place
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:20.760]  The veneer of civilization is paper thin
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:23.760]  And the family is the greatest defense against that
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:25.760]  So they've done a good job of annihilating it
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:27.760]  Fabian, go ahead and finish up
[1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:30.760]  Yeah, I just asked him two questions at a little talk
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:33.760]  He had in Calgary and one of them was
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:36.760]  Isn't the Earth CO2 impoverished and he answered back with
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:39.760]  Well, it wasn't at Warmer back then, you know, when CO2 was higher
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.760]  And then my other question was
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:46.760]  Doesn't CO2 come after temperature and he's like
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:52.760]  He uses the basic rebuttal to any CO2 argument
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:55.760]  Well, the instruments weren't good enough or something
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:59.760]  Yeah, well, this is why, and I appreciate your call
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:02.760]  They want to restrict scientific inquiry they don't control
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:06.760]  That's why they're trying to ban
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:09.760]  Denying that there is global warming and climate change
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:10.760]  And that it's deadly
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:12.760]  They want to ban that because they can't allow
[1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:15.760]  Other scientific institutions to prove it's a fraud
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:17.760]  You know, NASA's own scans of the sun
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:18.760]  We don't have to believe NASA
[1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:21.760]  We have all these other universities and governments looking at it
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:24.760]  The sun goes through a 12-year cycle
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.760]  And it was one of the hottest, you know, highest levels of radiation
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:31.760]  Ever recorded coming off the sun, the different wavelengths
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:33.760]  Ever recorded over 300 years
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:37.760]  The sun's one of the most recorded, you know, things out there
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:41.760]  It's important
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:45.760]  Now it's entered the coolest cycle ever before it recorded
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:50.760]  But it's set to now go back up in the cycle and peak in 2012
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:51.760]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.760]  And I have the big NASA report on that one
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:54.760]  We'll have a prisonplanet.tv later
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:56.760]  I'm going to put these articles up on screen
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.760]  And show you the different graphs
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:02.760]  And that's why when the sun went into the hottest cycle ever recorded
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:07.760]  The ice moons of Jupiter and Saturn became liquid
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:09.760]  They were liquid methane, other things
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:10.760]  Now they're frozen again
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:13.760]  The ice caps of Mars were receding at several miles a year
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.760]  They're now exploding in size
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:23.760]  Because of the fact that the sun has now cooled
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.760]  Let's take another call here
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:26.760]  Let's talk to Joshua in Florida
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:28.760]  Joshua, you're on the air
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.760]  Alex Jones, how are you doing, my friend?
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:31.760]  Good
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:34.760]  I just want to give you and your listeners a quick update
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:36.760]  On the growing resistance here in the state of Florida
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:38.760]  I spoke to you last week about what we're doing
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:41.760]  And I'd say it is just growing and growing and growing
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.760]  Two things specifically I want to discuss
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:47.760]  We do have a 10th Amendment resolution introduced
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.760]  And I encourage all your listeners who are Florida residents to visit
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:54.760]  Write this down, please
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:59.760]  www.billofrightsday.org
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:02.760]  You can download the PDF and just print it directly off
[1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:05.760]  And send that to your state legislature
[1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:06.760]  And get that ball rolling
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:11.760]  Secondly, we're currently organizing for a big end of Fed protest
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:14.760]  At the Jacksonville and the Miami Federal Reserve branches
[1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:18.760]  On the 25th of this month, it's nationwide protest
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:21.760]  I encourage everyone again, please come to our website
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:27.760]  www.meadup.com, backslash, Orlando, 9-11-truth
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:31.760]  And there are Glenn Beck 9-12 meetings
[1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:33.760]  Where he's trying to take over our movement
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:35.760]  We need to take over his movement
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.760]  The 15th, there's tea parties everywhere
[1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:40.760]  There is massive resistance forming everywhere
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:42.760]  The will to resist is exploding
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:44.760]  The media is trying to ignore it, but that doesn't matter
[1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:45.760]  It's a dying dinosaur
[1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:47.760]  Good to hear from you, Joshua, we got a jump
[1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:51.760]  Brian, Fred, Will, our team and many others
[1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:52.760]  Your call straight ahead
[1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:54.760]  I'm going to phone blitz when we get back
[1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:57.760]  On the other side of this quick break, infowars.com

[1:06:50.760 --> 1:07:00.760]  www.prisonplanet.tv
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:06.760]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:09.760]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.760]  That's just as powerful, just as strong
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:14.760]  Just as well-funded
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:17.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:20.760]  That Obama is working for the best interests of the American people
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:22.760]  Well, Obama's already fudging
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:25.760]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:28.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:31.760]  A personality cultist who is imposing the program
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:35.760]  Of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:36.760]  That's fascism
[1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:38.760]  It's not about left or right
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:40.760]  It's about a one-world government
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:43.760]  This film documents who Obama works for
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:45.760]  The lies he is told
[1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:47.760]  And his real agenda

[1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:02.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:05.760]  Probably presents The Alex Jones Show
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:08.760]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:33.760]  As we speak, the financial criminals, the treasury secretaries and
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:37.760]  Governors of the private banking system are meeting in Europe
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:41.760]  To openly set up what they call a global government
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:46.760]  Owned, run and paid for by the taxpayers
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:50.760]  But dominated by the elite
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:53.760]  That is, we finance it, but it's private
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:10:00.760]  And private groups then set the rules, the regulations over the planet
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:05.760]  And it's all over the newspapers, hundreds and hundreds of newspapers
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:10.760]  And that's why you see all these Fox News people and others
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:12.760]  Having to come out and admit it's real
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:14.760]  Because they look ridiculous denying it
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.760]  Like they always did in the past
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:19.760]  So you'll have no say in it, no control
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:21.760]  The very bankers that have engineered all this
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.760]  Are out there having press conferences
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:25.760]  And diverting and distracting you about
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:27.760]  Oh, how they need more money
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:29.760]  But Dick Morris is right on Fox News
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:33.760]  That is the side show
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:39.760]  The real issue is what they put in their draft resolutions
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:42.760]  They want a world tax rate on average of over 80%
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:44.760]  On every man, woman and child in the country
[1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:48.760]  No matter what nation you live in, on the planet
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:54.760]  They want environmental carbon taxes on every facet of your life
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:57.760]  They will control the value of currencies
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.760]  So they can manipulate things to their profit
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  And destroy nations further to consolidate them
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:04.760]  They will control global interest rates
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:08.760]  This is all being set up right now
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:12.760]  And we'll continue to track that as it unfolds
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:14.760]  Alright, let's go back to the calls
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:16.760]  Let's talk to Brian in Alabama
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:17.760]  Go ahead, Brian
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:18.760]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.760]  Good, sir
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:22.760]  I wanted to talk about the FEMA camp
[1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:24.760]  I know you're doing a big expose there
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:26.760]  And tomorrow I think it has a Glenn Beck show
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:29.760]  But, you know, I wanted to...
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.760]  Something people I think don't understand
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:33.760]  Is that there's different types of FEMA camps
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:36.760]  And they're not all like giant death camps
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:41.760]  And I want to know if you could speak to that a little bit
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:44.760]  Well, I have been so busy
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:46.760]  Because I'm already shooting new interviews
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  For a new Obama film
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:53.760]  That I'm going to be releasing on July 4th
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:56.760]  As something to accompany
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:58.760]  And to compliment the Obama deception
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:02.760]  That's just taken off like a rocket
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:06.760]  And so, again, two weeks ago
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:08.760]  When Glenn Beck was saying he was going to debunk
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:12.760]  The FEMA camps and that he was going to
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:15.760]  See if they were real or not
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:18.760]  I said, you watch, it's going to be a hit piece
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:20.760]  In fact, to be clear, going back a few months ago
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.760]  He started saying on every show
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:25.760]  On radio and TV, on Fox and on his radio show
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:27.760]  I'm going to look at the FEMA camps
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:29.760]  It looks like they may be real
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:31.760]  I'm going to cover them
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:33.760]  And then show after show, he would go on other Fox shows
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  And say, tonight on my show, I'm going to expose it
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:38.760]  It looks like it's real
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  And I said, folks, he's only doing that
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:44.760]  To get your confidence, he's going to debunk them
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:48.760]  These guys have lost so much credibility now
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:52.760]  That...
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:54.760]  They have to first try to get your confidence
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:55.760]  To then stab you in the back
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:59.760]  And sure enough, last week he announces
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:05.760]  That coming up the Monday after next
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:07.760]  And that's now, next Monday
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:09.760]  That he's going to have popular mechanics on
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:11.760]  To debunk it and that it's not true
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:14.760]  And it was only kernels of truth
[1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:15.760]  And so how they're going to do it is
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.760]  They're going to go, yeah, there's a bill
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:21.760]  For homeless people to give them a safe place to live
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:23.760]  And yeah, there's a few military plans
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:26.760]  If there's a terror attack from temporary shelter
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  And these are not death camps like the Nazis had
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:31.760]  And these people have exaggerated
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.760]  And then they're going to show
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:37.760]  Louisiana or Mississippi
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:39.760]  Those are some of the most famous photos
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:41.760]  Been out for a decade
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:44.760]  Quote, US Army NATO training camp
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:48.760]  And it's set up like a refugee camp
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.760]  In Kosovo, in Serbia, in Bosnia
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:55.760]  And it's got barbed wire facing in
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.760]  It's got guard towers
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:02.760]  I'm guessing they're going to show that
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:03.760]  Because I know how they operate
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:04.760]  And some of the things they said
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  Oh, we've got the photos, but it isn't what you think
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:13.760]  So if they see, it's just an Army training camp
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:16.760]  And there won't be any discussions on the scores
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:18.760]  Of different types of camps
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:21.760]  The current camps that have prisoners on them
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:23.760]  The city council members we've had on
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:24.760]  From like Washington State
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:25.760]  Where the Army approached them and said
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.760]  We want you to give us this city land
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:31.760]  Because we're going to have a collapse of the society
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:33.760]  This was like four years ago I had the city council
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:36.760]  Went on, it was on local NBC TV
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:38.760]  See, I've got to, here's the problem
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:40.760]  I have to sit down
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  This is the process with this much data
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:45.760]  Because I didn't have enough webmasters in the past
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:47.760]  To always take any new FEMA camp article
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.760]  And put it in the subsection
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:51.760]  We're trying to work on this
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:53.760]  And I have to sit down with a piece of paper
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:55.760]  And write probably 20, 30 pages of notes
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:57.760]  Of things I remember
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:00.760]  Then I have to go on Google
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:02.760]  And spend hours and hours and hours
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:05.760]  And I've got to do it tonight now
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:06.760]  So I didn't do it last night
[1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:08.760]  I got home and actually spent a few hours
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:09.760]  With my wife and children
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:12.760]  Then I got tired at about 10 and went to bed
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:14.760]  I just, it's such a responsibility
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:17.760]  And I just can't handle it anymore
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:20.760]  The point is, is that
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:22.760]  Bills to put Americans in FEMA camps
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:23.760]  At the state levels
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:25.760]  Rhode Island with the governor said
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:26.760]  If you criticize the government
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:27.760]  You'll be put in a forced labor camp
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:30.760]  That was in the
[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:33.760]  That was in the major paper
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:34.760]  In the capital city there
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:36.760]  And it was also on local TV
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:38.760]  I have to find those and pull them
[1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  I have to show the accompanying legislation
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:43.760]  I have to pull all the U.S. Army codes
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:46.760]  I have to pull the civilian and make labor camp program
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.760]  I have to get all of that
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:49.760]  And all the video clips
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:51.760]  Because I want to throw the kitchen sink at them
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:54.760]  I want to show just hundreds of pieces of evidence
[1:15:54.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  I mean, I could do a show right now
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:58.760]  And show 20, 30 pieces in Washington Post
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:00.760]  And Houston Chronicle
[1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:02.760]  And admitting they have camps for civil unrest
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:04.760]  And Senate hearings admitting it
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:05.760]  No, no, no, no
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:08.760]  I want to hit them with the whole picture
[1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:10.760]  And then also counter how they're going to debunk
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.760]  And show that I understand their minds so well
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:16.760]  And how they operate that I'm going to predict
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:19.760]  How the debunking works next Monday
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:20.760]  And here's the problem
[1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:23.760]  I leave here today to go to George Humphrey's house
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:25.760]  To interview him for the next Obama film
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:27.760]  I'll probably get home about seven
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:28.760]  But I will do it
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:29.760]  I'll drink a bunch of coffee
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:31.760]  And I'll stay up till three in the morning
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:32.760]  And I am going to come in here
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:34.760]  In fact, guys, who's?
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:38.760]  Paul Hartman and Mr. Nyhart
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:40.760]  I need you both here an hour early tomorrow
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:41.760]  Can you do that?
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:44.760]  Because I have to bring in a huge group of printouts
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.760]  Mainstream news articles and bills
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:49.760]  And I need you to have them already pulled up
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:50.760]  With a web address as a list
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:51.760]  And then all the video clips
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:54.760]  So that'll be an hour meeting before tomorrow
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:56.760]  I mean, think of Fox
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:58.760]  Beck is probably 100 people working for him
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:16:59.760]  And he can do what?
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:00.760]  Sir?
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:04.760]  Oh, my God
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:05.760]  That's right
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:07.760]  I have lawyer meetings tomorrow
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.760]  And I, since I was getting home early
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:11.760]  I told my kids I'd take them fishing
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:13.760]  That fishing has to wait
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:14.760]  I'm not going to
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:16.760]  Oh, man, my wife is going to get mad
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.760]  They've been so excited all week
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:21.760]  No, I have to do it
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:23.760]  I have to do it
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:25.760]  See, I don't want to wait till Monday
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:27.760]  And then launch it hours before
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:29.760]  Because if we get the jump on them
[1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:30.760]  And have it all over the web
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:31.760]  Debunking them before
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:35.760]  Then I can really expose them
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:37.760]  I should have launched it earlier this week
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  Oh, man
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:43.760]  You know, I could get ready
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:44.760]  On the nights this weekend
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:47.760]  And launch it Monday
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:50.760]  And then get it up on the Alex Jones channel
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:52.760]  On YouTube before
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:55.760]  So it can go viral
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.760]  All that matters is I broadcast it
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:58.760]  Before they broadcast a show
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:00.760]  I know their attack profile
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:03.760]  People always like that trick
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:05.760]  That kind of illustrates for them
[1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:07.760]  Because if I debunk it afterwards
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:09.760]  It needs to be debunked before
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:11.760]  Oh, man
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:13.760]  Yeah, Burma's is in here tomorrow
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:18.760]  See, I say I'm going to take a lot of calls
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:20.760]  And then this happens because this isn't just
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:23.760]  Just quick answers
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.760]  Brian in Alabama
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:27.760]  There's going to be an expose on the FEMA camps
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:29.760]  I already did one two or three weeks ago
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:31.760]  That's been an hour on
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:32.760]  And I showed
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:34.760]  In fact, let's just get that up now
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.760]  I know that's on prisonplanet.tv
[1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:38.760]  What date was that?
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:41.760]  What was the date when it was the
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:43.760]  Day after Glenn Beck had
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:45.760]  Popper Mechanics on say it was a debunk it
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:47.760]  No, no, no, that came after
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:49.760]  I said watch, he's going to debunk it
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.760]  He's claiming he's going to expose it
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:52.760]  He's going to debunk it
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:54.760]  So that was about a week before that
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:55.760]  About two and a half weeks ago
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:18:56.760]  That doesn't matter
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.760]  You know, I can't do it all, ladies and gentlemen
[1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:00.760]  I just can't do it all anymore
[1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:03.760]  But does that answer your question there, Brian?
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:06.760]  Yeah, I was also going to talk about how
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.760]  Some of the Rex 84 camps that you're talking about
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:10.760]  You know, the civilian internment camps
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:13.760]  There's one that actually I live really close to
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:15.760]  It's in Fort McClellan, Alabama
[1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:18.760]  And there's a few, I think, kind of unique
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:20.760]  Features of this particular FEMA camp
[1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:21.760]  Because when I first heard about them
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:22.760]  I was a little skeptical and I was like
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:23.760]  When I found out there was one, you know
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:25.760]  15 minutes from my house back home
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:27.760]  I went and checked it out
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:29.760]  And it used to be an internment camp
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.760]  For the Japanese back in World War II
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:35.760]  And they've turned into a giant FEMA facility now
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  And they do a lot of training there
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:39.760]  For biological attacks and stuff
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:41.760]  It's actually one of the major centers
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:44.760]  In the United States to do this
[1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:46.760]  And another interesting thing about this
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:48.760]  Is they have the FEMA camps where they, you know
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:50.760]  You can tell they've got FEMA buses and shuttles
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  And you can tell them you put people there
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:55.760]  About 15 minutes away at the Anson Army Depot
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:57.760]  They have a giant incinerator
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.760]  That's about just to be
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:01.760]  It's not going to be used anymore
[1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.760]  They use it to burn up a bunch of
[1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:05.760]  Mustard gas and nerve agents
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:07.760]  From World War I
[1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:09.760]  That's from Aniston
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:12.760]  Listen, you need to go shoot video of that
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:14.760]  File a report, post it on YouTube
[1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:16.760]  We'll link to it, but yes, I'm aware of those facilities
[1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:20.760]  And again, they're all dual use
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:22.760]  And so what they do is they go
[1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:24.760]  Well, yeah, we got some state prisoners
[1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:26.760]  That live at the base in the military overseas
[1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:28.760]  And what's wrong with that?
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:30.760]  They're acclimating everybody
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:32.760]  They don't just immediately say these are death camps
[1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:34.760]  Just like I told you, they wouldn't just
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:36.760]  Immediately say troops on the streets
[1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:38.760]  They had to acclimate you first
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:39.760]  Look, I can't do it all
[1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:41.760]  I need all of you to go to the camps
[1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:43.760]  You can go to the 24 camps listed in the
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:45.760]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program
[1:20:45.760 --> 1:20:47.760]  Just Google Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program
[1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:49.760]  Army Regulation 210-35
[1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:51.760]  You can go to all the camps for yourself
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:53.760]  And now they got the buses ready
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:56.760]  By the way, we did dig out the Rocky Mountain News article
[1:20:56.760 --> 1:20:58.760]  Find that curtain in the article about it
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:00.760]  With the incinerators
[1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:03.760]  The New World Order Beast
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:06.760]  Is genetically modifying your food
[1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:10.760]  Genetically modifying mixing vegetables with animals
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:14.760]  And now experimenting with viruses
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:17.760]  Without a long term food solution
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:20.760]  You will have just two options
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:23.760]  Starve or surrender
[1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:26.760]  And food supplies will eventually run out
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:29.760]  What? Then? Then?
[1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.760]  Go your own healthy food

[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:02.760]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:04.760]  April 2, 2009
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:06.760]  Gold opened this morning at 9.1440
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:08.760]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for
[1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.760]  9.4085, 4.7042 for the half ounce
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.760]  And 2.3521 for a quarter ounce
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:18.760]  That's 9.4085, 4.7042 and 2.3521
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:20.760]  On June 4, 1963
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:22.760]  An unknown presidential decree
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:25.760]  Executive order 11,110 was signed
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:27.760]  With the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank
[1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:29.760]  Of its power to lend money to the United States
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:31.760]  Government and interest
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:33.760]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:34.760]  The Fed out of business
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:36.760]  The November assassination quieted the production
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:38.760]  Of the new currency, however the executive order
[1:22:38.760 --> 1:22:40.760]  Still stands unrepealed
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:43.760]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  Call 800-686-2237
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:48.760]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free

[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:04.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:07.760]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:09.760]  We've got to give them a stake in creating
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:11.760]  The kind of world order that I think
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.760]  All of us would like to see
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:16.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:18.760]  That Obama is working for the best interest
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:19.760]  Of the American people
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:21.760]  Well Obama's already fudging
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.760]  He's fudged since day one in this election
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:26.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:29.760]  Of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:32.760]  Of a group of extreme bankers
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:35.760]  And finance oligarchs, that's fascism
[1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:38.760]  It's not about left or right
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:40.760]  It's about a one world government
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.760]  This film documents who Obama works for

[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:18.200]  I know two and a half weeks ago I did a full hour plus breaking down the FEMA camps
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:25.320]  and that was a huge expose. I want Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, everybody
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:31.880]  to go get those YouTubes because I know they got grabbed from PrisonPlanet.tv where it's
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.600]  uploaded for members of my quality and posted there. Post those this weekend in the story
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:44.200]  saying that Monday I'm gonna do two hours, the full report, and that'll give me all weekend
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:51.560]  to dig out everything I want to cover and to also go over. Rob, you're talking to me. What's
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:57.400]  going on? Too much is happening. It's like a war room. Okay, good. Thank you. Do I have the
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:01.720]  number for this freedom nugget I'm supposed to do on 93.7? I'm supposed to call there in the next break.
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:09.480]  Okay, good. That's the thing. I'm not whining. It's just it's crazy up here. It's just absolutely
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:15.080]  crazy. Everything that's going on, how many angles we're getting hit from, what we're doing. I promise
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:18.440]  go to your calls, but to do that, I can't spend 15 minutes with one caller. I've got to give each
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:23.240]  caller about a minute and a half. Let's talk to Fred in Texas. Fred, you're on the air.
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:29.640]  Hello, Alex. How are you doing today? Just all right. That sounds excellent. I just want to let
[1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:34.600]  you know I called into Sean Hannity's show on the 10th right before Obama deception came out
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:40.040]  and I was trying to plug it. Of course, I had to go through this intense screener who asked
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:45.880]  basically my entire life story and what I did was I finally got on and I talked to him about
[1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:50.920]  Gordon Brown to try to set him up for it and he was pretty much ripping into Obama the whole
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:56.680]  time and I figured if I plugged in the Obama deception movie, he would start asking questions
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:01.560]  about it. But of course, he has all that inside knowledge already. Your movie is very popular.
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:05.240]  It was popular before it came out. And as soon as I mentioned it, he goes,
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:08.440]  oh, I'm bleeping you out and he clicked me off right at the very second I said.
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:14.600]  Yeah. So before the film even came out, you said the Obama deception film and he cuts you off.
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:18.920]  Yeah. No, no, they listened to the show. They tracked the show. That's been admitted by folks
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:25.880]  at Fox News to me on the phone. They follow it and it's incredible. See, you can't attack Obama
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:30.440]  from a real perspective that he's an elitist globalist. You've got to say he's a liberal,
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:33.800]  so the Republicans can be your savior. So the elites stay in power.
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:39.640]  Right. And what I did is I, you know, I think if anybody else wants to call into these talk shows
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:44.520]  like O'Reilly and, and, and, uh, Hannity, they need to set up the screener a little bit and maybe
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:48.920]  fill a little bit to get on to be able to plug these things because the screener is real intense.
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:52.040]  If you mentioned anything about, you know, you don't believe in the left, right paradigm,
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:55.320]  she's going to say, well, I can't fit you in or something similar like that. She'll,
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:59.160]  she'll make it hard to yeah, they're managing reality. But, but so he said a little something
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:04.840]  to you before he delayed you. Right. He just, he even mentioned before the, uh, the, he started
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:08.920]  taking calls that there was a 30 second delay because of all the nut, the liberal left people,
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:13.480]  the left, right, wacko left, left-wing wackos are, you know, he has to have that 30 second delay to
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:17.480]  be able to, you know, maintain control. And so I knew I was going to get bleep bleep. And as soon
[1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:21.800]  as soon as I heard myself come live on the show on the radio, sure enough, he'd already started
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:25.240]  the next caller. So I didn't know when I really got to hear it, but I was letting you know that I
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:30.040]  tried to get through and I'm trying to find what you do is you do what Mark Dice does. You record it
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:34.600]  and then you put it on YouTube and then all of his censorship can be exposed. But you know,
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:39.000]  it's, it's really not even technically censorship because they own their show. They can do what
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  they want. Uh, really censorship would be the government coming in and telling you what you
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.720]  could say on your own show or what Sean Hannity could say or do. Uh, but technically what it is
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:53.640]  is them trying to manage reality and keep the left, right paradigm going. Good to hear from
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:57.800]  you. Interesting. Good job. And I just want to let y'all know that, you know, your callers need to,
[1:28:57.800 --> 1:29:01.720]  if they want to call into those places, they need to really set those screeners up
[1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:05.480]  so they can really try to get something out and have it recorded. You know, I tried to get a
[1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:08.920]  recorder. My recorder wasn't working for some reason, but at least I just want to let y'all know
[1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:13.480]  about it because. Hey, good job. Good to hear from you. Yeah, it's a cash 22. I got to cut
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:17.800]  shop. I'll never get to all these callers. Uh, our team in Canada, go ahead.
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:34.840]  Hi, Alex Jones. Um, it's my first time calling in and I've been a conspiracy skeptic for a long
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:39.880]  time, but we're, but the moment when I really woke up to this whole thing was during my
[1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:47.720]  graduation speech and the guy who gave the speech was a Muslim guy and he basically
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:53.320]  he delivered the message that we're the generation that, um, that's going to put this thing together.
[1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:59.000]  And it was like totally out in the open. And just because it is Canada and no one,
[1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:07.960]  so, uh, uh, I mean, in my generation, no, no one values liberty in and of itself and
[1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:11.880]  everyone believes in socialism. I mean, they just swallowed that thing.
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:18.600]  Okay. To be clear, yes, sir, we're here. We're on air right now. Uh, at your college graduation
[1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:25.480]  speech, they came in and told you the new world order was good. Uh, well, they didn't use the word
[1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:30.680]  the new world order, but at the same time, they talked about massive redistribution of,
[1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:37.320]  of wealth. We talked about population control. They talked about like more government regulation
[1:30:37.320 --> 1:30:44.360]  over everything and eliminating pa, poverty, equality, equality. Yeah, it's actually to
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:49.240]  keep poverty in place. Stay there. I'll let you finish up when we get back on here. What college this was?
[1:30:51.240 --> 1:30:57.960]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:06.760]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:12.840]  allows you to have? It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:19.320]  technology is coming. Not if, but when. Hi, Bill. I just wanted to call in and let you folks know
[1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:24.040]  that I got my solar backup generator hooked up and running to tell you the truth. It's awesome.
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:30.360]  Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV and shortwave radio. I now
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:35.080]  know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid. Thanks for all your help. This generator is
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:40.600]  solar powered, complete with battery backup has no moving parts to wear out or break and requires
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:46.280]  no gas. Don't wait for the energies are to cut your power or raise your rates, produce your own
[1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:56.760]  electricity for free. Go to my solar backup.com. That's my solar backup.com or call 877-327-0365

[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:12.600]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:19.240]  just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:24.840]  best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:29.960]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:37.240]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:42.920]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:50.360]  works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:09.240]  earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days. Anyone that's ever
[1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:13.800]  been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight. That's why you need

[1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:31.400]  you need it most. One Florida customer says, My pack light has lasted through four hurricane in
[1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:37.560]  two years, over 30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery. The pack light
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:43.400]  comes with a 25 year warranty and prices started just $12.99. It's time for you to be prepared

[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:11.160]  Big John. Big John. Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive. He stood six foot six
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:17.240]  and waited 245 kind of broad at the shoulder and there at the hip and everybody knew you didn't give
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:24.680]  no lift to the big John. All right, let's go back to Artem in Canada than many others, 1-800-259-9231.
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:30.760]  Open phones today. A ton of news coming up and George Humphrey in studio economist, author,
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:36.520]  researcher on what's happening in the world today. Always informative. So tell us your
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:44.520]  university. It's the graduation speech. What happens? It's Concordia University and it's the
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:49.400]  second rate university in Montreal because everyone knows McGill and no one really knows
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:54.600]  Concordia because it's fairly new and that's the one that makes a lot of noise with all those
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:35:00.760]  Palestinians breaking windows every time someone from Israel comes by to give a speech. I mean
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:09.960]  unfortunately we have that kind of infamy but I was really shocked by the whole New World Order
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:17.160]  speech because what used to be relegated to quote unquote conspiracy theories is like really out in
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:24.280]  the open. But sir, it's always been out in the open. I mean, I have New York Times articles
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:28.920]  from the 30s with the 10 FEMA regions they were going to set up and how we'd be part of the North
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:35.960]  American Union. So they just arrogantly told everybody it didn't exist and that you were a
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:41.160]  cuckoo if you talked about it. All we were reading was government documents, sir. Actually,
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:47.080]  actually the way it found out about the whole Alex Jones movement was through
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:53.960]  southern secessionists because I sort of get interested in that and the reasons people fly
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:36:00.360]  the rebel flag and the other side of the story. So I've followed H.K. Edgerton's Southern Heritage
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:12.040]  411 and Mike Tuggle's rebellion blog and that's where I found a link because essentially
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:17.960]  these days the reason the settlers want to secede is that they don't want to be part of this New
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:22.920]  World Order. Yeah, well, there's going to be secessionist movements and rebellions all over
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:28.520]  the planet to this and the globalists plan to use the crises of those conflict to expand their
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:33.560]  power. Again, they create crises and then offer the solution. Problem reaction solution. Good to
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:38.200]  hear from you. I'm glad you've woken up, sir. Sorry I had to hear that speech about population
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:43.320]  reduction and all the rest of it, but that's the crowning achievement of the New World Order.
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:48.120]  This is not going to be pretty. Kyle in Canada, another caller from Canada. Go ahead, Kyle.
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:52.280]  Hey, how's it going today, Alex? Pretty good. Right on. I'd just like to bring up something
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:58.440]  to everybody's attention. I saw this watching live internet about in our legislator about a
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:02.120]  year ago. There's something called Bill 44, which is a pharmacy and drug amendment act.
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:07.160]  And basically this thing, there's a lady in the house that she totally was freaking out about
[1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:12.200]  this because it was basically a loss of our privacy totally. It was buried in the bottom of
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:16.600]  this thing. Yeah, the same bills are all being passed worldwide where everything you do is
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:20.920]  uploaded to the government instantly. It's all standardized. Everything's done the same. For
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:26.840]  36 years, everybody at birth has their blood taken to be put in a UN database. We call it a head
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:33.800]  start. They call it a secure start in England and something else start in Canada. It's all
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:38.600]  the same. It's global government already in place. They're just unveiling it.
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:43.000]  Yeah, exactly. And basically it took about a year for this to actually come into effect.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.920]  It actually came into effect yesterday and I got the bill right here. It actually says
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:52.360]  health information and personal information as defined of the Freedom Information and Protection
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:58.280]  of Privacy Act. It basically releases all of our private information to law enforcement agencies,
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:02.280]  any apparatus of the government, anything like that. It's buried in the bottom and all this
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:06.680]  bill is supposed to be for is just to give pharmacists the power to renew people's subscription
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:13.400]  or refill their medication without going back to their doctor. So...
[1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:19.480]  Well, sir, here they called it a privacy bill and it does the opposite. Listen,
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:25.960]  Homeland Security, the Pentagon, all of them openly are about to pass a law, but they're
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:32.760]  already doing it through FIAT. It's through executive regulations to take over all internet
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:38.520]  companies of any type, any infrastructure, any hubs. The way it's written, you could have one
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:43.560]  server in your office. They run it and you've got to give them backdoors into it. It has to be
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.920]  the architecture they give you so they can shut the web down in the name of defending the web.
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:56.280]  And the head of it, people say, well, there'd be whistleblowers. The head three weeks ago quit, went
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:39:01.720]  on the news and said this, and that was the end of it. So there are these whistleblowers. And
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:07.240]  it's just all happening, sir. Classical tyranny is now unfolding.
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:12.520]  Very staring. I guess just the point that I'd like to make to all Canadians is I even know
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:15.960]  all my friends and all my family. They've heard nothing about this bill. There's been no
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.240]  coverage of it on the news, anything like that. There was one lady in that whole legislator that
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:25.080]  totally freaked out. She said, this is the beginning in the dissent and the fascism,
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:31.080]  basically. And it's kind of just scary to see something like a pharmacy and drug amendment act
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:35.080]  and then buried in the bottom. It says, oh, by the way, we also are going to give all your private
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:38.760]  information to the police and government agencies whenever and whenever they need it.
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:42.280]  I appreciate your call. Yes, I was aware of that. It's happening everywhere.
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:47.880]  This is the cashless society control grid, the technological enslavement
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:55.000]  technocracy, really, is what it is. And they state this, the Pentagon states, they've designed it,
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:00.280]  MIT designed it, and they are going to track all your purchases, everything you're doing.
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:04.200]  You're going to see like a 70 year old lady buying a bottle of wine, being carted at the grocery
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:11.160]  store. And she'll say, Missy, why are you doing that? I'm obviously above 21. We just card everybody
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:15.240]  now. Well, I've read the big consortium meetings they've had. And what they do is they tell the
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:19.640]  companies, we'll give you a better insurance rate if you card everybody. And then you can go read
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:24.600]  the big conferences they've had, you know, meeting for IT and financial services. And they say,
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:30.920]  oh, we're complying with the regulations and preparing the public to scan their ID to buy and
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:37.240]  sell. I mean, this is public. And they've got all the fake conservatives out pushing a, quote,
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:42.120]  fair tax, a flat tax, but they're going to keep the income tax too. And then it's going to be a
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:46.520]  graduated sales tax, where if you're poor, you won't pay any sales taxes. But what it'll do is
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:52.040]  it'll know how much money you've got. So even if you pay cash off to swipe the card, then they know
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:57.800]  if there's an underground economy. Well, wait a minute, this shows you swiped your card for $32,000
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:05.640]  last year. But your tax filing through the card shows you only made 17,000. And that you were
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:11.320]  exempt from sales tax, but this card shows in the record shows that you're cheating. Oh my gosh,
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:19.960]  you're now indicted for tax cheating. And they have to do this as, see, they know what the cause
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:23.720]  and effect is. They're scientific about it. This is scientific dictatorships, what they call it.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:30.440]  Scientific dictatorship, the final revolution. This is Bloomberg, tax dodgers, multiplies underground
[1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:36.760]  economy cushions jobs. So they know as they destroy the real economy and as they tax you to a level
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:41.080]  that's unsustainable so you can't live, that you're going to be driven like the illegal aliens underground.
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:46.840]  But then they're going to come after you there. Oh, you're selling watermelons. You're selling
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:50.680]  eggs on the side of the road. SWAT team hits you. We're now getting reports of that every week.
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:56.680]  People are like, what? I'm just selling eggs. I'm putting you in handcuffs. You did this without
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:03.080]  a permit. You see, we may not allow you to have gardens. You might be growing pot, you know, cities
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:10.600]  announced. Carlos Cruz has a strategy for surviving the worst global recession in 60 years, pay less
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:16.040]  in taxes and pass the savings along to customers. I'm declaring half as much as I used to, said Cruz
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:23.320]  29, who runs a painting business in Madrid. Prices have fallen by 30%. Customers will choose
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:30.840]  you for a difference as little as 50 euros, said Cruz, an Ecuadorian who's lived in Spain's in 2001.
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:37.080]  Even in the U.S. and Japan and Europe, whether the first stimulus recessions, simultaneous
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:42.280]  recessions since World War II, some types of activity are expanding worldwide, just below
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:47.080]  government radar. The production of goods and services that are lawful through the declared
[1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:53.880]  may grow to the most as a proportion of total outputs in 2000, according to Frederick Schindler,
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:59.880]  a professor at Austria's Johans Kepler University in Lenz. And it just goes into the huge underground
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:03.960]  economy and our government's trying to shut it down. And last night, I was watching European
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.720]  parliament video feeds from the day, and it was all about how you've got a swipe of card in these
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:14.760]  countries to even have a job or to clock in or out that's hooked into the government. And that's
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:19.720]  what Homeland Security's announced. You'll swipe the card, the government card, when you check in
[1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:26.920]  and out of work. I mean, this is, they're going to squeeze you and press you till you bankrupt.
[1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:33.720]  That is what this is about. This is about driving everybody into bankruptcy but the elite. This
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:43.960]  is about control. The painter in Madrid said clients don't ask for receipts as much as they used to,
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:49.000]  willing to trade savings for the guarantee that having bills gives them. He couldn't afford
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:55.400]  to operate in the current crisis paying full taxes, he said. That talks about labor exchanges,
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:00.600]  barter starting up everywhere. So they're criminalizing it. They're going after it. They're trying
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:11.160]  to stop it. It's just amazing how they pull these operations off. Okay, let's go ahead and
[1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:18.680]  take another call here. Who's up next? Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:25.480]  Thank you, sir. The re-perseed that's relevant here because the dismay and despair is leading
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:31.720]  to joint excitement because, sadly, the organized crime pedagopally has held us all hostage to the
[1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:36.520]  continually counterproductive war on pot smokers, empan, medicinal marijuana enthusiasts for decades
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:43.240]  now. But the happy news is it's ironic that at least partially thanks to the psychopathic violent
[1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:49.320]  ruthlessness exploding from those illegal drug thugs south of the border, all citizens of the
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:56.600]  US can see clearly now that merely by canceling the illegality of farming, marijuana here,
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:01.400]  will help solve many, many problems. For example, all family farms in our nation
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:06.920]  will become more wealthy and sustainable no matter what they grow because of the inescapable
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:12.680]  dynamics of supply and demand. Everybody wins because just some of the farmers will grow some
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:17.880]  of this miraculously multifunctional, fibrous medicinal fruit crop while some farmers will
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:23.400]  choose not to, and that's just fine. All crops will earn more money across the board from now on.
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:29.080]  Less money, in fact, a great deal less money will from now on help finance violent criminal
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:35.000]  activity worldwide. So let's help conserve our honest law enforcement personnel by better
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:41.960]  prioritizing their much needed valuable work. And even our ongoing banks are instigated economic
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:51.240]  meltdown demands. Thanks for the call. I appreciate it. Look, drug prohibition is what has caused
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:57.000]  the crime, most of it. And if they legalize drugs tomorrow in Mexico, 98% of the of the
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:01.720]  violence would end. You'd probably have the drug dealers, though, going after government people
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:09.000]  for legalizing it, trying to kill them to make them criminalize it again. They know this. And
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:13.960]  they make money on the prisons. They make money on the police state. The police make money off
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:19.560]  the seizures. The CIA ships in the majority of the narcotics. The drug war you see is against
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:28.120]  their competition at the cartel level. And yes, that's definitely what's happening. Let's go
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:36.360]  ahead and talk to Paul in mass. Go ahead. How are you doing, Alex? Good. I have some very important
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:42.600]  information for you, Alex. And maybe your contacts can help you with this. A friend of mine works
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:49.160]  for a limousine business in Boston. Some people flew in military people flew in. They said that
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:55.880]  they had a secret emergency meeting in Devon for Devon's and mass last Friday, the 27th.
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:47:04.360]  And I guess the limo driver, he drove into the checkpoint to drop the people off.
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:11.080]  His passengers got out. Well, this he says that initially I'm going to drive them in further
[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:16.280]  and the guards at the gate sternly told them in motion to their guns like no, you won't matter
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:21.960]  fact, you'll turn around and leave. He had to leave for Devon's right there at the checkpoint.
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:27.240]  He was not allowed to drive in and he was told very sternly not to. And maybe your contacts
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:33.000]  up high in the military can give you insight into what this secret was. Yeah, I don't know what it
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:38.040]  was in their secret meetings all the time. And treating Americans like slaves scum is what the
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:42.840]  system does. And they just can't wait to turn the troops. See what they've done is they've got all
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:48.040]  these good troops and they give them questionnaires and they say, will you fire on Americans on
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:54.360]  average 76% say no, but they take that 24% that say yes, they promote them up into this whole
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:48:00.040]  police state and they've built this giant group of thugs and do whatever they're told. They want
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:04.920]  to turn loose on us. But I mean, Israel is openly saying they're getting ready to attack Iran.
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:10.120]  There's all sorts of crazy stuff going on all over the world. But you know, we're not omnipresent,
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:14.360]  sir. We don't even have the personnel to go through all the contacts we get. But you know,
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:18.200]  who knows what it was. Look, mainly the people in the government at that level
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:23.320]  are into the power trip of limousines and uniforms and acting tough and running around like secret
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:29.080]  agents. You know, who knows what the secret meeting was. You know, you might have had some
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:33.080]  MPs that caught them unloading cocaine or something. That's usually what it is. And then
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:37.000]  officials have to come in and tell them to stand down and give us the goods. That happens all the
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:45.560]  time. But who knows anything else there, Paul? Yes, I do. There's a set of railroad tracks near
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:51.400]  my house. And my wife had told me these railroad tracks hadn't been used since she was like, oh,
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:57.960]  in her 20s. And like, the weeds had grown over the tracks and everything. They hadn't been used.
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:02.920]  They had been blocked off. Well, a couple of months ago, I crossed the tracks. The cement
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:08.280]  blocks had been pulled away. These are like one ton blocks. They've been pulled away off the tracks.
[1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:13.960]  And then what I've noticed since then, all the overgrip on the tracks has been cut down.
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:19.720]  And they started to lay down new railroad ties, like for a higher speed trains,
[1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:23.640]  because the old ties have been there like 50 years probably. Yeah, no, some of the road,
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:27.320]  some of the rail beds are over 100 years old. So that's probably just regular repair going on.
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:33.960]  But the city knows nothing about it. We call it the city. And the city DPW knows nothing about it.
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:38.040]  Well, I mean, if that's a interstate rail line owned by a private railway, they wouldn't know.
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:43.320]  Okay, all right. But I wanted to let you know this, and we are trying to spread the word about
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:49.480]  info wars.com. Shirley and I. Well, God bless you, sir. Good to hear from you, Paul. Yeah,
[1:49:49.480 --> 1:49:54.440]  I mean, it may be something, but I mean, it's admitted during disasters, as they said, they're
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:50:01.960]  going to use trains. In fact, I got attacked by the Veterans Affairs Office. We posted a radio
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:09.960]  clip of one of the directors on a radio show saying I made up the story about mass graves,
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:14.120]  and that they're just getting ready for, you know, all the veterans that are dying each year,
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:20.280]  which I know is a huge number in the hundreds of thousands. The point is that veteran cemeteries
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:25.000]  all over the country in California and Texas and everywhere we've confirmed it.
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:30.840]  They're adding thousands and thousands and thousands of graves per site.
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:37.240]  And that is probably just a normal function. We just asked the question because a listener
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:41.320]  filed a video report and a photo report on it and asked people to look into it.
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:48.840]  Also, because these are new four person Crips that are buried side by side. And I knew that
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:53.640]  that didn't how they bury people in the past. They claim now it's, they've changed to safe space.
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:59.720]  But how would we not ask the question and investigate it and look into it when Kurt
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:03.960]  Nemo found the articles I mentioned from five years ago where Rocky Mountain News and other
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:08.360]  newspapers reported, oh, we've got mass incinerators ready for dead during a bio attack,
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:11.640]  and they're preparing mass graves and, you know, the governor's admitting it.
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:15.320]  So Kurt found a bunch of the mainstream news articles I mentioned.
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:20.200]  Does that have the memory to remember them? I just want the time to dig them all back up each day.
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:25.800]  And he put an article together going, well, you know, here they are saying that we're lying
[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:31.480]  about this when all we did was say, what is this? Is this part of all these other mass graves
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:37.400]  and the plastic coffin liners which the CDC paid for that didn't part of Veterans Affair?
[1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:41.800]  And now we found a huge depot of them in Alabama, bigger than what's in Georgia.
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:47.560]  So see, we're investigating all of this. That's what we do here. All right, folks,
[1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:52.200]  we'll be right back after this quick break with more of your phone calls towards time for coming
[1:51:52.200 --> 1:51:56.360]  up in about 40 minutes from now. I've got a ton of news and some key audio clips.
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:00.200]  Children aren't allowed to play dodgeball. We'll tell you what else you're not allowed to do when
[1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:05.480]  we come back. Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:09.720]  political problems facing the U.S. and the world. And for the first time in their lives,
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:13.960]  they are feeling the need for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous

[1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:09.880]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:15.960]  world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:21.080]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already
[1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:26.600]  fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:32.920]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:39.960]  finance all the bucks, that's fascist. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:47.160]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:38.600]  bringing me more news. I've got to somehow go through all this if I just read the headlines

[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.920]  I'm going to do a big news blitz and then George Humphrey is going to be in studio with us.

[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:22.920]  today, tomorrow, Burmese is sitting in tomorrow during the live show, got a lot of important

[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:48.520]  and 20,000 views there and 1,000 views here and 80,000 there. You know, it's well over 15 million
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:53.480]  now that I've been able to count up. But I want to get this particular version that's the highest
[1:56:53.480 --> 1:57:00.120]  quality over a million and it's right at a million views right now, the Obama deception.
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:05.880]  And it should be on the main page of Google and of YouTube, but it's not. It's also the number
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:10.440]  one on Google, but they pulled it out of the rankings trying to keep people from seeing it
[1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:14.680]  because, you know, when it's on the main page, everybody goes in and can see it who's who's
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:20.600]  mainstream. A lot of people use Google and YouTube front page as kind of their TV guide.
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:27.960]  So let's drive this to number one. This is a focused, documented, huge dose of truth,
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:35.480]  a giant red pill to wake people up. Red pill politics, red pill news, whatever you want to call it.

[1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:55.640]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient,
[1:59:55.640 --> 1:59:59.720]  and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent, and food and water
[1:59:59.720 --> 2:00:03.400]  is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:07.640]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family. In any
[2:00:07.640 --> 2:00:12.120]  emergency, if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation,
[2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:17.160]  but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:21.880]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of last
[2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:29.720]  year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633, or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit eFoodsDirect.com
[2:00:29.720 --> 2:00:33.960]  and look over the final list of high quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to

[2:00:48.040 --> 2:01:06.200]  horrible food. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother,
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:15.240]  mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:21.720]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:28.840]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. It is the third hour to our temporary studio in 30 minutes.
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:34.600]  I want to do a big news blitz, and your phone calls. Maureen, Chris, Robert, Redflex, and many
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:41.640]  others coming up. I have four giant stacks of news that I have only scratched the service on.
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:46.760]  Again, I want a news blitz on that first, when we come back from break, and then we'll still be
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:55.880]  continually open phones throughout the broadcast day today. It's unbelievable to go from going off
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:02:00.440]  government documents and bills and Senate hearings that no one would look at, no one would believe
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:04.120]  us, no one would check out all the facts we had, to now they're just, yeah, we're going to have
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:07.240]  one child policies everywhere, and yeah, we're going to have troops on the streets, and yeah,
[2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:10.680]  we're going to carbon tax everything you do, and yeah, we're going to get rid of the middle class,
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:16.040]  but it's for your own good, on and on and on and on, and yeah, we're going to force you to take
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:21.320]  vaccines, and yeah, we're building FEMA camps for your own good. I mean, it is all coming down on
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:26.600]  this, folks. Terranee always has a leg up because people can't believe it's happening to them, but
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:31.080]  if you look at history, you learn it's the norm, but we got a good chance of beating this if we
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:35.320]  fight back. That's what history shows. So for all of you out there who are fighting back, all of you
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:40.040]  spreading the Obama deception, to all of you standing up for liberty and freedom, this song is for you.
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:43.080]  Steve Voss and The Renegades.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:20.280]  Others couldn't stand for that. The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[2:03:22.200 --> 2:03:33.080]  Wise men followed him, but he rose again. Wise men followed him, thank God for the Renegades,
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:45.320]  and the lives they need for the hell's broader time. Without the Renegades,
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:04:05.560]  the Lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:15.480]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band declaring independence.
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:27.800]  They divided down on a bloody war and liberty for their descendants.
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:40.040]  Thanks to the Renegades, we're free today. Thanks to the Renegades, we're free today.
[2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:51.880]  Thank God for the Renegades, and the lives they need for the hell's broader time.
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:05:04.120]  Without the Renegades, the Lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:39.560]  We're from the Renegades, and the world today. Who are the Renegades, and the world today?
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:55.160]  Thank God for the Renegades, and the lives they need for the hell's broader time. Without the Renegades,
[2:05:55.160 --> 2:06:01.480]  the Lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[2:06:01.480 --> 2:06:07.160]  Ancient gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered a new bioactive
[2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:11.320]  superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs. It's called protogrow, and it's so effective at
[2:06:11.320 --> 2:06:15.480]  producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under
[2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:19.640]  practically any soil and like conditions. Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden
[2:06:19.640 --> 2:06:24.920]  for self-reliance. Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:29.640]  increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time. Protogrow works by providing
[2:06:29.640 --> 2:06:33.560]  geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake
[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:37.640]  in plants. Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:41.720]  taste, and up to 10 times the nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency
[2:06:41.720 --> 2:06:46.120]  of herbs or wheatgrass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids,
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:50.360]  it's now easy. GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-sheaf superfood should visit the protogrow
[2:06:50.360 --> 2:07:00.360]  website at growlikecrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:07.160]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:12.760]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:18.200]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:23.480]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:28.280]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:34.840]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:07:34.840 --> 2:07:41.320]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:49.080]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy
[2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:55.000]  of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high quality at Prison

[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:07.720]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:18.360]  We are live at prisonplanet.tv,
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:25.640]  somalcasting with the syndicated radio. Friends, mission. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:30.760]  George Hopper is coming up in about 22 minutes in studio. We're also going to be taking your phone
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:35.560]  calls continually throughout the hour and 50 minutes that we have left to cover.
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:40.920]  Over. Obama is giving his big new world order globalist speech before the G20 right now,
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:52.120]  openly setting up, according to the CNN, a new world order crisis leading to new world order
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:58.280]  is the headline. Here is the New York Times, a new world order, a world in need of a new order.
[2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:02.680]  Again, they create the crisis. They offer the solution. The Times of London reports that G20
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:08.280]  Summit Europeans demand threatens to wreck deals. They're acting like there's a fight going on here.
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:12.920]  They demand that the global government have strong controls and global taxation
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:17.480]  systems so no one can escape high taxes, regulation, control of banking, businesses,
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:22.120]  everything. And we've got a clip I'm going to play later and get economist George Humphrey's
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:28.600]  take on it where we have Tim Geithner, who doesn't pay us taxes as the head of the treasury,
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:36.200]  telling CBS News that, oh, yeah, we're going to go after other corporations and companies,
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:40.680]  not just the head of GM. So, I mean, if that isn't tyranny, I don't know what it is where they say,
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:46.520]  you do what the government says or will order you to step down. No judge, no jury, no grand jury,
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:53.320]  no court order. Just the president says so. That's dictatorship. So you let the foreign banks take
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:57.320]  over your industry. You hand everything over. This is what the IMF and World Bank do in third
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:01.480]  world countries they're in control of. And just a really huge story that came out yesterday,
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:07.960]  Washington Post, Senate legislation would federalize cybersecurity. Everything's being seized.
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:14.040]  Rules for private networks also proposed. Now, this bill's been out for a few weeks. This is why
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:20.440]  the head of cybersecurity resigned three weeks ago. This was the head of the program for the
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:25.320]  federal government. So this is a Pentagon takeover of all private industry involved with computers
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:29.800]  with how computers are built, the back doors in them, how everything operates.
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:33.400]  He said a threat to democracy. You mean a threat to the free republic.
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:39.160]  Senate legislation would federalize cybersecurity. Now, this also brings in federal funds just like
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:43.960]  they did with the 96 telecommunications act to put NSA snooping floors, whole floors,
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:48.200]  in all major telecommunications companies. So the internet all runs through them already.
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:53.160]  This is so they have back doors into all the hubs to shut the web down. And that's what the Pentagon
[2:11:53.160 --> 2:11:58.440]  admits they're drilling for. And what they're going to do is say China did it, shut down the web,
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:02.840]  then relaunched his internet too with total controls. And you watch, that's a big false flag
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:07.160]  terror attack, a financial and free speech attack. They're planning to launch. And I've done the
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:14.360]  analysis on that. Here's UPI. US cybersecurity had quit citing growing role of spy agencies for
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:19.320]  those watching on the internet. I apologize. My printer ink was running out when I printed this
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:24.440]  one. So it's, it's hard to read there on screen. If that guy's just pull this up, just Google
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:28.440]  US cybersecurity chief quit. So we'll just punch that up from the web itself.
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:32.120]  That's United Press International. You'll get AP Reuters too when you do that.
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:37.480]  And we're trying to get him on the show, but so people say, Oh, we don't see any whistleblowers
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:43.160]  on this takeover. Like you say, Alex, that's all we see. Fox Fallon refused to attack Iran
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:47.400]  and refused to let Dick Cheney have Navy SEALs attack their ships acting like Iran did it.
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:54.120]  Source MSNBC, New Yorker magazine and Fox Fallon, Fallon, the head of CENTCOM quit.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:59.720]  We'd already be in World War three folks. It is the whistleblowers. We've had NSA whistleblowers
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:04.760]  come out and say, they listen to Americans having phone sex and sit around the NSA laughing. And now
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:11.960]  over 70% of phone internet security has been handed out to private security firms owned and run by
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:16.760]  people like felon, Admiral Poindexter, the total information awareness network. So most of it's
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:22.280]  being done by private groups now. It says the official in charge of coordinating U.S. government
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:26.440]  cyber security operations has quit saying expanding control of the national security
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:30.840]  agency over the nation's computer security poses threats to our democratic process.
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:35.800]  Even from a security standpoint, Rob Brextram, the head of the Department of Homeland Security's
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:41.240]  National Cyber Security Center, told Nonopress International, it is unwise to hand over security
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:45.240]  of all government networks to a single organization. Well, yeah, it's dictatorship.
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:48.920]  But then it goes on with the new bill and he talks about the private takeover,
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:55.000]  total takeover of everything. They've announced Senator Rockefeller, J. Rockefeller went on
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  TV last week and said, if we'd be better off without the web, we've got to get rid of it.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:02.360]  New York Times says, we've got to get rid of the old internet, have internet too,
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:06.520]  where you have a subdomain on somebody else's government site or private industry.
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:10.840]  50 corporations get it, 50 universities and 50 agencies. That's internet too. And then you'll
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:15.640]  have 150 domains for each nation. You'll have a sub-account and they'll have rules and say you
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:22.120]  can't post. This is openly publicly stated. This is internet too and they're going to end
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:29.240]  that neutrality, start taxing the web. It's already happening. This is it. Stated. And here's the bill.
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:33.720]  Senate legislation with federalized cyber security. It says over private industry.
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:36.920]  I mean, you can go read it for yourself. They just tell you how great it is though.
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:39.560]  People say, well, why do you use mainstream news? Well, a lot of times they tell the
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:43.640]  truth. They just spin it. They're admitting what they're doing here. They just say it's a good idea
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:48.760]  to keep it safe from China. So you understand, folks, they're openly saying they want to shut
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:52.760]  down the web. How terrible it is. The newspapers are imploding. The establishment's losing all
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:57.560]  credibility. They have to shut it down. And believe me, when they set off a nuke or release
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:02.360]  smallpox or whatever these jackasses are planning, you better believe that they're going after the
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:09.880]  web first and are going to claim that China or Russia did it. Meanwhile, clear evidence that the
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:14.680]  computer cables to Russia and the Middle East in places keep getting cut by deep submersibles
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:20.200]  and only Russia, England, France and a few other countries have. So they're busy trying to chop
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:26.680]  those as well. Here's the Geithner on ousting CEOs reviving economy. We're going to get into that.
[2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:38.920]  But here is an important story. Deep solar minimum and says the sunspot cycle 1995 to present.
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:44.760]  And if you go up to NASA's website, for some reason, our one on info wars.com, we posted
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:48.200]  this but links to the wrong thing. It links to a Bilderberg story. So we need to get that fixed.
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:16:01.000]  A deep solar minimum. Now you can see the 12 year sun cycle and the highest sun cycle on record
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:06.920]  was right here. You can click on it and look at the graph going back for over 60 years with
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:13.720]  scientific, very high tech scientific instruments. Now this is in 2000, 2001, the super peak,
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:24.520]  global warming throughout the solar system. And then over here, you can see where we currently
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:31.000]  are down there in the dip 2009. And if you see that, there is almost no solar activity. Look
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:39.480]  at the last dip in the cycle in 1997. Look how much higher sun activity was at the last low
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:44.360]  point. I mean, this is a record low point. The sun is putting off no solar flares right now.
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:51.400]  They appear as sunspots that they could hide giant Coriolis ejections hundreds of times the size of
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:57.160]  the planet Earth that shoot out. They disrupt satellites, all sorts of things. There you have
[2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:02.360]  it. Now, when is it set to peak again 2012? Isn't that interesting? Everything's 2012.
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:07.000]  I don't put much stock in that, but a lot of folks do. Look at that. That's from NASA.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  And they've got a bunch of other graphs in here showing what's happening with that on that front.
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:24.280]  You know, I mentioned this yesterday, but it really needs to be covered again.
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:30.760]  And that is a Bloomberg article that was everywhere else. Three days before we posted
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:34.920]  a George Washington blog spot story, the guy does great research, great analysis.
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:40.920]  And he showed the Congressional Budget Office's own numbers that the current
[2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:46.040]  spending was approaching the size of the gross domestic product of the United States.
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:53.000]  Just the bailout. He gave a number of 11 trillion. And two days later, it came out. Oh,
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:18:01.240]  no, the government admits it's worse than that. It's $12.8 trillion, $200 billion short of the
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:05.000]  entire GDP of the country. But I noticed the comments of the trolls under it were,
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:10.040]  that's a lie. He's making this up. It's not that big. And then now it's all admitted.
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:18.600]  Just, just denial, denial, denial, denial. I had that story here in my stack. That doesn't
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:25.240]  matter. I covered it yesterday. It's just there is so much, so much going on. We posted a story
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:35.080]  yesterday. John Yoo arrested. And we documented the fact that they had not arrested him, but that
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:43.560]  was a rumor. But what is not a rumor is that he has been indicted along with 11 others in Spain
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:48.360]  for war crimes and crimes against humanity for writing memos ordering the torture of children.
[2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:53.160]  So I thought I would let you know that that's where that rumor came from. And we tried to
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:19:00.120]  whack a mole and try to stop that rumor. But of course we're not that influential. So who knows
[2:19:00.120 --> 2:19:07.000]  what will happen with that? Another White House would be official is in trouble for not paying
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:15.960]  back taxes. Sebelinus, if I'm pronouncing it right, held the human secretary nominee Kathleen
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:21.880]  Sebelus recently corrected three years of tax returns and paid more than 7,000 back after
[2:19:21.880 --> 2:19:27.080]  finding unintentional errors. Now, see, that's nothing compared to all the other ones in the
[2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:32.360]  administration where it's hundreds of thousands of dollars free limos, not paying taxes period
[2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:39.160]  like Geithner and saying he didn't have to and then fighting it. Another story here out of
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:45.080]  the Associated Press promises, promises, Obama's tax pledge goes up in smoke. And it talks about
[2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:50.840]  how he promised no new taxes of any type except if you made over $125,000 a year. Every time I
[2:19:50.840 --> 2:19:59.000]  say that, I get emails. They go, it's $250,000 with a couple. That's $125,000. Anybody making that
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:03.640]  or more? And that's your lower middle class, folks, in the real scale of things. And that's
[2:20:03.640 --> 2:20:07.000]  who actually buys things from you locally. And that's your real economy. But don't worry,
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:09.800]  the elite will get rid of that for you and see how you're doing out there poor.
[2:20:10.680 --> 2:20:15.880]  One of President Barack Obama's campaign pledges on taxes went up in puffs of smoke Wednesday.
[2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:19.560]  The largest increase in tobacco taxes took effect despite Obama's promise not to raise
[2:20:19.560 --> 2:20:24.680]  sales taxes on any kind of families earning under $250,000 or individual under $200,000.
[2:20:24.680 --> 2:20:29.480]  This is the one tax that disproportionately affects the poor. And it goes on. It's called,
[2:20:29.480 --> 2:20:34.280]  well, that's okay. Broke his promise on cigarettes. No, they're raising all these different taxes
[2:20:34.280 --> 2:20:40.040]  and they're getting rid of the loopholes as they call them. That's really just tax write-offs for
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:45.480]  your house or for your mortgage deduction or education. They're saying they're getting hundreds
[2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:52.440]  of deductions. So, and that's on everybody just massive, massive tax increases on everybody.
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:59.400]  And it all goes not to the nation, but to foreign bankers. Your call straight ahead, more news
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:05.800]  straight ahead. This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:10.760]  and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these troubled times.
[2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:15.080]  One of the most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors
[2:21:15.080 --> 2:21:21.080]  to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins and heavy metals. It's a documented fact. 80%
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:27.080]  of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic
[2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:32.760]  infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and
[2:21:32.760 --> 2:21:39.000]  safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage

[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:07.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:13.160]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:19.800]  just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[2:23:19.800 --> 2:23:29.080]  best interests of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:23:29.080 --> 2:23:35.560]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[2:23:35.560 --> 2:23:41.400]  oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.

[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:14.120]  Coming up, when Torx Humphrey gets here in studio, I'm gonna break down the latest G20 news. I got
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:19.960]  a big stack of it here. They have agreed on the regulatory changes to the world system,
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:25.320]  a new global regulator over all the nations in the words of Time Magazine and an article titled
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:30.840]  The New World Order to knock the heads of the American people to punish us. Taxes will be
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:38.280]  paid directly to them and they've wanted a $500 billion deal. Well, that's not enough. It is a
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:45.320]  trillion and a half dollars of tax money to be given from the American people, the people of
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:50.360]  Europe, to the private banks to set up their new global super currency. That's Reuters.
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:57.240]  I've also got MSNBC right here. I mean, it's all happening, ladies and gentlemen. It's all
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:04.120]  happening in our face. Let's go ahead and talk to Marine in Virginia. You're on the air.
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:10.600]  Hey, how are you? I've got something. First of all, thank you for everything you do. Now,
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:19.240]  so much that is said absolutely sounds scary. We need to remember we serve the most high God.
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:25.560]  These other idiots are serving Satan. He only took one-third of the angels with him. It's
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:31.880]  gonna be a two against one fight. Go read chapters one, two, and three of Hebrews and just see
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:38.920]  we are told that they are all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation.
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:48.600]  That is us. I put a website up citiesforrefuge.info and God has shown us that He is setting up
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:55.720]  cities of refuge and I know so many people have been called to different places to set up places
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:27:02.680]  for other people to go to when things get bad. Well, I mean, I agree that this is a fight against
[2:27:02.680 --> 2:27:07.480]  good and evil and we need to ask God for His guidance and help. My problem is most the Christian
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:11.240]  churches and other religions have been bought off by the government, by the World Council of
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:15.080]  Churches, by the UN, and they're telling people, stand down, go to the FEMA camps. You know,
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:20.440]  the tyranny is good and that we're Romans 13 out of context. Hitler's favorite Bible passage.
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:27.080]  So, you know, the solution is in the church, but it's also the problem is the phony church.
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:30.120]  I appreciate your call. Chris in Florida. Chris, you're on the air.
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:36.680]  Yeah, go on YouTube and to just see a parody of the Queen. You'll really enjoy the
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:44.120]  myth from modern day minstrels called basements of jacks, J-A-X-X, called you don't know me,
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:49.320]  letters you don't know me. And it's funny how the Queen goes around abusing her own servants
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:56.920]  in the public after she goes on the run. But there's a quote, it's my little tribute to liberals
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:28:04.440]  to have it come out on 666, end quote. She's quoted that saying in USA Today. And she's
[2:28:04.440 --> 2:28:11.400]  talking about her book, which I'm sure was full of very pressing matters and culture,
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:15.960]  the quick change agent you're talking about recently wrote a book entitled Godless,
[2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:26.280]  The Church of Liberalism, released on 666, 2006. And so I also wanted to ask you regarding
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:33.240]  Obama, were you aware that he also, one of his broken promises was that his $3,000
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:40.280]  tax cut that he promised to businesses if they were to hire any new employees. And it's not
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:46.200]  in the stimulus bill. And other indicators that show that his acts that he is on the side of
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:52.360]  the bankers suggesting that the 401k and the IRA participation should be mandatory if your
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:59.080]  employer offers it. And it's kind of like Bush Jr. idea, Jr.'s idea of investing the social
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:03.880]  money. Yeah, make you give your money to a 401k that's given to the derivatives bankers
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:09.320]  to basically steal it. I appreciate your call. Speaking of bizarreness, this is up on infowars.com,
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:13.880]  Kurt Nimot had a story about it. Now, but it's mainstream news that he links to Queen Elizabeth's
[2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:20.920]  gift to Calderon, the president of Mexico. Guess what he gave her? George R. Wells in 1984.
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:25.000]  And people think, oh, she's exposing the police state. No, they're the ones putting in the cameras
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:31.480]  and the control grids and that are doing all of this. And so that's why Hillary says her favorite
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:41.080]  book is 1984. For them, it is a blueprint of control. For them, it is a way to control society
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:46.760]  and to limit the language and to pass all these hate speech laws and to train the children to
[2:29:46.760 --> 2:29:52.360]  be spies on their parents. Felipe Calderon gave the, oh, he gave the Queen of England a
[2:29:54.360 --> 2:30:00.040]  marquee tray, but the Queen gave Calderon a collector's edition of George R. Wells dystopian
[2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:05.640]  novel 1984. Calderon received the book as he bowed and scraped at Buckingham Palace. On its face,
[2:30:05.640 --> 2:30:10.680]  the gift presented to Calderon seems rather strange. But when you think about it, not really,
[2:30:10.680 --> 2:30:16.360]  it's a novel. Oceania has a strict social class arrangement with the inner party at the top,
[2:30:16.360 --> 2:30:20.520]  2% of the population representing the big brother, the outer party of bureaucrats in the middle and
[2:30:20.520 --> 2:30:25.400]  the large number of proles at the bottom. The inner party believes that the proles are inferior
[2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:30.920]  and expendable and strives to make certain they live in misery. Not unlike the average Mexican
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:35.240]  who lives under the grinding poverty while a small predatory and parasitical class
[2:30:35.240 --> 2:30:39.560]  represented by Calderon steals the country's wealth. And the article goes on, great writer,

[2:32:12.280 --> 2:32:18.120]  all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:23.480]  for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:28.920]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:32:28.920 --> 2:32:37.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:43.800]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works

[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:05.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:21.400]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:25.960]  Well, I've got George Humphrey, my good friend in studio with us. He is an economist, a very
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:31.400]  successful businessman, author, lecturer, filmmaker, and former Austin City Councilman.
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:36.200]  And back when I was first waking up in like 1994-95, I was involved in politics a little bit
[2:34:36.200 --> 2:34:38.680]  in Austin. I would run into George Humphrey and he was talking about the New World Order and all
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:42.760]  this stuff and I'd read some books about it. So he was instrumental in a lot of my formation
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:47.800]  of my ideas as well. And here we are 14 years, well that'd be 16 years later, but you know here
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:52.840]  we are 14 years after I got on air and he's got his own local TV show he does from time to time,
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:56.840]  very busy man, George Humphrey. And today we're going to leave and go do more interviews with
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:02.120]  him for the second Obama film. I haven't decided on the name yet. I'm very close because Obama
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:07.400]  Deception has been so successful and so up to date. It's actually worse than we thought with the
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:11.000]  they've introduced another bill for compulsory service. So I'm going to go down the list
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:14.760]  with you, George, just on issue after issue. In the next hour we're going to open the phones up
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:19.000]  for all of your calls, but George you were ranting during the break, raving, and I appreciate the
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:23.560]  rave reviews. You're in the Obama Deception, but you're in a few of my other films and
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:26.680]  you said they were good, but I didn't get this excited. So you're not just saying it's good
[2:35:26.680 --> 2:35:30.600]  because you're in it. Break down the film like you were breaking down for me during the break.
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:36.040]  Well, Alex, I don't rant that much, but I'll tell you what, we had a bunch of people over at my
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:43.160]  house last night and to a person, everybody was totally, totally impressed. And I had been in
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:48.120]  some of your other films and your other films have been excellent and positive and good information.
[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:56.280]  And in my opinion, the presentation, the professionalism on this, the people who were the guests,
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:36:05.080]  Salente, KRS, unbelievable. And if you have not downloaded this, or more importantly,
[2:36:05.720 --> 2:36:11.640]  buy some copies from Alex, because as you buy the copies from Alex, then he can do more stuff.
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:18.680]  And this is the, this is a big deal, friends. And it's hard to be objective about a film that
[2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:26.280]  you, that I'm in, and I'm in it for maybe six or seven minutes. And it was my total complete honor
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:35.720]  to be of service to this film. And what we are facing right now is so, so much bigger and coming
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:44.680]  at us so much faster than 98% of the patriots in this country have any idea about. And I am just
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:51.160]  so pleased that I have been of help and that you have been a good friend of mine for so long.
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:59.080]  And I'll tell you what, the game's on, friends. The game is on. It's not, it's not about 10 years
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:06.840]  from now. It's not about 2012. It's about right now. And the choice is whether you're going to go down
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:11.560]  the path of the New World Order, whether you're going to go down the path of fear, whether you're
[2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:17.640]  going to go down the path of materialism, or whether you're going to make the choice and realize
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:23.960]  that you and every single one of you, black, white, Hispanic, Oriental, is that we're all part of
[2:37:23.960 --> 2:37:31.000]  God's creation and that we can all make things better. And if, and if we see this thing with clear
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:40.200]  eyes and a full heart, then we can have some, then we can have some love in our hearts and realize
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:46.520]  that we don't have to go to this materialistic gulag that is being prepared for us. And I'll
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:53.160]  tell you what, our opponents right now, people like Obama, and remember Obama is only a puppet.
[2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:58.120]  He is a puppet. It's not about Obama. It's about something much bigger, just like it wasn't about
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:06.120]  George Bush, because it's about something much, much bigger. And, and it is so good to be in body
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:13.480]  right now. It is so wonderful to have this freedom to be able to speak about this issue.
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:19.640]  And there is no greater time to be alive and speak about freedom, to speak about love, to speak
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:25.640]  about God, to speak about the Republic. I love this country and I'll tell you what, I know that
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:30.440]  if you're listening to this, you do too. So listen to what Alex has to say and we're going to give
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:34.680]  you a whole, whole bunch of information today. Yeah, I've got a lot of questions for you. We're
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:38.600]  also taping for the film, the new Obama film while you're in studio with us right now,
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:42.680]  that, you know, there's a whole host of things going on. I've been looking around for it. I
[2:38:42.680 --> 2:38:47.640]  covered it yesterday and then I saw it back in my stack. Well, you guys in there, Google,
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:57.080]  Bloomberg, $12.8 trillion. And it is a Bloomberg article about how the real number now is $12.8
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:39:01.880]  trillion approaching the gross domestic product of the nation since you're an economist and a,
[2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:07.080]  and a successful one at that. I want to get your breakdown of what's happening. But first,
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:09.800]  they have announced that it's going to be a trillion and a half bucks to the bankers,
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:16.200]  but that's really the sideshow. As Dick Morris said on Fox News on Monday night,
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:19.800]  shockingly, he said, Oh, the new order is real. The conspiracy theorists were right.
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:22.920]  They said they put global government where banks will rule the United States and the rest of the
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:27.560]  planet. And that they're talking about the money on one level, but they just issue that the real
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:32.120]  issue is the regulatory power, this quote, bank of the world that will rule everything. Can you
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:39.080]  in your own words speak to all of that? And why suddenly we're seeing mainstream news have to
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:45.720]  admit we were right about all this? Well, clearly money has always been the strings of the puppeteers
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:52.760]  on the slaves. And the people, whether we call them the Illuminati, the black hats, the oligarchy,
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:57.640]  the plutocracy, the rascals, whatever we want to call these people are living in separation
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:05.880]  consciousness. They have used fiat currency to as a manipulation. It's not money that they're
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:13.320]  after. It's what they're after is power, cold, ruthless, total power. And they've been planning
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:21.640]  this for a long, long time, incrementally, since the days of Weishoff. And now they're in their
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:29.400]  final chapter. And the amount of money that you are talking about, and that is truly out there,
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:34.920]  most Americans think that this bailout, if they pay any attention, is three, maybe four trillion
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:39.800]  dollars. They don't have any idea what that most people don't know what that really means. And
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:46.840]  three or four trillion dollars is an amount that staggers the mind, staggers the mind.
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:56.760]  But however, the reality is, is that the Federal Reserve, with no accounting, with no supervision,
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:41:03.400]  is putting out another eight and a half to 10 trillion dollars so far, they are not informing
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:08.760]  Congress or the people of this country where that money is going. And so the real number that is
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:15.560]  part of this, quote, bailout. And let's just get straight. This is not a bailout. This is financial
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:24.760]  terrorism. This is not a bailout. This is financial terrorism. And because Adam Weishoff,
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:33.080]  when they started the Illuminati, their motto was, out of chaos is order. Out of chaos is an order.
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:38.600]  And when they went into the, create the French Revolution, they created this chaos, the murders
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:43.240]  blood was running in the street. They destroyed the economy so that they could get power.
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:50.920]  And they're doing the exact same thing here in the United States. This wonderful, wonderful nation
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:57.960]  is being destroyed. It is destroyed, I shouldn't say is being, it is destroyed economically by the
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:06.520]  Federal Reserve, by the Treasury, and by these absolute rascals that are, that are creating the
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:12.840]  greatest and the most significant transfer of wealth in the history, not just of our country,
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:19.320]  but in all of Occidental history. The middle class, the productive peoples of this country,
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:29.880]  black, white, Hispanic, Oriental, Christian, Jewish, the whole group, we're all being robbed as we
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:39.240]  speak. You cannot create wealth by creating more debt. You cannot create wealth by robbing and
[2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:47.320]  hindering the people who create the wealth. The state cannot, by definition, cannot create wealth.
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:57.480]  And the amazing thing is, is that 98% of this bailout money is going to financial institutions.
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:06.840]  Where, or where, or where is it in the Constitution of the United States that the taxpayers of the
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:15.720]  United States should bail out corrupt, failing, and wrong financial institutions? The very
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:25.240]  institutions that created and profited by this, starting in 1998 with this ending of the Glass-Siegel
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:31.640]  Act, and they took not millions, not billions, but trillions and trillions of dollars from the
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:38.440]  people, from the economy, between 98 and now, and these very same people who plan this, who,
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:44.920]  who participated in this, are now getting the bailouts from the people of this country.
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:51.320]  That means you and me, your family, and your friends. And that can only mean one thing,
[2:43:51.320 --> 2:44:00.440]  one thing. Extremely high taxes coming at us, more government interference, and eventually
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:07.000]  mass inflation. Now we're going to be in a significant debt deflationary period for a
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:13.560]  longer period of time than most people think. This bailout doesn't even come close. Let me repeat,
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:20.680]  this bailout doesn't even come close to sopping up these toxic derivatives. You know, and nobody
[2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:27.400]  really knows the exact number of the toxic derivatives out there, whether it's 300 trillion,
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:32.600]  whether it's 500 trillion, or whether it's eight or 900 trillion dollars. It really doesn't make
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:40.760]  any difference, because the problem cannot be fixed. This bailout money doesn't even pay the
[2:44:40.760 --> 2:44:49.080]  interest on these toxic derivatives. Friends, the game's all over. Using the, the, the rules of the
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:55.720]  Federal Reserve, Fractional Reserve Banking, fiat currency. The game was fixed many, many,
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:45:02.680]  many, many years ago. But now we're at the end game. And most people don't even realize what fiat
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:08.840]  currency is. They don't understand what Fraction Reserve Banking is. And most, many Americans,
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:14.760]  I'm sure that most people who are listening to this, realize their founding fathers knew very,
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:20.920]  very clearly that to have a free nation is that we had to have our banking system controlled by
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:29.720]  the people, that we had to have a hard currency so that money had value, money had value. But the
[2:45:29.720 --> 2:45:38.600]  large bankers came in and they created Fraction Reserve Bank, they created Fraction Banking and
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:43.880]  fiat currency. And since the beginning of this country, as I'm sure you've heard over and over
[2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:48.840]  again, has been the battle between the people and the populace who want to help the people of
[2:45:48.840 --> 2:45:55.640]  this country through a hard currency, through a, through true money that has value, as opposed to
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:46:03.480]  the oligarchy, the small handful of people who control the strings and who make money a commodity.
[2:46:04.120 --> 2:46:11.880]  It doesn't take a PhD or even a master's or even a degree in economics to figure this out. If you
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:18.600]  just take a few minutes, they are creating money out of thin air and then multiplying it and multiplying
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:25.880]  it and multiplying it. And then they are able to take your collateral, your business, your home,
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:31.480]  your auto, take it as collateral and then you have to pay interest to them. It is the biggest
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:38.360]  Ponzi scheme in the history of this world. And because it is unsustainable, we are at the end
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:45.320]  game right now. And Brother Obama and all of his buddies like Geithner and the others are just
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:55.880]  cutting the necks of all the good people, Democrats, Republicans, independence, rich, poor,
[2:46:55.880 --> 2:47:02.680]  everybody. And friends, this is what Alex and what other people have been sharing with you for the
[2:47:02.680 --> 2:47:09.560]  last 15 years. And the time is right now. And we can either see it with fear or we can see
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:17.320]  it as a time of change, as a time of shifting. And if we organize, if we organize, we can turn
[2:47:17.320 --> 2:47:23.480]  this thing around. Well, that's very well said, George Humphrey Economist here visiting with us
[2:47:23.480 --> 2:47:28.520]  today. I've got a whole list of questions I want to go through. We can do this on air part of it
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:32.520]  and then in an off air later for the film I'm making. And they're going to be a big part of,
[2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:38.200]  it'll be a lot more than the six or seven minutes you're in the previous film, because this one's
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:47.240]  going to be, you know, a lot more of you and Tarpley in it. Specifically, for people that don't
[2:47:47.240 --> 2:47:51.080]  understand fractional reserve banking, they know it's fiat, they know it's made out of nothing.
[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:55.960]  But when we hear that, when the public hears that trillions of dollars are being given to
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:00.200]  central banks, or that central banks are giving trillions of dollars to private banks, those
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:06.760]  private banks are the public component of the very same private bank, the Federal Reserve. It's
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:13.000]  a consortium or a combine. So they take our tax money to give their fiat value, they pay it to
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:18.600]  themselves, and to pay them our tax money, we then have to pay interest. So we're not just paying
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:23.320]  in the money we give them for nothing. Then we have to pay interest for the pleasure of giving
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:29.640]  them the money. I mean, this is a Ponzi scheme of all Ponzi schemes to the power of infinity.
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:35.720]  It's absolutely amazing. And it's happening right out in front of us, and it's, you know,
[2:48:35.720 --> 2:48:42.680]  and they realize that they can do this because as Adolf Hitler said, the bigger the lie, the easier
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:52.120]  it is to pull it off. And this is right in front of us. The Federal Reserve Board has the treasury,
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:59.960]  orders the treasury to print up quote money. And the treasury takes paper and ink and prints this
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:07.080]  stuff up. And then the Fed pays the treasury about two and a half or three cents on the dollar.
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:14.440]  And then they lend it to the Federal Reserve regional banks, and then they lend it to the
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:18.040]  other banks. And now they're not even doing that because they're starting to monetize the debt,
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:22.920]  which we'll go into in a little bit. But these banks get money from the Fed,
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:31.960]  and then they can lend it out at a 10 to one level. So let's say that they get 10 billion
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:40.280]  dollars so that they then can lend out 100 or 90 million dollars, billion dollars. And then when
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:44.520]  they get that some of that money, start over on that, start over on that. Okay. So let's say
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:53.080]  that a bank gets 100 billion dollars from the Federal Reserve. And then they start lending
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:59.560]  that out at a nine to one level. So it's 900 billion dollars that they can lend out that's on
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:04.440]  their books. But then they get the money back and they put that in their quote reserves,
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:12.840]  and then they can lend that out again. So their book value is not 100 billion. It's not 900 billion.
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:22.600]  It's 72 times the original amount that they have in. And this all starts with nothing, paper and ink.
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:30.840]  And then they get the interest from the industries, from the small businesses,
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:37.000]  from the auto dealers, from, from the people cutting lawns, from you and me that comes back.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:44.280]  And it is money out of thin air. And the multiplication factors on this
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:53.080]  are so monstrous. And, and, and the multiplication factors used to be much smaller. It was still
[2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:59.800]  wrong then, but then they upped it and upped it and upped it and upped it. And now for every
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:07.800]  dollar that comes into a private bank, they can multiply if they, if they do their work properly
[2:51:07.800 --> 2:51:16.440]  by 72 times. This is true insanity, considering that there is nothing there to begin with.
[2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:20.600]  And that's where derivatives come in. They need to keep pumping the bubble so they can
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:25.160]  skim the money off the top and buy real assets. And when it finally implodes, they leave us with
[2:51:25.160 --> 2:51:30.440]  the black hole of debt. They run off with real, with all the real assets and say, we'll save you,
[2:51:30.440 --> 2:51:34.840]  we'll bring in a complete world tyranny and regulate every facet of your life and give you
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:42.280]  hundreds of new carbon taxes on everything you do. This is how we're going to fix everything.
[2:51:42.280 --> 2:51:46.600]  I mean, just amazing. So let's, let's talk about where this is going, what this is going to do,
[2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:50.760]  how this is going to end. When we get back with George Humphrey economist, author, lecturer,
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:55.160]  former Austin City Council member, the most important, my good buddy coming up, he's in the current
[2:51:55.160 --> 2:52:01.160]  Obama deception, but he's also going to be in the new Obama film that's out July 4th. Stay with us.

[2:53:01.720 --> 2:53:07.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:53:07.720 --> 2:53:14.040]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as
[2:53:14.040 --> 2:53:20.040]  well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:25.320]  interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in
[2:53:25.320 --> 2:53:30.440]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:53:30.440 --> 2:53:36.360]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:41.960]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film

[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:29.320]  a million questions for you, George. So we were getting up to the point of explaining,
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:33.800]  and I know most of the audience knows this, but your neighbors, your friends, your family,
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:37.480]  they just think the banker screwed up and boy, we've got to give them all this money and it's
[2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:41.880]  financial terrorism. They say, give us all this power or everything's going to end, everything's
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:46.680]  going to fall apart. When they're all rubbing their hands together, laughing, giggling, writing
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:50.360]  white papers, how they engineered it, laughing at how they're going to destroy the middle class.
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:53.960]  I mean, this is, this is how we knew all this was going to happen because these guys all bragged
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:57.800]  about it and we'd say, look at this book, look at this document, they wrote it. They're going to
[2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:04.600]  do this. George wrote books about this 12 years ago and now it's all here and he said the derivatives,
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:10.360]  the derivatives. I mean, I remember listening to books on tape you made in 1998, driving around
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:16.600]  in my car and hearing you talk about derivatives, derivatives, and you're an economist, so they
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:22.120]  knew they were setting this up. So let's go back to George's breakdown, how this fiat system works
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:26.680]  and how it's going to end, what they want to set up through making us dependent.
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:34.040]  Well, the fiat system is a system of theft and it's been around for a long, long time and that's
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:43.640]  why in the Bible is that there are 17 references not against usury. But the reality is, is that
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:51.960]  the central bankers realize that by using fiat currency is that they can create so-called money
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:58.920]  out of nothing. They can create so-called money out of nothing and if they can convince the people
[2:56:58.920 --> 2:57:05.640]  that they have something of value, which they have done and a fiat is, is simply means the
[2:57:05.640 --> 2:57:12.680]  declaration of the king or the president and so that's why we call it fiat currency. And so what
[2:57:12.680 --> 2:57:19.000]  was done is that in 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Banking Act, is the Federal
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:24.200]  Reserve was created. And of course, all of you, I'm sure, are aware the Federal Reserve is not
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:30.360]  federal, there's no reserves and it is owned by European bankers for the most part. It's never
[2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:36.280]  been accounted, there's the GIO has never been able to come in and take a look at it. And what they
[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:44.280]  do is that they, and according to Greenspan, they are a completely independent agency that is above
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:50.120]  the law of the United States. And Greenspan just said this last week on television, it's just truly
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:57.480]  amazing. And so what they do is that they order the treasury to print up money. Now money for them
[2:57:57.480 --> 2:58:04.920]  is just basically paper and ink. Then they take this so-called money and lend it to the Federal
[2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:11.800]  Reserve regional banks in Dallas and New York and San Francisco and Denver and around the country.
[2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:18.520]  And then they lend that money to the quote private banks, which at this time are becoming
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:26.760]  nationalized very, very quickly. And so when they lend this money to the private banks,
[2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:34.920]  is that they get a certain interest back, but then the private banks can put that
[2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:42.200]  on their books and let's say that they borrow a billion dollars, they can lend out 10 billion
[2:58:42.200 --> 2:58:50.280]  dollars. And then as the people start paying that money back, and let's say they pay that money back,
[2:58:50.280 --> 2:58:58.440]  then they can lend that out again at another percentage. And so after a period of time,
[2:58:58.440 --> 2:59:05.160]  the bank that has borrowed one billion dollars, which is out of thin air in the first place,
[2:59:05.160 --> 2:59:13.800]  which is basically paper and ink, has assets on their books of 72 times. So a bank that has
[2:59:13.800 --> 2:59:21.640]  borrowed one million dollars after let's say a year and a half or two years has up to 70 billion
[2:59:21.640 --> 2:59:29.080]  dollars on their books. Now clearly there's nothing there as far as real value. However,
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:36.600]  for all the many, many thousands of people that they have lent the money to, they have to pay back
[2:59:36.600 --> 2:59:43.960]  the principal plus the interest. All right, stay there back in 70 seconds. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[3:00:04.280 --> 3:00:16.360]  All right, George Humphrey is our guest. Your calls are coming up at about the 20 after.
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:21.720]  I got a lot of questions. I want to go over with the George. So it's all fiat currency,
[3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:25.800]  about one and a half percent of all the fiat money they've got out there in zeros and ones and
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:32.440]  computers is physical paper money. You've got people then who lose their houses, their cars,
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:37.320]  their wives for just made up fiat. But it's a contract they've signed. So it's through contract
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:43.400]  fraud. So this is a institutional fraud. This is an institutional fraud that makes made off. It was
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:49.400]  one of the top guys in this, you know, looked like a choir boy. George, I want to go through a whole,
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:55.160]  you know, section of important questions here. But we've just witnessed what I would call one of
[3:00:55.160 --> 3:01:00.120]  the most important dates in the March of World Government, this World Tyranny. They're openly
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:06.680]  agreed today 1.5 trillion for this new international body to issue their own monetized IMF World Bank
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:11.720]  super currency that the United States will now fully go into the control of this system as
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:15.560]  every other nation will. They're calling in a world government. They're saying and suddenly
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:22.200]  get the end down and yawn in the EU observer gave an interview. This is up on info wars.com
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:25.800]  and he bragged it says that suddenly they're admitting World Government, Bilderberg. They say,
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:29.880]  oh, at a meeting in June in Europe, the Bilderberg group, an informal club of leading politicians,
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:35.240]  businessmen and thinkers chaired by Mr. Davignon could also improve understanding on future action
[3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:40.760]  the same way it helped create the Euro in the 1990s, he said. And it says, he goes on to say,
[3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:45.400]  when we were having debates on the Euro, people at Bilderberg events could explain why it was worth
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:52.600]  taking risk and others for whom the formal policy was not believed in it yet. We were not obliged
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:58.200]  not to listen and had to stand up and come up with real arguments. So we've gotten some Bilderberg
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:02.200]  documents before where they admit they set up the Euro, but here they are admitting it. This is the
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:06.360]  group behind the European Union, the American Union, North American Union, you know, all of these
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:10.200]  things that are happening. So that's my question for you now and then what will this system look
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:16.280]  like if they're successful? Why now is Fox News and CNN coming out and saying it is a world government?
[3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:22.280]  We will be ruled by a group of private bankers, but it's good or some of the shows say it might
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:29.000]  be bad. All these years they knew this, so what does it mean now to have them emerging and admitting
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:35.320]  it? Well, quite clearly the G20 meeting that is taking place right now is the vortex of energy
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:41.880]  for the movement toward a total world bank and thus, and very shortly, a world government.
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:49.640]  They realize, the Illuminati realize that with the impetus, with the momentum of the election of
[3:02:49.640 --> 3:02:58.360]  Barack Obama, and he is just one of the most amazing actors in the history of western politics,
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:04.600]  he's much ahead of Ronald Reagan, is that they have to act very, very quickly because very,
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:10.360]  very quickly also the people of this world are waking up to the reality of the facade and the
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:17.080]  deception of Obama and his administration. And you and I have been aware of this for a long,
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:23.560]  long, long time, is that their tentacles are going out further and further and further,
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:31.320]  and that this G20 meeting is nothing more than creating a world bank right now. Now if that
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:38.120]  happens, in the United States dollar no longer is the reserve currency of this, of this world,
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:46.680]  Katie bar the door for all the families, for all the businesses, for all the people of the United
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:55.400]  States. We have, we have prospered for the last 50 years because the US dollar was the reserve
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:04:05.240]  currency. And because of massive, massive greed, because of massive incompetence, because of theft,
[3:04:05.240 --> 3:04:12.280]  and because of every sort of shenanigans you can think of, the US Treasury and the Fed have
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:20.840]  completely and 100% debased not only the economy of this nation, but the retirements and the future,
[3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:26.680]  economic future for the people of this country. This is really, really big stuff friends. And
[3:04:26.680 --> 3:04:35.000]  this situation is so, so much bigger than 99% of the people in this country understand. Well,
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:39.480]  the elite admit this is a world revolution, a scientific dictatorship. Let's come back,
[3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:43.640]  run through a laundry list of important questions I've got for you, then take calls for the balance

[3:05:54.040 --> 3:06:00.280]  humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security
[3:06:00.280 --> 3:06:07.480]  force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[3:06:07.480 --> 3:06:12.840]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. While Obama's
[3:06:12.840 --> 3:06:18.600]  already fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[3:06:18.600 --> 3:06:24.440]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:06:24.440 --> 3:06:30.440]  bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one
[3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:37.960]  world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:08:09.880 --> 3:08:23.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:28.680]  George, you've studied the New World Order, their own writings, their own statements. What will life
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:33.560]  be like under the New World Order if they're able to get the full system in place, this global
[3:08:33.560 --> 3:08:40.120]  regulatory micromanaging system? Wow, that's a big question, Alex. And it's one that is,
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:47.480]  we really don't know, but we do know this, that power tends to corrupt and absolute power
[3:08:47.480 --> 3:08:55.080]  crops absolutely. This we know. Now, the question is, is whether our slave masters would be
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:02.600]  liberals in which they would just allow us to be and they would have full control of us,
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:08.680]  but they would cut off all of our freedoms and give us things like sports and entertainment
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:14.200]  to keep us occupied. By the way, as you know, they have open discussions about that
[3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:19.880]  in major globalist publications. Absolutely. Go ahead. Or whether they're going to be more
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:26.120]  tyrannical in which they have repeatedly said that they need to cull the population
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:31.320]  down to less than a billion. That means that five out of every six people of this planet would be
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:38.520]  eliminated. Now, when you think about these concepts, they seem so far out. How could somebody
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:46.600]  like Barack Obama, who seems to have such kind eyes, be part of this? But all we have to do
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:53.640]  is go back in history, not 5,000 years or 2,000 years or even 500 years, but just in the last
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:10:02.920]  century. When Stalin came in, he eliminated over 25 million people of his own nation.
[3:10:03.480 --> 3:10:12.840]  He completely closed off the Ukraine and starved death, 14 million Russians because they weren't
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:21.240]  going along with his, with his policies. Mao Zedong, another very, very charismatic guy,
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:31.480]  comes in and promises a new way of better life. Five years later, 55 to 60 million educated
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:40.520]  and working Chinese people had been exterminated. So to believe that this cannot happen
[3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:47.960]  is just denial. Now, that's why Alex is here. That's why I'm here. That's why you're listening.
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:56.680]  My intention and my focus is not to let us go down that path. We are not an ounce of prevention.
[3:10:56.680 --> 3:11:01.080]  It's going to take a lot more of an ounce of prevention right now is worth a pound of cure,
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:08.600]  but it's going to take the combined efforts of everyone, not just Alex and myself or David
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:15.640]  Iker or whoever, but you, the people listening out there to first get yourself informed and to
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:25.080]  realize the real severity, the real seriousness, the reality of this point of time in our world.
[3:11:25.800 --> 3:11:31.960]  And all the prophecies for the last 4,000 years have pointed to this period of time.
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:38.360]  Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Hopi Indians, Nostradamus, the whole group of people,
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:45.560]  but it doesn't take a prophecy to understand of the incredible first economic, then political,
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:54.280]  then cultural danger or changes that are taking place. Now, if we react in fear and we then we're
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:12:00.680]  going to go right down their path because quite clearly they have more money. They have more guns.
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:07.560]  They have more organization, but we have the secret weapon up our sleeves and that is universal
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:18.120]  truth. That is what many of us call God because God doesn't create junk and the universal creator
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:25.480]  of this planet doesn't want us to wipe ourselves out. We don't need to go down this road and we
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:31.800]  have plenty of brain power. We have plenty of courage and we have plenty of ability to turn
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:38.360]  this thing around, but we have to do it right now and it starts with correct information.
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:45.960]  Then it takes a determination that you are going to stand up for what is right and just
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:51.880]  and to connect with your friends, your family, your coworkers to educate them. And then it is
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:12:59.800]  to organize people and we have the constitution, the republic, history on our side. We are not
[3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:03.480]  the bad guys in this situation. That's right. The globalists have been able to take over
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:07.720]  Russia with no history of freedom, China and others. It's going to be a lot tougher. That's
[3:13:07.720 --> 3:13:12.360]  why they've moved slower. They've incrementally tried to federalize all the local areas. They've
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:17.400]  tried to slowly twist us and I don't see them getting away with this too easily. Can you speak
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:23.800]  specifically to the issue that so many people before us and then today and what we've been
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:28.760]  doing for the last 15 years or so, you longer, the fact that we did read the globalist documents,
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:33.240]  we did warn people the power of the fact that we planted those seeds. They're now sprouting.
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:38.760]  There's never been such an awakening and planting seeds. Now people, some of them won't listen,
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:42.840]  but as the next phase of what we say comes true, we have their own blueprint,
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:48.360]  then our credibility gets even greater and that in that is going to be our victory.
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:52.120]  Doesn't mean we're not going to go deep into the battle in the arena. That mean a lot of us
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:55.560]  aren't going to make it through this. It means that you have to understand this is part of
[3:13:55.560 --> 3:14:00.520]  destiny, humanity, a human choice, bigger than even the individual in the whole development
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:05.240]  of the human species. This is what makes us strong, the wheat from the chaff, the gold from the
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:11.720]  lesser metals. This is the purification. This is the great test. This is the great culmination,
[3:14:11.720 --> 3:14:16.120]  the great battle as humans prepare to become a type one civilization, meaning survival of the
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:21.880]  species off planet. As we prepare literally like a caterpillar about to turn into a butterfly,
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:26.920]  the globalists don't want that going to the next level. Well, absolutely, Alex, and you say it so
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:35.640]  well and quite clearly this is a situation that has been going on for a long, long time. People
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:43.240]  such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Ford from the Ford Motor Company,
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:51.320]  Charles Lindbergh, John Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, all were very clear about the dangers of
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:15:00.600]  globalism and the new world order. And that's why our founding fathers to a person wrote about the
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:07.880]  decentralization of power, the keeping power in the states and returning power to the individuals.
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:14.040]  That's why we have the Bill of Rights. And is our constitution perfect? No, but it's probably the
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:20.520]  best constitution in the best republic that has ever been created on this planet. And I for one,
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:29.400]  in 100% behind the concepts and the higher higher ideals of our republic. Now the question is,
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:34.280]  is what are we going to do about this? And the first thing is that we have to wake up.
[3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:39.160]  There are clearly people out there. There are clearly these souls out there that have what I
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:46.280]  consider to be a vampire consciousness. They believe that the only way that they are going to survive
[3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:53.160]  is by sucking the blood or the nutrition or the life force from others. And it is actually
[3:15:53.160 --> 3:16:00.040]  that bizarre at one different level. Now clearly, then there are the other people such as Alex and
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:08.440]  myself who realize that this universe is infinite. There is infinite love. There's infinite abundance.
[3:16:08.440 --> 3:16:16.360]  There is infinite ability for all of us on this planet to live a healthy, positive, meaningful
[3:16:16.360 --> 3:16:24.040]  life if we work together with cooperation and under the rule of law, of laws that are equal
[3:16:24.040 --> 3:16:31.080]  and just for all people, just like in the republic. And that is what we are on the side
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:39.080]  of real law. The people who are in Washington who have all the guns, all the money are breaking
[3:16:39.080 --> 3:16:47.160]  the laws right in front of us. Now in the vampire consciousness, they also have a rule that they
[3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:52.200]  have to tell us what they're going to do before they do it. And there was a movie about 10 years
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:17:00.280]  ago called Wag the Dog in which it showed about how President Clinton had to create a war to get
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:09.000]  out of a situation with his intern. This movie was in the can six months before Bosnia or any of the
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:17.320]  other escapades took place. They always, these people in the Illuminati are under a very deep,
[3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:23.800]  secret societies that have their own laws. And they do tell us what they're going to do. And
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:31.400]  Alex and others have read these things and we know what they want to do. It is not just about
[3:17:31.400 --> 3:17:37.880]  money. It's about power. Let me repeat that again. It's not just about money. They're taking our
[3:17:37.880 --> 3:17:44.280]  money and they've got our money now. Now it's about power. Now the question is, is that they can
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:53.080]  only take our power is if we give it to them. And clearly I and many, many other hundreds of
[3:17:53.080 --> 3:17:58.840]  thousands of people and maybe millions of people are becoming aware and saying, no, you're not going
[3:17:58.840 --> 3:18:05.000]  to do that. This is my life. This is my state. This is my country. This is my world. And we're
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:12.600]  not going to play your games. And friends, I when I first became aware of this, it scared the heck out
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:21.480]  of me. But then as time went on, I found all these wonderful and vibrant new people, people who were
[3:18:21.480 --> 3:18:27.880]  alive in their spirit, who had beautiful hearts, who were so much instead of just talking about
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:33.880]  how about those longhorns or how about those rangers or how about, you know, whatever it was,
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:39.720]  all the draft, you know, and I'm a sports fan. I'm a total sports junkie. But there's bigger and
[3:18:39.720 --> 3:18:47.320]  more exciting things to talk about also. And there is no better game in the world right now.
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:54.120]  And I say game in a very fanciful way. It's life and death. It's life and death. This is a very
[3:18:54.120 --> 3:18:58.360]  serious situation. Well, that's what the British overlords in open books, they write, call how
[3:18:58.360 --> 3:19:01.800]  they play countries off against each other, how they control both parties, the manipulation,
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:07.560]  they call it the great game. Absolutely. And it is a great game. It's like a chess board game to them.
[3:19:07.560 --> 3:19:16.040]  Because for them, human life has no value. Again, for them, most of the people who are in the epicenter
[3:19:16.040 --> 3:19:23.400]  of the Illuminati, the power elite are basically atheists. They are materialistic, secular atheists.
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:31.560]  And I have a different point of view about life. I believe that life is divine. I believe it is
[3:19:31.560 --> 3:19:37.080]  spiritual. I believe it is loving. And I believe that there is purpose. And every single person on
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:42.760]  this planet has a purpose and a reason for being here. I mean, you take up that destiny to truly
[3:19:42.760 --> 3:19:46.680]  go to the next level. You're not truly living till you do that. We got a break. Come back,

[3:20:49.640 --> 3:20:54.760]  L U E dot com today. Hello, Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[3:20:54.760 --> 3:20:59.640]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events,
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:03.800]  it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:08.280]  depositors can remove from their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:12.360]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will
[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:17.000]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:21.880]  followed by a depressed economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central
[3:21:21.880 --> 3:21:26.360]  banks to increase liquidity for depositors. However, an increase in money supply without
[3:21:26.360 --> 3:21:30.760]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and
[3:21:30.760 --> 3:21:36.200]  stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:41.640]  gold and silver. While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has
[3:21:41.640 --> 3:21:49.640]  held value for over 6000 years. For more information, call 1 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7. That's 1 800 6 8 6
[3:21:49.640 --> 3:21:57.160]  2 2 3 7. In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:22:02.680]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:22:02.680 --> 3:22:08.280]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:13.800]  best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:18.840]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:22:18.840 --> 3:22:25.560]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:33.400]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:40.920]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:05.880]  Okay, Ravel, Nathan, Brian, Mark, Sean and others are going to your calls right now.
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:10.360]  Then folks will have to wait until the second Obama film comes out to hear all these questions.
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:15.480]  I've got about 50 of them here for you, George. We're going to rock it through after the show.
[3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:21.000]  But, Ravel, in Pennsylvania, you are on the air. Welcome.
[3:24:23.320 --> 3:24:27.640]  We went through this the last time I called. Oh, yeah. I forgot to give George headphones.
[3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:32.760]  Is there a pair there on the ground for you, George? They must have run off with them after
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:36.200]  they had them plugged in. Well, somebody get George some headphones. Okay, Ravel, go ahead and
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:40.600]  ask me a question while we're getting him headphones. Okay, the census. They're putting
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:46.040]  a millions of dollars into refining the census, sensing us because people are homeless and the
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:52.680]  foreigners, you know, whatever, immigrants, whatever, and they're trying, they said that
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:56.520]  they were going to take the stimulus money and take millions of dollars and put it into the
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:25:00.600]  census. Has anybody considered why they're suddenly coming out with that while you're
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:04.520]  talking trillions of dollars? No one's going to notice a few million going into a census.
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:09.560]  That might be a huge deal. I have the complete answer for you since you asked the question.
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:14.760]  Would you like me to tell you exactly what's going on? Yeah. Okay. Well, your instincts are
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:20.600]  correct there. Remember the big battle in 2000 when they said the census now isn't just how
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:27.000]  many people live in your house, but it's a 54 question deal. And then one out of six families
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  got a multi-hundred one saying, do you own firearms? What type of toilet do you have?
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:34.920]  And what stocks and bonds do you have? And then they get, and they start doing a business
[3:25:34.920 --> 3:25:38.920]  census and a farming census. And in the Constitution, they can only ask how many people
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:43.880]  live here to a portion of the states to decide how many members of the House of Representatives
[3:25:43.880 --> 3:25:49.000]  do your state get for representation in voting. That's why California has the most members of
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:53.560]  Congress. They have the biggest population. Texas has the second amount in Florida and so on and
[3:25:53.560 --> 3:25:58.920]  so forth. That's all the census is for. Now the census is this fifth amendment violating. You're
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:03.400]  not supposed to be able to answer questions even under torture. And they just mail you it. And then
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:08.760]  I got the big 54 question. I think every three homes got that. Every six homes got the multi-hundred.
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:13.960]  When I was here, everybody talking about it, I got in the mail the 54 question. And I said,
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:18.520]  me and my wife live here with my girlfriend at the time. We're now married. I said, there's two
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:23.080]  people here. And I filled it out, mailed it back in a young punk hang to my door. And I'll never
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:28.920]  forget he parked halfway out in the street kind of blocking the road over there where I lived.
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:32.280]  I told the story on air and I even have video, but somewhere never, never aired it. I get a video
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:35.800]  camera go there and go, what do you want? He goes, listen, you're his little badge. He goes,
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:39.000]  you're going to be arrested. If you don't fill this out, go show me the law. He goes, what's the
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:43.080]  law? And I said, no, here's the census form. It says you've only got to answer this question.
[3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:47.640]  And it threatens you with law up at the top of the form. It's a legal fraud. But down here,
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:51.320]  there's all these questions. I'm not answering it. Get out of here. And he wouldn't leave. And I
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:55.800]  stepped out and I said, did you hear me? I'm going to call the police. But see, most people buckle.
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:27:00.440]  And so now they're saying it's going to be first a yearly census, now a monthly census. And you're
[3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:04.280]  just going to have constant questions from the government. They threaten. And just like there's
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:08.520]  no law to take vaccines, but they say, we'll arrest you if you don't do this. George, you want to
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:12.920]  comment on that? Well, it's in the constitution. And the constitution is very clear. And you can't
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:17.960]  ask any other questions about who lives in your household, period, paragraph, and a sentence.
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:22.280]  And either we have a constitution or we don't have a constitution. And it's like if you're playing a
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:29.240]  game of cards, this four of a kind beat two pair, of course it does. But if they change the rules
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:34.920]  in the middle of the game, you get cheated. And I personally like the rules of the constitution
[3:27:34.920 --> 3:27:41.080]  that are equal and just for all people. It's dog training. They just constantly with peer pressure
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:47.160]  and with a badge or the uniform. You just say this is the way it is. Well, it's absolute intimidation.
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:53.320]  And it's also my control together with ignorance. And I really want to stress the fact that the
[3:27:53.320 --> 3:28:01.400]  people of this nation are far, far more controlled subconsciously than they have any idea about.
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:06.520]  And this has been going on for years and years and years through the television,
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:10.680]  through our schools, through the food we eat, through all the political,
[3:28:11.800 --> 3:28:19.960]  political correctness. And the people of this country don't even realize how enslaved they are.
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:23.560]  Absolutely. Ravel, your instincts are correct. Anything else?
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:29.400]  Okay, Nathan in Seattle. Nathan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:37.080]  Hello, Axe. Thanks. I was calling because I wanted to plug, wanted to know if you
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:42.120]  ever had Ellen Brown on. And the next thing was that I'm also calling because I don't really
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:48.600]  agree with George. I'm an atheist patriot. And I think the kind of rhetoric he's talking about
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:53.960]  is not really helpful because he wasn't saying, hold on a minute. He wasn't saying you are a
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:57.880]  New World Order. He was saying how the globalists identify most of themselves.
[3:28:58.440 --> 3:29:04.920]  Am I correct, George? Correct. And part of the Constitution is freedom of religion and beliefs.
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:11.160]  And if that is your belief, so be it. That's not my belief. But if I believe in the Constitution
[3:29:11.160 --> 3:29:18.440]  in real freedom, I allow you to be a Lutheran or a Catholic or a Jew or an atheist. And we can all
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:22.760]  live together. Nathan, do you want to come back and make any more comments? Yeah. All right. I'll
[3:29:22.760 --> 3:29:25.560]  put you on hold. We'll come right back to you for this quick break. Long segment coming up.
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:29.080]  Tons of time to take your calls and a lot more with George Humphrey. But yeah, don't let me
[3:29:29.080 --> 3:29:32.600]  forget our extended interview we're going to do about Mind Control because this film is going to
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:37.640]  talk about how they program people, you know, at all the different levels of programming. Yeah.
[3:29:37.640 --> 3:29:41.080]  Left, right paradigm, you know, all of this that's going on that keeps people in the dark.
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:48.680]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[3:31:00.120 --> 3:31:07.480]  security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception
[3:31:07.480 --> 3:31:12.440]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:31:12.440 --> 3:31:18.120]  While Obama's already fudging, yeah, but since day one in this election, if you have a demagogue

[3:31:23.720 --> 3:31:30.520]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about

[3:31:57.080 --> 3:32:01.480]  there are some of you that we really don't want to have food. If you're a politician who voted for

[3:32:12.680 --> 3:32:17.400]  growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food. If you think waiting for a cop to
[3:32:17.400 --> 3:32:21.400]  show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call

[3:33:26.760 --> 3:33:30.600]  Hi, we're back live. I'm gonna take calls at the end of the show from Nathan, Brian, Mark,
[3:33:30.600 --> 3:33:34.440]  Sean, Shane, and others. Tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show
[3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:39.240]  possible before we do that. One of them is Home Gain. Let me tell you a little bit about one of

[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:51.240]  means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:54.760]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims, for example, when seeds had the
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:34:59.720]  highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold. There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds,
[3:34:59.720 --> 3:35:03.240]  waged by the global elite as they buy them up and put them in these huge seed vaults,
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:07.400]  and the UN is involved with that as well. So Solutions from Science is trying to get the seeds
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:10.680]  out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time,
[3:35:10.680 --> 3:35:15.400]  one family at a time. Survivalseedbank from Solutions from Science contains enough open

[3:36:23.480 --> 3:36:28.280]  as those sponsors are all great and they also make this radio show possible. I tell you,
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:31.960]  the time just flies when you're exposing the New World Order. Let's go back to Nathan. Okay,
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:36.200]  your issue with George is saying the elite claim they're atheists. They're really
[3:36:36.200 --> 3:36:41.960]  Luciferians. They don't want us being on the spiritual side, but he wasn't saying all atheists
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:45.720]  are with the New World Order. Go ahead, sir. Oh yeah, I mean, I agree with that completely,
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:53.880]  because there's this mindset that atheists don't have morals, and when you really get down to morals,
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:36:59.240]  is about the healthiness of people, you know, and who's going to set that healthiness. You know,
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:02.360]  every time a European country votes to say we don't want to be part of the European Union,
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:06.600]  they say no, we're not letting you leave because you don't know, you're not educated. We know best.
[3:37:07.240 --> 3:37:12.200]  You see, so there's this attitude of, you know, the elite are saying what their morals are,
[3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:16.040]  and if you look what their morals are, death, destruction, enslavement, with a nice sugar
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:21.160]  coating. So all I'm saying is look at the people to say, well, look how Christianity has been used
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:26.680]  for mass murder or Islam or any of this. That is, again, always these people using that for that.
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:34.520]  Yeah, well, but that's the point. It's that morality is outside of religion, as far as
[3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:38.440]  I'm concerned. But you know, even if you don't consider it to be outside of religion, the main
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:42.920]  thing is, it's not really hard to find. You don't have to tell your kid, you know, don't stick dirt
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:47.560]  in your mouth. You know, that's primarily to, you know, it's not very complicated in a way. It's,
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:52.440]  it's either it's helping people or not helping people. Yeah, but I mean, sir, there's, there's
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:57.480]  all these other dimensions, the mathematics experts, the mathematicians have proven that there's,
[3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:07.000]  there's this very narrow spectrum that we live in. And I mean, just to say that, you know,
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:11.160]  I don't believe there's any higher power or anything greater. I mean, if you've studied
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:16.120]  where the earth is, how it's positioned, you know, its moon is just the right size and all
[3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:19.720]  these other mathematical and they say, well, that's just because we're alive here, because we're the
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:23.720]  one spot in the universe where there's, you know, one out of 50 trillion actually happened.
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:29.560]  I mean, the numbers are greater than that. All I'm saying is, look, you could be an atheist
[3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:33.320]  all day long or an agnostic. And I don't blame people looking at mainline churches and, you know,
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:39.880]  becoming atheists because they're so evil. But the larger issue here is the elites really do
[3:38:39.880 --> 3:38:45.960]  believe in spiritual systems and they are always attempting to get people to not look at that or
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:48.920]  to go into kind of the mainline paradigm. George, you want to talk about it? Well,
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:54.840]  I completely agree with you. And there's two points. First of our listener, I think the most
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:39:00.680]  important thing is a patriot. You agree that all people in this country have the right to their
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:06.040]  own beliefs, whether they believe in God or they say they're a Christian or a Jew or a Buddhist
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:11.720]  or an atheist. And that in a republic, we should allow that and we should be able to work together.
[3:39:11.720 --> 3:39:16.120]  And I think you and I are together on that. Is that correct? I'm not together with you,
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:22.280]  honestly. You know, the gold standard that seems to have like a religious, you know, pseudo kind
[3:39:22.280 --> 3:39:27.000]  of thing behind it. And when you look at it, it's, you know, if a guy shows up in town with a silver
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:30.840]  dollar and the silver dollar makes it all the way back to the guy, it doesn't really matter
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:36.920]  whether it was a silver dollar or, you know, seashells or whatever. The sea shell doesn't
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:43.480]  have a real inherent value. Silver and gold is always, you know, has a value for industrial
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:47.320]  means and many other things. Alex, even our air show, when you were on there, when you were
[3:39:47.320 --> 3:39:51.800]  money master's guy, you said that you weren't necessarily down for the, you know, silver
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:56.840]  gold. I'm not saying that. I'm saying we could have a fiat system and I'm open for debate on
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:00.760]  that. I'm just saying to say that gold and silver don't have an inherent value. They do.
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:05.320]  I'm not, I'm not saying that. I think they have a good long term. Let me just stop you
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:09.000]  because we made a mistake during the break and quit taping. We're taping in there, aren't we?
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:13.800]  We're taping on that deck. Then it's not a crisis. Don't worry about it. Okay. Sorry, sir. Go ahead.
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:19.160]  They have a long term value. And I think any system that has a financial, you know,
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:23.160]  systematic that you should have gold and silver for a long term, but I think you also,
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:27.960]  it makes sense to have, you know, I hear you. I hear you. I mean, I got to move on, you know,
[3:40:28.760 --> 3:40:34.040]  so much of what happens is we end up arguing with each other over, over these side issues.
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:38.200]  And I'm not saying gay marriage isn't a side issue or abortion isn't a side issue.
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:44.600]  Or I'm saying for the elite, they are, they want us fighting all day over all these issues that,
[3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:50.600]  you know, that aren't in the overall plan of we have a tyrannical world government run by a bunch
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:54.760]  of murdering eugenicists. And, you know, all these people are talking, oh, the bankers are
[3:40:54.760 --> 3:40:58.760]  corrupt. I agree. Things are getting bad, but Obama's going to fix it when he's bought and paid for
[3:40:58.760 --> 3:41:05.080]  by them. George. Well, there's no question is that Obama is a perfect Trojan horse for these
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:10.600]  people. He is the most charismatic. He's the most articulate. He's just, he's just awesome. He was
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:16.280]  the perfect pick by the Illuminati to carry their water. And that just makes the game a lot more
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:21.320]  interesting. And it makes a lot more dangerous because if brother McCann had gotten elected,
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:26.520]  it would have been easy to pick him apart. And I agree with Alex. We, at this time,
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:32.600]  we need to set our priorities and we need to stay focused and we need to keep on track of
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:37.560]  what's really important because survival is what it's all about right now.
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:41.480]  Absolutely. Let's take another call. Brian in Colorado. I got to hurry through these
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:47.640]  whenever I get to them all. Brian, go ahead. Hey, Alex, a long time listener since 2002.
[3:41:47.640 --> 3:41:53.320]  Also a prison planet member TV. Thank you. TV member. Hey, I've got a theory here.
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:42:00.280]  And I think it's credible. And if you can give me a second or a minute to connect the dots and
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:09.240]  put out all the dots out there. Now, we've talked or you've talked about the 80% of the world
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:16.680]  population reduction, what they want to do. And I believe personally that if this is what
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:21.560]  they're going to try to do, they're going to do it through an airborne virus type thing.
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:34.440]  Now, what if 20% of the population was resistant to that airborne virus? You've had a doctor on
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:41.080]  your show that she stated that these airborne viruses are fairly vulnerable and they're short
[3:42:41.080 --> 3:42:49.400]  lived in the air. Now, this is where I'm getting into my theory. What if those airborne viruses
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:57.480]  were to enter into the body into a toxic environment, such as a smoker's lung. Now,
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:09.240]  nicotine has been used as a pesticide for many years. And there's been this war against smokers.
[3:43:09.800 --> 3:43:15.400]  I mean, we got this new tax and they're trying to get us to quit smoking for whatever reason.
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:20.760]  So, do you see where I'm going with this? Oh, yeah, cigarettes are a magic elixir. I don't
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:27.240]  agree with you. Certainly, look, the establishment is going to carry out controlled bio attacks
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:31.800]  that are smaller to lock us down and train us that there are savers that are going to protect us
[3:43:31.800 --> 3:43:35.560]  from the next bio attack. Well, they're already doing it right now. All you have to do is look
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:40.920]  up in the air and look at the chemtrails. I mean, I was just out in California two weeks ago and I
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:46.360]  was outside. The weather is exactly the same every single day. Day one, totally cleared.
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:52.680]  Day two, totally cleared. Day three, totally clear. Day four, the planes are spraying all over,
[3:43:53.800 --> 3:44:00.040]  all over. And I look at the people, look up, look up, look up. The next day, clear, clear, clear.
[3:44:00.040 --> 3:44:06.200]  And the fourth day, the next fourth day, it's all tic-tac-toe and you can see it. And it's like
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:11.800]  5,000 feet on a hot day and it's not ice crystals. It doesn't dissipate. And then there's all these
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:16.200]  universities now admitting they're doing weather modifications. Sir, they want to go out for
[3:44:16.200 --> 3:44:20.680]  smoking because they want to put taxes on it and control it. And it sounds good to have socialism
[3:44:20.680 --> 3:44:25.880]  to take our rights for a good issue, a good cause. They're going to hit us with cocktails
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:29.720]  and things, sodium fluoride in the water, cancer viruses in the vaccines. They're hitting us a lot
[3:44:29.720 --> 3:44:34.600]  of different levels, but I appreciate your call, Brian. And then no question is a bad question.
[3:44:34.600 --> 3:44:39.400]  And I just don't think smoking is protecting us so they don't want to smoke you because they're
[3:44:39.400 --> 3:44:43.480]  going to do that. A lot of studies show you actually get more airborne things in your lungs
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:47.720]  when you do smoke as it breaks them down. Let's talk to Mark in Oregon. Mark, you're on the air.
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:53.960]  Hello, George and Alex. Great to speak with you. George, thank you also for, you know,
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.120]  your great heart and your great articulation of the important issues through the years.
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:45:07.400]  George, as Alex has so recently well documented, we have mass graves being dug for us around the
[3:45:07.400 --> 3:45:14.280]  country. And there are millions of plastic coffins being delivered to FEMA storage areas,
[3:45:14.280 --> 3:45:20.200]  which have been ordered by the Centers for Disease Control. And the federal government
[3:45:20.200 --> 3:45:24.440]  has prepared enough bird flu vaccinations ready and waiting to use on all of us.
[3:45:24.440 --> 3:45:31.160]  George, in your view, how do these activities by the federal government fit into their overall
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:37.800]  plans for the American people? And what do you see as the time when they will use their biological
[3:45:37.800 --> 3:45:45.080]  warfare on us all relative to their overall agenda of this country's total destruction?
[3:45:46.120 --> 3:45:49.080]  Well, first of all, thank you for your kind words. Yes, sir.
[3:45:49.080 --> 3:45:54.760]  Boy, nobody knows the exact dates, but we do know that the federal government,
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:45:58.600]  which is not really our government, this is not a government, it is a federal,
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:04.360]  it is a corporation controlled by the Federal Reserve, has already been poisoning us intentionally
[3:46:04.360 --> 3:46:08.760]  through the vaccines, through the chemtrails, through the fluoride in our water, through the
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:14.520]  misinformation and on and on and on and on to weaken the, weaken the people. And as Thomas Payne
[3:46:14.520 --> 3:46:19.880]  said, the beacon of freedom in the United States can be the beacon of freedom for the whole world
[3:46:19.880 --> 3:46:26.600]  and the Illuminati do not want this. And so they are smart enough. Now, the neocons were really
[3:46:26.600 --> 3:46:32.520]  pushing the schedule. Now, Obama, I don't know how fast they're going to go because they're going
[3:46:32.520 --> 3:46:38.520]  with the financial implosion. They're going with financial crisis. You know, and this situation,
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:45.080]  we are going to have massive, massive debt deflation for a much longer period of time
[3:46:45.080 --> 3:46:50.520]  than what we're being told, because there is no way in the world that even if they issue
[3:46:50.520 --> 3:46:57.640]  20 or $25 trillion of this bailout money, can they sop up all of this debt derivative debt?
[3:46:58.360 --> 3:47:03.000]  And that's just the fact. And they're just putting plasma into a dead man right now,
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:08.600]  trying to get this thing going. Unless they let get the toxic elements out of the system,
[3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:16.040]  the economy cannot recover. That's just a fact. Now, when, when the real Shinola is going to hit
[3:47:16.040 --> 3:47:22.680]  the fan, it's hard to tell. But right now, today, as we speak, the G 20 countries are meeting and
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:31.000]  they're planning on a world currency, a world bank and world government. And this is, this is
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:36.120]  not theory. As you know, I mean, it sounds like you've really, really done your homework. And
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:41.880]  the question is, is that we know that it's coming. All you have to do is extend the lines of what's
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:49.080]  there. The question is, is what can you and I and Alex and the others do to derail this train?
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:54.920]  Because we believe in something better for our families, better for our grandchildren and our
[3:47:54.920 --> 3:48:01.320]  children, but also for ourselves. And I guarantee you that if enough good people come together,
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:05.160]  we can derail this thing and that we can shift to a higher level of consciousness.
[3:48:06.360 --> 3:48:10.360]  But the biggest issue is we have to face the horror. It's hard for people to admit we have
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:15.480]  this criminal of an elite and that this is really happening. It's hard to believe as a parent
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:19.480]  that there are really people who want to kidnap your kids and go torture. Well, the mind control
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:25.240]  is just so amazing. And there is a psychological term called cognitive dissonance. And it is a
[3:48:25.240 --> 3:48:31.720]  very, very real psychological thing that when a person invests their time, energy or money into
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:38.200]  a concept, and then they see it's wrong, is that physically they have a very difficult time of
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:43.560]  changing courses. It's just like in the in the movie, The Matrix, when Neo goes into the construct
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:50.120]  and he realizes this is all an illusion, and that this is all just, you know, it's not what it appears
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:55.240]  and he comes out, he gets physically sick. And I remember when I first became aware of the New
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:49:01.880]  World Order, I became physically ill. It was that big of a shock to my system. And as Winston
[3:49:01.880 --> 3:49:08.680]  Churchill said, almost every man at some time in their life is knocked down by the truth. 99%
[3:49:08.680 --> 3:49:14.680]  of them get up, dust themselves off and walk away like nothing has happened. 1% will really figure
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:20.040]  out what's going and do something about it. And it sounds like my friend that you are aware of
[3:49:20.040 --> 3:49:24.920]  what's going on in you and your friends are doing something about it. And it's going to take the
[3:49:24.920 --> 3:49:31.480]  combined work of the people all over this country, all over this world to say no to this insanity.
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:38.040]  Absolutely. Okay. Thank you so much for the call. Sean, we got a hurry here. Sean in Minnesota,
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:50.040]  go ahead. Hey there. Good day to you, Alex and George. You guys made a profound remark about
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:57.000]  how under the globalist system of thought they believe that they are obligated to warn the
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:03.160]  public. And I want to ask both of you guys, have you seen this comic series that's been
[3:50:03.160 --> 3:50:08.680]  published in the London Telegraph called Blackjack? Yeah, Steve Watson's written a three-part series
[3:50:08.680 --> 3:50:14.760]  on Blackjack where the New World Order stages all the terror attacks, nukes going off to bring in
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:19.560]  world government, and they won't say where it came from, just a major paper just publishes this
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:24.600]  in a way of letting you know we're going to set off nukes, we're the government, and the government
[3:50:24.600 --> 3:50:32.840]  is going to stage the attacks. Absolutely true. I find it very strange that the paper does not
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:38.520]  disclose the name of the author. And they do on all the other times. Guys, pull up Blackjack during
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:43.960]  the break after we show some of the visual ads for the sponsors. We'll come out with Blackjack,
[3:50:43.960 --> 3:50:49.320]  the comic. It's not a comic, it's just a visual thing. Martial law, too. They show you martial
[3:50:49.320 --> 3:50:56.760]  law on the FEMA camps. Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral
[3:50:56.760 --> 3:51:01.640]  has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world. Utopia, Texas is home to
[3:51:01.640 --> 3:51:06.600]  a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:11.480]  produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:16.360]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[3:51:16.360 --> 3:51:21.240]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[3:51:21.240 --> 3:51:26.360]  antibiotics. Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver,
[3:51:26.360 --> 3:51:31.240]  gold, and copper, with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce. For four years,
[3:51:31.240 --> 3:51:35.800]  Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our
[3:51:35.800 --> 3:51:41.320]  God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech. Visit us today at utopiasilver.com.

[3:51:52.680 --> 3:51:58.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:51:58.680 --> 3:52:03.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:03.640 --> 3:52:09.080]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:52:09.080 --> 3:52:13.720]  the best interests of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged
[3:52:13.720 --> 3:52:18.440]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:52:18.440 --> 3:52:25.720]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:52:25.720 --> 3:52:32.200]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:39.960]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy
[3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:47.320]  of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:22.520]  Alright, let's try to get in as many callers as we can right now. Let's talk to Shane in Denver.
[3:54:23.720 --> 3:54:27.960]  Shane, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hello, Alex. Thank you so much for having me.
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:34.840]  I'd like to cover real quick Stanley Myers HHO Energy. We can convert these cars to run off
[3:54:34.840 --> 3:54:40.440]  water. We're using stainless steel jars, stainless steel, and mason jars. Okay.
[3:54:41.320 --> 3:54:46.040]  And this has been an application since the early 70s. There's actually a video surfing
[3:54:46.040 --> 3:54:49.160]  now. I've seen it, but I mean, do you have any comments or questions for George Humphrey?
[3:54:50.360 --> 3:54:57.720]  Actually, my main concern with the G20 Summit is they're producing mass-producing
[3:54:57.720 --> 3:55:00.840]  terminator seats and providing them to third world countries in Africa,
[3:55:01.560 --> 3:55:05.560]  and it's going to cause a mass starvation on your video with the Obama deception. I know
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:09.400]  it's on Rockefeller's car. He's talking about ethanol. That's going to cause mass starvation
[3:55:09.400 --> 3:55:13.800]  throughout the United States as well. It's not an alternative. It's horrible. You have to harvest
[3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:18.200]  the organs of the plant. This collar is real low. Can you guys boost him up for me? Maybe
[3:55:18.200 --> 3:55:22.040]  he's fine on air, but I'm having trouble hearing him. Interesting, sir. I don't mean to cut you
[3:55:22.040 --> 3:55:25.720]  off, but I have a caller who disagrees. They go to the head of the line. Mark in Colorado,
[3:55:25.720 --> 3:55:30.520]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, I think you and George are doing a wonderful job. I think
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:35.080]  you have a huge hole in your intellect. You compromise way too much with people who claim
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:39.240]  to be atheists, gnostics, and agnostics. Both of you need to buy and read a book called The
[3:55:39.240 --> 3:55:45.320]  Answers Book 2 from AnswersInGenesis.org and quit the compromising. God bless you for your work,
[3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:51.640]  and I'm hanging up. All right. Look, we're not compromising, but I always have a group call me
[3:55:51.640 --> 3:55:55.960]  up and say, you've got to bash Jews or you've got to bash Catholics. You've got to bash Blacks.
[3:55:55.960 --> 3:56:01.240]  You've got to bash Hindus. You've got to bash this. I've got a news show, and I'm here doing a news
[3:56:01.240 --> 3:56:05.560]  show. It's not one of these little specialty shows where people just cover one thing all day.
[3:56:05.560 --> 3:56:12.840]  I'm here covering world government being set up and cancer viruses and the vaccines and
[3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:18.360]  Chemtrail spraying and giant FEMA camps being built, admittedly with plastic coffins and people
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:24.600]  in denial. And a guy called up saying that we were saying that all atheists were running the
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:29.240]  New World Order. We said, no, we're saying the elitists claim they're atheists. So, I mean,
[3:56:29.240 --> 3:56:35.080]  it, you know, there's so much intellectual dishonesty out there or simplicity. It's like
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:41.000]  people always email me and they say, you have a sponsor selling tasers, but you say it's wrong
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:45.240]  when the police taser people know. I'm saying it's wrong when a pregnant lady didn't move quick
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:50.120]  enough and they taser or the guys on the ground going, don't taser me, bro. It's the misuse of
[3:56:50.120 --> 3:56:54.920]  it. It's like people that are anti gun say, we got to ban all guns because people get killed with
[3:56:54.920 --> 3:56:59.960]  them. No, it's the misuse of the gun. I mean, I'm not against police having guns. I don't want to
[3:56:59.960 --> 3:57:03.880]  misusing them. I'm not against citizens having guns. I don't want to misusing them. You know,
[3:57:03.880 --> 3:57:09.160]  that's the whole issue. And I, and so I get that it's like, there's no psychological,
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:16.760]  you know, differential to, you know, because the other guy thought we were saying he was part of
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:21.320]  the New World Order. And then the other guy thought we were endorsing atheism, George. I mean, you
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:27.960]  can't win. Well, that's the price of freedom sometimes. And the point is, is that if we do
[3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:33.080]  live in a truly free constitutional republic, we have to allow different points of view.
[3:57:33.800 --> 3:57:39.720]  And that's just the way it is. And that's a great thing. Having these discussions and these debates
[3:57:39.720 --> 3:57:44.840]  are great. And at the same time, as Alex says, we've got more important fish to fry. There's a
[3:57:44.840 --> 3:57:49.320]  bunch of folks out there who are getting ready to create a world government and try and really
[3:57:49.320 --> 3:57:55.080]  stuff us. And that's where I've got my attention. Now, we're out of time. Jason Bermas will be
[3:57:55.080 --> 3:57:59.640]  sitting in tomorrow from 11am to 3pm. And then he'll be back tomorrow night, night to midnight.
[3:57:59.640 --> 3:58:04.440]  So he'll be on tonight, the info warrior, night to midnight. Be sure and join him for that. Please
[3:58:04.440 --> 3:58:08.120]  tell folks about Jason's show. It's getting really popular. And quite a few stations picking it up
[3:58:08.120 --> 3:58:11.720]  if stations are listening to pick up my show or pick up the info warrior, check it out.
[3:58:11.720 --> 3:58:17.000]  Night to midnight central at GCN up there on the star guide satellite that details at the info
[3:58:17.000 --> 3:58:20.760]  warrior or infowarrior.com. George Humphrey, I want to thank you for coming in, brother.
[3:58:20.760 --> 3:58:25.800]  Alex is so great to be here. And I'll tell you all your friends, go and get the Obama deception
[3:58:25.800 --> 3:58:42.040]  right now. I really am proud of it. Get the DVD at infowars.com. God bless you all. See. Hello,
[3:58:42.040 --> 3:58:46.360]  friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[3:58:46.360 --> 3:58:51.080]  And today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[3:58:51.080 --> 3:58:54.920]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread. You'll never have to go
[3:58:54.920 --> 3:58:59.640]  to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply
[3:58:59.640 --> 3:59:03.720]  prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you. You know
[3:59:03.720 --> 3:59:08.840]  efoodsdirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic
[3:59:08.840 --> 3:59:13.720]  alteration or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
