[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next four hours. We have former congressman
[00:11.680 --> 00:17.480]  Ron Paul joining us. We have Gavin McGinnis joining us. Anthony Cummings joining us.
[00:17.480 --> 00:24.160]  We have David Knight also co-hosting and hosting in the fourth hour. We have our reporters
[00:24.160 --> 00:29.720]  on the West Coast that saw another night of rioting and police and press and innocent
[00:29.720 --> 00:37.560]  citizens being attacked. We've got those videos. We have Katie Couric caught red-handed editing
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.320]  a gun documentary to make gun owners look like idiots. This is so illustrative of deception
[00:43.320 --> 00:48.160]  that ties into a huge new Glenn Beck deception where we've got him red-handed. So it's bigger
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.120]  than Glenn Beck or Katie Couric. It's about understanding people like Brian Williams.
[00:52.120 --> 00:57.680]  These are three P's in a pod. That's why they're all three falling apart. But first, record
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.520]  lines this Memorial Day coming up and the TSA demanding more money or they're going
[01:01.520 --> 01:07.440]  to shut down all transport on planes basically. This is terrorism.
[01:07.440 --> 01:13.200]  The TSA, a monstrosity of bloated George Bush era New World Order policy resulting from
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.640]  the nefarious relationship between the Bush family and the Saudis. This relationship has
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.760]  forced Ron Paul to file an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act mandating
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.880]  that the 28 classified pages of the 9-11 report be released within 60 days of the NDAA being
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.680]  signed into law later this year. Meanwhile, the TSA cost the taxpayers in the ballpark
[01:36.680 --> 01:42.840]  of $7 billion annually. Money spent on a long and embarrassing track record resulting in
[01:42.840 --> 01:49.960]  Homeland Security being successful in smuggling guns and bombs through TSA security 67 out
[01:49.960 --> 01:55.920]  of 70 times. Loaded guns still pass right through the TSA as happened in Atlanta recently,
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.920]  not to mention the fact that you have a pretty good chance of being robbed by a TSA agent.
[02:00.920 --> 02:07.080]  RT reported that a TSA agent convicted of stealing more than $800,000 worth of goods
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.480]  from travelers said this type of theft is commonplace among airport security. Almost
[02:12.480 --> 02:18.960]  400 TSA officers have been fired for stealing from passengers since 2003. But there we are
[02:18.960 --> 02:23.720]  standing in long lines, each one of us having our Fourth Amendment rights violated and our
[02:23.720 --> 02:29.120]  tax dollars squandered. While the borders remain wide open as drug traffickers, child
[02:29.120 --> 02:35.200]  rapists and terrorists surge through the unprotected property of American citizens while the border
[02:35.200 --> 02:41.360]  patrol is ordered to stand down. Meanwhile, as many as 4,000 flyers missed their flights
[02:41.360 --> 02:47.320]  on American Airlines from February of this year alone. Got it? Illegal aliens move freer
[02:47.320 --> 02:53.560]  than American citizens and we are paying for it. The borders are open and we have mainstream
[02:53.560 --> 02:57.880]  news articles admitting that they fly in planes to New York every day out of Mexico and other
[02:57.880 --> 03:04.040]  countries and no one is even checked. No IDs are even looked at. Congress approves TSA requests
[03:04.040 --> 03:10.400]  for screeners to meet summer crush. They're going to get an additional 34 million to hire
[03:10.400 --> 03:16.440]  an additional 768 new officers and pay overtime for 42,000 plus. So what does the establishment
[03:16.440 --> 03:22.600]  do? The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform fired Kelly Hogan, the TSA's chief
[03:22.600 --> 03:30.160]  of security, mainly because Hogan, who has paid $181,000 a year, received $90,000 in
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.000]  bonuses regardless of the fact that TSA had been recently revealed to be a complete failure,
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.920]  as if that fixes the problem. And the only recourse for the airlines is Memorial Day,
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.720]  weekend looms, is for the airlines to take over the gridlock. Bloomberg reports, American,
[03:46.720 --> 03:53.160]  Delta and United Airlines will spend as much as $4 million each for extra workers at their
[03:53.160 --> 03:58.760]  busiest airports to help manage lines and shuffle bins at checkpoints. Freeing up TSA
[03:58.760 --> 04:04.240]  officers to focus on screening. Carriers and airports also are diverting some of their
[04:04.240 --> 04:11.080]  own employees to take the load off TSA staff. You want a solution? Shut down the TSA and
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.280]  reinvigorate the spirit of the American people by restoring the Fourth Amendment. Terrorists
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.000]  want to take a plane over? Well, our Second Amendment rights have a pretty simple fix for
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.320]  that. Of course, I admit, a shootout at 35,000 feet isn't the smartest solution. So if the
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.720]  bureaucracy must continue, take that $7 billion spent on the TSA annually and expand and modify
[04:32.720 --> 04:37.680]  the highly trained Sky Martial Service into an agency that actually obeys the Bill of
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.800]  Rights. Because right now, the only thing the TSA provides is a guaranteed false sense
[04:43.800 --> 04:49.400]  of security to protect the travelers who are being set up for disaster by an alphabet
[04:49.400 --> 04:56.200]  agency expanding its grip on the very freedom and security the TSA supposedly protects.
[04:56.200 --> 05:03.200]  John Bowne, FreeInfoWords.com James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, where
[05:26.200 --> 05:31.560]  power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country. It was why the anti-fetalists
[05:31.560 --> 05:35.720]  opposed the Constitution. They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse
[05:35.720 --> 05:40.320]  that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever
[05:40.320 --> 05:45.280]  govern ignorance. People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.920]  power that knowledge gives. Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[05:49.920 --> 05:55.400]  of what the real constraints upon them are. Only then will you have the courage to nullify
[05:55.400 --> 06:02.400]  their actions. For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[06:25.400 --> 06:32.400]  Remember your ProMax shower filter from ProPure today.
[06:55.400 --> 07:02.400]  5-3-3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic
[07:02.400 --> 07:07.880]  form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of
[07:07.880 --> 07:14.000]  the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.400]  forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[07:20.400 --> 07:26.240]  In the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.680]  and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality. Turn off our hormones
[07:31.680 --> 07:37.840]  and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[07:37.840 --> 07:45.800]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[07:45.800 --> 07:50.800]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex has turned so
[07:50.800 --> 07:55.160]  many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it
[07:55.160 --> 08:19.040]  starts at InfoWarsLife.com with Anthroplex. We now take you live to the Central Texas
[08:19.040 --> 08:28.560]  Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[08:28.560 --> 08:34.960]  I will have to be extremely disciplined today to cover even half of the vitally important
[08:34.960 --> 08:40.560]  news and information we have to break down, but I'm going to give it my best attempt here.
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.160]  Former Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us at the start of the second hour, and we
[08:46.160 --> 08:51.960]  have Gavin McGinnis also joining us, and Anthony Cumia for analysis on political correctness
[08:51.960 --> 08:58.840]  at world events. David Knight will be hosting the fourth hour, and I believe that we also
[08:58.840 --> 09:05.520]  have John McAfee popping in with him. There's a special report I filed yesterday that I think
[09:05.520 --> 09:13.760]  is excellent, that we're going to be playing later in this hour. It's up on InfoWars.com.
[09:13.760 --> 09:22.560]  It needs to go extremely viral. Video, Trump exposes globalist coup inside America, elite
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.880]  in full panic mode. I'm going to change that headline that I came up with right now. Video,
[09:27.880 --> 09:37.640]  Trump exposes globalist coup over America, elite in full panic mode, because it is an
[09:37.640 --> 09:45.960]  elitist coup over America. A globalist coup, and here's what's happening. People are becoming
[09:45.960 --> 09:52.720]  aware of it, and the old dominant dinosaur media is officially dead. They now know that,
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.160]  so they're coming to try to sell the idea of censoring and controlling, and intend to
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.800]  try to use the Federal Elections Commission, the FCC, Homeland Security, and others to
[10:02.800 --> 10:08.000]  do it. They intend to use the Department of Justice to go out and arrest governors and
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.800]  attorney generals that stand up to Obama and the agenda. They're arresting filmmakers.
[10:14.800 --> 10:21.760]  They're persecuting pastors. They are putting people in jail for having dinosaur creation
[10:21.760 --> 10:31.080]  parks in Florida. Whether you believe that dinosaurs walked with humans or not, someone
[10:31.080 --> 10:36.240]  should have the right to say the world is round or the world is flat. But this is the
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.720]  top of stuff going on, and they have shows on HBO going, yeah, lock these crazies up.
[10:42.720 --> 10:49.360]  Lock them up. They had a big story on Monday. We've covered it in the Washington Post. Big
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.280]  old huge, thick 30-something page report saying their arm, they're dangerous, they're constitutionalist.
[10:54.280 --> 11:01.040]  They're the biggest threat. Arrest them, because you've lost the viewers. You've lost the people
[11:01.040 --> 11:04.360] 's heart. You've lost the people's trust. You've broken the social contract. You're
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.280]  not liberals. You're anti-free speech authoritarians. You are allied with the establishment Republicans
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.040]  who are just as authoritarian, and the American people have taken the gloves off, and I'm
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.720]  here to tell you something. You may balkanize people against each other along religion and
[11:18.720 --> 11:23.680]  race. You may try to get more of the public dependent on welfare and systems to control
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.680]  them, but at the end of the day, historically, and looking at current trends as well, and
[11:29.680 --> 11:35.000]  even reading your own white papers, your own top advisors, like Brzezinski tell you it
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.840]  is impossible to control populations. You just have to kill everybody. And when your
[11:41.840 --> 11:47.920]  own minions find out that that's the plan to start world wars and release bio weapons,
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.320]  that you're actually looking at that to maintain your fraudulent control, people aren't going
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.440]  to go along with you when the rubber meets the road, especially if you start pulling
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.000]  the trigger on the final phases of your emergency plans, your backup plans. We aren't being
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.960]  caught flat footed. We're being caught on our toes in a fighting stance. We are the
[12:08.960 --> 12:17.920]  culture patriots through newsletters, magazines, talk radio, speaking at churches, colleges,
[12:17.920 --> 12:24.720]  writing books, you name it for 60 plus years, really longer than that. You go back to the
[12:24.720 --> 12:30.420]  Limburgs and others fighting the private Federal Reserve, but really for 60 years, the liberty
[12:30.420 --> 12:36.600]  movement has been on target opposing globalism and the globalist project because they were
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.920]  scholars, they were military men and women, they were constitutional lawyers, they were
[12:41.920 --> 12:49.440]  governors, they were serious people that were inside the system and who the globalist tried
[12:49.440 --> 13:00.680]  to recruit. When you read Barry Goldwater's quotes in his book, No Compromise, it's right
[13:00.680 --> 13:05.600]  there where he describes the trilateral commission plan to take over America and set up regional
[13:05.600 --> 13:10.680]  governments worldwide and destroy national sovereignty to take over the churches, banking,
[13:10.680 --> 13:19.360]  industry and the universities and they've done it. This is a real plan, but it counts
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.160]  on you being so ignorant and mainstream media making fun of researchers that pointed out
[13:24.160 --> 13:30.560]  that it's been hidden in plain view. Like the White House science czar, John P. Holdren,
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.960]  42 years ago, the year I was born wrote a U.S. government sponsored 1100 page textbook
[13:36.960 --> 13:43.000]  for PhDs and above on how to social engineer, how to break up the family, how to fluoridate
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.400]  the water, to brain damage you. I mean, at a controller level, they've got to have a
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.080]  book where they go, this is really what we're doing. It's the size of the Dallas phone
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.520]  book when I was a kid, a huge phone book. That's just one book. Tragedy and hope, the
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.040]  technotronic era, there are countless ones where they openly write books, men in power
[14:03.040 --> 14:09.080]  is a political retrospective, Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor. And I've read or scanned
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.680]  over, I've read probably 20 of these books they've written. I've scanned through, you
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.080]  know, with bibliographies, hundreds of books. I mean, I can't just sit to the same dribble
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.680]  over and over again, but I've scanned over hundreds of books. I've read 20 plus books
[14:20.680 --> 14:26.600]  written by them or more. That's a conservative number. And they just think you're so stupid.
[14:26.600 --> 14:30.600]  And every time I talk to a globalist, they go, you notice Alex, even though we're public
[14:30.600 --> 14:37.040]  about this, the public doesn't care. No, the public does care. They get bullied and ridiculed.
[14:37.040 --> 14:41.960]  Every time they talk about these issues or the media spins and lies. And so people feel
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.760]  like they're alone and intimidated, but not anymore, because anybody can put an infowars.com
[14:46.760 --> 14:51.720]  t-shirt and go out and walk down the street and have people stop them and shake their
[14:51.720 --> 14:59.120]  hand. So we're reaching a critical point. And infowars is only one part of that. Obviously,
[14:59.120 --> 15:06.960]  Hillary is in big trouble, significant security risk. State Department says Clinton violated
[15:06.960 --> 15:13.680]  email security rules. So that's a big slap in the face for her. We could be beginning
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.560]  to see the beginning of the end of Hillary Clinton. I've been smelling it. I've been
[15:18.560 --> 15:24.880]  smelling it for months. But regardless, the truth is coming out. I mean, she just can't
[15:24.880 --> 15:31.800]  hide her lies in plain view and get away with it forever. Obama has come out and said, world
[15:31.800 --> 15:37.120]  leaders are right to be rattled. Close quote by Donald Trump. What an endorsement to have
[15:37.120 --> 15:43.640]  world leaders that have sold us out to globalism rattled. We are also going to get into Trump.
[15:43.640 --> 15:49.280]  AAA says Memorial Day travel volume will be second highest on record as the TSA holds
[15:49.280 --> 15:54.400]  the public, as the federal government holds the public hostage to give us more funding
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.800]  to set up highway checkpoints and other things. Or we won't put enough screeners at the airports
[15:59.800 --> 16:08.600]  to quote engage in security theater. But John Bowne filed a very powerful report that we
[16:08.600 --> 16:13.640]  aired earlier today here at the very start of the broadcast that's up on info wars.com
[16:13.640 --> 16:19.920]  titled shut down the TSA enough already where we prove that the borders are wide open, that
[16:19.920 --> 16:24.840]  the jihadis are brought in without even having passports. And that all of that is a okay,
[16:24.840 --> 16:29.640]  but citizens have to be trained to take their shoes off their belts off and to be pre screened
[16:29.640 --> 16:33.680]  or pre approved. But still, if you're pre approved, you can still be shunned into the
[16:33.680 --> 16:40.560]  security line preparing you to be a prisoner that you're guilty until proven innocent when
[16:40.560 --> 16:48.400]  the answer is arm the pilots or for a fraction of the price. Stick a air marshal on every
[16:48.400 --> 16:55.760]  passenger plane out there. You could do it for $300 $400 a flight. It's estimated, boom,
[16:55.760 --> 17:02.920]  fine game over arm person on the plane. And sit right up there, you know, with the pilots
[17:02.920 --> 17:09.480]  if you want. And that ends it. That ends it right there. And they know that. Oh, we can't
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.480]  trust pilots. They only fly the big giant plane. Well, look out because they want to
[17:13.480 --> 17:16.800]  go to everything being drone operated. And that gives the globalist total control over
[17:16.800 --> 17:21.240]  all of society. The military is coming out saying we want all of our convoys now to be
[17:21.240 --> 17:27.240]  to be autonomous to be driverless because then terrorists won't blow them up. Oh, we want
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.520]  all of our combat trips to be robots because then terrorists won't kill them. Humans are
[17:31.520 --> 17:39.120]  being taken out of the equation to turn us into servile screen head wire head zombies.
[17:39.120 --> 17:45.160]  Not being challenged, not working out, not facing combat, not being involved, not being
[17:45.160 --> 17:50.080]  forced to go give a speech or to try to get an A plus or to play dodgeball or to play
[17:50.080 --> 17:55.640]  volleyball. Because I might lose all that's being phased out because they don't want you
[17:55.640 --> 18:01.680]  to ever experience anything that takes you through stress to a higher level. That's why
[18:01.680 --> 18:06.320]  our IQs are dropping. It's why our health is imploding. The federal government came
[18:06.320 --> 18:17.800]  out the CDC and said we're fatter than ever today. And that ties in to this report. CDC
[18:17.800 --> 18:22.400]  Americans are fatter than ever before. I'll cover this coming up. US Army to test driverless
[18:22.400 --> 18:26.320]  vehicles, technology in Michigan, that all ties together. And then that ties in with
[18:26.320 --> 18:30.360]  this. Professor, if you read to your kids, you're unfairly disadvantageing others, national
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.640]  review that I mentioned yesterday. When you read deeper, it actually says the family's
[18:34.640 --> 18:39.240]  bad, but we're going to allow it to be around for a little bit longer. And that ties into
[18:39.240 --> 18:48.320]  this new article today. Oberlin students want to abolish midterms in any grades below C.
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.640]  You see there? Oh my gosh, you read to your kids, they're too advantage. We need to ban
[18:53.640 --> 19:00.280]  private school. We need to get rid of the family. This is ABC News interviewing a professor
[19:00.280 --> 19:05.640]  saying this with a straight face. And now we need to get rid of anything below C. You
[19:05.640 --> 19:14.640]  see where this is going by design. The world is being set up where we're obsolete by design.
[19:14.640 --> 19:17.600]  We're the dominant species. Humans build their own environment. That's what makes us
[19:17.600 --> 19:24.520]  different. But instead, the elite are taking control of our development and building an
[19:24.520 --> 19:29.640]  environment that makes us obsolete and makes us dumb and makes us weak in Bill Joyce's
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.720]  own words in 1999 in Wire Magazine, some microsystems owner. He said, I went to an elite meeting
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.800]  with 200 top owners. We said, we just keep humans alive and mass and let them play games
[19:38.800 --> 19:43.200]  all day where we just exterminate everybody. And he said, the answer is extermination.
[19:43.200 --> 19:46.160]  He said, I just think I might want to tell the public this. They're going to build a
[19:46.160 --> 19:50.440]  technocracy where you're obsolete and they plan to kill you. And people said, oh, that's
[19:50.440 --> 19:56.800]  a funny article. So they're already killing us slowly right now. Don't say you weren't
[19:56.800 --> 19:58.040]  warned. We'll be back.
[19:58.040 --> 20:04.400]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I'm a former 22 year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:04.400 --> 20:08.680]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives. You never know
[20:08.680 --> 20:13.440]  when there will be another Katrina and economic collapse or a serious drought. We should all
[20:13.440 --> 20:17.360]  have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times. I'm going to tell
[20:17.360 --> 20:22.880]  you about a great way to do that. A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance
[20:22.880 --> 20:28.000]  that can help you be prepared. It's a home freeze dryer. With the product, you can preserve
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.440]  the foods your family loves. And the best part is the food will last 25 years and still
[20:33.440 --> 20:38.920]  taste great. I've tried it and it's amazing. With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right,
[20:38.920 --> 20:44.040]  you can literally freeze dry anything you eat, even things like ice cream. To learn

[20:58.800 --> 21:04.280]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian Psychiatrist, author of 85 books and founder of the National
[21:04.280 --> 21:09.280]  Chain, Meyer Clinics, to tell you about two-year health liquid vitamins. I've been taking
[21:09.280 --> 21:14.120]  these every day for over a decade now. And I try to encourage every one of my clients
[21:14.120 --> 21:17.960]  to take them every day. And there's a number of reasons. First of all, it's the best vitamins
[21:17.960 --> 21:21.560]  you can get. It's got dozens of vitamins and antioxidants and nutrients in it. And then
[21:21.560 --> 21:25.920]  the most important reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients
[21:25.920 --> 21:29.800]  is because it's got brain food in it. It's got the essential amino acid. It's got
[21:29.800 --> 21:34.600]  tripsin, phylloelamine, tyrosine, choline, vitamin B6, and these chemicals that are
[21:34.600 --> 21:38.280]  all natural from food. Turn into the brain chemicals that make you happy.

[22:07.200 --> 22:11.480]  chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[22:11.480 --> 22:16.440]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[24:04.360 --> 24:07.640]  That's Johnny Cash, bringing us in. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining
[24:07.640 --> 24:15.880]  us. Is it getting better? I'm about to, in this segment, for part
[24:15.880 --> 24:23.120]  of the next breakdown, hardcore deception in the media. And then I'm going to tie that
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.280]  into how this is an overall public destabilization program. But just to illustrate that, during
[24:29.280 --> 24:34.840]  the break, I've never seen Leanne McAdoo in four years of knowing her so hot. One of
[24:34.840 --> 24:38.960]  our reporters, I don't mean so beautiful. She's always beautiful. I mean so angry, hot under
[24:38.960 --> 24:42.840]  the collar. They said, hey, Leanne wants to come on during the break before. And I said,
[24:42.840 --> 24:52.720]  okay, and then she comes stomping in here and shows me KXAN, TV, NBC, and the Office
[24:52.720 --> 24:57.080]  of the American Statesman and others. And it's just so angry because the Alamo Draft
[24:57.080 --> 25:02.440]  House has revolutionized dinner theaters. They do it on a big scale. I know Ken Lee back
[25:02.440 --> 25:06.120]  when he founded the first one. I've been showing my films there since he first founded them
[25:06.120 --> 25:13.000]  back in, I guess it was like 1999 or something. And now they're all over the country. It's
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.040]  based here in Austin. It's dinner and a movie. I don't care if the guy's liberal. He's produced
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.960]  movies that have characters that are based on myself. I've gone and been a guest and
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.360]  spoken at some of the premieres. He has a lot of big actors that come into town. The
[25:28.360 --> 25:33.400]  guys have an American success story. So I'm going to cover the media deception in the
[25:33.400 --> 25:36.680]  next segment. I'm going to cover this a little bit now. She's going to be in the studio with
[25:36.680 --> 25:40.720]  us later. She walked in and she said, I'm really mad about this. And I said, yeah, they're
[25:40.720 --> 25:44.720]  going to retrofit the Alamo Draft House and have it where men and women's bathrooms can
[25:44.720 --> 25:50.480]  be everybody and everybody's bathrooms. Women are still, I said to her, don't worry, going
[25:50.480 --> 25:53.320]  to self segregate and go to the women's and men's are going to the men's. I mean, it's
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.760]  like a cattle call after a movie or before one to even get into a movie theater bathroom.
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.960]  You want to go as fast as possible. It's just getting a bodily function done. But the government's
[26:02.960 --> 26:08.000]  jacking with our physiology to totally confuse us and mess with us. You think it's bad for
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.720]  adults in the social engineering? Imagine what it's like for kids. And she goes, read
[26:13.720 --> 26:17.760]  the article. And I said, okay, you're so angry. She was red face. She said, read it. And I
[26:17.760 --> 26:24.040]  went, oh my gosh, let me show you this right now. If you're a TV viewer, oh my gosh, this
[26:24.040 --> 26:34.120]  is the next face document can please. The headline should be Alamo Draft House theaters
[26:34.120 --> 26:39.160]  to make women P standing up. That's the real headline. They have the blueprints. They want
[26:39.160 --> 26:47.440]  to jack with people so hard. They're getting rid of toilets, except for a few stalls. In
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.280]  social, they're already getting rid of water at some of them saying humans are bad eco-friendly.
[26:51.280 --> 26:57.200]  I don't know if Ken Lee knows this is eugenics. He's like guilty. He's a capitalist making
[26:57.200 --> 27:01.040]  hundreds of millions of dollars or whatever. And so he's just going to adopt the 200 square
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.320]  foot apartments Austin's getting and just everything else. And don't say the word mother
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.920]  or father and every movie has to have a woman as the hero. But now they have urinals where
[27:09.920 --> 27:15.800]  women have to pee standing up. See, they're just phasing out culture. They're phasing
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.000]  out electricity. They're phasing out big apartments and big houses. They're social engineering
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.960]  us to have less, but the elite are going to have more while they lecture us. And this
[27:26.960 --> 27:30.880]  is as all these different governors in 12 states. It was tears, two more in the last
[27:30.880 --> 27:38.000]  few hours, Sue Obama over gender neutral bathrooms and gender neutral prisons. They're
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.800]  now having to build new prisons, new detainment facilities for illegals. That's been announced.
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.840]  The Fez are building a huge facility in Texas for something like $30 million. I mean, you
[27:48.840 --> 27:55.680]  thought it bankrupted everything to put a wheelchair ramp and to say a tiny bed and
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.600]  breakfast that has two rooms. They just go bankrupt. The big corporations love that.
[28:00.600 --> 28:07.760]  This is the tyranny of zoning. And just like the left and Austin is so freaked out that
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.560]  Uber and Lyft that got there in two or three minutes every time. I always had a great experience
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.640]  with it. It was just night and day. The taxi cab service in Austin, Texas, the whole time
[28:17.640 --> 28:22.600]  I've lived here has been horrible. It's so bad that I won't even use it 90% of the time
[28:22.600 --> 28:26.560]  until I quit using it a few years ago. They don't even send a cab the first time. You
[28:26.560 --> 28:30.680]  have to get it like an hour and a half earlier than the second or third try. They come. Now
[28:30.680 --> 28:35.000]  they tell you, Oh, I don't want to come where you're at. I don't want to go there. You get
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.200]  cab services in London. It's all foreigners. And they tell you, I want triple price to
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.080]  take you to the hotel. You ask the next person, they go triple price. They got everything
[28:43.080 --> 28:50.000]  rigged. That's okay. You like losing your Uber and Lyft. How about losing your businesses?
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.480]  How about now where, okay, you want to go to a woman's? That's fine. You want to go
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.320]  to a man's? However you identify, whatever, that's going to cause problems. But now, oh
[28:59.320 --> 29:05.360]  no, we're getting rid of the toilets and we're going to make everybody, by the way, the
[29:05.360 --> 29:08.840]  word is they're coming out with new toilets where you also stand and take a crap. And
[29:08.840 --> 29:12.280]  look, I'm starting to talk about body functions here on air. I never used to do that, but
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.200]  that's what our sick, freakoid governments into. And it's happening in Europe, everywhere
[29:16.200 --> 29:20.920]  else to ruin culture. The truth is, they're not sick and that they're obsessed with potties
[29:20.920 --> 29:24.520]  and sex and all this. They want to get us obsessed with that, where we're just a bunch
[29:24.520 --> 29:30.520]  of confused, mentally ill basket case, social justice warriors that can hardly talk and
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.640]  are waging war against communication and against language and against everything else. This
[29:35.640 --> 29:41.680]  is total divide and conquer. But look at it right here. It actually says right here, women
[29:41.680 --> 29:46.240]  will have to urinate standing up. They're just going to get rid of toilets and the Alamo
[29:46.240 --> 29:52.360]  draft house wants to be cutting edge. We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex
[29:52.360 --> 30:02.000]  Jones and the GCN radio network. There's rumors that Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump might
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.840]  have a debate. Well, we can debate on whether or not that's going to happen. But what I
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.200]  can tell you is that Trump has reached the delegate number needed to quench the GOP nomination.
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.720]  Donald Trump has reached that number, securing his status as a presumptive Republican nominee
[30:15.720 --> 30:20.640]  and avoiding a contested convention, according to a delegate count released Thursday by the
[30:20.640 --> 30:26.680]  Associated Press. The AP reports that Trump has reached 1,238 delegates put over the
[30:26.680 --> 30:32.760]  1,237 needed to win the nomination by a small number of the party's unbound delegates who
[30:32.760 --> 30:37.400]  said they would support him at the convention. Trump will most likely add more delegates
[30:37.400 --> 30:42.280]  to his total, giving him a very comfortable victory. Trump's achievement marks the completion
[30:42.280 --> 30:47.760]  of a primary campaign that has defied multiple predictions of failure from political commentators.
[30:47.760 --> 30:52.720]  It now sets the stage for a bitter fall campaign against likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
[30:52.720 --> 30:56.840]  And don't forget, Hillary for prison, hashtag handcuff Hillary. This has been Joe Biggs
[30:56.840 --> 30:58.880]  with Infowars.com.

[33:04.560 --> 33:10.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:10.680 --> 33:15.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, Congressman Ron Paul's coming up on
[33:15.680 --> 33:23.560]  huge issues, the economy, 2016, globalism, and so much more. We've also got a bunch of
[33:23.560 --> 33:27.640]  other guests. Liam McAdiz is going to be popping back in in about an hour and a half to really
[33:27.640 --> 33:34.080]  flesh this out when Anthony Coomie is on with us. Popularist going to get a talk show host.
[33:34.080 --> 33:38.400]  But if you're a new viewer, I'm not kidding about what I just covered, so she's popping
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.000]  in right now. They have the blueprints out, and Ken Lee, who I've known for, gosh, it's
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.560]  got to be like 18 years, he used to love me. Now when I see him, I run him down the street,
[33:48.560 --> 33:52.440]  he goes, oh, Alex, hi, and just walks around me, totally freaked out. He's totally in the
[33:52.440 --> 33:58.360]  liberal cult, absolutely, completely following whatever they say. And when you read the KXAN
[33:58.360 --> 34:05.040]  article with his quotes from NBC News here, that I'm about to show TV viewers and read
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.160]  for radio listeners, you have to understand everything he's saying is an inversion of
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.000]  what this is designed. Notice when you hear him talk, it's everything I've said but the
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.640]  opposite. Now I don't know if he's in on this or he knows he's been given talking points,
[34:18.640 --> 34:22.560]  but Ken, I don't think you're a bad guy. I mean, I've been to movie premieres where
[34:22.560 --> 34:26.720]  they have big actors that he's produced, he produces big films now, and the character
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.840]  is based on me, and I'm happy that's happened. I mean, I've hung out in that dinner with
[34:30.840 --> 34:36.680]  this guy, and it's just crazy that he's the cutting edge. He said, we've heard about transgender
[34:36.680 --> 34:43.680]  kids getting beat up in bathrooms, oh, we're, I mean, Ken Lee, Tim Lee, whatever, it's teleprompter
[34:43.680 --> 34:52.520]  free, Tim Lee. And all of this is going on. It's totally out of control. It blows my mind
[34:52.520 --> 35:00.680]  that this is happening. And they, again, invert reality. Tim Lee is inverting reality. I don't
[35:00.680 --> 35:05.920]  know if Tim Lee is doing this on purpose. I've known the guy for years as I said, but
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.560]  listen to how they twist this information. Alamo Draftile seeks feedback on gender neutral
[35:11.560 --> 35:17.640]  bathroom design. Like when they caught the gay preacher putting fag on the cake, they
[35:17.640 --> 35:23.760]  just said, oh, he's nicely dropping his lawsuit. He's such an angel, was the KXAN and Austin
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.240]  America statesman headlines. They wouldn't tell you he'd been caught lying and they
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.880]  had surveillance footage. It was just, he's so gracious and he's loving. So there's deception
[35:30.880 --> 35:34.880]  in the headline to make it look normal. Here it is. So all psychological warfare. Alamo
[35:34.880 --> 35:38.520]  Draftile seeks feedback on gender neutral bathroom design. Then you read it. It's the
[35:38.520 --> 35:43.800]  opposite of general neutral. The Alamo Draftile has classic bathrooms, big area for women,
[35:43.800 --> 35:47.960]  big area for men, already big lines, already a disaster. This is going to be an even bigger
[35:47.960 --> 35:53.920]  disaster. So he's decided that their new location here in Austin, the Mueller location, to scrap
[35:53.920 --> 36:01.560]  it. And he says, because we want to quote, hopefully remove design conflicts. So he goes
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.800]  on to say, you can't necessarily change everybody's mind immediately on these issues, but you
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.520]  can hopefully, by design, eliminate conflict. Putting men and women together in restrooms
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.000]  will create conflict. Everyone knows it. It's social engineering to stir everybody up and
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.960]  bring down culture and society. That's the admitted globalist blueprint. The working
[36:18.960 --> 36:24.160]  draft, which was posted on Facebook is one large bathroom with a section of urinals behind
[36:24.160 --> 36:29.680]  a door and individual stalls for seated toilets. League said he is considering a type of urinal
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.560]  both men and women can use because you're going to have one bathroom now folks. You won't
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.560]  be able to go to the Alamo Draft House. I will not go and stick my little girls and
[36:37.560 --> 36:42.080]  my son in a freak show bathroom because you just want to control reality, but it's their
[36:42.080 --> 36:48.480]  religion so he can't help it. I predict he'll bankrupt Alamo franchise before he stops.
[36:48.480 --> 36:54.120]  So what does an all gender urinal look like? It's new territory, says Weiss. It's something
[36:54.120 --> 36:59.760]  we're looking into. It's essentially a urinal that has a throat that comes out. It's a deeper
[36:59.760 --> 37:05.920]  store. It's a deeper store. So women's squat now. I mean, we just sort of bring ourselves
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.920]  standing above this urinal as a woman. I was so frustrated to get rid of conflict. Yeah,
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.200]  this will cause total bedlam, total tower of Babel, total absolute insanity. I mean,
[37:18.200 --> 37:21.760]  I wouldn't hear any of the minorities that listen, I won't go to a gas station that has
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.080]  a crappy bathroom. Even if I only use it once a year, if I know that gas station has a bad
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.520]  bathroom, I will not pump gas there because I just think of the whole place is gross.
[37:30.520 --> 37:35.520]  Now, because of this, just they already put these low flush toilets and environmental
[37:35.520 --> 37:41.960]  toilets in with no water. So the place smells like year old 550,000 gallons of cat piss.
[37:41.960 --> 37:46.000]  So I already can't go to Alamo Draft House South Lamar because the place into the hall
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.040]  smells like a giant cat piss hell. So it's now Alamo cat piss and now Lee and everybody
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.840]  else and my daughters are not going to some dirty funnel spout and sticking their butts
[37:56.840 --> 38:00.920]  in it because you want to play God. Now I know why you're so angry, but these people
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.280]  are cult leaders. They will have us drinking purple Kool-Aid with fricking cyanide by the
[38:05.280 --> 38:08.520]  time they're done. I'm sorry, Leigh Ann. I called you in here. Now I know why you're
[38:08.520 --> 38:13.240]  mad. Go ahead. Look, it ties in with this. Professor, if you read to your kids, you're
[38:13.240 --> 38:16.920]  unfairly disadvantaging others and they go on to say, we're not getting rid of the family
[38:16.920 --> 38:22.000]  completely yet, but it's bad and private school should be banned. I have another article, Oberlin
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.760]  students want to abolish midterms and any grades below C. We are being destroyed. We
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.760]  are bringing brain damage. We are being annihilated. Now go ahead. I'm sorry, Leigh Ann.
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.120]  Tyranny of the minority. Tyranny by the minority. And this is, this made me so angry because
[38:37.120 --> 38:41.680]  it's, we've completely... Check your male white privilege. We've gone completely past
[38:41.680 --> 38:48.600]  gender inclusive bathrooms to physics defying bathrooms. Women are not made to pee standing
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.840]  up. And why, why all of a sudden do women now have to change the way that they go to
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.040]  the bathroom? These people are loons. They're control freaks. I'm sorry. Go ahead. It's just,
[38:59.040 --> 39:04.520]  it's so frustrating to me. This is different. Ken, Tim, whatever. Tim Leigh. I'm so angry
[39:04.520 --> 39:10.080]  I can't even talk. Literally is obsessing over how we pee-pee. Yeah. Well, I, I demand
[39:10.080 --> 39:16.120]  that Tim Leigh redesign his bathrooms to be inclusive for the men who live as dogs.
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.160]  So really he should just put fire hydrants in there. That's in the garden. That's in
[39:19.160 --> 39:23.240]  the garden. I agree. How about, how about we all just have a big commons area at the
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.720]  entrance by the bar at Alamo Draft House theaters and everyone just comes in and urinates on,
[39:27.720 --> 39:32.360]  on, on fire hydrants. Yeah. I mean, we just have a giant gaping hole in the floor. And
[39:32.360 --> 39:38.000]  have a big old Astro Turf area. Yeah. Where we take... And they could have little poop
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.520]  or scoopers come around and just follow us all around. That'll be a new job. How prestigious.
[39:42.520 --> 39:46.160]  Hey, you know, Alamo Draft House South Lamar, the times I've been in there now, smells like
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.720]  a urinal out in the hall. Yeah. I mean, because they put the no water thing in there. Right.
[39:50.720 --> 39:55.320]  And then like urinal cakes. I don't want those in the bathroom. Those things are disgusting
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.560]  and they smell terrible. Like, what are they thinking? I mean, as a woman, I am so frustrated
[40:00.560 --> 40:04.120]  that as soon as they're teaching us to be poor and they're destroying civilization, that's
[40:04.120 --> 40:11.000]  just in a 21. It's a battle plan on record for post industrial world. Tim Leigh. Talk
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.800]  about oppression by the patriarchy. So now... Can we get a clip of Copper Cab what he sings
[40:16.800 --> 40:23.160]  saying patriarchy rules the world to check your male white privilege? I'm sorry. And
[40:23.160 --> 40:29.680]  now I got to check my female white privilege, my woman privilege, because now that women
[40:29.680 --> 40:35.400]  have penises, we have to actually redesign the way the actual women go to... You know,
[40:35.400 --> 40:38.920]  I shouldn't be laughing. This is horrifying. And we're on a lot of great Christian stations
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.000]  around the country that have picked us up for decades and they know we don't get into
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.040]  potty stuff, but the government's taking over the potties and they're coming after our
[40:46.040 --> 40:51.080]  kids. I have to talk about... Yeah. Well, if you desex society, you dehumanize society.
[40:51.080 --> 40:53.760]  And that's what this is really all about. You've been talking about this for a long
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.640]  time. It's not about gender inclusivity. It's about redefining what sex is, what gender
[40:59.640 --> 41:04.360]  is. And we're just at the beginning of this. How far are they going to take this? I mean,
[41:04.360 --> 41:08.040]  we are just at the beginning of this whole transgender thing and they're already making
[41:08.040 --> 41:14.360]  federal laws where you can be fined if you refuse to call someone they. You know, I mean,
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.440]  the house... They want to arrest you five years in prison in Canada if you say you don't
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.960]  believe in transgenderism. Well, I mean, how about I believe the moon's made of cheese,
[41:22.960 --> 41:26.800]  whether I'm wrong or right, do I have free speech or not? And now, now, I mean, listen,
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.120]  I'm not kidding. See this thing, oh yeah, it'll be all... Next is going to be our houses,
[41:31.120 --> 41:36.720]  restaurants, our homes. You watch with all the zoning where Germany six years ago passed
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.880]  a law saying no new single home dwellings in Germany. People didn't believe it. Now Austin's
[41:41.880 --> 41:47.840]  talking about doing that. They're actually social engineering the standard biology of
[41:47.840 --> 41:54.080]  humans out of existence. This is a takeover. This is a plan. This isn't a game. Well, and
[41:54.080 --> 41:59.880]  this also is a total oppression by the patriarchy because you're forcing women to accommodate
[41:59.880 --> 42:05.160]  the male anatomy. You're completely changing the women's comfort. We don't... That's the
[42:05.160 --> 42:08.240]  plan. They're going to cause a debate with this nationwide and say, we're sorry, we're
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.400]  going to make you all sit down now. Watch. I've got them. This is a Gaelian dialectic.
[42:13.400 --> 42:17.160]  I actually had a breakup with a guy because I found out that he peed sitting down. Sorry.
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.400]  That might be offensive, but... Well, I love it was mommies make them do that so they don't
[42:21.400 --> 42:25.760]  give you a sprinkle when you tinkle, be a sweetie, lift the seatie. Yeah. Well, and here's the
[42:25.760 --> 42:30.400]  other thing. So they're taking out textbooks that if anyone, if there's any kind of debate
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.080]  about the whole climate, man, make climate change and stuff. Well, how come sciences
[42:35.080 --> 42:41.000]  is like 100% on that? But now all of a sudden science got it wrong on their only two sexes.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  I like what you say about their blood bill now that say their dogs. Let's show this.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.520]  And so we shouldn't be able to say dog because maybe some people don't have a dog like boy
[42:48.520 --> 42:52.880]  or girl. But I think actually almost wrapped up should put in a big astroturf and fire
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.080]  hydrants and we'll just say, well, you're all dogs when you come here and the folks that
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.360]  want to go there and, you know, maybe the evolution, we will just change the way that
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.360]  all of us will. I mean, that woman doesn't look completely insane right there. Oh, she's
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.720]  very happy taking care of her husband. They take your freedom. They take your rights away.
[43:09.720 --> 43:14.080]  They take your health away. We're a bunch of mentally ill, obese people on average. Now
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.520]  people record levels of cancer, but they give us insanity. That's the new right we're given
[43:18.520 --> 43:24.520]  is cultural degradation and the collapse of humanity. And Tim league can make hundreds
[43:24.520 --> 43:28.480]  of millions of dollars and prance around. And that's okay. But he wants to look at making
[43:28.480 --> 43:33.960]  women stand while urinating. And look, I'm sorry to talk about this. This is not a subject
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.080]  we get into, but now we're being culturally taken over. And this is the attack. Leigh Ann
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.720]  will be back with us in a couple of hours. Thank you so much. Amazing. Ladies and gentlemen,
[43:42.720 --> 43:47.720]  now I've got to get back to my hardcore news, but I was already planning to get into all
[43:47.720 --> 43:52.240]  the transgender news and the 12 States suing. And while this is going on, our economy is
[43:52.240 --> 43:55.840]  falling apart. While our power plants are being shut off, we can't compete. I mean,
[43:55.840 --> 44:02.400]  we are being shut down right now. You want to see 21st century warfare? This is it telling
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.000]  women to urinate standing up, telling people we're going to go tell your five year olds
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.360]  that they can be confused and can be male or female or maybe a dog or, you know, banning
[44:11.360 --> 44:17.480]  dodgeball, Danny, a banning tag, banning the words mother and father, he and she on admission
[44:17.480 --> 44:24.720]  forms. It's here. It's going on. It's a cult. They mean business. And then half the time
[44:24.720 --> 44:28.520]  they bust these Congress people and leaders of different federal agencies or hardcore
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.600]  pedophiles. I mean, with like three year old kids and stuff. Of course, who else would
[44:34.600 --> 44:41.280]  want to make women use weird urinals but a bunch of freaks. And then you got all the
[44:41.280 --> 44:45.840]  intimidated basically cult members of liberalism who mean well, many of them probably like
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.320]  Tim Lee. I don't think he's a bad guy who just, okay, we'll put in urinals for women,
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.920]  whatever you say. And we'll all put everyone in the same bathroom. I'm not going to the
[44:54.920 --> 44:59.800]  Alamo draft house on the off chance. I got to go number two and I'm going to go in there
[44:59.800 --> 45:04.280]  and go, Hey, how you doing, ma'am? Pull my pants down in front of women. I already don't
[45:04.280 --> 45:08.680]  want to do that in front of men. And again, I've never in 21 years on air talked about
[45:08.680 --> 45:12.160]  private stuff like this, but you want to get it all out in the open. You perverts. We're
[45:12.160 --> 45:21.040]  doing it now. I am so fed up with these people. I am so absolutely fed up with it. I just
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.640]  I am sick of them. There you go. I am boycotting the Alamo draft house. I'm not going there
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.160]  again until they apologize and pull this out. I've done repeatedly the deal at the start
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.600]  of the movie where they say, don't talk on your cell phone or I'm going to take you out.
[45:35.600 --> 45:40.040]  I've done that, I think three times over the years. I mean, I've showed my films there.
[45:40.040 --> 45:47.080]  I know these people and they have gone completely nuts and I'm done. I'm sorry. I'm not taking
[45:47.080 --> 45:50.980]  my son to stick him in a bathroom with other women and men and I'm not taking my daughters
[45:50.980 --> 45:58.200]  to stick them in a bathroom where they learn to pee like a dog. I mean, I'm not even boycotting
[45:58.200 --> 46:03.520]  you. I can't get close to you. I can't get near you and all your unhappy, desperate trendies
[46:03.520 --> 46:09.760]  that run it who are so empty and so soulless and so unhappy. That's it. Never going again.
[46:09.760 --> 46:16.200]  Boom. Hope you enjoy it because you're not going to stop. You're in a cult. It's like
[46:16.200 --> 46:19.920]  Target lost three, four billion dollars when they came out and said they're going to integrate
[46:19.920 --> 46:26.520]  the bathrooms and they just said, we're not stopping. We don't care because this is a plan,
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.760]  a program, an operation. They've all got a lockstep together and not have any link in
[46:30.760 --> 46:37.000]  the chain fail in their con game, in their takeover, in their plan. Now, let's shift
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.080]  gears very briefly here and I'm getting into the deception of the media. They're putting
[46:43.080 --> 46:46.040]  estrogen mimickers in the food and water. They're jacking with people. They're attacking
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.320]  our sex. I just covered that. That's what this is all about is ending the species. Ninety
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.040]  percent of the sperm in the west are dead or immobile. Women are incredibly infertile.
[46:54.040 --> 46:57.000]  You're being hit and you're being hit hard. And one thing is the estrogen mimickers,
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.040]  what I counter it with is super male and super female vitality. Both have been sold out for
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.880]  months. There are number one products. They just came back in yesterday. Get super male
[47:05.880 --> 47:13.040]  vitality. Concentrated cold pressed herbs and an incredible fusion to just energize
[47:13.040 --> 47:16.840]  your life. That's what I've experienced. I'm not going to go over what all these well
[47:16.840 --> 47:21.600]  known documented herbs do, but nobody else has the patent process. The Dr. Group does
[47:21.600 --> 47:28.360]  of the cold pressing and then the basically the aging of it. They don't heat it up, but
[47:28.360 --> 47:34.760]  they age it and then let it dry out and then keep adding more. It's more complex than that,
[47:34.760 --> 47:40.560]  but it's super, super, super, super, super concentrated and most people feel libido energy
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.600]  stamina within 24 hours. But talk to your physician first. Super male vitality is now

[48:42.000 --> 48:44.800]  not going to skip this break. I've got to stop skipping the breaks. I might when Ron
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.840]  pulls on, so I just stop right there. Sounds like I'm talking to myself. I just hit the
[48:49.840 --> 48:52.000]  cough button and told them I'm going to skip the break, but now I'm not going to. I just
[48:52.000 --> 48:59.480]  can't do it. Here's what I'm getting at. The bad halogen is out there. There's a whole
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.800]  bunch of them. Look at the informational videos. Inforwarslife.com. Read the papers. Do your
[49:04.800 --> 49:08.680]  own research. Talk to your physician. Your nutritionist. The bad halogens are there.

[50:33.360 --> 50:43.520]  not been exaggerated to paraphrase a patriot of old, but we are certainly going to go over
[50:43.520 --> 50:47.960]  it because he's come out yet again and said that they didn't have veiled threats at Matt
[50:47.960 --> 51:13.840]  Drudge or that they're not sitting there lying about Matt Drudge and veiled threats on Donald
[51:13.840 --> 51:29.160]  Drudge.

[54:07.120 --> 54:15.120]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[54:15.120 --> 54:29.120]  There is a video up on infowars.com that's a clip of Glenn Beck yesterday saying,
[54:29.120 --> 54:34.640]  one of the most deceptive things I've ever heard, period. It's one of these lies that's so twisted,
[54:34.640 --> 54:38.800]  it's hard to even describe, where he goes, finally the mainstream media is doing something I've
[54:38.800 --> 54:45.040]  called for for years. They're battling dangerous conspiracy theorists and these type of right
[54:45.040 --> 54:51.040]  wingers and he goes, it's incredible. They're exposing the lies that people claim that Vince
[54:51.040 --> 54:55.680]  Foster was murdered. I mean there's so much evidence, it's incredible. And so he's acting
[54:55.680 --> 55:02.480]  like mainstream media never said Vince Foster wasn't murdered or that the CIA didn't invent the term
[55:02.480 --> 55:07.760]  conspiracy theory back in the 50s and 60s to discredit people. That's been declassified
[55:07.760 --> 55:13.280]  in the Senate Church Committee hearings. So Glenn Beck proves Vince Foster's death,
[55:13.280 --> 55:22.480]  a suicide not is our joke. Trusted source Jake Tapper has Beck convinced there was no foul play.
[55:22.480 --> 55:29.600]  It's him worshiping CNN. It's so bizarre. But saying no one had ever said Vince Foster
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.560]  committed suicide. That all these kooks were saying it was murder and that only Glenn Beck had said
[55:34.560 --> 55:41.120]  it was really suicide. I mean it is just total establishment behavior but saying it's anti-
[55:41.120 --> 55:48.560]  establishment. So then it gets worse. Story up on infowars.com. Beck calls Drudge Evil for
[55:48.560 --> 55:56.720]  suggesting he advocated patriot kill Donald Trump. Now again we're not obsessing on him
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.720]  because he's Glenn Beck. We're obsessing on this because this is how they deceive. In the next
[56:00.720 --> 56:05.920]  segment before Ron Paul comes on, I'm gonna get to Katie Couric clips where a whistleblower inside
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.920]  the maker of this documentary film, she goes you'll give me a reason guns you know protect people
[56:11.920 --> 56:15.760]  and what they would have done and she cuts to them sitting there when they were rolling but
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.000]  didn't know they were being asked a question and they all look dumb. They've tried that with me
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.360]  before. It's a classic tactic but then the person released the real video where they all jump in
[56:25.360 --> 56:31.840]  and answer with great answers. So see this is getting behind the curtain and this is what we
[56:31.840 --> 56:37.680]  do. We destroy them. Brian Williams, Glenn Beck, Katie Couric. We take him one person.
[56:38.240 --> 56:47.280]  Mr. Maddow. Who's the one that wears the glasses? It's Mr. Maddow and then it's Mrs. Hayes.
[56:47.280 --> 56:50.640]  Yeah I confuse them all. I don't have a teleprompter folks. I get names wrong
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.000]  like earlier. It's in Ken League. It's Tim League. But getting serious here,
[56:57.440 --> 57:01.280]  they know what they're doing and the latest thing he goes it's ridiculous, despicable,
[57:01.280 --> 57:08.160]  Matt Drudge says that I threatened Donald Trump on my show. That's ridiculous. A few months ago he
[57:08.160 --> 57:13.040]  said I want to get up there on stage if I was there I'd stab him and the stabbing wouldn't stop
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.400]  and then Beck came out and said that he didn't mean that and that it didn't say that and that
[57:18.400 --> 57:25.520]  Drudge linking to it was wrong. Now he's done it again with this writer on there saying we need
[57:25.520 --> 57:31.040]  you know somebody to take action a good patriot if Congress won't stop Trump. Then they add we're
[57:31.040 --> 57:34.320]  just saying that hypothetically. That's like if you're sitting around talking about murdering
[57:34.320 --> 57:39.040]  somebody hypothetically you know how much would it cost to take out my husband or hypothetically
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.280]  how much would it take to take out my wife you know I'm writing a novel. They sit there with
[57:43.280 --> 57:49.440]  provisos which makes it even more premeditated on a show with a few million listeners used to be a
[57:49.440 --> 57:56.640]  lot trying to get some nut to do something this is so crazy and then denying it and saying Matt
[57:56.640 --> 58:02.480]  Drudge is a liar. Let's go to one of the clips now we'll come back with more. Here he is a few
[58:02.480 --> 58:09.520]  months ago saying stab Donald Trump. If I were on the stage I would have said have you been listening
[58:09.520 --> 58:14.960]  to him tonight yeah have you been listening to what I say about him and also why don't I actually
[58:14.960 --> 58:21.200]  I believe these things yeah I'm not gonna be sitting in their shoes I mean was he a gigantic
[58:21.200 --> 58:26.960]  shoes I look at you man if I were closing up and I had a knife really I mean I what the stabbing
[58:26.960 --> 58:31.600]  just wouldn't stop. Okay man it's a long clip before that they're talking about Trump the whole
[58:31.600 --> 58:36.240]  time they carefully don't say his name right before but say big shoes meaning small hands
[58:36.240 --> 58:40.480]  but they're talking about Trump they've done it again and then they go how dare you scumbag
[58:42.160 --> 58:48.720]  he calls him evil that calls him evil others call him a scumbag his other little minions over
[58:48.720 --> 58:53.600]  the years there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals

[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.800]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network this just in from world net daily
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.480]  dr carcy heads suppressing draft criminal indictment against hillary this after the state
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.640]  department's own inspector general found significant security risk and then hillary clinton lied
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.320]  repeatedly ron paul's coming up to be discussing this in a lot more here in a moment but look
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:38.160]  let's play that clip one more time where they're talking about donald trump and and the whole
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.200]  debate and they were on the stage with him he would stab him and keep stabbing him it's clearly
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.360]  who he's talking about the new york times just had people call for him to be killed they leave
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.560]  stuff up on twitter and facebook saying kill him kill trump but now none of that exists and now
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:01:00.160]  he's had this writer on where they discussed killing him and said you know a good patriot needs to
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.680]  stand up and do this and when they come out and drudge links to an article about it they say
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.600]  drudge is evil and drudge is a horrible person and a piece of garbage close quote because he even
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:18.480]  linked to a news article about it bet calls drudge evil for suggesting he advocated a patriot
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.400]  killed donald trump co-host labels news icon despicable lying scumbag when bet sensationally
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.120]  labeled matt drudge evil for linking to a post that suggested bet and his guest on his radio show
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.240]  advocated a patriot assassinate donald trump if he becomes president the american mirror characterized
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.760]  bet discussion with best-selling author brad door as an agreement between the two that they
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.720]  would only way to get trump out of office was to apparently kill him and and you can tell they're
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.200]  scripting it as they're not getting trouble with the secret service and they say let's just hypothetically
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.560]  in a literary way you know talk about this uh you know we need if congress won't stop him then we
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:02.000]  need somebody else to you know a patriot this is really creepy folks so let's play back one more time
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.560]  from a few months ago at cpaq and then let's play the latest one and each time he denies that's even
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.640]  what he's saying here it is if i were on the stage i would have said have you been listening to him
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.280]  tonight yeah have you been listening to what i say about him also why would i actually
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.600]  sit in these things yeah i'm yeah would be weird sit in their shoes that i mean was he a gigantic
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.960]  shoes how could you oh man if i were close enough and i had a knife really i mean i hate what the
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:38.800]  stabbing just wouldn't stop okay it's in full context on info wars dot com we're talking about
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.280]  trump and how everybody should be against even never trump and then they segue but for time i'm
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.360]  just showing the clip where he talks about stabbing him now now this audio is really not that great
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.080]  because i guess it is the glenbeck show but richard reeves on the road covering politics and he was
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.360]  listening to it following it and monitoring enemy transmissions and actually caught video of this
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:04.560]  audio for you the full in context is up on info wars dot com but here's a shorter clip of it well
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:12.640]  we have talked about it before we have seen it time and time again but it's getting worse
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:21.360]  but here's jake tapper on the latest national inquirer angle once again journalists are in
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.720]  the unhappy predicament of trying to decide whether and how to cover false allegations
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.840]  raised by a candidate for president of the united states this time in the midst of donald trump's
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.320]  attacks on the clinton's using various scandals and then because end of bill and hillary clinton's
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:42.960]  until his tragic suicide in july 1993 foster who suffered from depression drove to fort marcy
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.640]  park in virginia walked into the park with an old okay we're gonna fade this down because of the
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.320]  time constraints but you can see the full video then he says what a great job he's doing here's
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.880]  the four comment uh also uh with beck talking about we need a patriot to step forward of congress
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:03.440]  won't deal with trump here it is with the factless fun with congress we have who will stand in the
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.440]  way of donald trump overstepping his constitutional authority as president if congress won't remove
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:16.400]  him from office what patriot will step up and do that if if he oversteps his uh his mandate as
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.600]  president his constitutional granted authority i should say as president if he oversteps that
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:28.000]  how will we get him out of office and i don't think there is a legal means available i think it
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.120]  will be a terrible terrible position the american people will be in to get trump out of office
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:38.160]  because you won't be able to do it through congress oh i would i would agree with you on that
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.800]  so again they're the ones that started the fights with matt drudge everybody they're the people
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.760]  that are going after trump those people going after populism he's the guy that goes and gives
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.240]  you know teddy bears to the illegals and all the rest of it uh will he give teddy bears to the
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.280]  troops that are being euthanized i mean it's all stunts words americans most associate with hillary
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.320]  liar not trustworthy and scandals clinton's popularity hits rock bottom his damning report
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.520]  reveals more lies article by steve watson at info wars dot com americans were asked to give a word
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.400]  or short phrase that they think best describes hillary pull also found that only 19 percent of
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.920]  voters believe clinton is honest and straightforward noted msnbc anchor steve cornac this has been a
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:27.120]  huge obstacle for her in her campaign a separate abc news washington post poll approximately 53
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.000]  percent of voters said that they had an unfavorable opinion of clinton another recent poll by the new
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.200]  york times found that 64 percent of registered voters do not see hillary as honest and trustworthy

[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.680]  the least we are seeing so many good things happen but also so many bad things we're seeing the
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:26.480]  associated press come out the national poll a month ago showing that six percent of news consumers
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:33.840]  trust mainstream media we're seeing the ratings go from bad to worse at cnn and msnbc and so many

[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.000]  we're doing the same thing competition is absolutely beautiful for a free market in an open
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.160]  society that's why john d rockefeller called it a sin famously so i want to talk about these moves
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:04.080]  by the federal elections commission deputy chair to try to censor the internet starting with matt
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.800]  drudge and then talk radio starting with rush limbaugh because if they can take down matt drudge
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.840]  and rush limbaugh folks they can take down anybody's free speech and believe me they have been eyeing
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.320]  campaign for liberty they've been eyeing info wars they've been eyeing ron paul's private
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.040]  media operations because they're so effective so i wanted to speak with the former congressman
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.320]  and medical doctor and really the torchbearer worldwide for libertarian ideas in my my view i
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.120]  think that's undisputed about where he sees the world right now and what the establishment's
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:40.000]  going to do also the big central banks are moving to try to abolish cash he for decades tried to get
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.560]  the bill passed it's very close to passing finally uh after not even having any cosponsors a few
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:50.240]  decades ago to audit the fed it seems liberties on the march but also tyranny's on the rise
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:56.640]  the best of times worst of times and we'll talk about campaign 2016 and more dr paul thank you
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.320]  so much for spending time with us uh you look great it's good to have you with us via your uh
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:08.000]  your skype connection thank you alex good to see you today we've got about a two or three
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.520]  second delay so i'll try to just uh you know not jump in too much just with a few questions
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.920]  you heard what i threw out uh where would you like to start with the moves the censor i don't
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.480]  think i've ever seen with facebook and all the rest of them being caught uh censorship of this
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:30.960]  magnitude i think we live in an age where there is no understanding and no respect whatsoever
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.280]  for personal liberty and personal privacy and the founders understood it much better
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.040]  they tried to protect us against a big government that would come in and destroy that but there is
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.360]  a collusion between big business corporatism and big government that are in in in control
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:53.200]  so therefore they can control the output it used to be that newspapers did it in three major networks
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.800]  and it was uh we understood it and then it changed when there were more cable stations in the
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:04.240]  internet stations at all but they haven't quit they're still challenging us and you're right the irs
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.800]  has not been kind to us they've been after us quite a few different times on some of our
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.400]  organizations and they continue to do it they'd like to bankrupt us uh you know through all the
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.960]  money you have to spend to try to defend oneself but i think what we're witnessing today is a result
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.440]  of an era ending and i've talked about this for maybe five plus years about the end of an era
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:34.000]  because i believe the era of big government uh the progressive era uh really exhausted itself
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.120]  probably at the end of the last century and now we have just been fidgeting and trying to keep things
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:44.640]  together and that's why you know the political parties are in shambles the economy's in shambles
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:50.800]  civil liberties are in shambles but the real problem is that the system we have today isn't
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.960]  working it's ending kasey and economics doesn't work that model is bad and and never worked but
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.920]  that was the substitute for fascism and communism in the 20th century did a pretty good job at
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.200]  smashing it because it's a total failure and there are still some who would like to be socialists and
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.600]  think that venezuela is the way to go and all there's nothing but you know the markets are
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  very powerful the market said that fascism and communism failed but the substitute the american
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:26.000]  substitute of kanesianism economic planning central banking inflationism a fiat money
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.240]  and uh running our lives regulating our lives taking away our liberties and also this obsession
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:38.320]  with us believing that we are so exceptional that we can tell the rest of the world how to live
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:44.400]  and we should be exceptional in the in dealing with our own problems and setting a good example
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:51.280]  but so i think the mess that we're in today is the end of this era and without anybody admitting
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:57.200]  this we and those in the freedom movement have been trying to warn people of this and giving
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:02.320]  them an option and quite frankly i think we're doing fine there even though like you mentioned
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.000]  alex on the introduction that you know uh statism and big governments are alive and well
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.200]  but they're bankrupt so they will end just as our empire will end kanesian economics will
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.800]  fail the central banking system is going to fail we just have to concentrate on it to energize
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.000]  another generation that there is an option for this there is an alternative and of course that's
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.080]  what i've been working on for quite a few years absolutely dr paul uh expanding on that looking
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.560]  at what the so-called left is doing ally with the establishment republicans in this country
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.640]  similarly in europe where i know you've traveled and spoken extensively well they now because
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.600]  they were discredited last century as you said are instead just trying to dumb everyone down
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:52.480]  and really much overthrow reality and overthrow the engines of free market that are left because
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.600]  they just can't compete with that even existing even though it brings down the civilization they'd
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.280]  rather rural people you know not be able to take care of themselves they'd rather city people not
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:09.120]  be able to take care of themselves they'd rather the whole country in the whole world be poor and
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:16.800]  rule a huge junk pile instead of a great civilization and so my concerns are what do you see them
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.560]  doing in their death rows because even most mainline analysts are starting to agree with you
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.240]  that we're coming to the end of a bubble uh that no matter what the establishment does
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.880]  they're not going to be able to suppress change more and more young people are waking up so clearly
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.520]  i agree with you this great turning that you've talked about for decades but you've said is very
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:39.600]  close for five years is pretty much here but but how do you expect the empire to strike back i mean
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:45.680]  i think we're seeing it open naked authoritarianism but doesn't that only accelerate the fall of their
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:55.520]  system well yes there are their failure but they will strike out and uh i think that what they have
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.560]  going for them right now is the dummy down of america so in many ways they have been successful
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.080]  by getting hold of the public school system and teaching people you know bad economics and bad
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.880]  foreign policy and and all the things that are wrong but at the same time uh you know the failures
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.520]  there i think they know that the failure is there but they will strike out and they will become more
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.480]  authoritarian and i think that is exactly what they're doing and it isn't a partisan thing when
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.400]  you know that the nancy poloses of the world and the john banners of the world were much more
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.440]  buddies than anybody realized but that continues the parties the parties mean very little but i
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:40.080]  think if nothing else this current election cycle that's going on represents the dummy down of america
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.600]  but then again does that mean that we should be exhausted and run for the hills or should we continue
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.040]  the fight obviously i'm here for the fight and to me it's an intellectual fight and we have to beat
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.480]  them with better ideas and i think there is a receptive audience out there but what they they
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.760]  have power because they're in control right now but what we have on our side is that ideas have
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:09.280]  consequences you can't stop ideas uh it even the armies and the governments can't stop ideas
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.760]  if their time has come and of course the need has come and certainly we hope to make it our time has
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:22.000]  come for the option to be because i see the collapsing of this system as the opportunity
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.600]  to be more forceful in our presentation because they will be very aggressive they will use the
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.520]  judicial system and the irs and everything else because their goal is power they believe that
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:39.600]  they are exceptional they believe that they know what is best for us for instance the silliness of
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.560]  what this country has endorsed now with the federal reserve that they know what interest rates should
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.120]  be that's this remote you'll sing in the world for somebody who knows anything about economics
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:56.560]  and free markets so so i think there's in the midst of this mess we do have opportunities sir
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.880]  you've got so many organizations and groups and tv shows and radio shows i see it and hear it everywhere
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.120]  i want to say congratulations to your media team it's so wonderful to see you not just in congress
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.160]  now but you look younger than you did five years ago so congratulations on on the hard fight in
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.960]  congress and not missing any votes that you couldn't and working so hard and now reaching
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:21.040]  so many people but uh is ron paul liberty report dot com is that one of the best sites to to talk about
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.520]  yeah we concentrate on that although you know we have a hone school curriculum and campaign for
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:36.400]  liberty and and other sites but yes this is my outlet this is my effort to reach more people the
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:44.320]  ron paul uh liberty report dot com and our growth is very significant and uh i'm excited about it
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.920]  but we still have a ways to go but uh absolutely look at what are the various organization if you
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:54.400]  look at the line of growth uh it's in the in the liberty report and that's where i put a lot of
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.560]  my efforts right now ron paul liberty report dot com folks absolutely key to get those articles
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.840]  and videos out to everybody now speaking of this you of course are a retired gynecologist
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.760]  and you also delivered babies i guess that's an obstetrician uh correct me if i'm wrong sir
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.760]  and i know that you even you know famously without trying to get attention but it's well known would
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.800]  go and work basically for free in the charity hospitals i mean you're a real Hippocratic oath
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.360]  type doctor and so many people that you delivered and so many families that you helped you know have
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.920]  have spoken out in your campaigns about the great job you've done a true servant i know
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.800]  you don't like folks that he prays on you but you are uniquely positioned to speak about obama care
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:38.080]  and also about uh things happening with men and women's issues so just briefly the alamo draft
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:43.120]  house as you know is a texas chain based here in austin texas i know the owner of it the founder of it
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.680]  they have been convinced it's in kxan that they're new theaters to just have one giant bathroom
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.840]  where men and women both use urinals that's in kxan nbc i'm not kidding and i've got the
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.880]  state department and cia reports that we've done articles back from 30 years ago about how they wanted
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.240]  to merge men and women together to basically break down the family and i have another article here
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.120]  out of national review uh where they came out and said we need to get rid of the family you
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.120]  shouldn't read to your children at night that you know that advances them too much i know this all
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.560]  sounds crazy but we're putting it on screen folks this is meant to create division hysteria
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:26.640]  insanity infighting in my view and and the article actually has the owner saying we want to do this
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.320]  let me read the quote then i'll go back to you sir but i wanted to give you this uh info so you
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:38.480]  could respond to it he said uh this design will hopefully eliminate conflict so let me ask you
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.200]  dr paul as a doctor what do you think all this transgender stuff's about it i mean i know you're
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.840]  not a hater i'm not a hater we're libertarians these aren't our issues but what is this because
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.480]  this is all they talk about it's all that seems to be going on and now they say if it goes well
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.200]  if this new theater they're gonna do it at the theaters i go to with my family i cannot go
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.560]  with my daughters and lead them into a bathroom with women i'm sorry squatting over urinals what
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:11.840]  is what is this sir this sounds like mental illness to me doctor right and uh and they're
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.640]  they're they're determined and this is social turmoil but uh it's come about because we've
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.960]  lost the sense of uh private property because the property owner should make all these these
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:27.280]  decisions but uh this this is something that is absolutely absurd but you know if they win
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.920]  with this presentation and the people go along with it because they have been coerced and and
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:39.920]  bribed into it the principle is the government gives you money and and then all the states
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.240]  and local communities grab the money so in education different things schools they take the money
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:48.080]  and the reason why they go along with the laws if you don't do it exactly is what we tell you
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.680]  you know they did this the speed limits and everything else they put out the carrot there
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.760]  and they say we're going to take it away from you unless you go along with it so then the
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.440]  politicians go along with it and the people get frightened oh it's going to cost a lot more a lot
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:06.640]  more liberty doesn't mean anything at all so this this is the this is the real problem that we have
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.000]  but if they win and we don't wake up enough people and there's not enough fighting back on
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.640]  legal terms at the same time using boycotts they they shouldn't get blamed for this we the people
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.840]  have to get blamed for this because we go along with this and we have indoctrinated our own people
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.120]  to say oh this is the right thing to do this is good and if if you don't go along with it you're
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:33.600]  a bigot well maybe if you don't go along with it you believe in private property we don't grant
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.360]  people these rights because in our house to come in and use our house and live there and use the
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:45.440]  bathroom so we we write all the rules but a business is private property or do they get to
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.920]  write their own rules no we gave up on that a long time ago because they said we'd be bigots if we
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:56.400]  got to write our own rules so this is the whole problem the answers can be found in private property
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:03.040]  and volunteerism in cooperation with with two people no matter whether it's a social or economic
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:10.720]  issue but your expert view concurs best with what i said that this is just turmoil clowered in
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.800]  piven divide and conquer if they can't compete with free market just create a whole bunch of crazy
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.320]  confusion because i mean in a lot of their own writings they admit that's their plan
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:29.120]  yeah i i think that uh and and if you look at the surface that looks like they're uh doing quite
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:36.000]  well uh but what we have to have is people to understand that a moral principle can be used
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.240]  to combat what they're saying because they want to grab the moral high ground you know uh we we
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.760]  we become the bigots if we even challenge anything they say they're supposed to be able to set the
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:54.480]  standard and of course uh for for a libertarian the standard is set no aggression against anybody
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.600]  else and it's your life your body and your property and you can do with what you do with it what you
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.960]  want as long as you don't hurt hurt other people but see that's been rejected but that is what
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:11.840]  should be emphasized over and above everything else rather than entitlements and uh corporatism
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.880]  and the financial system we have and the international governments that are developing
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:22.000]  they have to be challenged they have to be challenged you know through an intellectual
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.920]  challenge by ideas it can't be challenged with a little bit of token um political activity
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.880]  that's important but ultimately it's the ideas that count
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:40.480]  again former congressman ron paul is our guest ron paul libertyreport.com uh in closing sir i want
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:46.880]  to in a few minutes spend some time getting into your brainchild auditing the fellow reserve in 102
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.640]  years it hasn't been audited i guess it's about time now but before we go there briefly so many
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.400]  people contact me so many listeners so many people on the street uh folks connected to the whole
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.520]  donald trump campaign you name it and they say look we know donald trump isn't perfect i disagree
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:09.040]  with him on his apple spying stuff and on torture but he doesn't want war with russia and he doesn't
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.600]  you know want war in syria he does a lot of good things but separately just that he's a populist at
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.480]  some level just that he's going after political correctness that he wants to audit the fed that
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.280]  he admires you i know he said some mean things about rand uh but rand said some things back to him
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.960]  i would love to see both men friends i know they played golf but all that aside is there any way
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.840]  that you could be given say a list of his policies that are on his site and say i don't fully endorse
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.760]  trump uh like senator sessions and others do but and session said he's not perfect but the system
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:45.360]  hates him he's a populist he wants better deals for us he's an anti-globalist the cfr hates him i
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.000]  mean it would just be so wonderful to see a purist you know dr know a guy with a perfect
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.680]  constitutional record like yourself i understand you don't want to now endorse him because you've
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:00.480]  got a perfect record something nobody else has but is there any way to at least highlight the
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.760]  things you think are good because i would love to see uh you know the whole ron paul libertarian
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.400]  revolution somehow uh you know at least talking uh to the trump populist movement
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.720]  well i think he's too much all over the place what he says one day is something the next day
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:25.040]  sometimes he flip-flops in one day and what he what he has said over the years so i have no idea
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.560]  what he believes in i don't believe he has a basic principle a basic libertarian principle sure
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.680]  that one of the one thing he does real well is challenges this political correctness so no matter
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:39.520]  what your beliefs are people get sick and tired of political correctness and that's very good
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:45.280]  but his economic policies are are all over the place when you talk about a 35 percent uh
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:51.920]  tax on imports uh you're looking for a trade war trade wars lead to bad wars so no i i think
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.720]  personally he's very much an authoritarian i'm not looking for a boss i'm looking for somebody
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.760]  will leave me alone and i and he hasn't convinced me that he'll leave me alone i think he will be
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.360]  the champion of the executive order because he has lived with executive orders and if he has
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:13.360]  the strings of power he won't be bashful and using that so that is why i'm very hesitant well i
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.600]  understand and i've had problems as well i mean what he said is basically that's the negotiation
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.960]  with china is a huge threat because they basically have a 35 percent you know obvious uh a tariff
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.040]  internally on us with their currency and some of the things they do and that then there would be
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.520]  a negotiation but i could see if people take the brashness that he is kind of being the man on the
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.120]  white horse let me ask you this then and then briefly about the federal reserve audit bill
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.320]  why do you think the establishment on both sides is so scared
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.640]  of trump because it reveals how the deep state works it it reveals exactly what goes on behind
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:54.080]  the scenes and the most important part of their secrecy is the interconnection of all the central
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.480]  banks and the arrangements that we make especially during the bailout period oa and o9 that is the
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.960]  part that they keep very secret but over the years even all the way back to right patman days and
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.360]  gonzalez's day the populace type democrat they were always stopped because they did not want to reveal
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:17.280]  what goes on internationally and that may that ties this globalism together because if you control
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.880]  the money you can control the politics of it so uh that is the most important thing it would reveal
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:28.000]  the individuals the political interests that benefit so there are financial interests the
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.920]  bankers interest but there's foreign governments and foreign central banks and corporations they
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.240]  all benefit and they don't sure do you think they're against trump because the audit is very
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.480]  very important sure sure how do we get your audit the fed bill passed i know it's very very close
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.720]  who's against it well i was saying i mean that may be one reason well yeah i i don't know
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.160]  yeah i i have no idea whether that's uh important i i don't i don't think it's i don't think it's
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.840]  uh known to be an issue in this campaign if you go out and talk to a couple thousand sure i understand
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.520]  let's briefly then in 60 seconds talk about it but but auditing the fed we're very close to getting
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:15.840]  your dream done correct well audit the fed is doing well we're we're getting a long way on it but
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.680]  campaign for liberty uh our our other group works on that constantly we've had several votes because
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.640]  we stirred up the population and they told their congressman we want you to vote for audit the
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.600]  fed has been very very successful we because we always win the votes overwhelmingly in the house
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.840]  in the senate's a different story rand's gotten the vote once in the senate he got a majority vote
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.240]  but they closed them out you know by closure so we haven't passed in the senate we have a long way
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:47.040]  to go and right now i don't think that uh any republican or democrat that's about running
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.360]  even in this past year other than ran would actually allow the audit to occur because uh you
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.720]  know there's too much tied in trump trump doesn't think the interest rate should ever raise he loves
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.880]  he loves the idea that the fed has a great time to zero percent because his business deals depend
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.640]  on that so anyway uh no i i don't think we're on the verge of passing it but we're on the verge
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.920]  of getting a lot more attention and when this thing comes apart the fed has to be the big issue
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.840]  that's how all this globalism and big government has been financed and that is through uh through
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.160]  the monetary system amazing amazing doctor that of course i think is uh one of the places where
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.680]  we've had had an amazing amazing that much success congratulations 30 years positioning it so the guys
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.520]  that hijacked the country get the blame when it comes down and we're almost there thank you so much
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:43.280]  for your time ron paul liberty report dot com thank you doctor thank you all right he did a pretty
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.360]  good job with three second delay all right folks we'll be back stay with us that was dr ron paul
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:54.720]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:30:04.080]  there's rumors that bernie sanders and donald trump might have a debate well we can debate on
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.920]  whether or not that's gonna happen but what i can tell you is that trump has reached the
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.640]  delegate number needed to quench the g.o.p nomination donald trump has reached that number
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.600]  securing his status as a presumptive republican nominee and avoiding a contested convention
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.880]  according to a delegate count released thursday by the associated press the ap reports that
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:30.960]  trump has reached 1238 delegates put over the 1237 needed to win the nomination by a small number of
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.840]  the party's unbound delegates who said they would support him at the convention trump will most
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:41.200]  likely add more delegates to his total giving him a very comfortable victory trump's achievement
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:46.160]  marks the completion of a primary campaign that has defied multiple predictions of failure from
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.360]  political commentators and now sets the stage for a bitterfall campaign against likely democratic

[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:26.000]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:51.040]  i'm gonna be honest with everybody
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.680]  i get angry on air and it's real when i get angry but it's kind of like letting the dog off the
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:04.320]  leash so you can say it's it's fake in that i'm allowing myself to do it but that's kind of like
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.520]  saying you know if you have sexual woman uh you know it's fake because you let yourself do it i
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.560]  mean it's it's it's not fake or it's like if you let yourself go swim in the ocean it's not fake but
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.880]  when i blow up when i start yelling and screaming i'm allowing myself to do it and it is a way of
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:27.360]  venting but it's real not earlier today i i got so flipped out not even that angry on air but
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:31.600]  physically angry that i want to leave right now but i'm not going to do it i'm going to
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.400]  breathe and i'm going to settle down and everything's going to get okay because when
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:40.560]  something hits you at home like a month ago i went down to barton creek mall where i've been
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:44.640]  going since i was in elementary school i'd come down here and visit my grandparents on the summer
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.480]  they take me to the mall it's an old mall i've lived here since high school i've been going there
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.600]  every couple weeks since high school i go to the mall and there's women wearing beekeeper suits
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:35:00.560]  everywhere i mean every turn i start hyperventilating and folks i don't do this normally i mean i don't
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.240]  do this back when i was younger when three guys were wanting to mug me i didn't start hyperventilating
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.680]  and i've got my daughters with me and and and there's all these middle eastern men and it's just
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.560]  culture shock that our government's bringing all these people in and these women were basically
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:22.720]  slaves i mean they get killed folks they try to take their beekeeper prisoner mask off it's like
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.800]  it you know gitmo they put a hood over your head that kind of freaked me out then leon mackadoo
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:34.320]  comes in here with an austin american statesman report and a couple others and a kxan report a
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:41.840]  tv report and with a straight face they start talking about we're going to get rid of men's
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.640]  and women's bathrooms and have communal bathrooms where men and women both use urinals and they've
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:54.160]  got a big snout that sticks out and the woman basically grabs it and it's all about dehumanizing
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:36:01.040]  us and they've got the owner of alamo draft house who i've known for 18 years saying this is to stop
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:07.040]  disturbances you're going to have i mean i'm not taking my eight and 11 year old daughters and my
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.880]  13 year old son all in there i mean we don't go in the bathroom with each other now it's been a
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:18.720]  long time since i went in bathrooms with my daughters because we like privacy you freaks and
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.400]  civilization and i had a panic attack i've never had panic attacks in my life but i've been asking
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.000]  people i'm gonna go to a psychologist i'm not kidding i mean i'm starting to have panic attacks
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.280]  where i can't breathe okay these people are coming after us and by the way tim league knows full well
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.040]  what he's doing okay the owner of the alamo draft house he knows full well this is social
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:48.080]  engineering and it's a sick joke now these people are out to get us okay that's all i'm telling you
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:53.120]  and i've had enough of them and listen i'm not never going there again because i just can't handle it
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:57.120]  people messing with me and and the schools saying they're going to teach five year olds
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.200]  that they may not be a man or a woman and don't use he or she this is an attack on humanity
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.240]  like it's space aliens or something just ending our biological process 90 percent of the sperm
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.360]  are dead or half dead fertility is plummeting cancer is exploding i'm ranting now i'm gonna go to our
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:19.680]  guest gavin mcginnis and i'll be honest i like a lot of high stuff over the years but i'm so busy
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:24.080]  i don't study the media landscape and things the last six eight months i've just seen his videos
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:29.120]  i saw him some before really love the stuff he does my son watches them turns out most of school
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.960]  watches them and not just because i'm alex jones i mean the school almost everyone boys and girls
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.800]  13 14 15 up to high school and then people i know they're 60 years old are watching gavin mcginnis
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.080]  and also the next host that's coming on with us that's exciting when people hit the zeitgeist
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.080]  but i'm like reading his bio and i go oh he's one of the founders of vice so of course he's a smart
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.000]  guy and i guess they sold after a few hundred million or whatever it was hbo now they've
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.880]  found taking a new direction but whatever the point is is that this is the real media right here
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.720]  and i'm not in competition with somebody like gavin mcginnis i love the fact he's out there
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.000]  bringing up different points different angles some of the same points because this is a war i want
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  to beat these people i don't want to be like glenn beck the guy that has all the answers and knows
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.480]  everything and tells people he's moses on the mountain i want an army to defeat these people
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.720]  i want to hit them from every angle because it gets to me personally they'll be with us 30 minutes
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.640]  to the next hour and then anthony kimmy will continue on for another 30 minutes but the the
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:30.880]  two will be on together uh in the next 30 minutes as well after uh after this hour ends but boy
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.680]  it is just crazy the amount of news they're saying they want to get rid of the grading system
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:44.720]  and get rid of a below c minus now they always propose that they're doing it now uh they are
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.440]  announcing that they want to get rid of parents reading their children at night and because the
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:55.440]  family's bad they're actually saying it on abc news i've got those articles gavin made a great
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.000]  point he's on with uh paul watson last week i appreciate him joining us again this week i had
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:06.480]  to take up a family matter and paul sat in he made a great point he said they just want to blow up
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:11.520]  civilization because they can't compete with normal free market civilization that's it these people
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.680]  know what they're doing and i want to ask gavin a question how high up though i mean we know the
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.640]  top engineers know this they write white papers on it in textbooks this is admitted they have abc
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.320]  news interviews now but how low down in the strata of the average trendy authoritarian middle patient
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:34.160]  cult member uh liberal do they realize this is about destroying civilization uh gavin um you've
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:40.880]  got compound media dot com twitter is a gavin underscore mc i innes we salute your wonderful
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:47.440]  work you've got the gavin mcginnis show uh that is on uh eastern time uh many days right up against us
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.560]  at the same time which i think is just wonderful because i could care less just attack on all fronts
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.680]  thanks for popping in with us today gavin what is going on here well here's the big question is
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:06.160]  is how much of this sabotage has an agenda like what are they trying to do and of course there's
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:11.520]  the theory that it's it's all about uh destroying civilization destroying western cultures so they
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:17.920]  can rebuild something new but i'm starting to think that what's really going on here is just sabotage
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:24.560]  like i i think george soros's grandfather or sorry father was on his death bed he just said to george
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:32.080]  just go make a huge mess and then he died and george went all right i'm just going to throw money
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:39.600]  at sabotage i don't think there's an agenda here i think it's just malicious it it's just
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:46.960]  malicious discontent i agree with you they set up a system to rot the sub mass to make a servile
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:52.720]  idiots but it's affecting them in blowback and now the program has gotten out like zombies out of
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.720]  the underground base and it's just wreaking havoc where the most radical stupid ones are now commanders
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:04.400]  as they have taxpayer funded systems dumping drano in their eyes and having taxpayers pay for them
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.480]  in their arms and legs chopped off to live in little boxes and folks if you're a new viewer
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:16.000]  this is the new trendy stuff to do i mean how far will it go gavin well uh it will go until we
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.640]  discipline them it's almost like a crazy girlfriend that wants to get slapped and i've noticed when
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:26.080]  i'm in uh my community which is hipstersville brooklyn i live in lambsburg and when i wear my
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:33.040]  trump shirt i've noticed there's this strange sort of capitulation where they sort of bow their heads
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:40.080]  and accept that i am the alpha in this situation so i think that these far left nutbars that are
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.680]  sabotaging our culture don't really want to sabotage it it's like a child acting out and you know
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.360]  they're betas that want to be put in their place they want a time out and it's our job to do that
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.840]  and that's what we're doing with compound media that's what you're doing and if we're saying i know
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:02.880]  you want to get slapped here's a slap sometimes a girl needs a good smack which i don't actually
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.000]  believe in that but that's that's a famous quote from uh shon khanry go ahead sorry yeah they really
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.760]  honestly don't want to take over and look at what they do too they say okay uh i don't like the
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.040]  patriarchy i don't like white males i don't like cysts whatever we're called this week and they go
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.640]  and you go all right because guys are pretty unsist white males are pretty open minded we go
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:30.160]  all right well what do you got maybe i do suck and they go it's called sharia law and you go
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:35.600]  that's what you're going to replace me with something that was me 500 years ago the sale
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.360]  and witch trials we're going back to that no we're not doing that that's what's crazy here is they
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.680]  don't have a plan b they want to eradicate western tradition they want to blow up conservatism
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.480]  they want to destroy the family the patriarchy marriage all that stuff and you go wow you must
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.440]  have a great plan if you're sabotage they're like no we'll replace it with caveman patriarchy
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.360]  with a bunch of inbred psychopaths cutting women's genitals off and putting beekeeper
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.720]  outfits on them and all murdering each other why is the left so in love with radical jihadists
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:14.000]  because they feel guilty that they haven't done anything with their lives and it makes them feel
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.520]  bad about themselves and who makes you feel bad about yourself your dad so all my anger is now
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:25.520]  going to be directed towards daddy everyone who looks like dad is evil and i'm going to discredit
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:33.520]  dad so i don't feel bad that i took mass calm at nyu and put myself 60 000 in debt exactly
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.720]  they've got worthless educations and now they've weaponized it to make people so mentally ill and
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.680]  so confused and and and you know obsessed with brown paper bags or that somebody's having a costume
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:49.600]  party that they don't realize they've been totally screwed over exactly the lunatics want to run the
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:55.920]  asylum but we're telling them trust me if i let you run the asylum you're all gonna die piggy's
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:01.600]  gonna get the conch shell like in lord of the flies and he's gonna get brained with a big rock trust
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:07.440]  me you're better off with me in charge because i've been doing this for a quarter of a million years
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:13.440]  that is what's crazy though where they're leading us is road warrior with like uh
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:19.600]  literal warlords driving around armored vehicles with heads mounted on the front with women and
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.880]  bikinis and chains with slayer playing i mean that's where this goes in like 10 years if they
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:30.160]  keep going this direction it is and the fact that bernie sanders is so popular do you know
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:37.200]  what socialists do to gays do you know what these totalitarians do to to creative types to artists
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:44.880]  to comedians you know you'll be the first to go i they like me islamist like islamophobes like me
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:51.600]  because we have balls we're alphas the first to go is the gays and the artists and you not you
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:57.200]  elix jones but you the guy who is pro islam i mean we just had eagles of death metal they were oh
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:03.920]  yeah let's talk about that 89 people killed at that concert right the the guy the singer of the band
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:11.040]  he says to me that he's suspicious of the security suspicious of islam he's suspicious of arab's
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:17.360]  arab money and now he's backtracking because it's killing his band they're having shows canceled
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:22.320]  because they dared to question the narrative and what's fantastic about it is in the interview he
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.440]  said to me you ever read george orwell you ever read animal farm he goes as soon as someone questions
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:34.880]  the narrative they all become bleeding sheep and then after saying that exactly what he said happens
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:41.120]  the bleeding sheep start canceling the shows and now jesse hues is a pariah he's actually mad at me
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.880]  we're not friends anymore because i got him in this mess and i go don't get mad at me get mad at
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.640]  the man they're the ones going after your free speech oh we're so sorry that radical jahadi came
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.600]  and shot everybody was but you know all this garbage no no no now that he didn't that everybody
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:01.520]  didn't grovel properly he's got to have his shows canceled a woman stepped in front of him she got
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:08.800]  shot in the face her jaw exploded she's dead he had shrapnel of teeth and bone in his face
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:14.240]  he had to get stitches they had to pull teeth out of his face and we are sitting here telling him
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.680]  that we quote unquote disagree that's what the promoter said who canceled their show at rock on
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:25.200]  sin which is like the kitchen is the victim the west is the victim the free speech is the victim
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.160]  and it's the west that empowered women and opened everything up i mean i could put it on screen
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:38.480]  bbc communist china kills gay men all these countries kill them but then we're supposed to
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:44.000]  sit here and and then let pedophiles have access to our kids or we're homophobic well you know what's
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:50.320]  really going on here is the socialist the communist the far left when they notice a pattern they commit
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:56.320]  genocide so that's why they're so petrified of noticing a pattern of any sort of discussion of
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:02.160]  eugenics or biology or any kind of pattern because they've noticed their boys stall in their boy
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:09.040]  pole pot their boy hitler they tend to exterminate the people that notice a pattern us here on the
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.080]  right with the libertarians we go we notice a pattern we just discuss it we don't kill anyone
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:19.360]  that's what's crazy about the left and the right we all have our opinions but the left enforces
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:24.160]  their opinions to a fault the right just sits there going hmm i've noticed a pattern here
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:29.680]  that's interesting and they let meritocracy take over if you're tall and you're good at basketball
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.600]  you're in the nba the end well that's right in fact uh they're now uh i'm sure you saw the
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.200]  national review article i mentioned it where they're talking to this professor on abc news like
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.400]  it's normal going well it's very bad to read to your kids because other people don't read
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.160]  to their kids and it's bad to have private school and you know families actually say
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.600]  family's something we're not going to get rid of quite yet but you know the state will allow it for
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.520]  now but we're phasing it out with a straight face well then it's wrong then if you're a seven foot
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.560]  tall black guy named lebron james because you know the lollipop guild can't beat you at basketball
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:08.480]  it's just a war on it's funny you know info wars what what do we want we want information we just
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.760]  want an open discourse they want to shut down discourse and i think it's based on revenge
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.800]  it's based on spike and there's the indian child welfare act i had this this uh lauren
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:24.080]  mcgill on my show the other day and this six-year-old girl lexie page she's 1.4
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:30.400]  percent chalk talk and she was ripped from her foster family her white foster family at six years old
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:37.200]  torn from them and thrown to some other family who's loosely related to chalk does through marriage
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:43.120]  and the indian child welfare act ruin this family i mean destroyed her siblings this this poor girl's
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:48.880]  siblings are having seizures because they're so traumatized by this event and why are we doing it
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:55.360]  it's not to make a to reunite an indian family it's not to right any wrong it's just pure revenge
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:01.040]  and this spiteful horrible act is taking white guilt and punishing this family because of what
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.800]  we did in the past yes it was terrible what we do with the indians we separated families that was
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:11.040]  terrible but to to create legislation that it's just pure revenge it's sick and twisted and you
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:17.760]  know who suffers lexie page exactly it's all about social engineering gabin mcganis is our guest radio
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.480]  tv host one of the founders of vice media we're going to break i want to come back and get into
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.440]  some of the you know angles and issues that you're looking at front and center but just briefly
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.600]  is it a sign of weakness in the authoritarian left and this orgy of control that facebook's
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.320]  openly censoring denies it is forced to admit it that the federal elections commission wants to
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:42.240]  you know regulate drugs that means us next i mean really this is so naked i'm surprised more on the
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.840]  so-called left aren't repenting and defending the first amendment because you could say what
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.000]  you wanted about the left a long time ago i'm a libertarian uh you know more out live with them on
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.640]  many cases but no they're just like no get rid of free speech we're taking over that's really scary
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:02.720]  yes well what we've had what we have here is a zenith we've reached full peak sjw and this is
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:09.200]  not their year you know that zombie song this will be a year took a long time to come this is our

[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:24.400]  the way i am the opposite of trend okay let's just let's just get that out there that i pay no
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:31.920]  attention but most people who are really trendy and cause the trends don't pay attention and of
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.240]  course i'm now learning more about uh you have them again as just as i've been watching for six months
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:41.120]  as and obviously you know has has a big buzz going he's had big buzzes before started vice
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:46.960]  that i was reading here he's known as the godfather of hipsterdom and then left vice in 2007 i guess
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.520]  because they were not not not truly hip anymore and that's my deal he looks just like the russians
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.080]  are the one that looked like the british king you know back in you know world war one i mean
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:59.520]  he could be a body double i guess he was born in england but look he looks good with that beard
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.520]  and that mustache he pulls it off he's the guy that started it like i was just googling i didn't
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.880]  know that but now everybody's got the beard and my only issue is if you can't pull it off don't do
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:14.960]  it but there's gavin mcginnis uh nicholas the second i'm sure that's not the first time you've
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:18.800]  been told this hey i gotta go to him in a moment uh because i gotta plug at least once this hour
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:23.120]  i already skipped a break with ron paul by our products they're they'll blow you away the best

[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.760]  supporting the broadcast okay gavin i just made the whole point about that you secretly
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.440]  are related to czar nicholas the second that's actually a secret i you shouldn't have mentioned
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:21.760]  that on the show that they're designed a man's face to cover the fact that you don't have a chin
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.800]  and you have aesthetic problems i don't know why we ignore that i look at rupert murdoch and as
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:32.800]  carl pilking then says he looks like a turtle without his shell if you're ugly well hey here's
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.480]  the deal i have not a weak chin it's actually my dad's a dentist about as big as they get it's like
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:43.360]  a bulldog so it's giant so i have a regular length chin but you're right looks like i have a small chin
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:47.840]  because i have a giant pumpkin head but if i grow a beer i look like a caveman you think i should
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:52.800]  grow one now that it's like like now uncool or what should i do by all means what is you've got
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:58.560]  kind of a rounded are you a slow fact are you eastern european uh no but if you mix like a
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.480]  brit with uh with german and then native american that's pretty much what slow box are
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.640]  that's where the indians came from was basically china huns over the bearing straight of the americas
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:14.560]  so i'm kind of like an artificial western genetic variety of us of a slob actually you're a homemade
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:20.000]  slob i'm an american made slob with no original slob but even older slob from bearing land straight
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:26.320]  15 000 year old asian yes well i i married a uh an indian and i made a bunch of indians
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:32.560]  they're very cute as kids i highly recommend them all right listen i'm running over you here uh you
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:36.560]  got censored famously or manipulated and i want to talk about this summer the next hour with you
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.320]  but let's start talking about it now on the daily show there's a new case of katie currick caught
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.160]  i don't know if you've seen this just came out yesterday where where she edited the video uh to
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:48.880]  make it look like they couldn't answer a question but they could okay so here's the assumption right
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:56.160]  wetmail patriarchy is retarded we're idiots and we're so stupid by the way that when we talk and
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:02.560]  when we express our beliefs the less sort of goes oh god here we go again with this idiotic mentality
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:09.440]  this is so boring and in order to purport that myth they have to take dozens of people doing
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:15.200]  hours of research they have to spend all this time in the editing lab and they have to edit in
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:19.360]  pictures of them going oh which is what happened on the daily show i did this interview with this
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.440]  guy about women's soccer and his contention was that women are getting paid less for the same
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:28.800]  amount of work which is just ridiculous women are not as good at soccer there's more eyeballs for men's
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:34.560]  soccer yes ladies you had a good year in 2015 but hold on get it back in 70 seconds a lot of
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:38.720]  breaks at the end of the hour i'm gonna come back finish this you caught him red-handed it's right
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:43.680]  because they're such geniuses that laughs always oh we're such geniuses libertarians are so dumb
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:47.760]  and they're the dumbest people they're minions look at the mark dice videos they can't even
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:52.800]  wipe their rear end clean pure drinking water you can't survive without it but where do you get it

[01:59:52.880 --> 02:00:22.560]  jones show we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio network
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:26.400]  all right we're on the radio format so a lot of our ads are at the end of an hour i'm sorry
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:29.680]  now we're going to break in five minutes come back with a 12 minute segment and we're going to be
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:33.440]  have anthucumian with the balance of the next hour with us but part of that is going to be
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:39.840]  i guess uh having both host on together and again the website is compound media dot com
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.000]  gavin mcganis who i just think is awesome i really really enjoy his humor it's a little
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.080]  racy for the am and fm crowd so warning there are some parental concerns it's adult information
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:53.360]  but that's what it takes to also reach out to the trendies and the liberals in tana
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:58.160]  the program but you got caught off by the break gavin you were you you were getting in the daily
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:04.080]  show uh taking jokes you made acting like they were serious and editing it together exactly so
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:09.520]  what they did after the interview they recorded a bunch of reactions so the guy i forget he has
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:16.400]  some stupid indian name but he's sitting there and he they record him going and and uh and then
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:22.560]  they edit that in later and at one point they said to me uh what uh names some soccer players i don't
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:27.040]  know about american soccer so i made up a bunch of names and then i go and then of course everyone's
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:32.400]  favorite a guy who's known to most is june bug and then i made it clear to them that that was a
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.960]  joke and they didn't know it was a joke the guy said oh those are some deep cuts and i go those
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:41.440]  weren't deep cuts i just made up those names it was a joke and then they made that the whole crux
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.880]  of their point was that i wanted to convince you that june bug was a soccer player but the big
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:54.560]  picture here is it takes so many resources and so much framing to make us look bad that they
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.760]  end up proving the opposite of what they're setting up to prove they ended up proving that we're right
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:04.080]  and they're wrong that's right uh well well number one nine eleven truth they would always
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:07.360]  misrepresent what i was saying i said criminal elements of our government are working with
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.480]  radical islam bare minimum allowed this to happen i had all these fbi agents and whistleblowers on
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.960]  it was a fact it's all coming out now but discovery channel did this hour long documentary
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.640]  that was two hours long they varied it probably a hundred times it's on all the time it was like
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:27.120]  seven years ago and i talked to a pat crowd at ut like 500 people okay but i've had crowds of 5000
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:32.080]  before but the point was they cut at lunch to two or three people sitting there eating sandwiches
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:37.920]  in the you know big room and showed me speaking cutting back and forth like there were five people
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:45.680]  i mean this is real deception if we are so stupid then why can't you ridicule us if you believe that
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:51.760]  jews are lizard people then that's easy to mock i could just show you you know a surgeon working
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:57.040]  on a guy we can see doesn't have scales underneath very easy to mock but if we are so easy to mock
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:01.360]  why do you have to keep framing us we just had this with katie currick where we see the whole
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.560]  video and we learn that when she said why don't you have background checks the people she was
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:16.320]  asking didn't sit there dumbfounded no they edited that in later what's crazy is what's crazy is they
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:21.280]  keep doing it even though they've been caught and their ratings are going down are they on a
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.560]  suicide mission what's happening uh they're lazy they have haven't been challenged enough that's
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:31.440]  the funny thing about being right i mean if you're a black conservative you are getting hammered
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.240]  every thanksgiving every christmas every time you visit your nephews and nieces and what that
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:43.440]  does is it's like training and you end up getting better at drawing conclusions from data and
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:49.600]  conservatives anyone right of center is so used to being challenged and questioned that we actually
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.760]  have become pretty good at the truth whereas the left has been so spoiled with their idiotic
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:01.360]  infantilized view of the world with the racist evil bad white man ruining everything that when
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:08.160]  they get challenged they get reclaimed they don't know what to do you're right they really are spoiled
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.560]  and they just lay back and act like they're intellectual giants look at trigly puff look at
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:18.080]  age screelex these are not these are not even the worst examples this is what we're talking about
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:23.200]  victims uh of this this system that gave them everything to the point now they have nothing
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:28.880]  why do you want to censor me if you don't like what i'm saying debate me why are they so scared
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:34.880]  of debates i have to fight tooth and nail to get a liberal on my show kurt metzker over at race wars
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:41.360]  who does a podcast he's a liberal him and his black comedian friend sharon small they have to
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:47.600]  lay out little breadcrumbs like a swirl to get a feminist on their show because liberals are petrified
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.840]  a debate because they don't know what they're talking about and i don't even think they believe

[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:13.200]  freaks though it's we're doing this leon mac is just popping in at the bottom of the next hour
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:16.800]  i've tried to ignore this because man i don't sit around talking about bathrooms i don't like them
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:22.560]  them hey you want to have unisex ones have it like the w but there's like 21 person ones please
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:27.200]  bring that in oh excuse me excuse me i i didn't mean to get back to this i got so much news to
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:32.640]  cover i want to talk about trump the new media censorship we were just talking you know earlier
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:37.680]  to the folks at compound media gavin mckinnon's one of the founders of vice and amazing i'd just
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:40.880]  call him a free thinker not even libertarian conservative just folks that are for common
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:46.400]  sense and civilization and anthia kumia who i've known for probably i don't know 10 years i probably
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.760]  popped in on one of his previous shows was one of the top ones in the country's been kicked off
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.840]  terrestrial radio because of all those rules same ones were under even though we dominate the internet
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.480]  too and then he got kicked off for making comments about black lives matter running around killing
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.880]  people saying they were acting you know like horrible folks which they were but that's better
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:06.880]  because now he's even bigger than ever i've gone look to the metrics uh believe it spins all over
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:11.440]  the place for what they're doing at compound media dot com and this is a war they want to shut down
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.640]  drugs they want to shut down everybody and when the head of the federal elections commission the
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:21.440]  deputy head comes out and says yes i do want to regulate drugs and these horrible right wingers
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.240]  what they're saying it's affecting things but but i got death threats well you're talking about
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:32.640]  getting rid of free speech you demon i mean come on this is what america's about what is your problem
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:37.680]  and so it's just out of control they know they're losing power they know people know they're a
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:42.080]  bunch of authoritarians they're panicking now the question is will they win will we just shut up
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:45.520]  now i've been ranting and probably dominating with you with uh you know gabin on so i'm gonna
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:50.080]  give these two guys just go at it for about 10 15 minutes before i get to some other subjects with
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:54.960]  them on whatever is front and center for them but i'm telling you this is an epic time to be alive
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:11:00.480]  and trump has got his problems but he's a nationalist he's got the power structure crapping his pants
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:05.680]  so much exciting stuff is happening he's going after hillary for all the murders and the rape
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:11.760]  and the corruption i love it and i love ron paul but i just wish he was on earlier i wish he'd be
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:18.240]  more pro trump because i'm telling you folks this is the nationalism we need let me just say
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:23.680]  anthony great having you on here uh and gabin's riding shotgun with us let me ask you what do you
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:27.680]  think of the trump phenomenon where do you think this is all going and what do you think the state
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:34.960]  of not just america but the world is right now i'm loving this i am loving it because uh it's time
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:41.760]  finally a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel uh that for over a decade i i guess it's been that
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:48.480]  we just have our freedoms taken away and freedom of speech has been a front and center on their
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:54.240]  agenda uh somebody on twitter last night was asking me do you really think trump is going to change
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:12:00.880]  things i said no trump is just a symptom of the change that's already happening you know people
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:08.000]  want change they've been slowly changing and trump is a symptom of that change so uh i don't think he's
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.400]  going to change things per se but you could feel it can't you you could feel their desperation
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:19.120]  and it all shows that we're angry he shows that we're standing up the sleeping giant
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:28.720]  yes finally we're looking and saying wow it's not all them dominating the uh the news and and whatever
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:35.040]  other alternative media is out there it's people that are thinking like we are and like the majority
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:40.560]  of americans are thinking we want our freedoms back we want our nicolas the second looks so please
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:46.480]  sitting there uh gavin are you i mean are you feeling the the energy of our age shift this is
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:50.800]  our year and you were talking about this with arty laying the other day about uh how he would
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.920]  fake his way on the job sites yeah and he would pretend that he could do all this stuff right right
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:00.880]  you know he didn't get in shit later on and this is what the liberals have been doing they said we
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:05.040]  don't want the patriarchy we should run the show and we went all right you seem to know what you're
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:12.080]  doing we let them on the job site and there's just been construction mayhem for seven years and we're
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.800]  realizing wait a minute you were lying you don't know what you're doing actually you know what
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:22.320]  donald trump personifies the patriarchy we're bringing the patriarchy back it was working fine
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:29.920]  wow so so both of you i mean both smart businessmen both smart media folks founded your own successful
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.320]  media companies you know been around the world in your gut you sit around the table talking to
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.680]  your girlfriend your wife or whatever talking to business partners where do you really think the
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.320]  world's going how do you think this fight's going to play out what are some of the possible scenarios
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:50.080]  that are positive but also negative uh anthony well obviously um on demand digital media is
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:56.640]  where it's at these days people don't want to be told uh where when and what they could be watching
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:02.320]  or should be watching perish the thought uh so i see it going that way which opens up a lot more
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:09.840]  freedoms of expression uh people to uh are able to uh voice their opinions and ideology without
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:17.440]  being persecuted or fired because your boss doesn't think what you're saying is good for the company
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:23.520]  uh that's uh there's a lot of good that comes of that and again i see this pendulum swinging
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:30.240]  and and i really do think that the the free thinkers the actual progressives which is
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:37.360]  hilarious that they have that uh term stapled to them uh will take hold again and we will be able
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:44.160]  to discuss things uh truthfully which is something we haven't been able to do for years but we can
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:49.520]  talk about uh violence in the black community we can talk about things like you were just saying
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.560]  with the bathrooms like people think you ever see that movie starship troopers where the men
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:58.400]  and the women are showering together and they're just talking about what they're going to do that
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:05.680]  day it's ludicrous to think that men can interact with women like that on that kind of level it
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:12.160]  isn't going to happen they're trying to squash can you imagine your female reporters or say
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.880]  yeah it's shower time let's guys you know my wife won't mind let me just get the shower with my
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:23.440]  reporter here yeah it's ludicrous i mean your wife would kill you alone i mean even the guy
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:32.720]  behaved himself of course nobody well and no one wants their children showering with some freak
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:39.200]  that doesn't know what sexuality they are this is common sense stuff that has been thrown to the
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:47.040]  wayside over the past decade and it's time sensibility uh comes back uh to our society but
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.760]  isn't it also proof that they're just trying to sabotage us there's no demand there's no
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.000]  problem here there's not a bunch of trainees going i had to go to the bathroom with a bunch of men
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.800]  it was horrible i identify with women that hasn't happened they just know it makes us bad so they
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:04.960]  get in there and with like a little pen knife and they just sort of twist it in the hole and go
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.520]  this seems to annoy you i'm gonna hear let's make their young daughters pissing urinals
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:18.160]  it's just willful sabotage they're trying to annoy us and i think it's because they have
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:23.840]  daddy issues and we're dead so let's mess with those guys let me tell you something alex i remember
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:29.840]  going to shea stadium when i was a kid with my dad and that urinal experience was frightening
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:35.680]  exactly how did you put their daughter now through the same trauma i remember going to
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.880]  dallas cowboy games at those urinals that are 20 feet long all these guys and like my dad goes go
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:46.000]  ahead imagine taking your daughter turn around honey if we're gonna do it there's all these guys
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.280]  i'm sorry i want to hear a woman going to the bathroom i'm still under the belief
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.760]  that bubblegum comes out of it little cubes of bubblegum i don't want to know the truth
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:04.480]  you just you just brought back memories of all the times i was horrified at baseball and football
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:11.120]  games staring into those old rotten urinals and of course all the men were also relieving themselves
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:14.880]  you know farting i mean i'm sorry but it was it was like a nerve gas room or something
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:21.040]  terrible and now and now they're like yeah let the daughters experience this wonderful
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:28.880]  no listen that's the crazy part is is is that um oh my god i don't even know what to say
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:32.320]  is it a plan or is it total mental illness i mean which one is it
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:37.520]  look they're like islam the left is insatiable and you see this with islam
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.680]  someone has a burqa on they've got the little garbage bag on their head and then she's getting
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:47.520]  20 lashes because we can see her purple socks they are never satisfied and the left is the exact same
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:53.040]  they say we need we need he she and it we need a new gender and then you check in eight hours later
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:18:04.560]  and there's 15 genders now 50 can't satisfy them facebook made 50 50 i don't think star trek has
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:13.120]  50 genders they didn't have 50 alien species right i think uh Gavin's absolutely right
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:21.600]  they're insatiable you never see someone one of these social justice warrior groups that uh
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:28.560]  actually finish the job they have an agenda and they go well we got what we were asking for
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:34.880]  let's pack our bags we're done no they go they find other things to get to find other ways to
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:40.480]  get on to your skin and get their agenda across at the at the cost of society right because it's
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:45.840]  all about class it's all about i'm smarter than you and i'm telling you what the word is this week
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:50.720]  like with black it was negro and then it was african-american person of color and so they have
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:56.400]  the lower classes constantly flummoxed going what is it now can i see that's our new we don't learn

[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:38.160]  at seven to nine while we have an hour of nightly news produced so info wars.com forward slash show
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:41.360]  some of the stuff subscription like the films and rest of it if you want to support what we're
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:45.920]  doing but whatever let me just read this briefly this is a london guardian with a straight face
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:51.680]  this is not unintentional intentional comedy the men who live as dogs were just the same as any
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:57.680]  person on the high street it's easy to laugh at a grown man in a rubber dog suit chewing on a squeaky
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:03.840]  toy maybe too easy in fact because to laugh is to dismiss it denigrate it ignore it the fact that
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:08.000]  many of us have found comfort and joy in pretending to be animals at some point in our lives and it
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:12.400]  goes in to say how it's a gay lifestyle or something here's the deal folks our government's
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:16.960]  financing people that just killed 200 000 plus christians in syria and rape women to death some
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:22.640]  of them five years old the headline 100 men rape five-year-old death oh but no one cares about them
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:27.520]  it's all about he he lives off government welfare and is a dog she poured drain on her eyes and the
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:33.440]  state pays for it now it's beautiful and if you dismiss it you're a picket we're beautiful and smart
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:39.120]  because we poured drain on her eyes is this a clive barker novel gentlemen we had like five minutes
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:44.160]  the same we're coming back with coming in it would really go crazy but uh Gavin do we just counter
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:49.280]  their insanity by just saying whatever we want and just i mean what do we do to defeat them uh
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:56.320]  anthony what do we do well i think we're doing it i think we're doing it and i think the just
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:02.880]  the sensibility of the majority of people that have been quiet for so long and starting to get
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:07.440]  sick of what they're saying you know who cares like you said who cares about a guy who wants to dress
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:13.440]  like a dog when there are real problems and that comes from the uk where they're being overrun
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:24.160]  by a third world uh moslems uh and losing this amazing history that was the uh uk and a guy in
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:30.960]  a dog suit like that that's the distractions they're trying to throw at us to keep us uh off base
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:36.800]  and and keep us from realizing that we're in big big trouble and next we're gonna have to make a
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:41.600]  place for them to be in the you know to be dogs i'm sorry go answer you hear these journalists
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.960]  talk and you go no one talks like that like you're in a bar or you see the comments on a website and
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.640]  you go i agree with all that that's how everyone feels and then you hear the media you think no
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.760]  one talks like that like 60 minutes on sunday they had a thing called inside badge and it was all
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.280]  about corruption in wall street every single person in the story from the prosecutor the journalists
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:08.400]  they were all indian but 60 minutes just plowed through that and you didn't notice it and you think
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:13.280]  what are your journalistic instincts i don't know why they were all indian but the the story didn't
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:19.280]  cover that there is a major war on western culture going on in london now and these losers
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:27.040]  some random gay dudes put on a dog mask trying to be interesting and they're not there is so much
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.680]  interesting stuff going on and the free market has handled that that's why we have compound media
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:36.240]  that's why we have info wars because the supply and the demand will inexorably meet
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:42.240]  what do you expect them to do to try to strike back i mean i know censor just get more extreme
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:50.160]  more demanding yet they're trying i mean uh they are trying and they've been pretty successful
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:57.280]  over the course of the last decade thankfully technology has made it possible for the average
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:02.480]  joe to get out there and and actually be heard by a lot more people these days without having to go
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:10.240]  through a broadcast traditional broadcast uh standards or or or the the typical thing you have
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:15.680]  to do as an on-air personality so i think that helps a lot sure but that's why that's why they want
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:21.680]  to bring federal control over the web you think they'll be successful anthony uh well they'll try
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:25.520]  i don't know how successful they're going to be it's very difficult you know one thing we've
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:30.720]  learned over the course of the years it's very difficult to silence people uh you could try
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:36.240]  you could do pretty well but there's going to be a point where people want to be heard
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:40.240]  and they're going to be heard it's exactly what you've been doing it's what we're doing here
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:45.760]  and it's what a lot of other people are doing and and it's it's our right as an as americans
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:52.800]  to be able to speak and be heard and listen to opposing two points and um i think that's going
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:58.400]  to emerge absolutely a lot you're going to see a lot more of this happen well i want to thank
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:04.560]  i think american culture is we left europe because we couldn't do what we wanted we built a new
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:10.000]  country here and the foundation of this country is do what you want and to try to strip that away
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.800]  is unamerican and it goes against our own biology and notice they're trying to attack us for our
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:18.800]  greatest liberal true liberal freedom we said live like you want as long as you don't hurt us
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:22.880]  they go we want to live like this but you existing hurts us living like this i mean it's just

[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:04.080]  there's rumors that bernie sanders and donald trump might have a debate well we can debate on
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:07.920]  whether or not that's going to happen but what i can tell you is that trump has reached the
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:12.640]  delegate number needed to quench the g o p nomination donald trump has reached that number
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:17.600]  securing his status as a presumptive republican nominee and avoiding a contested convention
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:22.880]  according to a delegate count released thursday by the associated press the ap reports that
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:30.560]  trump has reached 1238 delegates put over the 1237 needed to win the nomination by a small
[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:35.280]  number of the party's unbound delegates who said they would support him at the convention trump
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:40.800]  will most likely add more delegates to his total giving him a very comfortable victory trump's
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:45.520]  achievement marks the completion of a primary campaign that has defied multiple predictions
[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:50.320]  of failure from political commentators and now sets the stage for a bitterfall campaign against
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:55.840]  likely democratic rival hillary clinton and don't forget hillary for prison hashtag handcuff hillary

[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:23.520]  you got a lot of powerful monopoly men a lot of big combines they're set in the world government
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:30.240]  they know how to use social envy social warfare class warfare and they've taken our tax money and
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:36.560]  built public schools and colleges that are designed on record to turn people into basket
[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:41.680]  case mental patients and they've done it so they could prey on these people but also use them as
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:48.640]  big armies of zombie like drooling trendies to try to enslave everybody else it really is true it
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:54.160]  really is happening uh and the establishment worldwide is using the left as their takeover
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:34:00.000]  arm they have compliant people on the right as well uh but it's an amazing time to be alive
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.360]  and the answer is you getting involved and not being scared of these people and and and just
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:09.840]  speaking out because we are the majority of every race color and creed around the world
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:13.520]  don't want to live under all this garbage i mean the old Soviet Union they take your money and

[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:23.120]  kids they're even taking that away now because they just want us totally alone because their
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:27.120]  control phrase we're going back to Anthony kumia founder of compound media of course he

[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:26.320]  look maybe you're super conservative um and you like particular shows to talk about the new world
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:31.440]  order or maybe you're more libertarian and like this broadcast or maybe uh you're more of a social
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:36.880]  liberal but a fiscal conservative there's different type of broadcast for everybody but bottom line
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:41.600]  we know the people running this country want to make us poor and break this nation so they
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:46.880]  can dictate terms to us going into this world government and that's why i'm now more than ever
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.920]  i just beat this drum support free speech or lose it now anthony kumia i have been kind of
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:57.280]  ranting today as i do i kind of go manic on air but there's so many other topics that i'm sure
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:01.360]  you're raising on your show i know you raise someone to ask you now for the next 10 minutes or so
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:06.960]  before we got to lean in uh to join us what you're talking about on your show today or or why you
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:11.120]  think so many young people like your show because sure i've seen your demographics you got people
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:16.320]  that are 70 you know 80 years old listening got a lot of folks that are 18 to 45 listening but you
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:23.440]  also because i know have a ton of people 13 to say 20 listening that excites me because they now
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:27.280]  understand the oppression happening in their schools they understand that it's meant to make
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:31.920]  them guilty i'm really proud that a that a lot of young people are listening to that really scares
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:39.680]  the power structure yeah absolutely it's uh obviously going to be talking about uh trump
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:46.480]  clinching the nomination not that it was any question uh that he would uh hillary and uh those
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:54.880]  those pesky emails oh boy she's in a bit of dutch for that one but again uh people just don't seem
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:02.320]  to want to put any responsibility on her she's uh she they will vote for her they will support her
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:09.200]  no matter how crooked um or dissonance she comes across well what i think both of us like doing
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:14.160]  are taking these stories whether it's political or just some of these ridiculous entertainment
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:22.000]  stories or the distractions and go behind them a little bit see what motivates the the mass media
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:28.160]  to to put these things out there see what their motivation is i think people like when the curtains
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:35.600]  pulled away a little bit and you expose these uh mass media organizations for what they are
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:42.160]  they're spreading propaganda it's what they're doing constantly they're a tool of the government
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:50.560]  um and it's dangerous there you go pulling back the curtain to show the wizard back there turning
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:58.800]  those knobs uh i don't know if so many people are buying it anymore i don't think we're as bamboozled
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:06.160]  as we were just even a few years ago and it's refreshing to see that people are waking up because
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:13.440]  uh this this is getting very dangerous for our personal freedoms and um we we really need to
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:21.360]  be vigilant and and talk about it uh support shows like yours and and the shows that uh we have here
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:25.520]  that really is the answer just don't do what they say they're not our bosses they claim there's no
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:30.240]  first amendment there still is and just start disobeying all these unlawful directives from
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:34.080]  the establishment and there's no way they can lock us all up i mean i think we're reaching that critical
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:37.920]  mass i think earlier you guys made that point that just you know they tell us what to do we
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:46.080]  don't do it anymore just like the whole trump chalking situation yeah when uh when a few years ago
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:52.960]  it became fashionable to label us you know oh he's a racist he's a sexist he's a homophobe he's
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:41:00.720]  misogynistic that ended the argument because the people were petrified of those labels it would cost
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:07.120]  you your job your reputation or whatnot uh now people are starting to go oh really am i is that
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:14.240]  what i am today and they'll continue to talk because it's it means nothing it means nothing
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:19.440]  anymore and i don't think there's that fear that they're holding over everybody's head anymore and
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:27.040]  and i see that like i said earlier as the light at the end of this long dark tunnel um of restriction
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:34.160]  and fear that we've had hanging over us fear to express ourselves honestly um fear that we're
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:39.760]  gonna lose our jobs and our reputation and that's going to be on the internet never go away i mean
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:47.680]  i had to literally build a facility to to broadcast and be open and honest and say things
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:54.080]  i wanted to say without having that cloud over my head that i was going to be crucified for what
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:02.720]  i'm talking about and um that's how dedicated i am to not letting the the people that have been in
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:09.120]  charge for the past tech haters so get away with this i want people to be able to speak openly and
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:15.120]  honestly without uh this retribution you're in a fight you're in a fight for your life for america's
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:19.200]  fight you name it you're not laying down and we find when we stand up the enemy starts to fall
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:26.480]  look at this article uh obama world leaders are right to be rattled by trump i mean the communist
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:31.360]  chinese lecturing us about donald trump and saying he's hitler when they've killed more people than
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.760]  anyone else in history i mean it's just all these other saudi arabia telling us who we can vote for
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:42.640]  and then the president running around with hillary taddling to world leaders as if when americans
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:47.520]  get bossed around we're supposed to just bow down and i mean they really have miscalculated they've
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:53.520]  gone too far they've gone too far and people are aware of it and they're fighting back finally
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:43:00.000]  fighting back you know when people talk about donald trump and the awful things he's done it's oh
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:06.080]  donald told a beauty contest contestant she shouldn't eat so much candy and people lose their minds
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.960]  like this is the worst thing you could possibly do and then you have hillary who was using her
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:18.320]  personal email account uh to send and receive some of the most top secret documents uh that
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:24.720]  that's someone in her position can can get or or send and they just go oh this is a just this is
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:32.320]  garbage it means nothing uh it's a the vast right wing uh conspiracy again they they have nothing on
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:39.760]  trump they have things that he did as a goofy personality builder years ago there's no secrets
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:46.640]  ready to jump out of his closet we know about him uh but hillary it's obvious she is a liar
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:53.120]  she uh uh is is pandering to get votes which she has always done learn and now she's been caught
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:58.000]  lying repeatedly remember she said there was not even a separate server or email before she's been
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.160]  caught she should be put in jail and you know what people think she's invincible at a certain point
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:07.520]  the establishment's going to turn on her as well yeah i think we're seeing that we're we're already
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.640]  seeing that you're not seeing where is all that support for for hillary from people you don't
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:18.640]  really see anybody except her dopey ass husband uh that she's trotting around the poor guy let
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:24.560]  him sleep he looks exhausted uh but but that's all you're seeing as far as supporting hillary
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:29.440]  i think people are pulling away they see this change comment and don't want to get into the uh
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:33.600]  the wrong vote now anthony i want to shift yours for you because i mentioned this earlier when
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:36.320]  you're wrong but i actually want to show the article for tv viewers and radio listeners i'll
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:44.800]  describe it it's in kxan uh it's in a bunch of other local news reports uh and they are openly
[02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:50.000]  talking about alamo draft house a national chain that's now grown all over the united states and
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.160]  they say in their new theaters they're going to just get rid of many women's bathrooms all together
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:59.840]  and then get rid of most of the toilets for women and make them bend over and use a urinal i'm not
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:06.720]  kidding uh and this is incredible they're they're asking for feedback and i'm going to go but the
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:11.520]  reason i raised this is i i brought it up with gavin earlier what do you think's behind it because
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:15.760]  i kind of ignored this for years because i just thought it sounded so stupid but now i turn on
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:20.800]  tv read a newspaper it's like another world all i hear about is these oppressed people and so they
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:24.720]  need to be in the bathroom with me and then now everyone men and women are going to go into a
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.480]  big giant bathroom it's one thing if you have individual bathrooms so i mentioned this earlier
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:32.160]  and then leon macadoo's here one of our reporters and has the article she got upset as a woman
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.760]  i mean she can't go to the movie theater now i mean who's going to do this this is crazy town
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:48.320]  what do you think is behind this uh i think honestly uh it's to take traditional values
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:56.320]  and throw them out the window it you're taking look gender is what it is there are men and women
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:04.160]  the second you try to uh eliminate that you're you're trying to eliminate the basics of of our
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:11.520]  society and and what what keeps us uh together as a society what makes a traditional family
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:18.640]  they hate what is traditional because it's what empowers the people it's what made this country
[02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:25.360]  great uh based on what what the people in this country have done the more you can break that
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:33.600]  traditionalism apart the the the more you can kind of uh run your people exactly i mean if you can
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:38.320]  say that someone being a man or woman is hurtful to someone else might not identify that's saying
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:44.480]  my identity can't exist because of what you say you've invented that is the most bigoted
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:51.200]  anti-human anti-liberal thing i could imagine i just so freakazoid and they keep getting crazier
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:55.760]  by the month i wonder what's coming next i mean here's kxan austin and it's in all the articles
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:59.760]  alamo draft house seeks feedback on gender neutral bathroom they say their new design
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:04.560]  will hopefully eliminate conflicts you have to eliminate conflicts that's a little joke on us
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:10.080]  it's meant for conflict then it goes on to say they're a type of urinal both men and women can use
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:15.280]  it's new territory and they just and they it's a huge nozzle uh leon macca to describe this for
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:20.320]  people i mean this is what this cult wants us to be under now actually i can't even we're gonna
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:24.560]  turn your mic on guys or it's not better me go ahead go ahead leon i can't even make out from
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:31.440]  the diagram exactly how they are expecting women to now just rearrange our anatomy in order to
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:37.360]  make this work that women can now pee standing up like how did this all of a sudden where does this
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:42.320]  come from people are mental patients it's just it's it's like overnight that they are trying to
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:47.440]  completely rewrite how science works so when i have a baby someday and i asked the doctor well
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:51.360]  what is it a boy or girl and he's gonna say you know well well you just gotta wait till find out
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:57.440]  what it decides it is that's a good point don't point the walls pink or blue uh you just sit there
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:00.880]  and you wait for the government to tell you right well and that's the whole dehumanization
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:06.480]  thing because if they can take away mother father uh brother son daughter then it's all you're the
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:13.440]  legal you're the legal guardian of this human noid i mean it might not even be a person here
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:17.680]  eventually they might rearrange and they're getting us ready for clones they're getting us ready for
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:21.520]  getting us ready for body augmentation you see the newscast your kid will soon have a chip i'm
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:27.680]  over technology but but not like having a chip like my cell phone that tracks me anthony let me
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:31.840]  ask you this question when you talk to folks who's on the ground in new york or florida or you're
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:37.440]  wherever you're visiting folks i mean are they getting that this stuff's going on yeah but
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:42.000]  look at how all this stuff has been presented over the years you're talking about putting chips
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:49.040]  in people and children and it's always presented as a convenience and new technology to help you
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:53.680]  no one ever goes hey the government wants you to go to this building and have a chip put in you
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:59.440]  people go what are you out of your mind yet we've been presented with our phones which is literally
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:07.440]  a tracking system it puts out to the world what we eat when we sleep where we go our families our
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:12.800]  friends our political affiliation all this stuff if you told someone years ago that you would carry
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:18.800]  a device with all your information on it pictures uh all your preferences you'd say get out of here

[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:38.400]  and seventy thousand people missing the flights in the last year and how they're demanding more
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:42.880]  money from congress and the borders open and they're letting jihadist in so so we'll talk
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:46.720]  some about that but just finishing up leon you had one other point you were going to make the
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:51.040]  anything on the whole thing about women and being forced to use urinals and it's going to be weird
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:54.480]  man i already see you walking there's like women in the restroom it's like what the what's going on
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:55:00.320]  here well there's just a story in the that came out a saudi man shoots the doctor shortly after
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:07.040]  the doctor delivered his wife's baby because he didn't want a man to see his spouse naked so i mean
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:12.720]  how i mean this here you have people who are so terrified of having anyone see anything beyond a
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:16.800]  woman's eyes and now you're going to force them to use all the bathrooms i mean it's a mental illness
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:20.720]  saudi arabia is completely mentally ill and i'm beggin it for saying that no they're complete fruits
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:26.560]  the nazis were crazy uh the Aztecs were nuts people go crazy yeah why not admit saudi arabian
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:32.080]  people under this government are nuts anthony uh i want to get some into the tsa we were almost out
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.600]  of time but we were we were getting into all this and i forget the point before i went to break but
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:42.160]  there's just so much going on it's like crazy people are taking over yeah the tsa thing i mean
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:48.640]  not only are the lines ridiculous uh everybody that goes to the airport realizes there's gotta be
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:55.360]  a better way uh and it's not working i mean there's something like a 98 percent failure rate when
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:56:02.960]  they test the tsa agents with with explosives uh they never caught one terrorist so it's not even
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:09.600]  working we're all waiting on these lines and it's a dog and pony show uh to make us feel good and
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:14.240]  feel safe it's not working well i mean in europe you go over there now and it's mainly the jihadis
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:20.000]  that run in the security uh that hold that i i don't know what kind of psychopath you'd have to be
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:28.080]  to fly out of the gall airport at this point uh they have people on the airport's payroll that are
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:35.440]  jihadis i don't understand what you don't want to offend people you'd rather blow up at 37 000 feet
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:40.400]  than offend somebody because you're questioning i think that's it this is the global takeover of
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  limps i mean a lot of this is just capitulation it's like the germans you have seen the video with
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.960]  the jihadis on tv is the government minister over immigration and they go soon all you evil
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:58.720]  germans will be gone the germans clap they're clapping at their own extermination which is
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:08.000]  ironic but they are i i can't understand people that applaud and feel good about their their culture
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:15.520]  their history their ancestry being uh erased i don't get it well it's progressive and loving
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:19.200]  to hate yourself the truth is i mean i'm here to say it i never used to bash the left and i didn't
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.520]  like them but i was just more libertarian these people are demons i mean and they're mentally ill
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:28.080]  and and it's like gavin was saying they have daddy issues they just want to overthrow everything
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:32.480]  because they can't build anything so they see the civilization and they get scared by it like
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:38.000]  uh freedom what do we do bring out those jihadis you know put beekeeper suits on the women right
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:42.560]  and they'll wait to collapse our society until they can disarm us like well we're fighting back
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:47.280]  and the world is waking up and i just want to thank our guests for joining us closing comments
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:51.760]  saying i think it's great having you thanks for the time well when uh when you look at what's
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:56.320]  happening like at the alamo draught house and uh what we've seen over the past 10 years we're trying
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:04.240]  to squash people's freedom of uh expression and and voicing their opinions of it's doing the way
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:12.880]  with identity they don't want us to have an identity uh and traditional identities of family a man a
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:19.760]  woman the kid is a bad word you can't that's looked at as something terrible meanwhile when you look
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:26.400]  around the world that's what built it that's what built all the amazing things yet now it's a bad
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:32.400]  thing so uh all these little little tricks that you see they're trying to do away with people's

[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:35.200]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:39.280]  walking in in about four and a half minutes to sit in this seat and take over we did a pretty good
[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:43.920]  job having a fun show that he covers much news i should have because quite frankly it's traumatic
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:48.160]  to read 100 or 200 articles and come in here and try to cover it and you were getting into
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:54.640]  the assault on just being real being independent they're trying to domesticate us is what i
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:59.120]  thought you were getting at and i think there's a rebellion against that and once humans realize
[03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:04.240]  every race color and creed religion that you are under attack humans love to fight and once we
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:10.640]  know we're in a fight we start winning well that's why they outlawed fistfighting yeah when you get
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:19.840]  it's an assault on people's individuality too uh innovation people being clever people being
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:28.160]  unique uh that's it they want to lump us into a group that can easily be it's easier to lead
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:35.840]  a group of people than it is a bunch of individuals so that's what they're doing whether it's making a
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:44.480]  one sex bathroom or just squashing people's freedoms and and the freedom to to voice opinions or
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:52.000]  invent be innovative have ideas uh that seems to be the bad thing we we're in a topsy turvy world
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:02:00.400]  the victims are um are the bad guys the perpetrators are the victims and when they throw us off face
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:05.520]  like that it's easier to uh to guide us in a direction they want sure you've been super
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:09.440]  successful for decades in radio i don't know all the numbers i know you've been really big so i know
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:14.320]  you you could have retired right oh yeah yeah i could have retired a while ago especially on
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:19.760]  that last outing where i was fired for merely tweeting something uh that uh exactly so let me
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:24.960]  guess though i just see the buzz on the street i i'm correct am i wrong i know you're an honest guy
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:29.840]  are you reaching as many or as much or or more people now since you went completely independent
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:35.360]  because i mean i'm hearing more about you than i've ever heard so we're we're almost two years
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:40.720]  into this uh venture at this point so honestly i don't think i'm reaching as many people as i did
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:45.360]  on satellite or especially broadcast radio no no i was on a satellite not broadcast yeah
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:51.760]  oh yeah yeah um i'm sure we're closing in on it and and i see this growing this is something i'm
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:57.520]  very happy with very proud of and it is it's got a buzz people are finally realizing hey there are
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:03.280]  some places out there where people are speaking openly honestly without repercussions yeah because
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:06.640]  i just heard some buzz about your show but i'm i'll be honest some smart people mainly a lot of
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:10.960]  trendies and and you know they just like the the dirty jokes or you know training jokes or whatever
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:14.160]  which is fine with me it's just it's just everybody can have their own free speech but
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:17.600]  now that you guys are getting hardcore a lot of the thinking folks are paying attention so
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:21.760]  that's a good thing and i'd rather have one thinking person than you know two idiots listening
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:28.560]  yeah well you know what years ago you could shock people on the radio and that was our job
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:35.600]  now two clicks of a mouse or on your phone you're seeing stuff that would shock anybody so
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:40.320]  that's kind of a done deal i like the idea of coming on here and talking about things that are
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:44.160]  pretty important but you always kind of did that whatever i was on your show you were kind of the
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:50.240]  guy getting into serious stuff yeah yeah i was always the one that wanted to tackle some of
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:56.080]  these issues and you know people wanted to hear uh dick jokes but uh you know it kind of works out
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:04:00.800]  here all right well listen we really appreciate the work you're doing it's good to have more folks
[03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:06.720]  out there fighting tyranny and uh god bless you auntie we appreciate your time thanks alex well

[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:31.680]  percent of voters said that they had an unfavorable opinion of clinton another recent poll by the
[03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:37.120]  new york times found that 64 percent of registered voters do not see hillary as honest and trustworthy
[03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:41.920]  report notes that the prime reason for voters not trusting hillary is the email scandal these
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:46.320]  findings dovetail with the release of the state department inspector general's report on hillary's
[03:05:46.320 --> 03:05:51.680]  email which reveals that although clinton handed over 55 000 emails she did not provide any emails

[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:25.520]  welcome back to alex jones show i'm david knight in the fourth hour we keep adding additional
[03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:30.720]  things to the broadcast we've added the fourth hour tonight we're going to try something new as alex
[03:08:30.720 --> 03:08:35.120]  is pointing out we're going to have a ask me anything session on reddit with roger stone that
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:38.960]  we're going to broadcast live and of course we have that graphic that's up there one thing that's
[03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:44.800]  not on the graphic is it is seven p.m central time seven p.m central time we're going to have
[03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:49.600]  roger stone on for a couple of hours ask him anything on reddit and that's going to combine
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:55.200]  the best aspects of the internet and being able to ask people things instantaneously
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:01.440]  and then have a live response there that you'll be able to see on video now this hour we're going
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:06.400]  to be talking to john McAfee at the bottom of the hour he is one of the candidates running for
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:11.760]  the libertarian party the libertarian party begins their convention tomorrow in orlando
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:18.960]  they're going to choose their nominee at convention they don't have the primary functions or the caucus
[03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:24.880]  elections state by state they do it for the national party they do it at convention it's
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:28.960]  going to be very interesting of course gary johnson was the candidate four years ago he appears to be
[03:09:28.960 --> 03:09:34.240]  in the lead at this point but i think there's a lot that john McAfee has to say actually i'm
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:39.840]  i'm quite interested in talking to him he's the person out of all the libertarian candidates that
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:46.320]  i'm the most interested in because i believe that john McAfee is pulling the libertarian party if he
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:53.200]  gets their their nomination he could pull the libertarian party into the 21st century in far too
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:58.480]  many areas libertarian party is still debating the academics of issues that were with us 20 years ago
[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:04.320]  when i was active with them they really have not been involved with some of the key core issues
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:09.360]  that were faced with today things that are taking over our lives that are laying the groundwork for
[03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:15.520]  tyranny and of course that is primarily in the electronics area and surveillance area and the
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:19.680]  dragnet surveillance area that we've got so i want to talk to him a lot about that yeah he's somebody
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:24.560]  that understands that of course better than pretty much anybody else on the planet he's one of the
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:31.680]  international experts on security cyber security what is possible what is not possible and of course
[03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:37.120]  this is an individual who has been under the gun of the government he hasn't been a politician
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:44.640]  he has been the target of politicians that will make you a libertarian so he feels it in his gut
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:51.520]  just as lily tang williams that we talked to is running for senate in colorado she grew up
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:57.520]  under mal under the cultural revolution in china she knows what it's like to be a slave she said
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:01.760]  she's not going to be a slave again he knows what it's like to be hunted by the government
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:07.760]  and he doesn't want to see that happen again either we're going to play a report from alex
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:14.720]  jones in just a moment before we do though i want to talk about what we've got back in stock we do
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:20.480]  have supermail vitality is now back in stock at info wars life dot com this has been out of supply
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:24.880]  for over a month and of course if this is something that you use on a regular basis you try our
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:30.480]  products you like the products you like what they do for you sign up for auto ship not only
[03:11:30.480 --> 03:11:34.720]  does it get you a 10 percent discount but it makes sure that it never goes out of stock for you
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:39.440]  so supermail vitality has been out of stock but it is now back in stock for limited time only
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:45.280]  unless you sign up for auto ship also we have a super uh we have a survival shield x2 nascent
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:52.640]  iodine 20 off we've extended that sale that's our nascent iodine a great time to stock up on a
[03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:57.120]  an emergency preparedness item that you need to have a health item that you need to have and that is
[03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:02.960]  nascent iodine in your i guess you could call it your medicine chest or your food supply
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:07.520]  one of the part one of the articles that we're looking at today that came out which i think
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:12.960]  is very relevant to what we're going to be talking to john mackiphe about is uh this is a wired magazine
[03:12:12.960 --> 03:12:20.160]  article a car's computer can fingerprint you in just minutes based on how you drive isn't that
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:25.760]  interesting we're going to talk about this more after the report but i wanted to just give you a
[03:12:25.760 --> 03:12:31.520]  little bit of a tease of this the government or the security experts let's say they can identify
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:35.440]  you of course with a lot of different biometric identifiers they can look at your eyes they can
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:39.920]  look at your ears they can look at your face okay they can identify you by your walk now they can
[03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:46.720]  identify you an incredibly short period of time by the way you drive and just by looking at the
[03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:55.200]  way you apply the brakes and this has massive privacy ramifications for us in our lives the way
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:12:59.040]  the insurance companies and government will regulate us it's just the tip of the iceberg
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:03.760]  of where we're going to go but before we go to that one i'll talk about that in the next segment
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:09.280]  but i want to play this report because donald trump clinched the nomination of 1237 delegates
[03:13:09.280 --> 03:13:15.200]  today's how to speech alex jones breaks this down he exposes the globalist coup over america
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:21.760]  the elite and full panic here's a report the establishment is in panic mode like it's never
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:28.720]  been before in the last 24 hours the new york times cnn msnbc and many other establishment media
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:35.360]  outlets all came out and said we're in panic mode donald trump is channeling alex jones donald
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:40.720]  trump's getting his worldview from info wars dot com and any sort of conspiracy theory anything from
[03:13:40.720 --> 03:13:45.920]  the 80s the 90s or even beyond i think is just continuously stoking that but this also just
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:50.480]  feels very narrowcast to me and this really is like i i really think it's been amazing to watch this
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:54.720]  i mean you got alex jones i've been watching a lot recently he's like the sort of the sort of
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:13:59.760]  main conspiracy theorist is sort of probably the most popular in american life right now
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:03.920]  you know roger strung goes on that show every day there's this crazy vortex of all that stuff
[03:14:03.920 --> 03:14:08.960]  back from the 90s and dan burton firing a gun and you know into a pumpkin or whatever the hell it was
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:12.560]  all of that stuff which has been simmering there forever and judges stoked is now sort of
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:16.880]  exploding through the channel of trump and part of the challenge michael straight he's talking
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:21.360]  about the jfk assassination he's talking about clinton's killing people and rape oh my gosh it's
[03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:26.720]  so terrible it's so horrible what do we do well the majority of americans know the government killed
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:32.480]  kennedy it's over 90 percent in halts the clinton scandals with the mysterious deaths and everything
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:38.000]  are incredibly famous the term arkham cited he's talking about things that the majority of americans
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:43.680]  know are going on and what's happening is the facade of the matron media is falling and they're
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:48.080]  figuring out the facade is falling because when they criticize trump for talking about these things
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:53.840]  he gets more popular the tide is now officially turned they keep trying to turn the tide back
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:59.840]  and it's not working am i proud of the fact that they're saying you know trump gets his world view
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:05.520]  from alex shows yes but that's not even true my world view of how the globalist operate in history
[03:15:05.520 --> 03:15:12.320]  is mainly off declassified documents congressional hearings it was declassified in the 1960s and
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:17.600]  in the 70s in the church hearings that the cia put out the term conspiracy theorist to criticize
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:22.320]  even mainline investigative journalists that were exposing opium coming out of vietnam and things
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:27.200]  like that this is all happened they've been caught over and over again that's their term and now trump
[03:15:27.200 --> 03:15:32.960]  comes in amplifies what i'm saying what drudge report and matt drudge is saying and just common
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:39.280]  sense stuff and it's blown past them and their facade has collapsed it was always a facade but
[03:15:39.280 --> 03:15:46.400]  now it's blown over and trump is hitting a whole new demographic worldwide even if he was a sellout
[03:15:46.400 --> 03:15:51.120]  even if he's a bad guy which i don't think he is i think the guy's a hero he's doing a revocable
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:56.960]  damage to him this is an incredible time to be alive and the info war has never been exploding
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:16:02.640]  fast we're getting like triple the traffic we got six months ago uh it's just amazing how
[03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:08.160]  mainline our information is going mainline libertarians mainline conservatives mainline
[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:14.640]  anti-war patriots amish type folks uh folks that are into being natural and organic they're all
[03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:20.640]  awake but they were already awake i didn't wake them up i was just a prominent person putting
[03:16:20.640 --> 03:16:25.920]  the information out and organizing and and having great reporters like our crew and you the listeners
[03:16:25.920 --> 03:16:31.600]  getting the info out we're all a family every race color and creed part of this fight and history
[03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:37.600]  is happening this is the potential beginning of 1776 part two they're going to crash economies
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:42.320]  they're going to start big wars they're going to pull out the stops folks but we know that they
[03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:47.440]  try to use these crises both manufactured and real to get more power and that's why they're being
[03:16:47.440 --> 03:16:57.760]  defeated and the guys oh no not another one where is it
[03:16:57.760 --> 03:17:16.080]  how old is this kid how old is this get out of him still wearing diapers look at this kid
[03:17:19.520 --> 03:17:22.320]  tell you the kid looks like he's 10 years old i've never seen them
[03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:31.760]  it's unbelievable that's the youngest protester i've ever seen actually 10 crews at it for a
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:41.360]  young one also i've never seen anybody like that i trump is just mainlining what the majority of
[03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:46.880]  americans are already concerned about and we're tired of being lied to and the system is in
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:51.360]  full panic mode turning all these thugs loose to try to go shut down free speech rallies and more
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:57.600]  and that's only backfiring the system is so scared right now the bottom line america's culture is a
[03:17:57.600 --> 03:18:06.240]  conspiracy culture since 1776 when we were ruled by a faraway land by a faraway empire we were born
[03:18:06.240 --> 03:18:09.840]  out of not trusting the government and wanting a small government we're just rediscovering who we
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:14.960]  were and what made us great we've been occupied by multinational globalists that say they're
[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:19.120]  establishing a world government and everything from the new york times the financial times of
[03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:22.480]  london then we say we don't want to be part of an unlikely world government and you call us
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:27.840]  dangerous terrorists the washington post three days ago is this global governance at last is
[03:18:27.840 --> 03:18:32.800]  it one world the central bankers in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for what the
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:39.280]  central banks do of course we are we are absolutely slaves to central banks you people want to have a
[03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:43.680]  full takeover of america when you already see these institutions you want to shut down free speech
[03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:49.600]  we're not flat-footed we warned everybody patriots 60 years ago got the word out and now
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:54.960]  we held your system back for so long it finally is getting here you're behind schedule but people

[03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:10.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight of the next segment we're going to be joined
[03:24:10.800 --> 03:24:15.040]  by john mackafee security expert presidential candidate for the libertarian party they're
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:19.360]  going to begin their convention tomorrow they will choose a nominee over this weekend
[03:24:20.080 --> 03:24:25.760]  and i want to ask john mackafee questions about a wide variety of issues when he joins us in the
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:30.240]  next segment but one of the key things that i want you to understand is just how much not
[03:24:30.240 --> 03:24:34.800]  only the libertarian party needs john mackafee but how much america needs his voice in this
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:43.600]  discussion we are seeing very disruptive technologies coming at us very quickly growing
[03:24:43.600 --> 03:24:48.720]  so quickly that most of us don't really understand what's going on with it and we don't understand
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:52.560]  the implications of it let me explain this to you i tease us a little bit in the very first
[03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:56.480]  segment of cars computer can fingerprint you in minutes based on how you drive this is an
[03:24:56.480 --> 03:25:00.960]  article from wired magazine today you know they're able to identify you by your walk well how about
[03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:04.880]  the way you drive they say the way you drive is surprisingly unique automobiles have become data
[03:25:04.880 --> 03:25:10.960]  harvesting mobile computers yes you need to understand that the data collected by your car
[03:25:10.960 --> 03:25:15.360]  are whether you own it or whether you rent it or whether you borrow it can probably identify you
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:19.680]  based on that driving style after as little as just a few minutes behind the wheel this is a study
[03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:25.840]  done by a group called privacy enhancing technology symposium they're going to present it in germany
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:29.520]  this uh this july i'm sorry that's the symposium where they're going to present the study the study
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:34.080]  was done by the university of washington and california at san diego they say they can
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:38.640]  fingerprint drivers based only on the data they collect from internal computer network of the
[03:25:38.640 --> 03:25:46.000]  vehicle their test subjects were driving this is what's known as the cars can bus can bus okay
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:52.160]  they say the data collected from a car's brake pedal alone the brake pedal alone can identify you
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:58.720]  and they did this with 15 individuals and they can identify you 90 of the time after just monitoring
[03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:04.480]  the way you apply the brakes for 15 minutes if they're given 90 minutes to watch the way you drive
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:11.600]  they can identify you fully 100 percent of the time think about that just 90 minutes they can
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:16.880]  identify everybody after 90 minutes of watching the way they apply the brake pedals now here's
[03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:21.840]  the implication of this the researchers argue that the ability to pinpoint could have unexpected
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:25.520]  privacy implications everything from letting insurance companies punish the drivers who loaned
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:31.520]  their cars to their teenage kids to confirming the identity of a driver who violated traffic laws
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:36.320]  or who caused a collision but the fingerprinting study they say should serve as a more general
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:40.960]  warning to car owners about the sensitivity of data that travels across their vehicles
[03:26:40.960 --> 03:26:46.000]  internal networks those networks are not going to remain internal much longer the department
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:50.400]  of transportation the federal department of transportation is already working on standards
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:54.880]  that they're going to mandate on cars these standards will be identified later this year in
[03:26:54.880 --> 03:26:59.440]  the fall vehicle to vehicle communications where the cars will be talking to each other
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:04.560]  but those cars will soon be talking to the infrastructure it's called vehicle to infrastructure
[03:27:04.560 --> 03:27:10.400]  v to i at that point they are going to be talking directly to your government regulators your
[03:27:10.400 --> 03:27:14.800]  government minders your government masters because that's what they will turn into this is the same
[03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:20.400]  data that tells insurance company when you've let your 16 year old kid take the car to the prom
[03:27:20.400 --> 03:27:24.560]  might easily be used to identify drunk driving or a medical condition that's altered someone's
[03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:29.040]  driving ability they say drivers are increasingly sending that sensitive data to the cloud with
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:35.280]  gadgets like hum venly automatic and zube designed to be plugged into the cars can network via a
[03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:40.000]  port under the vehicles dashboard other obd two devices are being offered by insurance companies
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:44.320]  like progressive and metro mile that's where they gave you a little dongle thing that you stick in
[03:27:44.320 --> 03:27:49.360]  and say well we'll give you lower insurance rates yeah we'll see how long that lasts understand
[03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:57.200]  the cars like tesla are uploading this data right now automatically for what purpose how will this
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:28:01.840]  be used how will this be misused i reported yesterday about how the feds are flashing their
[03:28:01.840 --> 03:28:06.880]  badges on auto data this was a report from automotive news they said back in february before all this
[03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:11.920]  dispute that john mack if he got involved in between apple and the fbi demanding the information
[03:28:11.920 --> 03:28:17.120]  from these uh sandbernadino shooters phones before that happened they called all these automotive
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:21.840]  executives under quantico virginia to talk to the fbi their headquarters and said we want you
[03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:25.440]  to work with us and these people are very uncomfortable with this so much so that they
[03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:30.560]  contacted automotive news and said anonymously i feel very uncomfortable with where we're at
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:34.400]  one industry official said he said there's a lot of pressure on the auto industry to do a
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.480]  better job with security at the same time we're being told by the government you guys are getting
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:44.800]  better at security and that's messing us up they don't want security they want to know everything
[03:28:44.800 --> 03:28:50.080]  about you this is a big brother government and here's the bottom line folks they spell down this
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:56.800]  article your car essentially knows where you sleep where you work where you eat where your kids go
[03:28:56.800 --> 03:29:02.560]  to school where you go to church if you're having an affair you name it hey guys there are multiple
[03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:07.360]  ways it's not just your phone it's your car all these different ways that the government has of
[03:29:07.360 --> 03:29:11.520]  tracking you and we've had people like james clapper say oh we're not recording your phone
[03:29:11.520 --> 03:29:16.800]  calls we're just looking at your metadata that's how they get you that's how they monitor and control
[03:29:16.800 --> 03:29:21.440]  you and profile you and it could be a very dangerous thing if it generates a false positive
[03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:26.160]  and you get swat teamed or you get identified as a terrorist by these people because they don't
[03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:33.440]  like your political views they know your political views it's called human intelligence okay it's called
[03:29:33.440 --> 03:29:37.920]  geo intelligence it's called activity based intelligence and this is a broad spectrum if
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:41.840]  we don't get control of this politically it will control us stay with us we'll be right back with
[03:29:41.840 --> 03:29:54.480]  john McAfee we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.480 --> 03:30:04.080]  there's rumors that barney sanders and donald trump might have a debate well we can debate on
[03:30:04.080 --> 03:30:07.920]  whether or not that's gonna happen but what i can tell you is that trump has reached the
[03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:13.120]  delegate number needed to quench the gop nomination donald trump has reached that number securing
[03:30:13.120 --> 03:30:18.320]  his status as a presumptive republican nominee and avoiding a contested convention according to a
[03:30:18.320 --> 03:30:25.280]  delegate count released thursday by the associated press the ap reports that trump has reached 1238
[03:30:25.280 --> 03:30:31.520]  delegates put over the 1237 needed to win the nomination by a small number of the party's
[03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:36.480]  unbound delegates who said they would support him at the convention trump will most likely add
[03:30:36.480 --> 03:30:41.440]  more delegates to his total giving him a very comfortable victory trump's achievement marks
[03:30:41.440 --> 03:30:46.160]  the completion of a primary campaign that has defied multiple predictions of failure from

[03:33:14.240 --> 03:33:17.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show i am david night in this segment we're going to be talking
[03:33:17.840 --> 03:33:22.320]  to john mack if we haven't established connection with him just yet we're having a little bit of
[03:33:22.320 --> 03:33:28.560]  trouble with the electronics communication but of course the government's not having too much
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:33.520]  problems with that this is very key because we've got the libertarian nomination commission
[03:33:33.520 --> 03:33:38.240]  convention going on this weekend beginning tomorrow and of course we're seeing a spike
[03:33:38.240 --> 03:33:42.560]  with the libertarian party typically last year they were getting about a hundred new members
[03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:49.120]  a month was reported by the hill that in january they got 148 went up to 323 in february march
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:57.120]  706 april 1293 so 13 times the amount that they were getting uh average on the month of
[03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:02.640]  preceding year and that's just in the first three weeks of may now what does the libertarian party
[03:34:02.640 --> 03:34:08.400]  have it has 50 state ballot access that's something that is very difficult to do but they've been
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:12.880]  able to achieve that in the even more difficult thing to do because the corruption is to get
[03:34:12.880 --> 03:34:18.160]  access to the debates but that's something that will have to be addressed on a on a different
[03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:23.840]  issue the libertarian party is a factor because it does have 50 state ballot access and let me
[03:34:23.840 --> 03:34:28.880]  introduce john here a little bit i think uh this op-ed piece that he wrote for newsweek back at
[03:34:28.880 --> 03:34:34.800]  the beginning of may was very good he says i might be a political hot shot but i'm not charlie sheen
[03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:39.520]  he said um he's done a lot of things in his life and of course his biography here we've got he was
[03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:46.080]  employed beginning as a nasa programmer from 68 to 70 from there he went to xerox as an operating
[03:34:46.080 --> 03:34:51.600]  systems architect and in 87 he founded the company that is named after him mackafee the computer
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:58.000]  antivirus company he sold that for a lot of money in 1989 he went to uh uh lockheed began
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:03.440]  i'm sorry he uh 1989 he quit lockheed he began working full time for his company and eventually
[03:35:03.440 --> 03:35:10.000]  sold that and then he uh and as recently as 2010 he started new venture in the field of bacterial
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:15.760]  quorum sensing whatever that is we won't get into that kind of a detail in the weeds but
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:22.240]  you can find him on his website at be a libertarian dot com be a libertarian dot com now he points out
[03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:28.080]  he says uh i'm familiar with business having started 17 in my life almost all successful one of them
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:32.000]  now worth more than a billion dollars the fourth company i founded mackafee was sold to intel for
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:36.160]  more than seven billion dollars a few years ago i've started many companies now worth more than
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:40.640]  a hundred million dollars so i know a little bit about business mackafee went on to say corporate
[03:35:40.640 --> 03:35:46.880]  competition is fierce many view it as economic warfare but he says politics is something unique
[03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:52.160]  and so he talks about how recently he's experienced mudslinging where someone attacked him by comparing
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:56.880]  him to charlie sheen unflatteringly he says he admires charlie sheen as an actor he doesn't make
[03:35:56.880 --> 03:36:02.400]  any judgments about his reported use of drugs or his proclivity for prostitutes he says i'm a libertarian
[03:36:02.400 --> 03:36:07.040]  after all libertarians believe no one should live one's life that everyone should live their life as
[03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:13.040]  they please provide they harm no one else he says as to his alleged craziness i don't know him personally
[03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:16.800]  but as for me i've written over a hundred articles in the past three years for international business
[03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:22.800]  times business insider digital trends silicon angle forbs and newsweek if any of that sounds crazy
[03:36:22.800 --> 03:36:28.960]  then perhaps i am joining us now is john mackafee welcome mr mackafee thank you very much i'm happy
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:33.680]  to be here i'm very interested to hear your voice i think the libertarian party needs your voice i
[03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:38.320]  think america needs your voice in the discussion we are threatened with a lot of vital issues i
[03:36:38.320 --> 03:36:42.880]  think the border issues the trade issues that we're seeing that donald trump has tapped into i
[03:36:42.880 --> 03:36:47.280]  think those are vital issues but there's another vital issue that nobody is talking about and that
[03:36:47.280 --> 03:36:52.240]  is the big brother aspect of massive surveillance and there's many other issues that i don't really
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:57.840]  see candidates like gary johnson addressing uh four years ago when he was running he basically
[03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:04.560]  focused his campaign on government redefining marriage on being pro-abortion and on pot legalization
[03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:09.440]  which is fine except that those first two things are not even necessarily something that all
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:13.840]  libertarians agree on we had pro-life libertarians when i was in the libertarian party a lot of
[03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:17.280]  people don't believe that the government should have any role in defining marriage and when it
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:21.600]  comes to pot legalization that's fine but i think we need to focus on the broader problems of drug
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:26.480]  prohibition in general then i was very disturbed to see that he's picking uh william well the guy
[03:37:26.480 --> 03:37:31.280]  who has supported assault weapon bans he is to support other gun control measures he supported
[03:37:31.280 --> 03:37:37.280]  the iraq war 10 months 10 months after the invasion uh he's failed to oppose the patriot act as a
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:43.680]  matter of fact he worked as a dea enforcer for ed mce and this is a guy who gave us a civil
[03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:48.640]  asset forfeiture now he eventually forced ed mce out for personal corruption charges but he should
[03:37:48.640 --> 03:37:53.040]  have forced him into jail for giving us something like civil asset forfeiture so i'm very disturbed
[03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:58.560]  to see the libertarian party moving in the direction of having these career politicians which is what
[03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:04.320]  gary johnson and um uh william weld are in my opinion i think they need to be brought into
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:10.720]  the 21st century with issues like your addressing talk to us about the vitality of cyber security
[03:38:10.720 --> 03:38:15.520]  and what we need to do to protect us from the government well with your permission sir i'd
[03:38:15.520 --> 03:38:21.040]  like to talk about something far more important sure we're talking about issues but there's an
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:27.680]  issue that absolutely no one has addressed and that is that when white eisenhower left office in
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:35.520]  the 50s he warned us about something called the military industrial complex that connection between
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:44.160]  government and industry which would only cause greater power in both of those um you talk gary
[03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:48.160]  johnson talks about presidential debates if we don't get into the debate we're lost so he's
[03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:53.600]  suing the debate commission well we know that's not going to go to court until after the election
[03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:59.360]  we know how the the court process works so it's other nonsense at the last at the los vegas debate
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:05.920]  the pen gillette of pen and teller put together i did the debate like everybody else in my closing
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:14.240]  statement i got up and said what you have watched is utter complete nonsense fabricated by the media
[03:39:14.240 --> 03:39:23.120]  in the 60s and perpetrated by the media for the media and let me explain what do you have in a
[03:39:23.120 --> 03:39:30.720]  presidential debate you have opening statements and closing statements written by speech writers
[03:39:31.440 --> 03:39:38.320]  not the candidate himself you have a candidate that has been coached by dozens in and
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:43.440]  as a matter of fact i think we've lost transmission there for a moment one of the
[03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:50.000]  founders of the libertarian party was a speech writer for goldwater who had that famous comment
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:55.680]  extremism and defense of liberty is no vice and moderation and defense of justice is no virtue
[03:39:55.680 --> 03:39:59.760]  if i got that correct i may not have gotten that exactly right but yeah exactly right and uh you
[03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:13.600]  know so it's speech writers so the point is by buying into this media industry government complex we'll
[03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:18.160]  learn if in fact we elect these candidates we should move the speech writer and his coaches
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:23.120]  into the oval office yeah put the candidate out we know nothing i like carl hess even better than
[03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:30.080]  very goldwater when i met him so i i made the comment in my closing statement wouldn't i would i would
[03:40:30.080 --> 03:40:36.240]  sign a form today with every media outlet giving them the right to break into my house at six o'clock
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:42.960]  in the morning fill me in bed when i have a hangover or come in when i'm arguing with my wife
[03:40:43.600 --> 03:40:50.320]  or scolding the dog wouldn't you learn more no this debate structure two minutes opening statement
[03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:57.920]  45 second response etc etc is nonsense structured by the media with their gaps for for commercials
[03:40:58.960 --> 03:41:04.960]  and it tells us nothing about the candidates the political process in america is broken
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:11.360]  pure and simple why do you think donald trump gets the support that he gets he's not a politician
[03:41:11.360 --> 03:41:19.760]  now he's a dealmaker which is half of politics but but you don't has been tainted by and become part
[03:41:19.760 --> 03:41:28.640]  of that machine which is america's political nightmare so i'm not playing by those games and
[03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:33.840]  like i said i suffered the debate after i participated and crashed the debate and apologized
[03:41:33.840 --> 03:41:40.080]  personally to pennsylvania afterwards because i know he put lots of money time and effort into
[03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:44.480]  that debate and lost faiths sure i understand yeah we're trying to see a contrast and a comparison
[03:41:44.480 --> 03:41:49.280]  of ideas and it's just a it's an imperfect form one of the problems with it is that it's not a
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:53.840]  true debate and that's why you have these sound bites that are put out there because the format
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:41:59.360]  that we use is not like you would see in a college debate format where somebody's got a premise and
[03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:03.680]  you have a back and forth and they are able to engage each other instead they're asked these
[03:42:03.680 --> 03:42:08.000]  questions by moderators who have their own agenda and they don't really follow the issues so
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:13.280]  i'd like to ask you about some specific issues if you'd like to talk about that i'm ready go ahead
[03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:18.720]  okay let's talk about uh we'll get to uh the security issue but let's talk first about something
[03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:22.880]  i haven't heard anybody really talk about much that's mandatory vaccines it seems like that'd be
[03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:26.240]  something that the libertarian party would be talking about what's your position on that as
[03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:32.480]  well as things like mandated government health insurance obama care okay i believe and all
[03:42:32.480 --> 03:42:38.080]  libertarians and not just libertarians i think all people have some sense that their bodies and
[03:42:38.080 --> 03:42:46.160]  their minds belong to themselves i do i was born with it i think all kids have it um you may disagree
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:52.640]  but if they don't belong to me maybe they belong to my mom and dad but they certainly don't belong
[03:42:52.640 --> 03:42:59.360]  to a neighbor or you or certainly not to a government so when you tell me that you're
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:06.960]  going to stick a needle into a body that i own and vaccinate before my own good i'm going to say
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:14.800]  f you and get the f off of my property why because look at the realities if the vaccines
[03:43:14.800 --> 03:43:22.000]  do in fact work then why are people upset if a few people choose not to take them yeah exactly
[03:43:22.640 --> 03:43:26.800]  they're gonna get sick and die but it's not going to affect you and if they don't work
[03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:32.800]  then it was an improper move to force everyone to be vaccinated this is a non issue sir it's a
[03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:37.840]  non issue if we look at it realistically good good that's a that's a great answer let me ask you
[03:43:37.840 --> 03:43:43.200]  about um mandated health insurance for example obama care uh i wish i'm assuming that you
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:46.800]  would say the government would not should not be able to uh force us to purchase something like
[03:43:46.800 --> 03:43:52.720]  that what would you do with the health system in order to appease the things that people think
[03:43:52.720 --> 03:43:56.880]  that they're going to get out of the quote unquote affordable health care act well that's
[03:43:56.880 --> 03:44:01.760]  that's odd that you asked that two years ago i was on neil cabrudo's fox news and he asked me
[03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:07.680]  about obama care and i said well number one the website is a hacker's wet drink and he said i don't
[03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:17.760]  believe you said that but but i did um what right does government have to mandate anything did we
[03:44:17.760 --> 03:44:25.120]  elect this government to be our mother and father or our boss i certainly didn't maybe you did when
[03:44:25.120 --> 03:44:34.000]  our constitution was formed the government was a service organization george washington was
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:40.000]  pushed kicking and screaming into the job who wants the job of serving three million people
[03:44:41.280 --> 03:44:46.400]  yes absolutely and that's a problem is they they try to manage this and there isn't anybody that
[03:44:46.400 --> 03:44:50.400]  is capable of managing the lives of hundreds of millions of people there's not any bureaucracy
[03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:56.000]  that's capable of doing that as well oh we are living under a delusion they tell us the police
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:04.960]  are here to protect us well i asked you someone breaks into head where is the magic button that you
[03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:14.000]  put yeah exactly it's between it's the magic button that opens up my gun safe that's that's
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:20.560]  why that's it that's it that's the thing okay and by the way you mentioned you mentioned guns
[03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:27.440]  good lord we are libertarians i have not met a single libertarian that does not believe we had
[03:45:27.440 --> 03:45:35.440]  the right to own and bear arms and gary johnson picks a man who doesn't want anyone under 21
[03:45:35.440 --> 03:45:40.160]  having a gun who doesn't believe that our arms are necessary unless they're used for hunting
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:45.760]  holy heck yes well i think the important i think the important thing that you and i are missing
[03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:50.320]  there john is that he picked somebody who was a two-term governor that was far more important
[03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:55.040]  than what he believed about the second amendment apparently what you're saying being a two-term
[03:45:55.040 --> 03:46:05.520]  governor is a negative this year we are sick we are sick of of politicians and governors and
[03:46:05.520 --> 03:46:13.760]  mothers and anybody tainted and polished by the political process so it's insane as a matter of
[03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:18.880]  fact when uh reason magazine looked at gary weldman and uh our william welden talked about his
[03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:22.560]  uh tenure is as governor they said yeah the libertarian party likes to talk about how they're
[03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:27.040]  fiscally conservative socially liberal well he's socially liberal in a michael bloomberg
[03:46:27.040 --> 03:46:34.240]  kind of way yes and and that's precisely it yeah scary it's utterly scary so so here's what happened
[03:46:35.200 --> 03:46:39.440]  the libertarians have been around for a long time this is gary's second attempt to be nominated
[03:46:39.440 --> 03:46:49.840]  um what happened when you decide to take a slow careful step into revolution because read
[03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:55.840]  libertarianism is a revolutionary idea we want to completely change the way our government functions
[03:46:56.560 --> 03:47:02.480]  when you take these slow careful steps like gary and the party has been doing you end up with
[03:47:02.480 --> 03:47:12.160]  compromise all change of a radical nature in all of human history that is attempted in a slow step
[03:47:12.160 --> 03:47:20.720]  by step process has resulted in that movement being absorbed yes in the power there through
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:28.480]  compromise things that convention has not even happened and already we have someone who is absolutely
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:34.480]  not a libertarian running as wise president exactly we can't do that i i agree with you
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:38.240]  completely and i think that's i think you really hit the nail on the head what we're looking at
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:45.040]  here is a uh a takeover by the establishment it's not an advantage to have two two-term governors
[03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:49.840]  from a democrat state running uh for your for your party only uh only the washington insiders
[03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:55.280]  would believe that let's talk a little bit about the surveillance state is uh snowden a hero or
[03:47:55.280 --> 03:48:06.000]  trader good lord let's get real if a man comes to you do we lose you are you there
[03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:12.000]  ah i just wanted to get that answer uh we're talking to john mackafee do we lose them guys
[03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:16.240]  is he still online are we getting a little bit sketchy uh with his phone
[03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:21.120]  oh we just lost him okay they're gonna try to reestablish connection with john mackafee but
[03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:26.240]  i want to ask him about this because you know alex alluded to this in his report about the
[03:48:27.360 --> 03:48:31.120]  the church committee hearings the pike committee hearings they knew back in the 70s that the
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:36.000]  government was illegally surveilling american citizens that was one of the things that started
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:40.640]  the church committee hearings in the senate the pike committee hearings in the uh house
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:47.520]  the pike commission called the nsa chief and to talk to them and they asked to see their
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:53.040]  charter and he said uh i'm not going to show it to you we were created by executive order by
[03:48:53.040 --> 03:48:58.880]  president truman and i'm not even going to show you my charter that's the arrogance of the nsa
[03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:04.640]  in the 1970s it's only gotten worse they decided that they would go through and they would try to
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:11.440]  establish a law to control this criminal secret dark government that had been that had already
[03:49:11.440 --> 03:49:18.160]  created uh metastasized after about two decades so they created the faiza act that's the foreign
[03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:24.160]  intelligence surveillance act part of that was going to be a court that would hear secret testimony
[03:49:24.160 --> 03:49:28.720]  if they wanted to spy on somebody and it was a matter of intelligence they wanted to set up a
[03:49:28.720 --> 03:49:35.280]  due process case with that so they created a court in order to hear that in order to give the warrant
[03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:42.160]  now what has happened we now have this organization and i'm notified that uh john is back with us we
[03:49:42.160 --> 03:49:47.600]  now have this organization that is acting as a star chamber operating in secret making these
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:52.880]  dragnet surveillance warrants that are going all over the entire country as well as claiming that

[03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:42.960]  this is a vital issue this is a tool that the government is using to control us winston church
[03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:46.960]  ill said after he went to war with the germans the second time he said the germans are either at
[03:54:46.960 --> 03:54:51.680]  your feet or at your throat well you know what it's more true of the government the government
[03:54:51.680 --> 03:54:56.720]  is either at your feet or at your throat and the tool with which they will control us or we
[03:54:56.720 --> 03:55:02.160]  will control them is the internet and technology it's vital that we understand the implications
[03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:07.920]  of these technologies it's vital that we have somebody who has a libertarian perspective telling
[03:55:07.920 --> 03:55:12.480]  us the truth about the real implications of this and real quickly before we go back to john just

[03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:40.640]  we support the operation now let's go back to john macafe uh john i want to ask you about
[03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:44.480]  the intelligence issues i talked briefly while we lost contact with you about what's going on
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:50.400]  with the fires everybody understands a little bit about this but talk to us about uh what we're
[03:55:50.400 --> 03:55:56.640]  seeing happening you you got involved with the demands from the fbi for data from the iphone of
[03:55:56.640 --> 03:56:03.680]  the san bernadino shooters but now we've learned that they are also already leaning on car manufacturers
[03:56:03.680 --> 03:56:09.920]  to turn over all this information how do we control this politically well one has happened
[03:56:09.920 --> 03:56:15.920]  is the fbi and not just the fbi uh all of the government copers agencies and and many of the
[03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:24.720]  police organizations are attempting to gain more control over access to our private information
[03:56:25.360 --> 03:56:33.680]  the fbi wanted i the uh apple to create a special master key that only the fbi would have so that
[03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:40.720]  the fbi could open any phone well i've been around for technology for 50 years it was a
[03:56:40.720 --> 03:56:46.640]  software key you can't keep that secret for more than two weeks everybody in the world would have
[03:56:46.640 --> 03:56:56.000]  it yes yes so the government is overreaching in an unconstitutional immoral and certainly
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:03.520]  illegal way in attempting to control us because we what is information if you know everything
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:09.680]  about the populace then you can control the populace i mean this is the the uh philosopher's
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:15.360]  stone of every dictator and this is what our government is trying to do well i won't have that
[03:57:15.920 --> 03:57:19.920]  so when i offered to hack the phone i knew i could get a team together to do it
[03:57:19.920 --> 03:57:26.320]  i was really pointing to the fact that i knew the fbi could do it themselves which they did as
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:32.400]  they said with the help of a farm hacker which they paid 1.2 million dollars offered to do it for free
[03:57:32.400 --> 03:57:42.800]  yeah so it's so we are as a nation ruled by a government that is so powerful and corrupt
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:49.600]  it is out of control and the fbi was just one representative's sample of what was happening
[03:57:49.600 --> 03:57:55.360]  so i stepped in and said no i'm not having to ship excuse me i'm not having this yes absolutely
[03:57:55.360 --> 03:57:59.680]  knowledge knowledge is power and if they have knowledge of everything that you do they have
[03:57:59.680 --> 03:58:04.640]  complete power over they have power we're out of time i wish we had more time uh john mackaffey
[03:58:04.640 --> 03:58:10.160]  if you want to find out more information about him go to be a libertarian dot com uh mr mackaffey
[03:58:10.160 --> 03:58:14.880]  best of luck to you this weekend whatever happens i hope we do not lose your voice in this important
[03:58:14.880 --> 03:58:21.680]  issue over privacy and it is not only a uh legal and constitutional issue it is a moral issue people
[03:58:21.680 --> 03:58:26.800]  need to understand this and they need to hear from someone like john mackaffey who can call the bluff
[03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:31.040]  of these liars who are telling us we have to give up our liberty for security tonight info
[03:58:31.040 --> 03:58:58.800]  war is nightly news at seven central we also have a ask me anything session at seven central
