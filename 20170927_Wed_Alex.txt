[00:00.000 --> 00:21.640]  Leading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[00:21.640 --> 00:26.320]  GCN Radio Network.
[00:26.320 --> 00:34.000]  I said it on Saturday that the NFL was committing suicide and that at first they'd be arrogant,
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.800]  but then it would blow up in their face and that Trump had purposely drawn out the American
[00:38.800 --> 00:46.640]  haters so they could show their full, disgusting intent to the nation to awaken the populist
[00:46.640 --> 00:48.080]  sleeping giant.
[00:48.080 --> 00:49.680]  And indeed that happened.
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.920]  Judge Roy Moore just defeated Luther Strange, the establishment Republican in the runoff
[00:54.920 --> 00:57.640]  of the Senate and the Republican primary.
[00:57.640 --> 00:59.160]  That is a huge victory.
[00:59.160 --> 01:00.160]  It's all coming up.
[01:00.160 --> 01:08.600]  But first, national fear-mongering liberals destroying the American dream.
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.600]  Why is it that the president of the weekend is going after, or seemingly go after, African
[01:13.600 --> 01:18.560]  American athletes and then this morning he's putting out a tweet praising NASCAR, which
[01:18.560 --> 01:22.360]  obviously is geared towards a different demographic.
[01:22.360 --> 01:27.280]  The way they stand in respect and honor the flag.
[01:27.280 --> 01:29.880]  Is he trying to wage something of a cultural war?
[01:29.880 --> 01:30.880]  Not at all.
[01:30.880 --> 01:33.000]  The president's not talking about race.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.120]  The president's talking about pride in our country.
[01:35.120 --> 01:37.520]  We have a white supremacist president in I-6.
[01:37.520 --> 01:39.160]  He's encouraging white supremacists.
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.240]  And the fact is, and I know, yes, I'm going to say that, we can debate that later, but
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.240]  the fact is-
[01:44.240 --> 01:47.280]  No, but don't also throw the grenades, Keith.
[01:47.280 --> 01:48.960]  Do you think he is a white supremacist?
[01:48.960 --> 01:50.760]  You really believe that this president is a white supremacist?
[01:50.760 --> 01:53.760]  Well, it doesn't matter what I think or whether he is or not.
[01:53.760 --> 01:59.440]  Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag,
[01:59.440 --> 02:04.000]  to say get that son of a s*** off the field right now, out, he's fired?
[02:04.000 --> 02:11.240]  And there is no regulation that says that these young men cannot stand against the dishonoring
[02:11.240 --> 02:16.000]  of their mothers by you calling them, fire the son of a bee.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.440]  You tell me which of those children's mothers-
[02:18.440 --> 02:21.200]  He's saying people that hate America are sons of bitches.
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.200]  You cannot deny it.
[02:22.200 --> 02:25.840]  There are full rot punks, and then they claim it's racial.
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.480]  Well, you know, it's not our fault, it's 90% black folks doing this.
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.080]  People have to be made to feel uncomfortable, and especially white people, because we're
[02:35.080 --> 02:36.080]  comfortable.
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.080]  That's what this is.
[02:37.080 --> 02:38.080]  It's a bunch of bullying.
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.080]  He's doing no clues.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.080]  I haven't done jack crap, and I'm sick of it.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.080]  He's doing white means.
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.720]  By the way, I don't blame average black folks either.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.680]  I don't buy into this group crap.
[02:44.680 --> 02:51.040]  It's just some that I have ever met, seen, or witnessed, let alone run for and become
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.520]  president of the United States of America.
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.160]  He is about division.
[02:55.160 --> 02:56.160]  He is about-
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.160]  No, you are.
[02:57.160 --> 03:00.240] ...signal to that core group of his.
[03:00.240 --> 03:03.200]  Majority of black Americans are against this crap, lady.
[03:03.200 --> 03:04.960]  They're not stupid like you.
[03:04.960 --> 03:07.240]  It's all about making it white.
[03:07.240 --> 03:09.920]  This anti-American cancer is spreading.
[03:09.920 --> 03:11.400]  It's come down to this.
[03:11.400 --> 03:12.720]  Either you love this country-
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.200]  Look at that blade, look at that blade.
[03:16.200 --> 03:18.560] ...or you want to destroy it.
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.160]  The NFL means everything to the blue-collar Americans that are the lifeblood of America
[03:24.160 --> 03:26.040]  and the NFL, for that matter.
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.720]  A moment of pride in their team to remove them from day-to-day backbreaking work.
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.320]  In the past, when an NFL running back ran through a blizzard, not only did he carry
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.720]  a ball, he carried the hearts and minds and pride of this country.
[03:40.720 --> 03:45.680]  When the knee is taken and the intent is that too many black men have died at the hands
[03:45.680 --> 03:46.680]  of the police.
[03:46.680 --> 03:48.440]  Sure, that's a problem.
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.840]  So is black-on-black crime and the plight of the American workers that have had their
[03:52.840 --> 03:59.320]  jobs shipped overseas, or the thousands of children missing every year, or the soldiers
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.920]  who return home in coffins, draped in the flag the NFL bent a knee on.
[04:04.920 --> 04:11.880]  Dying for our country, just so entitled morons can chase a ball around a field.
[04:11.880 --> 04:18.360]  The NFL is supposed to be a distraction for the people, not a reminder of political division
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.880]  by millionaires.
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.320]  This new generation of players that reflect the mindset of the millennials, who have zero
[04:25.320 --> 04:31.760]  gravitas of the fundamental problems facing this country, who think Americans are stupid
[04:31.760 --> 04:37.520]  enough to believe our president is the source of the divide, when he is blatantly expressing
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.120]  what the majority of Americans were thinking and feeling.
[04:41.120 --> 04:42.120]  All lives matter.
[04:42.120 --> 04:47.720]  In this melting pot of months called America, you want to make a difference, NFL?
[04:47.720 --> 04:53.080]  Then use your fortune and influence to clean up the mean streets of this country, instead
[04:53.080 --> 04:58.640]  of bending a knee, playing four quarters, then driving your bling around in your tricked
[04:58.640 --> 05:02.920]  out Humvee on your way to your ranch in FourWars.com.
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.400]  Today I want to talk to you about guns, why we have them, why the Bill of Rights guarantees
[05:08.400 --> 05:13.160]  that we can have them, and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right
[05:13.160 --> 05:15.120]  to rail against it in the press.
[05:15.120 --> 05:19.800]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered
[05:19.800 --> 05:22.380]  more essential than the First Amendment.
[05:22.380 --> 05:27.320]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[05:27.320 --> 05:32.600]  outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[05:32.600 --> 05:38.520]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.920]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional
[05:42.920 --> 05:45.680]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[05:45.680 --> 05:48.320]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[05:48.320 --> 05:51.200]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[05:51.200 --> 05:56.240]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even
[05:56.240 --> 05:57.920]  of those we love to hate.
[05:57.920 --> 06:00.880]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[06:00.880 --> 06:05.280]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:05.280 --> 06:10.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.520]  to detoxify the body.
[06:11.520 --> 06:16.400]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[06:16.400 --> 06:17.920]  It's made in the USA.
[06:17.920 --> 06:22.840]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[06:22.840 --> 06:24.680]  the body and it supports the M4.
[06:24.680 --> 06:26.920]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:26.920 --> 06:31.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.080]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.080]  get.
[06:37.080 --> 06:40.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[06:40.280 --> 06:45.320]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.560]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[06:50.560 --> 06:54.400]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[06:54.400 --> 06:56.560]  prayers together we're changing the world.
[06:56.560 --> 07:00.960]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at infowarslife.com.
[07:00.960 --> 07:05.200]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[07:05.200 --> 07:10.560]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[07:10.560 --> 07:15.520]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[07:15.520 --> 07:17.120]  at infowarsore.com.
[07:17.120 --> 07:20.960]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[07:20.960 --> 07:25.080]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:25.080 --> 07:30.560]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50, listeners have been
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.120]  requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that
[07:35.120 --> 07:36.120]  you need each month.
[07:36.120 --> 07:40.760]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.880]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:43.880 --> 07:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.120]  this is a sure win, 10% off on auto ship.
[07:52.120 --> 07:57.960]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items
[07:57.960 --> 08:04.120]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:04.120 --> 08:10.640]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[08:10.640 --> 08:22.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:22.280 --> 08:29.480]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's
[08:29.480 --> 08:30.640]  Alex Jones.
[08:30.640 --> 08:37.520]  A maraca was dying a slow death like so many other sovereign nations being absorbed into
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.760]  the unelected global dictatorship of the corporate crony capitalist technocracy known
[08:43.760 --> 08:46.080]  as the New World Order.
[08:46.080 --> 08:53.720]  And Donald Trump understood, Stephen Bannon understood, I shelf and the infowars listeners
[08:53.720 --> 09:03.440]  understood that we needed to invoke our constitutional republic and our nationalism and needed to
[09:03.440 --> 09:11.280]  force a confrontation with the globalist that we're slowly dissolving the final pillars
[09:11.280 --> 09:14.640]  of our culture and our republic.
[09:14.640 --> 09:22.240]  And Trump has lured these American hating scum and their useful idiots, because the
[09:22.240 --> 09:30.080]  people in the NFL and Hollywood on average are just useful idiots, has lured them into
[09:30.080 --> 09:36.380]  direct information warfare confrontation.
[09:36.380 --> 09:40.680]  We're promoting freedom, we're promoting justice, we're promoting free market, we're
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.920]  promoting prosperity, we're promoting truth and justice in the American way.
[09:45.920 --> 09:52.040]  They're promoting race war garbage from a weirdo Nazi collaborator, George Soros that
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.800]  seeks to overthrow any nation state he can and plunge it into civil war so he can come
[09:57.800 --> 10:01.400]  in and consolidate control.
[10:01.400 --> 10:06.880]  I told you a month into the Ukraine crisis, I said George Soros will call for a Marshall
[10:06.880 --> 10:07.880]  plan.
[10:07.880 --> 10:12.640]  A few months later, he called for a Marshall plan.
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.240]  He wasn't imitating when I said, I know their operation.
[10:17.240 --> 10:24.240]  Yeah, the Germans started World War II and we blew up Europe and they blew up Europe.
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.960]  We went in with the Marshall plan and they never came out of it.
[10:27.960 --> 10:32.240]  Germany's controlled by the globalist and that's what Soros means when he causes civil
[10:32.240 --> 10:33.880]  wars or economic collapse.
[10:33.880 --> 10:43.000]  He comes in and takes control and exploits it like an oligarch, like they did to Russia.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.280]  The Russians were exploited by oligarchs outside their country throughout the Soviet era and
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.400]  then after it got even worse and then Putin kicked them out of the country to a great
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.400]  extent.
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.680]  And there's an ongoing civil war still to remove him, but he's not a dictator.
[10:58.680 --> 11:01.760]  He's elected by 85% because the people love him.
[11:01.760 --> 11:04.880]  He doesn't have to kill journalists.
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.600]  The people that get killed are journalists that have outlived their usefulness for the
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.760]  foundations so they can blame Putin.
[11:11.760 --> 11:22.280]  You don't need to kill journalists when you get elected by 85 points.
[11:22.280 --> 11:25.360]  And now it's the same thing with Trump.
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.560]  Trump's really at about 65 points with the general public.
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.920]  If you look at Google numbers and trends, he's even more popular than ever.
[11:33.920 --> 11:36.720]  Now what could just defeat him is what the Republicans are doing.
[11:36.720 --> 11:39.280]  Look at Rogerport.com.
[11:39.280 --> 11:42.600]  Right now, more betrayal.
[11:42.600 --> 11:44.440]  Republicans plan to raise taxes.
[11:44.440 --> 11:46.240]  They want to kill the economy.
[11:46.240 --> 11:49.320]  They're working with the Democrats.
[11:49.320 --> 11:50.840]  And look, oh, Obamacare for life.
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.720]  Well, suddenly the Republicans, they can't get rid of it because they wrote the stinking
[11:56.720 --> 11:57.720]  thing.
[11:57.720 --> 12:00.400]  And I'm going to say this real slow to the moron Democrats.
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.560]  Listen, idiots, I don't take pleasure in the fact that you are a bunch of morons.
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.720]  The Republican blue bloods wrote the stinking thing for foreign megabanks that own the
[12:10.720 --> 12:12.040]  insurance companies.
[12:12.040 --> 12:18.040]  And one year after it was in place, they made a 47% increase global profit off of us.
[12:18.040 --> 12:19.800]  And that was before it even got implemented.
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.480]  We now have seen quadrupling in many cases, doubling on average, and the healthcare systems
[12:24.480 --> 12:25.720]  going bankrupt.
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.800]  And the Democrats and Republicans admit they want to fully bankrupt it and take it over
[12:30.800 --> 12:35.800]  and use that to bring the whole economy down, idiots.
[12:35.800 --> 12:41.560]  Obamacare is a multinational globalist economy killing attack.
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.680]  It's a weapon system.
[12:46.680 --> 12:49.200]  You understand?
[12:49.200 --> 12:53.000]  So when you go, oh, look, you're not getting rid of Obamacare, we're winning.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.760]  We're defeating Republicans, nanny, nanny, boo boo.
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.480]  You can't catch me, you're idiots.
[13:04.480 --> 13:10.920]  There's nothing stupider than people being wrecked and ruined and robbed by globalists
[13:10.920 --> 13:16.720]  when they admit it in books and white papers and on C-span.
[13:16.720 --> 13:18.360]  Thank God the public's so dumb, man.
[13:18.360 --> 13:20.760]  This is an incredible screw job.
[13:20.760 --> 13:24.520]  Never before have we had a direct tax to private banks and insurance companies.
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.240]  This is incredible.
[13:26.240 --> 13:29.040]  Thank God they have no memory.
[13:29.040 --> 13:30.640]  But here's what happened.
[13:30.640 --> 13:32.640]  They went too far.
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.640]  And so the NFL's been captured by the Justice Department, captured by Mueller, who did the
[13:36.640 --> 13:43.520]  whole concussion and the whole investigation into the bounties and all the other gladiatorial
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.520]  stuff.
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.520]  Remember all that?
[13:45.520 --> 13:53.920]  The whole special operation and took him a few years under Obama and within just a few
[13:53.920 --> 14:01.760]  weeks of rolling over suddenly anti-gun, anti-family, anti-America, suddenly the NFL wouldn't even
[14:01.760 --> 14:04.960]  take Pentagon money to run pro-veteran stuff.
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.960]  Well, do you think that's good or bad?
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.920]  The point is they're like, no.
[14:11.920 --> 14:13.480]  We're taking George Soros money.
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.480]  We're taking Hollywood money and they rolled over full.
[14:17.480 --> 14:18.960]  They rolled over completely.
[14:18.960 --> 14:23.720]  Those owners, those managers, those coaches, they rolled over and the teams rolled over.
[14:23.720 --> 14:28.560]  So when you look at the idiot teams out there, locking arms or taking a knee, remember it
[14:28.560 --> 14:34.200]  goes all the way up to the top of the NFL and the commissioner that on Saturday thought
[14:34.200 --> 14:37.880]  he was all powerful and another arrogant person.
[14:37.880 --> 14:41.200]  And he pointed his finger and he said, no, Trump, we're not disrespecting the flag or
[14:41.200 --> 14:43.600]  America, you disrespecting the NFL.
[14:43.600 --> 14:51.080]  He thought the NFL, it's like when John Lennon said, we're bigger than Jesus.
[14:51.080 --> 14:52.440]  What an arrogant statement.
[14:52.440 --> 14:54.600]  Well, this is just like that.
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.960]  We're bigger than America.
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.560]  Now they're having to come out and apologize.
[15:00.560 --> 15:01.760]  Now they've hired PR firms.
[15:01.760 --> 15:02.760]  Now they don't know what to do.
[15:02.760 --> 15:08.120]  Now they're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars being lost a week and people getting
[15:08.120 --> 15:15.240]  refunds and getting rid of their tickets and they understand they are in deep, deep, deep
[15:15.240 --> 15:17.520]  trouble.
[15:17.520 --> 15:19.760]  And Trump lured them out.
[15:19.760 --> 15:23.880]  He knows they're kept by the Democratic Party and by Mueller, who never ceased to be the
[15:23.880 --> 15:24.880]  FBI director.
[15:24.880 --> 15:25.880]  It's well known.
[15:25.880 --> 15:28.960]  He is the ongoing director of the FBI.
[15:28.960 --> 15:35.920]  He runs the subgroups, all of it, the blackmail operations, everything, super gangster.
[15:35.920 --> 15:38.200]  He makes Al Capone look like a moron.
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.480]  A guy running an eliminate stand next to somebody running Walmart.
[15:43.480 --> 15:47.160]  The Hitch Squads, the Death Squads, everything under Mueller.
[15:47.160 --> 15:52.280]  Mueller merged it with the CIA and his own adjunct goes on TV and says, we're getting
[15:52.280 --> 15:55.320]  ready to kill the president.
[15:55.320 --> 15:58.840]  My name's Mudd, Phil Mudd.
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.320]  I'm related to the doctor that helped John Wilkes Booth.
[16:02.320 --> 16:06.160]  We take presidents out, it's what we do.
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.680]  Robert Mueller's last major investigation, the NFL, and boy, he got them to come to
[16:11.680 --> 16:12.680]  heal.
[16:12.680 --> 16:16.920]  And believe me, that's Mueller's job to get Trump to come to heal.
[16:16.920 --> 16:23.000]  They want a kept president who they can then maneuver towards destruction.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.400]  Mueller report, let's NFL off the hook, but something still smells fishy.
[16:26.400 --> 16:36.400]  Yeah, the NFL rolled over and is now a subsidiary of Hollywood Horror Incorporated.
[16:36.400 --> 16:39.120]  Now I had this headline on Saturday and I had this headline on Sunday.
[16:39.120 --> 16:40.120]  Go to our YouTube.
[16:40.120 --> 16:45.960]  I did live feeds, I did a live show on Sunday and Saturday, and what was my headline?
[16:45.960 --> 16:48.880]  The suicide of the NFL.
[16:48.880 --> 16:54.360]  And now that's the trending story on Facebook and Twitter by Town Hall.
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.720]  The suicide of the NFL.
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.720]  Oh, everybody was saying, Alex, you don't know what you're talking about, the NFL.
[17:00.720 --> 17:01.720]  People are still going to watch you.
[17:01.720 --> 17:04.560]  The NFL is going to break Trump.
[17:04.560 --> 17:07.160]  Yeah.
[17:07.160 --> 17:09.760]  This is the story of the suicide of the NFL.
[17:09.760 --> 17:12.720]  Every liberal CEO in America should be watching and listening.
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.320]  This is a case study for how to destroy a billion-dollar business by injecting your offensive, leftist
[17:18.320 --> 17:23.480]  politics and alienating your own customer base.
[17:23.480 --> 17:27.040]  Using in major polls the vast majority of blacks, they just want to watch a football
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.640]  game and not get beat over the head with a bunch of BS.
[17:31.640 --> 17:33.000]  President Trump has done it again.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.400]  No, I don't mean he's offended millions of Americans.
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.200]  I mean, he said exactly what was on the mind of tens of millions of middle-class Americans
[17:39.200 --> 17:43.560]  call us the silent majority because of Trump, our views now count.
[17:43.560 --> 17:44.800]  It's a focal point.
[17:44.800 --> 17:46.400]  We know we're not alone.
[17:46.400 --> 17:52.360]  We know we're the future of every color who don't want to be a bunch of whiny little
[17:52.360 --> 17:56.960]  brats making $20 million a year.
[17:56.960 --> 17:57.960]  Jerry Jones.
[17:57.960 --> 17:59.760]  The Cowboys are no longer America's team.
[17:59.760 --> 18:00.760]  They're a joke.
[18:00.760 --> 18:02.760]  You're a joke.
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.880]  You disgrace the name Jones.
[18:04.880 --> 18:05.880]  It's just bizarre.
[18:05.880 --> 18:11.000]  You know, I was thinking if I have another son named after my dad's dad, Jerry Jones.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.600]  But I don't think I could do that now.
[18:13.600 --> 18:14.800]  That was going to be the name.
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.360]  If I have another son and I tend to try to have more children, God blesses me.
[18:19.360 --> 18:21.480]  It was going to be Jerry Jones.
[18:21.480 --> 18:24.080]  I cannot do it.
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.960]  I might still do it for my grandfather, but I just, Jerry Jones, I just don't want, I
[18:27.960 --> 18:29.280]  don't want to give that to my boy.
[18:29.280 --> 18:33.680]  You know, it's like boy named Sue.
[18:33.680 --> 18:34.840]  How do you do?
[18:34.840 --> 18:36.360]  My name is Sue.
[18:36.360 --> 18:41.920]  Now you're going to die.
[18:41.920 --> 18:48.360]  I mean, Jerry Jones was already enough of a clown, the Cowboys owner, not my grandfather.
[18:48.360 --> 18:56.320]  And I just don't know, see, I like old fashioned names like, I'm not going to say the names
[18:56.320 --> 19:00.040]  of my children on there, but it's just I'm like a good old fashioned Texas name like
[19:00.040 --> 19:01.040]  Jerry Jones.
[19:01.040 --> 19:03.040]  Can't do it.
[19:03.040 --> 19:04.880]  Thanks for ruining that, man.
[19:04.880 --> 19:06.360]  That's how bad you are.
[19:06.360 --> 19:10.280]  Literally, I wouldn't put a stigma on my son like that.
[19:10.280 --> 19:15.280]  I mean, the name Jerry Jones, think about it, that's a shameful name, not just because
[19:15.280 --> 19:17.200]  of this, all the stuff he's done.
[19:17.200 --> 19:24.560]  That's why I stopped watching it 20 years ago, because of Jerry Jones.
[19:24.560 --> 19:29.320]  And it's just indicative of what a bunch of scum they are.
[19:29.320 --> 19:33.640]  And it makes me sick.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.640]  It makes me ashamed.
[19:34.640 --> 19:40.880]  The institution in Texas is the Dallas Cowboys, not Cowboys, bunch of punks, excuse me.
[19:40.880 --> 19:42.480]  I'm going to get it all when we come back.
[19:42.480 --> 19:43.960]  There's so much to cover.
[19:43.960 --> 19:46.040]  We've got Steven Seagal annihilating these folks.
[19:46.040 --> 19:47.680]  We've got big economic news.
[19:47.680 --> 19:50.160]  We've got the left trying to start all these race wars.
[19:50.160 --> 19:55.280]  We've got Mueller even seeing an image running around wallously, just threatening everybody,
[19:55.280 --> 19:56.280]  doing illegal stuff.
[19:56.280 --> 20:00.280]  I mean, it's just a bunch of scum.
[20:00.280 --> 20:04.840]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control, and certainty without
[20:04.840 --> 20:09.960]  stock market risk or tax risk, and you want guarantees and you want it all tax free.
[20:09.960 --> 20:11.080]  That's a tall order.
[20:11.080 --> 20:15.920]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[20:15.920 --> 20:18.760]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[20:18.760 --> 20:19.760]  That's true.
[20:19.760 --> 20:24.040]  But you can have tax free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[24:16.960 --> 24:38.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[24:38.160 --> 24:45.840]  Coming up there is an extremely powerful Stephen Segal interview that he did yesterday for
[24:45.840 --> 24:47.840]  British television.
[24:47.840 --> 24:51.600]  And I'm an air large excerpt of what we talked about, Deep State, the attempt to overthrow
[24:51.600 --> 24:54.960]  America, how they're trying to block Trump.
[24:54.960 --> 24:56.960]  It's up on infowars.com.
[24:56.960 --> 24:59.920]  We're going to tweet it out at Real Alex Jones.
[24:59.920 --> 25:06.320]  There's also a very powerful report that Paul Watson shot, Take a Knee is total BS.
[25:06.320 --> 25:11.000]  And I think he really lays it out the best I've seen it so far.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  So that's coming up.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.960]  Again, people are saying Alex, you always say sports is a diversion at the national
[25:15.960 --> 25:16.960]  level.
[25:16.960 --> 25:18.600]  Why are you harping on it so much?
[25:18.600 --> 25:22.000]  Because it's the culture war in America lost its culture.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.440]  They thought the NFL was our culture.
[25:24.440 --> 25:29.520]  The globalist sees control of that culture and we're using it to poison America further.
[25:29.520 --> 25:31.440]  Trump has forced a fight.
[25:31.440 --> 25:38.280]  The enemy took the bait and every metric, every poll, every number shows blacks, Hispanics,
[25:38.280 --> 25:46.240]  whites, women, old folks, young folks, upwards of 70% are bucking the political correctness
[25:46.240 --> 25:49.080]  and saying this is insane.
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.800]  We don't like this.
[25:50.800 --> 25:57.720]  And the NFL tried to belligerently bullets way over all that anger this weekend and on
[25:57.720 --> 26:02.280]  Monday and Tuesday and are now panicking.
[26:02.280 --> 26:09.520]  The fact that they defended this crap really made it seem home to people what we're up
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.520]  against a bunch of America haters that want to culturally dominate us and we're going
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.760]  to use every venue who are going to politicize everything.
[26:18.760 --> 26:23.960]  I mean, think about it, MSNBC and CNN and just the last few weeks, I've seen clips of
[26:23.960 --> 26:29.440]  them saying we're not political and saying Hillary says we need to be political and there's
[26:29.440 --> 26:31.480]  not enough liberal media.
[26:31.480 --> 26:33.120]  They're all political.
[26:33.120 --> 26:35.600]  They're all a bunch of liars on top of it.
[26:35.600 --> 26:37.480]  They twist everything.
[26:37.480 --> 26:43.720]  They've got 100 times the media we've got, but they've got the nerve to say we're out
[26:43.720 --> 26:44.920]  numbering them.
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.520]  They've got the nerve to say that they don't have the power structure, Hollywood, the NFL,
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.760]  the big telecoms, the big internet companies, all these foreign governments, the UN, the
[26:53.760 --> 27:01.400]  EU, all these big immigrant populations they bring in and then politicize and then the
[27:01.400 --> 27:10.720]  American people have drugs report, info wars, talk radio, Fox News, I mean, I can't even
[27:10.720 --> 27:12.960]  watch Fox News and everybody else tells me they can.
[27:12.960 --> 27:15.840]  Their ratings are down by like half except for Hannity.
[27:15.840 --> 27:16.840]  Is there up?
[27:16.840 --> 27:20.840]  You tune in, it's milk toast crud.
[27:20.840 --> 27:22.840]  It's like CNN 10 years ago.
[27:22.840 --> 27:28.880]  CNN used to show both sides of the establishment Republican, establishment Democrat view 10
[27:28.880 --> 27:30.760]  years ago.
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.720]  They consequently have like 10 times the ratings, literally.
[27:34.720 --> 27:36.200]  That's what Fox is.
[27:36.200 --> 27:37.960]  It's segwayed into CNN.
[27:37.960 --> 27:39.560]  It's not showing both sides.
[27:39.560 --> 27:49.080]  It's showing establishment vomit, blended, parroted BS shoveled on everybody and I'm sick
[27:49.080 --> 27:50.080]  of it.
[27:50.080 --> 27:56.560]  I'll tell you, I relish the death of the NFL and all those swollen steroid head spoiled
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.440]  brats and all their sickening coaches and all the sickening NBA people in the sickening
[28:01.440 --> 28:06.040]  spurs coach and all these people that want to bully everybody, go to hell.
[28:06.040 --> 28:08.760]  I love what you've done.
[28:08.760 --> 28:12.720]  Your jokes and you're already losing money and you're wrecking yourselves.
[28:12.720 --> 28:15.280]  Oh, and please wait into it.
[28:15.280 --> 28:16.640]  Wait into it NBA.
[28:16.640 --> 28:17.640]  Do it.
[28:17.640 --> 28:18.640]  And you know what?
[28:18.640 --> 28:19.640]  You're coming into the quicksand.
[28:19.640 --> 28:20.640]  Come to me.
[28:20.640 --> 28:21.640]  Come to papa.
[28:21.640 --> 28:22.640]  Just get in the quicksand.
[28:22.640 --> 28:23.640]  Let's go.
[28:23.640 --> 28:24.640]  Let's go to the bottom.
[28:24.640 --> 28:25.640]  Come to me.
[28:25.640 --> 28:28.000]  I'm like a siren right there on the rock.
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  Just get off the boat.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  Just get in the water with me.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  Come on.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  Let's go.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Let's go.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  Just get in.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  Because I'm going to wrap my tentacles around you and I'm going to pull you right to the
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  bottom.
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.520]  And I'm watching Trump and you talk about tentacles around your neck dragging you down to the
[28:42.520 --> 28:43.520]  bottom.
[28:43.520 --> 28:44.960]  It's spiritual what Trump's doing.
[28:44.960 --> 28:46.720]  He is executing you.
[28:46.720 --> 28:51.680]  He is executing you with your own ignorance and your own arrogance.
[28:51.680 --> 28:57.880]  And you notice this isn't confidence, ladies and gentlemen, this is victory.
[28:57.880 --> 29:06.600]  This is the spirit of recognizing poison and of vomiting that poison back out of my gut
[29:06.600 --> 29:16.240]  and breaking with you fully and watching America and the world, Catalonia, 90% plus Catalonia,
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.240]  their own culture captured back by the earlier Spanish Empire hundreds of years ago.
[29:22.240 --> 29:23.440]  They're not French.
[29:23.440 --> 29:26.040]  They're not Spanish.
[29:26.040 --> 29:30.360]  And they voted almost 100% to leave and they're arresting their leaders and trying to put
[29:30.360 --> 29:31.560]  troops on the streets.
[29:31.560 --> 29:33.840]  Good luck with that.
[29:33.840 --> 29:36.360]  Again, you could beat them today.
[29:36.360 --> 29:37.360]  You're just like Brexit.
[29:37.360 --> 29:38.360]  You can try to block Brexit now.
[29:38.360 --> 29:39.360]  It won't work.
[29:39.360 --> 29:41.640]  Look at Judge Moore in Alabama.
[29:41.640 --> 29:44.760]  That huge referendum on the Republican establishment.
[29:44.760 --> 29:48.560]  Now, all these big Republican senators are announcing they're not going to run again.
[29:48.560 --> 29:49.560]  It's called victory.
[29:49.560 --> 29:50.560]  We're on the mark.
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.560]  Get used to it.
[29:51.560 --> 29:56.320]  America is awake and America is going to be awake for a long time.
[29:56.320 --> 29:57.760]  She's awake now.
[29:57.760 --> 30:02.320]  She's awake now.
[30:02.320 --> 30:07.320]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their
[30:07.320 --> 30:12.920]  Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
[30:12.920 --> 30:16.320]  ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[30:16.320 --> 30:20.400]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[30:20.400 --> 30:23.000]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.720]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[30:25.720 --> 30:30.960]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[30:30.960 --> 30:32.360]  and to profit from it?
[30:32.360 --> 30:36.280]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American
[30:36.280 --> 30:37.280]  people?
[30:37.280 --> 30:41.440]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[30:41.440 --> 30:43.840]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[30:43.840 --> 30:48.800]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[30:48.800 --> 30:54.200]  Join the InfoWars, spread the information, educate yourself and others, the truth shall
[30:54.200 --> 30:59.200]  set you free.
[30:59.200 --> 31:17.320]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[31:17.320 --> 31:31.800]  learn more about this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use and when compared
[31:31.800 --> 31:40.160]  to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, there is no comparison.
[31:40.160 --> 31:46.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.480]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[31:49.480 --> 31:52.920]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[31:52.920 --> 31:57.040]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[31:57.040 --> 31:58.040]  So what are you waiting for?

[33:22.120 --> 33:28.080]  When you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say
[33:28.080 --> 33:35.000]  get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired, he's fired.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  Donald Trump's dividing the country.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.080]  Yeah, quick fact check, Donald Trump didn't start take a knee, Colin Kaepernick did, months
[33:43.080 --> 33:45.320]  before Donald Trump was even elected.
[33:45.320 --> 33:49.480]  Kaepernick did it as a pro black lives matter stunt to draw attention to cops murdering
[33:49.480 --> 33:50.480]  African Americans.
[33:50.480 --> 33:55.240]  A narrative that's been completely debunked given that white people are more likely to
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.280]  be shot dead by cops, despite black people committing more violent crimes.
[33:59.280 --> 34:04.720]  This new incarnation of take a knee isn't about protesting police murders of black people.
[34:04.720 --> 34:08.360]  There haven't even been any high profile cases of that for months.
[34:08.360 --> 34:13.880]  It isn't about patriotism, it isn't about free speech, it's just the latest manifestation
[34:13.880 --> 34:18.040]  of mass hysteria and Trump derangement syndrome.
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.240]  Isn't it an amazing coincidence that the three most prominent personalities who popularized
[34:23.240 --> 34:28.560]  this new round of take a knee after Trump's comments, all campaigned for Hillary Clinton,
[34:28.560 --> 34:31.200]  Steph Curry, LeBron James, Pharrell Williams.
[34:31.200 --> 34:36.720]  Oh, but I'm sure it's about patriotism, I'm sure it's about police brutality, or whatever
[34:36.720 --> 34:41.280]  you decided it's about today, and it's got nothing whatsoever to do with your butthurt
[34:41.280 --> 34:43.280]  over Hillary Clinton losing.
[34:43.280 --> 34:48.800]  But when Steph, LeBron, Pharrell and all the other NFL chumps gonna take a knee to draw
[34:48.800 --> 34:54.880]  attention to the relentless carnage that is black on black murder, 700 plus homicides
[34:54.880 --> 35:01.560]  every year in Chicago alone, mostly black victims, nearly 2400 black people killed by
[35:01.560 --> 35:08.520]  other black people every single year, compare that to just 16 unarmed black men killed by
[35:08.520 --> 35:09.800]  police last year.
[35:09.800 --> 35:13.080]  That's roughly the same amount that gets struck by lightning.
[35:13.080 --> 35:18.160]  When are you gonna take a knee for something that's an actual problem and not a hysterical
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.720]  fraud contrived by the mass media?
[35:20.720 --> 35:27.440]  There is still a problem, and that problem of police brutality specifically is real,
[35:27.440 --> 35:28.440]  it's true, it's urgent.
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.880]  Yeah, I'm more concerned about the problem of NFL thug brutality.
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.960]  Maybe they all hate the police so much because the cops are the only ones stopping them from
[35:36.960 --> 35:39.280]  beating up their own wives and girlfriends.
[35:39.280 --> 35:45.160]  Let's do another fact check, moral high ground, no, you still don't have it, you're taking
[35:45.160 --> 35:50.200]  a knee as part of your temper tantrum over Trump being an autocrat, a dictator.
[35:50.200 --> 35:56.840]  While the idiot that started all this literally wears t-shirts off and praises an actual dictator,
[35:56.840 --> 36:02.120]  oh but the NFL really cares about free speech, that'll be why they threaten to find players
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.200]  for wanting to honour 9-11 victims.
[36:04.200 --> 36:09.160]  But if Colin Kaepernick wants to wear socks depicting police officers as pigs, that's
[36:09.160 --> 36:10.160]  just fine.
[36:10.160 --> 36:13.640]  Yeah, you do realise you wouldn't even be able to have an NFL if it wasn't for the
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.520]  thousands of police officers that provide security for it every single weekend.
[36:18.520 --> 36:24.520]  The NFL really supports players free speech, unless they want to criticise a ref or dance
[36:24.520 --> 36:25.640]  in the end zone.
[36:25.640 --> 36:31.000]  The NBA really cares about free speech too, which is why they banned Donald Sterling for
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.600]  life and find him $2.5 million over a private conversation.
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.200]  ESPN definitely cares about free speech, which is why they fired Kurt Schilling for sharing
[36:41.200 --> 36:47.680]  a meme on Facebook, and CNN really cares about free speech too, which is why they ran Defence
[36:47.680 --> 36:53.080]  for Antifa, a group that literally burns signs that say free speech, left in general
[36:53.080 --> 36:55.400]  really cherishes free speech, don't they?
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.040]  That'll be why they violently attack conservatives who try to exercise it, ban them on social
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.160]  media platforms, and grease the skids for censorship by claiming that anyone right of
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.400]  Karl Marx is literally Hitler.
[37:06.400 --> 37:10.200]  Give me a break, none of you give a s*** about free speech.
[37:10.200 --> 37:11.200]  Patriotism.
[37:11.200 --> 37:12.200]  Okay, let's talk about patriotism.
[37:12.200 --> 37:16.840]  The Ravens and the Jaguars kneeled for the Star-Spangled Banner, and then stood for God
[37:16.840 --> 37:17.840]  Save the Queen.
[37:17.840 --> 37:25.320]  That is video moments ago of the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars kneeling for
[37:25.320 --> 37:28.720]  the first game of week three here, which is in London.
[37:28.720 --> 37:32.960]  So the game's happening earlier than this, you see dozens of players kneeling, and then
[37:32.960 --> 37:36.800]  you see coaches and others locking arms as the American National Anthem is played on
[37:36.800 --> 37:37.800]  Foreign Soil.
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.160]  Yes, and then apparently they played the UK National Anthem, and you can see them there,
[37:42.160 --> 37:46.040]  they're not kneeling, they're standing, this is it right there, they're standing behind
[37:46.040 --> 37:51.080]  her for the UK National Anthem, but kneeling, of course, for ours, for the Americans.
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.640]  So look at the imagery of we're kneeling for our own country's anthem, and then we
[37:54.640 --> 37:58.560]  all rise to our feet and stand on Foreign Soil for another country's anthem.
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.080]  Yeah, you do know that the entire foundation of your country's patriotism is based on the
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.760]  fact that you won a war against that same royal family, and now you're standing for
[38:07.760 --> 38:08.760]  their anthem.
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.680]  Oh, but you're so patriotic, ball, b***h.
[38:12.680 --> 38:15.760]  Oh, but this is just another example of Trump's racism.
[38:15.760 --> 38:17.280]  Let's talk about racism.
[38:17.280 --> 38:21.840]  Let's talk about how all the black NFL players who stood for the National Anthem yesterday,
[38:21.840 --> 38:27.440]  guys like Gineo Grissom, were bombarded with racial slurs, not from Donald Trump, from
[38:27.440 --> 38:32.760]  take any supporters, yeah, they can't express their free speech without being called Uncle
[38:32.760 --> 38:35.280]  Tom's and the C-word by racists.
[38:35.280 --> 38:37.480]  Oh, but Trump's the racist.
[38:37.480 --> 38:41.600]  Now it's understandable why Americans are so pissed off about this, and it's easy to
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.720]  see why many of them are now burning NFL gear and vowing never to watch another game again.
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.400]  But if you're a Trump supporter, this is yet another gargantuan narrative fail for the
[38:51.400 --> 38:52.400]  left.
[38:52.400 --> 38:53.400]  Think about it.
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.520]  Trump associated opposition to him with hatred of America and disrespect of the anthem and
[38:59.520 --> 39:03.760]  the flag as Joe Scarborough, hardly a fan of Trump tweeted.
[39:03.760 --> 39:06.720]  This may be unpopular, but it's a political reality.
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.880]  Every NFL player refusing to stand for the National Anthem helps Trump politically.
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.320]  So well done for falling for that one, idiots.
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.480]  Real Americans don't give a b***h about whiny, privileged, multi-millionaire brats and their
[39:20.480 --> 39:23.040]  tedious tiresome virtue signaling.
[39:23.040 --> 39:27.840]  NFL ratings are already down 10% on Sunday alone, the lowest of the season.
[39:27.840 --> 39:32.320]  Even fans in liberal areas like Boston and D.C. booed their own players.
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.520]  No one's buying your vacuous excuses about patriotism, police brutality or free speech.
[39:38.520 --> 39:44.840]  We know this is just yet another manifestation of your anti-Trump election butthurt.
[39:44.840 --> 39:49.520]  And yeah, it's your right to do it, just as it's my right to call you a bunch of hysterical
[39:49.520 --> 39:54.280]  b***h idiots and what was the most powerful image to come out of all this?
[39:54.280 --> 39:59.200]  It wasn't any of the morons who took a knee or the Steelers players who hid in their locker
[39:59.200 --> 40:00.200]  room.
[40:00.200 --> 40:06.960]  It was Alejandro Villanueva, US Army veteran who stood alone, honoring the anthem and
[40:06.960 --> 40:08.520]  everything it stands for.
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.520]  But I'm sure the Steelers supported him for expressing his free speech, right?
[40:13.520 --> 40:16.840]  No, the head coach attacked him immediately after the game ended.
[40:16.840 --> 40:27.040]  I guess some free speech is more free than the other.
[40:27.040 --> 40:35.320]  And let's add a disgusting, rotting cherry to the top of this pile of evil.
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.880]  They threatened to fire the Steeler, the Army veteran that put his hand over his heart.
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.080]  That's what happened.
[40:44.080 --> 40:47.040]  And then they came out and said, oh, we didn't really do that.
[40:47.040 --> 40:48.040]  It's complex.
[40:48.040 --> 40:49.040]  He's allowed to have his views.
[40:49.040 --> 40:50.040]  He's just not going to share them.
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.840]  Because there was a backlash to them threatening him and the coach said, I'm going to discipline
[40:54.840 --> 40:55.840]  him.
[40:55.840 --> 41:00.680]  And then a day later, he came out and apologized for two days later.
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.520]  Turns out Reddit discovered this is why I love the great researchers over at Reddit.
[41:06.520 --> 41:12.360]  They're in the Donald forum, we're going to write a story about this.
[41:12.360 --> 41:22.000]  Turns out Hilary Rodham Clinton had a huge fundraiser for $30,000, excuse me, $33,400.
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.720]  Excuse me, I got that wrong.
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.880]  Supporter levels 10,000 to be there, but to be near her, to meet her, be at her table,
[41:33.880 --> 41:35.380]  $33,400.
[41:35.380 --> 41:47.800]  At the home of Kaya and Mike Tomlin, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, address provided upon RSVP.
[41:47.800 --> 41:49.600]  And he's an admitted Clinton supporter.
[41:49.600 --> 42:01.480]  So you've got a snot-nosed football coach who's a Hilary supporter, and he's a sore loser
[42:01.480 --> 42:03.000]  and doesn't like Trump.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.960]  So he organizes his punk football team to stay in the locker room.
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.500]  And then when there's a backlash against that, despite earlier, he said, we're doing this
[42:13.500 --> 42:17.560]  to be in solidarity and, you know, to fight all the racism, implying the flag's bad.
[42:17.560 --> 42:24.160]  But when there was a huge backlash, he came out and said, I implore you, I apologize yesterday.
[42:24.160 --> 42:26.960]  The article's on infowars.com with the video.
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.160]  He said, I'm sorry, we didn't mean that.
[42:29.160 --> 42:33.080]  We did it out of respect for the flag because we didn't want to be associated with this
[42:33.080 --> 42:34.080]  controversy.
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.120]  So they're at the heart of this.
[42:36.120 --> 42:37.360]  They're behind it.
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.800]  They're the worst team pushing and setting the precedent that other teams followed that
[42:42.800 --> 42:44.520]  day and the next day.
[42:44.520 --> 42:50.280]  And then when he gets his ass handed to him, this sore loser turns around and says, oh,
[42:50.280 --> 42:51.280]  that's not what I did.
[42:51.280 --> 42:52.280]  Oh, no.
[42:52.280 --> 42:54.760]  Actually, I'm against people taking a knee.
[42:54.760 --> 43:03.880]  So you have the owner and you have the coach begging fans not to abandon the team over national
[43:03.880 --> 43:05.360]  anthem protests.
[43:05.360 --> 43:08.040]  What world are we in?
[43:08.040 --> 43:20.800]  Then, of course, you have the famous Jamaican world champion runner last year who before
[43:20.800 --> 43:30.080]  there was even a controversy, Usan Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes
[43:30.080 --> 43:37.520]  of all time, showed respect for the national anthem without even being asked to.
[43:37.520 --> 43:39.280]  Because he'd show it for any anthem.
[43:39.280 --> 43:41.240]  He's a classy guy.
[43:41.240 --> 43:42.800]  He's a winner.
[43:42.800 --> 43:46.160]  And oh, people are getting medals up there.
[43:46.160 --> 43:47.480]  He's honoring the athletes.
[43:47.480 --> 43:48.600]  He's honoring the nations.
[43:48.600 --> 43:50.720]  He's honoring the nations that sent the people there.
[43:50.720 --> 43:54.160]  He's not a piece of crap.
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.080]  And by the way, they got polls out where over 65 percent of black Americans, that's with
[43:59.080 --> 44:00.080]  liberal pollsters.
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.560]  So they push him to not answer that way.
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.400]  But despite all the bullying, 60 plus percent of black Americans say, this is ridiculous.
[44:07.400 --> 44:09.280]  This is garbage.
[44:09.280 --> 44:11.680]  You imagine your hard work in black American.
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.280]  You want to just watch a football game with your family, your friends, probably your white
[44:15.280 --> 44:19.000]  friends or over your house, whatever, your buddies from work, everybody's taking knees.
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.200]  We're all hearing about racism all day and everybody's just trying to live their lives.
[44:22.200 --> 44:24.480]  We're sick of it.
[44:24.480 --> 44:25.480]  Are there black racists?
[44:25.480 --> 44:26.480]  Yeah.
[44:26.480 --> 44:27.480]  Are there white racists?
[44:27.480 --> 44:28.480]  Yeah.
[44:28.480 --> 44:29.480]  Let's get over it.
[44:29.480 --> 44:30.480]  There's serial killers too.
[44:30.480 --> 44:33.560]  There's child molesters.
[44:33.560 --> 44:36.120]  Doesn't mean everybody's guilty.
[44:36.120 --> 44:37.120]  Everybody's bad.
[44:37.120 --> 44:38.120]  And I'm sick of it.
[44:38.120 --> 44:48.760]  I know I keep saying I'm sick of it, but I'm really getting fed up.
[44:48.760 --> 44:55.120]  But the good news is everybody else is finally fed up because they invaded the final spaces.
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.000]  Movies, entertainment shows, football.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.400]  And folks are like, we're working 54 hours on average.
[45:01.400 --> 45:05.880]  Americans work more than anybody on earth in all studies.
[45:05.880 --> 45:10.120]  And we have the most extracurricular activities and we go to the most shows and movies and
[45:10.120 --> 45:11.120]  everything.
[45:11.120 --> 45:12.120]  We're busy people.
[45:12.120 --> 45:13.120]  We go to church.
[45:13.120 --> 45:14.120]  We go fishing.
[45:14.120 --> 45:20.800]  And we're like, man, I don't want to go to a football game or a basketball game or a
[45:20.800 --> 45:25.520]  baseball game and hear about how much I suck because when you sit there and say, my flag
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.360]  in my country is racist and my place is a piece of garbage, when nobody else would protest
[45:30.360 --> 45:36.440]  this way, it's disgusting and it's so over the top.
[45:36.440 --> 45:38.840]  It's the bridge too far.
[45:38.840 --> 45:41.640]  It's the straw that broke the camel's back.
[45:41.640 --> 45:44.760]  And there's no putting the Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[45:44.760 --> 45:51.640]  It's now being called the suicide of the NFL on the altar of liberalism by USA Today, by
[45:51.640 --> 45:54.160]  Town Hall.
[45:54.160 --> 45:57.480]  All these publications are now calling it the great suicide.
[45:57.480 --> 45:58.480]  Yes.
[45:58.480 --> 46:03.920]  And Hollywood committed suicide and MSNBC committed suicide and CNN committed suicide.
[46:03.920 --> 46:10.760]  And they can't believe as narcissistic borderline personality disorder mercenaries as scum, they
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.360]  tried to use race and all this to control people, they're just sociopaths, they can't
[46:15.360 --> 46:21.840]  believe that they're losing so they get even worse and start saying, he's KKK, he's white
[46:21.840 --> 46:27.120]  supremacist, he said all blacks are slaves and even CNN hosts that don't want to be destroyed
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.920]  by reality, they look to the other hosts and they say, listen, you know, that's not true.
[46:31.920 --> 46:34.000]  The public sick of this, stop it, stop it.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.200]  They can't stop.
[46:35.200 --> 46:36.400]  They can't stop.
[46:36.400 --> 46:37.720]  They can't stop.
[46:37.720 --> 46:45.680]  They can't stop.
[46:45.680 --> 46:51.760]  They can't do it.
[46:51.760 --> 46:55.760]  And so Antifa is announcing November 4th violence across the country.
[46:55.760 --> 46:59.680]  All this bullying is only going to intensify and they're going to do false flags and blame
[46:59.680 --> 47:00.680]  us.
[47:00.680 --> 47:01.680]  They can be the victims.
[47:01.680 --> 47:12.440]  But just realize we're living in a very, very historical moment right now.
[47:12.440 --> 47:15.600]  And Trump knows exactly what he's doing and that's why he's so awesome.
[47:15.600 --> 47:17.640]  Republicans blocked him, though.
[47:17.640 --> 47:19.080]  He couldn't get the tax cut.
[47:19.080 --> 47:20.480]  He couldn't get Obamacare repealed.
[47:20.480 --> 47:22.160]  He tried to get a good bill through.
[47:22.160 --> 47:26.000]  McCain turned his back on everybody at the last moment, even though he's dying of brain
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.200]  cancer, making his last preparations, he admits that back in the final rounds on TV, getting
[47:32.200 --> 47:35.440]  his life in order.
[47:35.440 --> 47:39.880]  He still saddles us with something designed to bankrupt health care and gouge the general
[47:39.880 --> 47:41.380]  public.
[47:41.380 --> 47:49.040]  Written by the fat cat, Republicans, bipartisanly, he still won't do the right thing, will he?
[47:49.040 --> 47:54.240]  But Judge Moore in Alabama was the anti-establishment candidate.
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.080]  Months ago, the GOP said, endorse Luther Strange, our candidate, and we'll work with
[47:58.080 --> 47:59.160]  you, Mr. President.
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.280]  And when he did, they stabbed him in the back and said, we're not even going to meet with
[48:02.280 --> 48:05.600]  you or talk to you on the telephone.
[48:05.600 --> 48:09.560]  That's Mitch McConnell.
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.440]  Trump reportedly in an Oval Office meeting months ago said, yelled at him and said, do
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.160]  the right thing for America.
[48:15.160 --> 48:18.320]  You know we're going to bankrupt the economy if you don't repeal this thing.
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.280]  And McConnell, that's been leaked, said, well, well, we have to have people who have their
[48:23.280 --> 48:24.280]  health care.
[48:24.280 --> 48:25.720]  And Trump says, you know, that's a load of crap.
[48:25.720 --> 48:28.280]  We're going to lose the whole system if you don't repeal this.
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.160]  And McConnell stormed out of there.
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.760]  Trump even appointed his wife to a high power position.
[48:34.760 --> 48:37.160]  It's not enough for McConnell to work with Trump.
[48:37.160 --> 48:38.160]  Trump's done everything.
[48:38.160 --> 48:40.320]  So you know who's to blame?
[48:40.320 --> 48:50.520]  Mitch McConnell, blue eyes, psycho man.
[48:50.520 --> 48:53.600]  Over there at the speaker of the house, Paul Ryan, they make me so sick.
[48:53.600 --> 48:58.840]  This is a major crossroads, bellwether, sea change, litmus test, canary in the coal mine
[48:58.840 --> 49:02.040]  for them, what happened in Alabama.
[49:02.040 --> 49:07.520]  They put $33 million against Judge Moore.
[49:07.520 --> 49:09.680]  Judge Moore had $2 million.
[49:09.680 --> 49:14.800]  The average contribution less than $20, $2 million to beat 30 plus mil.
[49:14.800 --> 49:15.800]  And they don't know what to do.
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.760]  The whole political establishment, Cole Rove, all these losers that were there running Luther
[49:19.760 --> 49:24.160]  Stranger's campaign, realize nothing on earth they can do can help them now.
[49:24.160 --> 49:31.320]  We come back to the extremely powerful excerpts of the Stephen Segal interview on Good Morning
[49:31.320 --> 49:32.320]  Britain.
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.440]  Segal, enemies within blocking Trump agenda, NFL, kneelers, disgusting.
[49:37.440 --> 49:39.840]  I've retweeted this at Real Alex Jones.
[49:39.840 --> 49:41.600]  Please get it out to everybody.
[49:41.600 --> 49:42.800]  It's powerful.
[49:42.800 --> 49:45.280]  He lays it all out.
[49:45.280 --> 49:49.320]  So that is coming up also before we go any further.
[49:49.320 --> 49:52.360]  Let's financially support the transmission.
[49:52.360 --> 49:56.840]  We have new immigrants essentials oils that are private labeled nature's brands.
[49:56.840 --> 50:00.520]  Nature's brands are already $5 less than the so-called leading brand that isn't even as
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.560]  strong as this.
[50:02.560 --> 50:05.240]  We're selling it for $5 less than they do in stores.
[50:05.240 --> 50:10.560]  So $10 less than the leading brand, $5 less than one of the other top brands that we private
[50:10.560 --> 50:11.720]  label it from.
[50:11.720 --> 50:13.400]  You're talking massive discounts.

[54:00.440 --> 54:22.440]  So, we got a bunch of globalists wanting to divide Congress.
[54:22.440 --> 54:30.280]  The country they're using race and sex to do it, male against female, black against
[54:30.280 --> 54:31.280]  white.
[54:31.280 --> 54:34.600]  And they're already kneeling and bitching and complaining at all the major football
[54:34.600 --> 54:39.800]  games and saying America's bad and acting like, you know, that the American flag is
[54:39.800 --> 54:42.640]  a KKK uniform or something.
[54:42.640 --> 54:46.240]  And so Trump says, I'm sick of this crap, you're a bunch of un-American garbage.
[54:46.240 --> 54:49.960]  You can kick somebody out of the game for doing an in-zone celebration, you can kick
[54:49.960 --> 54:54.280]  them out of the game for saying they, you know, hate America.
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.200]  And then they all whined and oh, you need to be impeached and oh, you're in trouble
[54:58.200 --> 55:04.000]  and ooh, the NFL, they showed solidarity with all the owners and all the players.
[55:04.000 --> 55:05.680]  Trump's in trouble.
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.800]  And I told you Saturday, day one, they're going to get says in trouble on Sunday.
[55:09.800 --> 55:13.280]  They're all going to lock arms, they're all going to have solidarity.
[55:13.280 --> 55:17.680]  They're all going to try to show the world that the NFL's king, but by later in the
[55:17.680 --> 55:22.040]  week, they're going to announce the NFL has crippled forever and has committed suicide
[55:22.040 --> 55:24.640]  and they'll be in full retreat.
[55:24.640 --> 55:26.720]  And exactly as I said, has now been announced.
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.160]  And I only tell you that because these are very clear things.
[55:30.160 --> 55:32.600]  We just finally are standing up.
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.160]  And that's why the globalists are so panicked and are throwing everything they've got out
[55:36.160 --> 55:43.080]  there now, because none of their bull works, Russian agents, KKK, all this garbage.
[55:43.080 --> 55:49.560]  Now this interviews up on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, newswars.com, please get it out of Dan
[55:49.560 --> 55:50.560]  Lyman article.
[55:50.560 --> 55:56.760]  Segal, enemies within, blocking Trump agenda, NFL, kneelers are disgusting.
[55:56.760 --> 56:00.400]  Renaissance man says leftover Obama nights, working to overthrow Trump.
[56:00.400 --> 56:02.800]  Here it is.
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.960]  And we have just, you know, a ton of enemies within.
[56:06.960 --> 56:15.880]  We have these, you know, Democrats that have this whole other agenda to kind of, when I
[56:15.880 --> 56:22.600]  say Democrats, it's not just the Democrats, but there are this whole group of leftover
[56:22.600 --> 56:33.480]  Obamaites and people who feel that they should really sort of kind of overthrow Trump.
[56:33.480 --> 56:42.200]  And any decisions he makes, anything that he tries to do, he gets blocked so often from,
[56:42.200 --> 56:45.000]  you know, sort of the enemies within.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.560]  So it's very difficult for him to do anything.
[56:47.560 --> 56:54.160]  When you see this ongoing debate right now about patriotism, the American flag, the anthem,
[56:54.160 --> 57:01.080]  black football players taking the knee as a mark of protest about racial division and
[57:01.080 --> 57:03.360]  injustice in America.
[57:03.360 --> 57:05.360]  Do you agree with Trump that it's disrespectful?
[57:05.360 --> 57:11.120]  Do you think actually going to one knee is not an entirely disrespectful way of making
[57:11.120 --> 57:12.120]  a point?
[57:12.120 --> 57:21.120]  I mean, I guess really what I'd like to say is this, I believe in free speech, I believe
[57:21.120 --> 57:26.720]  that everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but I don't agree that they should hold the
[57:26.720 --> 57:32.520]  United States of America or the world hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning
[57:32.520 --> 57:38.520]  in to watch a football game and, you know, imposing their political views.
[57:38.520 --> 57:39.960]  I think it's outrageous.
[57:39.960 --> 57:41.800]  I think it's a joke.
[57:41.800 --> 57:43.600]  It's disgusting.
[57:43.600 --> 57:50.640]  And, you know, I respect the American flag and I myself, you know, have risked my life
[57:50.640 --> 57:57.440]  countless times for the American flag and I don't understand or agree with this kind
[57:57.440 --> 57:58.440]  of behavior.
[57:58.440 --> 57:59.440]  I think it's an outrage.
[57:59.440 --> 58:04.560]  There will be some people, Stephen, who will be watching this interview, he's saying that
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.160]  and think you sound like a great patriotic guy, but they'll also see you in Moscow and
[58:09.160 --> 58:14.480]  being very complimentary about Vladimir Putin, who many Americans believe fixed the U.S.
[58:14.480 --> 58:17.440]  election, which is why Donald Trump became president.
[58:17.440 --> 58:21.440]  You know, how do you juggle the flag of the United States of America?
[58:21.440 --> 58:22.440]  Stay right there.
[58:22.440 --> 58:23.440]  We're going to go to Brighton.
[58:23.440 --> 58:24.440]  Come back with the next hour.
[58:24.440 --> 58:25.440]  Get to that.
[58:25.440 --> 58:26.440]  A bunch of other clubs, your calls, guests, you name it.
[58:26.440 --> 58:29.200]  Again, you can't even go to Moscow without being called a Russian.
[58:29.200 --> 58:32.680]  You can't go there and organize fights or go there and make movies.
[58:32.680 --> 58:34.040]  That's why I'm going to go to Russia soon.
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.360]  I mean, I'm not going to be controlled, but I do.
[58:36.360 --> 58:40.720]  Like I'm a Russian agent or Stephen Segal is because we love the American flag.
[58:40.720 --> 58:42.840]  I want to make America great again.
[58:42.840 --> 58:46.560]  That's why they hate Russia because Russia has become a sovereign nation again.
[58:46.560 --> 58:51.040]  It's ridiculous.
[58:51.040 --> 58:55.840]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[58:55.840 --> 59:00.200]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact
[59:00.200 --> 59:05.520]  that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in
[59:05.520 --> 59:08.840]  many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[59:08.840 --> 59:14.400]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.400]  and then processing.
[59:15.400 --> 59:20.960]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from
[59:20.960 --> 59:27.760]  chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the
[59:27.760 --> 59:31.920]  body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[59:31.920 --> 59:37.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.680]  and winning because of your support caveman is back in stock.
[59:41.680 --> 59:42.920]  People absolutely love it.
[59:42.920 --> 59:48.160]  So please secure your caveman today at info wars life.com or by calling toll free triple
[59:48.160 --> 59:53.760]  eight two five three three one three nine.
[59:53.760 --> 1:00:10.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:16.280]  Coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas,
[1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:39.960]  Alex Jones so you've got Piers Morgan who I really dislike because I know people that
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:45.520]  know him and I know that he's a closet conservative and back when we had our famous debate almost
[1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:52.880]  four years ago on CNN that they admit destroyed his career basically when I called him out.
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:55.400]  People behind the scenes said no no Morgan actually likes guns.
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:57.800]  He's really a conservative.
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:02.240]  And then later we learn that's the case and when liberals stop funding him, he goes back
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.280]  to England and becomes more of a conservative and it's been pro Trump.
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:12.960]  But he's again riding the fence here saying to Steven Seagal with that amazing red square
[1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:21.520]  behind him saying well okay you claim you love America but you're in Russia.
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:27.320]  And I love how Putin said to Megan Kelly in an interview he said Megan you keep saying
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:36.080]  Trump's bad for meeting me twice since he was president Megan you're constantly meeting
[1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:41.120]  me over the years that means you're a Russian agent and none of this even makes sense.
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:44.880]  I guarantee when I go to Russia I'm going to do the same shot with the red square behind
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:46.880]  me very iconic.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.040]  I want to see the Middle East.
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:49.360]  I want to see Russia.
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.200]  I've seen all over Europe and places.
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:54.200]  If I go to Germany it doesn't mean I'm German.
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:56.480]  If I go to Baghdad it doesn't mean I'm an Iraqi.
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:00.360]  And this is the mental illness where they want to bully everybody with political correctness
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:02.480]  now that oh it's the Russians too.
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:08.760]  You're not just a racist Mr. Seagal for supporting Trump as the media said now you're something
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:09.760]  even worse.
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:15.040]  You're a Ruski agent so here's Morgan at it again.
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:20.120]  There will be some people Stephen who will be watching this interview he's saying that
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:24.720]  and think you sound like a great patriotic guy but they'll also see you in Moscow and
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:30.440]  being very complimentary about Vladimir Putin who many Americans believe fixed the US election
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:34.200]  which is why Donald Trump became president.
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:40.880]  How do you juggle a lot of Americans are pretty unhappy about this.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:47.360]  Why don't we really be honest here Pierce let's let's be really honest.
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:51.240]  Every country is involved in espionage.
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:56.200]  Every single country the American spy the British spy the Russian spy we all spy on
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:02:57.200]  each other.
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:06.760]  Let's be honest however for anyone to think that Vladimir Putin had anything to do with
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:13.640]  fixing the elections or even that the Russians have that kind of technology is is stupid.
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:21.920]  And you know we have a situation here where really all of this is happening in my opinion
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:32.200]  from astronomical propaganda and this kind of propaganda is really a diversion you know
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:36.360]  from creating a diversion so that the people in the United States of America won't really
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:38.800]  see what's happening.
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:43.200]  And I think most of the people in the United States of America and most of the people in
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:49.640]  Russia want to like each other you know and we need each other.
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:55.360]  Russia and America should be great allies and that's the way it should be.
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:59.520]  Well I think that's absolutely right I agree with you.
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:06.840]  Final question Steve what are you up to movie wise at the moment any big movies coming.
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:13.040]  You know I just finished a movie called Detrition it's a movie about human trafficking it's
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:20.480]  a movie about kung fu it's a movie about honor and great action movie I'm just doing
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:26.360]  the post for it in Asia right now and so that's Steve Segal I want to get him on the
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:30.160]  show about the folks that don't they say he's a listener I told that like 10 years ago
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:33.160]  and he was like oh yeah Segal's a listener and then you see all this he's clearly a
[1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:34.160]  very very white.
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:37.920]  Oh they always spin that he says Putin's one of the greatest world leaders the council
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:42.920]  on farm relations and the CIA have said Putin's the most powerful man in the world until
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:49.000]  Trump came along because he's actually president he actually is calling shots you understand
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  how that works yes if you actually have a real president of a major country they have
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:58.680]  a lot of power we'll be right back stay with us.
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:03.480]  James Madison the father of the Bill of Rights wrote where an excess of power prevails property
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:09.280]  of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his faculties
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:14.440]  or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:19.440]  the only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from Washington
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:24.760]  to our local communities to the individual that is the ultimate concern the concentration
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:30.240]  of power the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:35.000]  it was why the anti-fetalists oppose the Constitution they believe they put safeguards in the Constitution
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.600]  to abuse that concentration of power but as James Madison also pointed out knowledge will
[1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:44.960]  forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:49.320]  with the power that knowledge gives arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are
[1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:54.360]  doing of what the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to
[1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:56.280]  nullify their actions.

[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:30.920]  all this kneeling kneeling to political correctness bowing your knee refusing to respect the flag
[1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:37.440]  of the country you live in you're saying I submit to globalism I overthrow any culture
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:44.240]  I was ever aligned with I hate my country I serve the power of the media and the power
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:52.560]  of George Soros that has ordered me to submit and to bow where have I heard of this active
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:09:17.560]  submission before I believe in free speech I believe that everyone's entitled to their
[1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:23.200]  own opinion but I don't agree that they should hold the United States of America the world
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:30.280]  hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game and you
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:36.880]  know imposing their political views I think it's outrageous I think it's a joke it's
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:45.240]  disgusting and you know I respect the American flag and and I myself you know have risked
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:52.200]  my life countless times for the American flag and I don't understand or agree with this
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:58.520]  kind of behavior I think it's an outrage that's good morning Britain and it's the truth we
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:04.480]  have best-selling author researcher filmmaker millions of viewers and listeners today Stefan
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:11.080]  Malinu joining us he's got a new book out we're going to be telling you about as well
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:15.280]  the art of the argument dot coms where you find it I've been telling my crew to carry
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:18.720]  it in the store here and we're going to be doing that very very soon I wanted to get
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:24.960]  him on last week just about the whole dream act and his point that you know he thinks
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:30.640]  Trump is starting to go sideways some on that and I agree Trump you know backing Luther
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:36.680]  Strange in Alabama who's an establishment guy and then he gets stabbed in the back by
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:44.820]  the Republican establishment who then wouldn't work with him on tax cuts or Obamacare so
[1:10:44.820 --> 1:10:53.000]  you see Trump being repudiated now by the Republicans stabbing him in the back and
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:11:00.480]  by the American people going for judge more despite the fact that he was outspent more
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.280]  than 10 to 1 he raised 2 million the establishment raised 33 million Carl Rove all the usual
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:16.520]  suspects came into Alabama where Carl Rove's from and ran this whole operation in the face
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:22.760]  of the Patriot movement so see the Patriots are defeating the Democrats the Republican
[1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:32.520]  establishment the globalist we're fighting uphill and winning trying to reboot America
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:38.040]  Trump understands that he's even said in the last few days hey I think I picked the wrong
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:43.640]  guy I was giving bad advice so Trump knows that but he tried to work with the Republican
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:47.920]  establishment okay I'll give you the guy you want the Senate give me the tax cuts so we
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:51.800]  can save the economy that's what he really wants to do he gets that if he can turn the
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:58.320]  economy around he put a 3% growth rate or more get the jobs back high paying jobs take
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:05.280]  care of the veterans do basic stuff that he wants to deliver you can read stories by people
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:08.480]  that have even written nasty you know books about Trump admitting he'd flip out of the
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:12.760]  food wasn't good flip out of the furniture wasn't nice if the golf course wasn't the
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:17.880]  best for his people that were you know coming and spending their money with him I mean Trump
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:22.680]  wants to give you what you're paying for give you what you voted for he's really trying
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:30.080]  to do it but he has begun to go sideways because the swamp what are you doing a swamp you sink
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:37.920]  into it but I'm thankful for cutting the carbon taxes cutting out the regulations cutting
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:44.360]  the illegal 69% coming into the country I'm very very thankful for killing the TPP I'm
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:53.600]  very very thankful for taking on ISIS I'm very very thankful for not letting Trump you
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:57.960]  know just be pushed around by the Islamists anymore there's been a lot of good and you
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:02.480]  know a man by his enemies the globalist hate his guts because he's taking power away from
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:09.280]  them but that said the fact that Trump and the Republican establishment were roundly
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:18.200]  repudiated even though Trump gave Luther Strange lukewarm support is very very exciting
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:22.440]  because it shows this isn't about Trump this isn't about Ron Paul it isn't about Matt
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:27.040]  Grudge it isn't about Alex Jones it isn't about Stephen Bannon it's about us it's about
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:33.560]  you it's about everybody together rediscovering Americana rediscovering that hey our system
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:40.760]  is a lot better than North Korea or Communist China or or or Venezuela and we are saying
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:48.680]  no to this and we don't care of the NFL bullies us we don't care if you call us white supremacists
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:54.160]  we don't care what you do there's a major global realignment against what you've done
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:59.720]  and the world is waking up to globalism and it's unelected authoritarian crony capitalist
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:05.680]  nature and the world saying no but why can't the establishment see it because they still
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:12.160]  watch the NFL they still watch Hollywood they still watch the news channels and they still
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:25.000]  think that's the dominant culture it's not it's uncool being a celebrities not cool who's
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:31.440]  the guy I never really followed Cheers but I watched it some his name Ted Danson he was
[1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:39.080]  the bartender I don't watch a lot of TV but we should pull up some of these ads he does
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:46.000]  he's sparing off vodka ads that are really good where he comes in and makes fun of himself
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.560]  and makes fun of being a celebrity and what a joke it is because if you're just somebody
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:54.000]  because you're a celebrity who cares if you write great books or you've got great ideas
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.400]  or you make good food or you climb amazing mountains or you write beautiful music or
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:04.000]  invent some type of medicine I mean then we admire you because we want to celebrate humanity
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:11.160]  together but just oh you're got a private jet and a red carpet and and you've got a
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:16.080]  political view you're gonna force fetus we're sick of that and I've been saying this for
[1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:20.200]  a decade but let me tell you something a decade ago I'd still get invited out to some Hollywood
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:25.200]  party they've said big private jets to pick me up I'd still okay jump on the jet fly
[1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:31.680]  over and do it in the last for 10 years I won't even do it because it's so empty it's
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:36.320]  like soul sucking and I thought well it must be LA something in the atmosphere is the reason
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:41.800]  I feel so bad when I'm here no then I've met in New York or I've met in the middle of nowhere
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:45.600]  with with Hollywood people a bunch of them and there's like something missing because
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:51.720]  they sold their souls folks it's it's spiritual you say well I don't believe in God I maybe
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:55.640]  I didn't used to until I got around this stuff you know I knew there was a God I wanted to
[1:15:55.640 --> 1:15:59.360]  believe in a God I don't want to think I just die at the end of this but you know you question
[1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:05.720]  things until you start really picking up on the energy of this so joining us for the rest
[1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:10.480]  of the hour and step on my one new with his new book out the art of the argument the art
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:15.920]  of the argument dot com and we'll get into the dream act and his Trump going sideways
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:22.160]  in the second part of the interview I want to get directly obviously as he does into
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:26.080]  the strategic genius of what Trump's done oh you for the third year you want to bitch
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:30.400]  and complain and hijack sporting events and take them over in your pity party when you're
[1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:34.720]  these you know guys worth hundreds of millions of dollars and all the rest of it he knows
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:38.440]  everybody's done with celebrity he's always been the blue collar billionaire he knows
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:44.880]  this is the time to make his move so he invokes them to attack him to show just how clear
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:51.520]  this attack on America is and it's now been called the suicide of the NFL they're now
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:55.520]  apologizing they're now backing off they're now hiring PR experts they don't know what
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:01.720]  to do so step on my one new I mean this just looks like pure victory to me what do you
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:07.920]  think well they're coming for everything that you love they're coming for everything that
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:12.600]  makes you happy they're coming for everything that gives you joy and satisfaction and connection
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:17.400]  and pride and community and yeah they're coming for your sports teams they're coming for your
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:23.360]  movies they're coming for your music the joyless people the joyless brigade of happiness eating
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:27.360]  zombies are coming and they're not going to stop until you push back they're trying
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:31.000]  to spread misery you know that old phrase misery loves company there's a profoundly unhappy
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.520]  discontented neurotic people and they kind of want to spread that mindset and they do
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:39.800]  that by making you feel terrible for everything that you might potentially enjoy until you
[1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:46.040]  have nothing left to defend and they can take over beautifully crystallized like only stuff
[1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:53.680]  I'm all new can do so as the as the shrillness and the drumbeat goes to fever pitch ramming
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:18:00.000]  speed when they've already turned it up to eleven where do they go next well I mean they
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:05.240]  will continue as they did in Soviet Russia as they're doing in South Africa they will
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:10.280]  continue to erase your history they will continue to strip down everything that you love and
[1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:14.880]  that makes you proud of where you came from oh do you like Shakespeare sorry just an old
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:19.720]  white racist dude ooh do you like Dickens you like Beethoven do you like John Locke no no
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.800]  no they were height bound they supported this that of the other it was all imperialism and
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:28.680]  evil and nastiness and terrible I mean it's just natural this is the corrosive effect
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:33.920]  that this kind of rampant hostility has towards a particular culture you know other cultures
[1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:39.360]  other world views are always trying to storm the ramparts of the west of the good and it
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:44.240]  is a terrible thing to to see and unfortunately we just have to pick up the culture weapons
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:49.520]  and and fight back why not just adopt the best parts of the west and the best parts
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:56.600]  of the east like Japan's done I mean why not just just adopt because the west is about
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:02.840]  adopting whatever works whatever is prosperous what why is there a war against that well
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:07.920]  I hate to say it Alex but it's it's sadly true there's a war against it because we pay people
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:13.360]  to do it you know whatever you subsidize you're going to get more of and if race baiting gender
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:18.640]  baiting hostility and rage and contempt and aggression and action against the society
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:23.520]  gets paid well then you know if you get a riot oh look let's spend more on welfare let's
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:27.960]  open up a youth center let's settle with people who've done egregious things with multi-million
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:32.200]  dollar lawsuits and so on so you keep paying for stuff the more that you pay people who
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:36.040]  whine and rage and complain the more of those people you're going to get and at some point
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:40.640]  the vending machine of white guilt has got a run dry you know if you keep pounding white
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:44.840]  people with racist sexist and so on and we keep coughing up resources to make this pounding
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:48.120]  go away we're just going to get more and more of it that's right we've been paying the pirate
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:54.520]  so long the pirates now eating the NFL it's it's a giant trillion pound spoiled rotten

[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:39.760]  it's in the wiki leaks want social conflict they want to guilt everybody into accepting
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:45.600]  their agenda not real free stuff in the long run for the masses but the backlash is so
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:52.240]  giant how do you expect them to counter strike and what else is on your radar the counter
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:59.160]  strike is of course the attempt to get the amnesty through right the DACA amnesty through
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:03.400]  that is the counter strike and I think that they're working feverishly overtime through
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:09.280]  the GOP and through other avenues through the media to try and get the amnesty as much
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:14.840]  as possible and of course this is going to be a true test of the future of the republic
[1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:20.400]  whether there's going to be a future of the republic or not it's very clear that the researchers
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:24.360]  in people in Mexico have an average IQ in the 80s it doesn't change you're importing
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:28.960]  a permanent underclass on average of people who are going to consistently vote for bigger
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:33.240]  and bigger government which is why Americans did give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:37.080]  and said okay he's not a politician you know he's not got much experience but he sure is
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:42.680]  talking about building a wall and controlling illegal immigration and possibly even getting
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:47.240]  rid of deporting or encouraging the self deportation of the tens of millions of illegal immigrants
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:51.760]  in the United States so people said okay I'm going to get involved I did I was not involved
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.880]  in politics for like 10 years of my public life I'm like okay this is an important enough
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:00.560]  issue and now of course now the best you can hope for is that the rejection of amnesty
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:06.160]  seems to be the best you can hope for as opposed to an end to DACA and the self deportation
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:10.960]  or deportation of people in America illegally and so this is one of these moments people
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:14.560]  have to make their calls they have to put their friendships on the line they have to
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:18.720]  make the case they have to call their congressman they have to reject as we saw what lives the
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:22.240]  strange recently they have to reject even the possibility of amnesty or they're going
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:27.720]  to lose the republic as sure as the sun is going to rise tomorrow well I think a lot
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:30.840]  of it's political it's the brainwashing of the populations that are brought in and how
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:36.600]  the schools are designed to never even have basic nutrition just even CNN just admitted
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:42.680]  last week massive IQ reductions with Florida water so so much of this is coming out I mean
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:46.200]  I know you get into more just the ineptitude of the elites and I tend to agree to that
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:51.840]  but they also kind of have an overarching plan where they admittedly say we're going to use
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:57.320]  diet injections injunctions Bertrand Russell said that we're going to use fluoride to dumb
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:01.840]  people down and I know it sounds crazy but they've done that well and there are other
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:07.120]  things as well of course if you hit your children it reduces their intelligence if you don't
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:12.600]  breastfeed for the recommended sort of 12 to 18 months it reduces intelligence IQ points
[1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:18.240]  and nobody knows how to recover it afterwards so there is a war on the minds of children
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:23.360]  and this needs to be reversed as well this is one of the reasons I talk a lot about parenting
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:27.360]  and positive parenting practices in my show because the children of course are the future
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:31.040]  of freedom but again right now I mean all of that stuff is going to show up in a general
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:33.880]  way let's talk about that I mean a hundred years ago they said we want assembly lines
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.840]  women and work formula for babies they knew it was wrecking them they knew it was creating
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:44.360]  basically soulless people to a certain extent and it's so sad what do people do in an economy
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:49.880]  set up where you're you cannot hardly survive and have kids unless you warehouse them well
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:54.040]  of course throughout most of our evolution Alex we survived on three berries and a rabbit
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:59.120]  leg a day you know so the idea exactly they built it where they've built all these expenses
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.400]  in artificially yeah I mean you don't need a giant house you know I'd rather live in
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:07.880]  a trailer and be home with my daughter than live in a mansion and ship her off to someplace
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:13.160]  you know the goal of the state has been for many years to separate parents from their newborns
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:16.640]  because of course you know we're kind of like ducks in a way we bond to whoever raises and
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:19.880]  if we're raised by the state then we're going to bond with the state we're going to view
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:23.760]  the state as not just a substitute parent but a primary parent and our actual parents
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.520]  is kind of like babysitters so if they can get you to hand over your babies to the state
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:31.040]  if they can get you all put them in daycare go back to work after six weeks or eight weeks
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:35.080]  don't worry people interchangeable people would just be able to take care of them they're
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.960]  just completely interchangeable relative to you as a mother or a father then you're going
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:42.600]  to get a kid who ends up bonding with the state and then when the state says oh we're
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:45.720]  going to take care of you we're going to people will say well what do I want my freedoms
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:49.560]  for I've got a lovely nanny state here that's going to take care of me women marry it for
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:55.440]  welfare kids marry it for pseudo education minorities marry it often for a bigger government
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:58.640]  and there are those of us out there saying the state is not your friend the state is
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:03.640]  a devil with a friendly mask but the mask is coming off very quickly look at Venezuela
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:08.200]  how many times is socialism have to end in a giant disaster for people to free I'm there
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:11.840]  was saying I want to be like Cuba where the health care is free they don't have any type
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:15.080]  of real health care in Cuba people come here from all over the world to get it and we have
[1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:20.560]  problems but it's just this we want communism it's like this West Point Army grad we're
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:24.000]  going to come back and talk about that with Stefan Malinu and get into a bunch of other
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:29.400]  subjects what does the victory of Roy Moore against the Republican establishment signify
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:34.480]  that's big we'll also look at where he thinks Mueller is going and other big issues but
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:40.480]  like Malinu said the designed attack to end the human community to break up the family
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:45.880]  is the greatest scientific evil of our age and it's on purpose by the robber baron super
[1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:54.880]  late we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the
[1:29:54.880 --> 1:30:02.600]  gcn radio network joe biggs here with info wars dot com with some patriotic quotes by
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:09.000]  ron paul the most basic principle to being a free american is the notion that we as individuals
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:14.680]  are responsible for our own lives and decisions we do not have the right to rob our neighbors
[1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:19.560]  to make up for our own mistakes neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how
[1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:24.880]  to live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights freedom to make bad decisions
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:29.720]  is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we are only free to make good decisions
[1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:35.520]  then we are not really free liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset
[1:30:35.520 --> 1:30:41.680]  when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints random searches mandatory identification
[1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:47.360]  cards and paramilitary police in our streets we have lost a vital part of our american
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:54.240]  heritage america was born of protest revolution and mistrust of government subservient societies

[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:09.160]  last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite
[1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:14.680]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:20.200]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of
[1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:25.320]  the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop

[1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:26.520]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live to the central
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:35.560]  texas command center it's alex jones you know 22 years ago we had liners some of these liners are
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:43.080]  19 years old same guy doing the voice people say a war a war on for your mind an information war
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:49.880]  well that's how the globalist and the social engineers saw it so i had to explain this is a war
[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:55.080]  a war for your mind we are a command center not to tell you what to think or what to do
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:01.560]  but to put out the information as best we see it so that folks understand there is a war happening
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:06.840]  and people have responded and steven bannon calls it a war and trump calls it a war because it is a war
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:14.200]  and once you understand that the globalists want to dominate anybody else they see a successful
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:20.360]  whether they'd be you know somebody live in africa somebody live in japan or you know somebody
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:27.640]  living in in in in europe it doesn't matter they want full control they're ruthless they're sociopaths
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.000]  they're psychopaths and we have to be strong and admit who they are and stand against them
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.560]  we're going to go back to stefan mollinum and cover a ton of this here in a moment but first off
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:41.960]  when you spread the articles and videos so that are at news wars dot com or info wars dot com
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:45.720]  that's a big act i mean they're doing everything they can try to censor us they're fighting to
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:50.200]  keep our information from the president so much of it he gets handed to him on the campaign trail
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:55.160]  now or out you know campaigning for different things on his agenda so you really do count
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:35:01.080]  with this president because he really does listen a week before this special election yesterday
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:05.880]  trump came out and said maybe i made a mistake i went with the establishment trying to make a deal
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:11.160]  on on repeal of obama care and tax cuts but he's now learned they're not going to deal with him
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:16.200]  he's a lot of the democrats are going to stab him in the back Mueller's not going to stop we've
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:20.680]  got to be there so the president knows when all the chips are down we're still here but even if
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:24.920]  they take him down which i know this is going to happen we're moving forward we're awake and this
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:29.080]  is happening globally they may try to arrest everybody in catalonia trying to make their own
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:32.680]  country which it's always been they may try to ban you know this special election they're
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:37.160]  going to lose the election and the people will just culturally be separate and spain will never
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:43.000]  stop them from separating because they're now just not complying with anything and it's game over
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.600]  and you can't put a permanent army there when catalonia supplies spain with most of its productivity
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:55.160]  it's over so the breakaway you see in catalonia is like the atlas shrug of the modern world we'll
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:59.560]  talk about that with stephan mollinum here in just a moment but first i mean i mean these are crazy
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:04.600]  headlines where troops on the streets are resting all the catalonian leaders putting them in an
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  internment facility in a western country that's a new spanish civil war right there ladies and

[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:24.920]  and speaking of plugs we're in a culture war you may already know a lot of what's
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:28.760]  stefan malin is talking about or what i'm talking about and i get that so when i'm preaching at
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:34.440]  idiots out there i'm talking to the lost sheep i'm talking to the uh prodigal sons because you
[1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:37.560]  know hey we know you're already awake it's the folks that aren't really trying to reach out to
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:42.360]  but you know really i'm more and more disagree with that because those of us that are awake
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:45.640]  have just got to take care of ourselves and then wake up those that are ready to listen
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:51.080]  and what a great thing to read and donate to the local library or what a great thing to give to
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:57.080]  your your judge or your doctor or your principal or your neighbor or your professor or your husband
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:03.400]  or wife the art of the argument stefan malin available right there on the art of the argument
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:08.600]  dot com let's spend a few minutes on your book and how it's uh comports and fits into what's
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:13.160]  happening uh today and then let's get back into world events that are taking place
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:19.480]  well the goal of course is that we wish to negotiate according to reason and evidence
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:23.880]  our differences all people are going to have differences and that's productive you know it
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:28.760]  is the sparks that sharpen the sword it is the creative destruction of rational disagreement
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:35.000]  that moves our species forward and upwards uh in in morality in rationality and civilization
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.920]  so we basically are always going to have disagreements we're either going to resolve them
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:44.280]  according to reason and evidence or we're going to have to use the fist the gun the club the state
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:50.440]  in one form or another and of course my goal uh in in writing the book and in publicizing the
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:55.320]  book is to get people to understand how essentials how essential arguments are to civilization they
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:41:01.480]  are civilization and how to make them how to spot sophistry and to motivate people to pursue
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:07.560]  the art of the argument and the art of the argument is a way to convince people with no
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:12.120]  threats it's a way to convince people with no force and it gives you your best chance at
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:17.240]  advancing your arguments in an increasingly anti-rational society you know we've got people
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:21.640]  who are like oh if you're a conservative and you want to speak at a left-wing campus man you
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:25.800]  what is it they got to spend a million dollars or more on security just to give you that chance
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:29.480]  we got people getting shouted down we got people showing up with menstrual blood or
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:34.280]  simulations of menstrual blood all over they're screaming shaking their fat arms and screaming
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:40.040]  about things this is not how civilization works civilization works when we listen to each other
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:44.680]  we commit to rationality and we submit to the better argument that's how you can't lose an
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:49.080]  argument because if you've proven wrong you've got the truth which is more valuable than whatever
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:54.280]  you had before so it is my goal to remind people all the way from the Socratic method forward
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:59.240]  just how important the argument is how much you need to commit to it because the alternative
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:05.240]  is living hell on earth continue here because I've been jumping in on you and interrupting get
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:10.520]  into your main philosophy what you're focused on right now you know the battle for Trump you know
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:16.520]  the battle for nationalism but I think this Roy Moore election landslide 15 plus points
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.480]  shows that Trump rode in on this wave he isn't the wave and again I'm not abandoning Trump he's
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:25.160]  he's doing a lot of good it's just that he's surrounded we have to realize we can't just count
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:34.360]  on Trump it's us well what happened to Trump's people you know as you know Alex personnel is
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  policy you don't just magically have a policy that animates itself and writes itself and broadcast
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:45.800]  itself personnel is policy and upwards of 20 people who were part of the campaign who were
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:51.400]  part of the Trump train have left the administration and the question is why certainly they did not
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:55.720]  want to get into politics or want to go through the hell of that brilliantly ran campaign in order
[1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.800]  to leave I think a lot of it has to do with these endless investigations right we're talking
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:05.400]  Robert Mueller's Russian witch hunt to me this strikes me as a soft judicial coup because what's
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:10.920]  happening is people are being hit with these unbelievably high ever escalating ever increasing
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:14.600]  legal bills we've got people in the Trump administration talking about having to liquidate
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:20.840]  their children's college funds in order to be able to pay off these legal bills from this witch
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:26.440]  hunt so to me this is a way of using a legal lawfare for a soft judicial coup to remove the
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:31.800]  people who drove the Trump train who drove the agenda and get them out and then replace them
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:38.040]  with the usual big globalist Goldman Sachs GOP insiders in a way of defusing the entire momentum
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:44.440]  of it and it's a way of making sure that what Trump ran on which was no amnesty and no DACA
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:49.560]  and deportations to make sure that that gets diluted so that the rich GOPs have their cheap
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:55.560]  gardeners and nannies and the left half their voters so I think that there is a very dangerous
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:59.720]  thing that is going on in America which is the will of the people is being directly thwarted
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:07.560]  in a highly visible way how do we accelerate this cultural victory
[1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:17.160]  well people don't have the capacity to judge rationally as yet you know it's been scrubbed
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:22.200]  out of our education the trivium is gone socratic method is gone reason evidence economics logic
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:28.280]  is all gone so and sadly you have to use some sophistic tricks and most important of what you
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:32.840]  have to be is committed people can't judge your arguments but they can judge your level of commitment
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:37.000]  and if you're committed people are going to start you start to take you more seriously now of course
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.200]  you want to be committed not looking like you should be committed so you know it's important
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:45.320]  to be passionate but not crazy although obviously the line is a little blurry sometimes but if you're
[1:44:45.320 --> 1:44:49.880]  certain if you're passionate if you're committed to what it is that you're into people will get
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:54.600]  interested in it because most people are pretty foggy and will they're like leaves on a stream
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:58.920]  or or dandelion fluffs in the wind they wherever the wind is blowing that's where they're gonna go
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:03.640]  so you have to be a hurricane of willpower and that's what's gonna take people and you know
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:07.240]  that's one of the reasons i've always enjoyed your show is hurricane of willpower should really be
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:16.360]  your middle name now looking at this nfl thing i think it's a genius thing that trump did and
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:19.960]  clearly under the nfl was gonna lose now they're calling it the suicide of the nfl now they're
[1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:25.160]  trying to pull back out of it but their players aren't gonna stop how do you see that train wreck
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:30.920]  ending well people are gonna have to discover their economic power it's economic incentives that
[1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:35.080]  are driving this as we mentioned earlier when people complain they get money showered on them oh
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:40.040]  gosh you know i give my kid candy when they're whining and all i'm doing is buying myself more
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:44.440]  whining and so people are gonna have to as they've seen with some of the universities like the social
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:49.400]  justice universities have seen their enrollments drop like 40 percent or more and so people are
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.640]  gonna have to remember their economic power when it comes to directing this discourse the social
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:58.360]  justice warriors do not infect organizations to improve them but to destroy them they're like
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:01.720]  it's like looking at termites in your house and saying well i'm sure they're just here to build
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:06.360]  me a nice cozy extension no they're there to eat and they're just going to eat until the house
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:11.880]  collapses so the nfl is looking at what up to 200 million dollars of last revenue because people
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:16.280]  are tuning out now that's good in a way i mean sports is i love to play sports i'm not such a
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:21.640]  big fan of watching sports and so maybe what people can do is take their time that they used to spend
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:26.680]  watching sports educate themselves about what's going on in the culture warts and start to participate
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:31.400]  rather than watching overly steroid half-brain damaged people run into each other on a taxpayer
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:39.960]  funded field well exactly i mean the nfl became americana and then the nfl thought it was america
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:44.600]  when the commissioner on saturday told trump no we didn't disrespect america or the veterans you
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:49.160]  disrespect the nfl the arrogance that's like marianne twanette i mean we know marianne
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:53.400]  twanette historically didn't really say let them eat cake that was that was revolutionary
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:58.040]  propaganda but they were very arrogant and disconnected from the starving people that
[1:46:58.040 --> 1:47:04.520]  then stormed the Bastille and that is a real marianne twanette type statement about no you
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:11.160]  disrespected the nfl i mean i could see a bunch of veterans that their arms and legs blown off
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:15.880]  and then now the country isn't taking care of them protesting during the anthem not to attack the
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:20.760]  flag but to say this is in america anymore and flying flags upside down that's the only kind of
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:25.720]  group that i think could could do that and have a reason to do it no it's the opposite it's a bunch
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:32.600]  of spoiled rotten babies uh just that are virtue signaling and it just shows how disconnected they
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:37.560]  are and how it's they claim we're in an echo chamber as libertarians or conservatives and
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:42.840]  you know just rational thinkers but they're really the ones that are in the echo chambers i invite
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:46.440]  them on all the time so-called liberals they won't come on because they don't want to have a real
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:52.840]  debate they are scared of that debate well they're interested in power they're not interested
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:57.480]  in conversation which is why they're sophists like a sophist is someone who doesn't want to
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:01.720]  provide you with information doesn't want to empower you but wants to control you by inflicting
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:07.560]  emotionally charged and often bullying conclusions on everything that you say to try and frighten you
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:11.000]  into south censorship you know america but the first amendment it's pretty tough to censor
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:15.160]  people legally but you can keep attacking them you can try and destroy the source of their income
[1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:21.240]  you can attack attack them all over the place uh and and that way you can get people to self-censor
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:26.120]  and of course we have to resist that that is the fear of ostracism that we have to overcome the
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:31.960]  left knows that people who aren't leftists are sensitive to ostracism are sensitive to how they're
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:37.240]  perceived socially and they use that to attack you and we have to resist that and say that the
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:42.760]  the bad opinion of bad people is a badge of honor and we have to be less sensitive to that you know
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:46.760]  that they've been horrible fights throughout history to try and make the world a more free place
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:51.880]  and the fact that we have to basically deal with mean typing on the internet makes it about the
[1:48:51.880 --> 1:48:56.760]  easiest battle we've ever had to face you know look at the psalm in world war one or the the
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:01.320]  civil war or whatever you want i mean the demand of bloodshed that has been spilled for freedom
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:06.520]  now all we have to do is get over you know mean tweets and we have to fight that kind of war
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:11.960]  oh no they might say something mean about me well i think people are waking up to the fact
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:16.760]  that if bad people are saying bad things about you that puts you on the sunny side of the field
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:26.280]  stefan malinu is our guest here today matt drudge is a story on info wars dot com
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:32.680]  drudge slams gop no different than dims and what will be slamming is the gop leadership
[1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:37.240]  that is blocking all this the freedom caucus are wonderful folks we've almost got control
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:42.600]  the gop it's why they're fighting so hard but but drudge is absolutely right and again we have
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:47.320]  trump's tax reform plan with dramatically lower taxes for the wealthy right down to the working
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:51.800]  poor and it's the republicans blocking it the answer is what we just saw in alabama
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:57.000]  in this primary the answer is remove their asses and with drudge at the head of that
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.280]  the number one website in the world not just you know site but total site we can target
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:10.200]  each one and we can show what these people have done and go after them well then it comes back
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:13.960]  to this question of amnesty and immigration and i sort of hate to keep beating that drum but it
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:18.360]  really is the only drum that matters right now look at the total cost of illegal immigrants
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:24.120]  and their kids they oh they outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by about seven
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:31.320]  to one right so they cost 135 billion a year and they pay taxes at the rate of 19 billion a year
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:37.320]  so per illegal alien american taxpayers are on the hook for over $8,000 a year uh and citizen child
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:41.880]  and uh that's before the taxes are paid in just under seven thousand a year after taxes are paid
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:47.240]  so i'm a big fan of tax cuts but if you're gonna start talking about amnesty uh then you're gonna
[1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:51.080]  have a no that's right you gotta you gotta cut spending for you to the taxes or do them together
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:56.920]  i want to come back and ask stuff on malinu what the world looks like if we fail if the west if

[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:35.240]  going to your calls on the nfl on north korea uh on establishment gop senator retires rather than
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:40.680]  risk primary challenger gop establishment for his backlash following roi moors victory in alabama
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:47.640]  that's bob corker the word is flake isn't going to run again and you see them all arrogant laughing
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:54.840]  at trump laughing at america the nfl their con men it's all they do so remember it's i mean just a
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:55:00.280]  few days ago the nfl's really showed trump they're invincible there's nothing you can do we're gonna
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:05.400]  piss all over the flag we're gonna tell you america's evil you shut up you're gonna kneel to us and do
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:12.680]  what we say and a few days later we're sorry please come back you know what oh oh the president just
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:17.560]  talked to jerry jones he's gonna have him stand with their hands over their hearts oh my gosh we want
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:23.640]  to watch a bunch of guys forced to hold their hands over their hearts i mean the capitulation now even
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:29.640]  makes it more weak do you agree with that stephan malinu oh it's uh it's completely ridiculous the
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:34.920]  nfl has clear standards that say you gotta stand your hand over the heart when the national anthem
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:40.360]  plays and it's a fireable offense to break that contract yeah your entertainers you signed a contract
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:46.680]  you're on a stage do it yeah it's like well i may be the lead in the midst but i don't feel like
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:50.840]  singing tonight it's like sorry that's kind of the gig you know you've got some rules i may be a top
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:56.040]  tennis player but i'm not gonna play tennis today i'll be an actor but i'm not facing a camera it
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:01.240]  makes me nervous right so uh no this is all uh silliness because people say well i want free
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:06.440]  speech and then if there are any negative social consequences to that free speech they then say
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:11.320]  i'm being censored now again if people like make up lies about you and so on that's a whole
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:16.680]  but isn't that it that once they get you to go yes we hate nazis yes we hate nazis okay let's
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:22.520]  ban nazis okay ban nazis now everybody's speech is banned but ours we're not gonna let you have any
[1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:27.320]  free speech rally at berkeley but then the next day the anti-fucking march and then beat up info
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:31.560]  wars reporters i know i wanted to ask you about the future if you do five more minutes the next
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:37.400]  hour i want to get to that in just a moment but step on then then that's my question as and i know
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:40.760]  that says five times but this is what i keep thinking it's kind of like a computer program or
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:46.360]  the bubble of death or the wheel of death i can't get the answer how do they escalate now i guess
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:50.760]  just towards more violence because they just get more and more shrill they think they're not freaking
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:56.280]  out or bullying enough so they are getting more aggressive more violent what happens i you know
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:00.920]  i think that the violence is blowing back on them a little bit alex i think that uh people are
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:08.200]  looking at uh bloody conservatives and saying hmm that does not seem quite right they're not exactly
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:12.760]  nazis uh and even if they were this is why you can't give an inch to the left they're relentless
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:19.160]  they will continue they want darker and it's like america bomb the nazis into into a steaming crater
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:24.920]  and somehow we're the nazis now no we killed them you can't you you have to defend nazis because
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:30.520]  the left won't stop at nazis that's all well is it okay to punch nazi well i don't like nazis so i
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:35.880]  guess so okay hey guess what you're now a nazi boom boom boom so they're all but you have to stop on
[1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:40.280]  principle you have to push back on principle you have to defend free speech of people you disagree
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:44.040]  with because otherwise they're going to appeal to your emotions say well if you just spend the
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:48.360]  friend to defend the free speech of nazis you must like nazism it's like no i just know what the
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.200]  next thing is which is you're going to define me as a nazi and i'm going to get a bike lock to my
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:58.360]  bold bold forehead so you have to push back on principle because i think the the violence
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:02.040]  tactic is is pushing back it's blowing back on them so i think what they're going to do is they're
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:07.080]  going to try and go to social media sites they're going to try and influence some kind of censorship
[1:58:07.080 --> 1:58:12.760]  on social media sites i think that being out in the open and being violent uh the the movement is
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:15.880]  not there yet they'd love to get there but i don't think they're there yet so i think they're going
[1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:21.160]  to try other ways to to suppress the voices that they disagree with rather than as they should engage

[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:07.480]  bigger paul gets and he works with us in fact i've been too busy to hold the moment malinu
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:12.120]  worked with us some it's just we're all this is this is survival folks civilization is a very
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:18.200]  thin veneer you lose this thing you lose everything we all have children i know stefan does i do and
[2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:26.040]  it really focuses you and i think magnifies what your previous personality all already was and i
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:31.240]  already cared out of self-preservation not of a some great altruistic thing now i really care
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:35.880]  as a civilization everywhere else starting to collapse and people trying to dynamite it
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:40.680]  because they can manage the collapse and get more power and then rule some road warrior type
[2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:45.000]  scenario so step on the three four minutes we got left what does it look like if we fail
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:52.120]  what it looks like alex is i want to just imagine this scenario like imagine so you're
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:56.520]  straight but imagine you live in a society where you have to every day pretend that you're gay you
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:00.040]  got a man to a guy you gotta or if you're gay you gotta pretend that you're straight no that's
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:04.520]  happened in the past if you have to falsify everything about yourself just to get through the
[2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:10.360]  day that is a hideous existence that anybody with a shred of integrity finds at the very
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:16.040]  bottom of the dantian levels of hell so if if we lose and we're not allowed to speak our minds
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:19.960]  and we're not allowed to be honest we're not allowed to engage in debate we have to falsify
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:25.320]  everything about ourselves every day we have to pretend and mouth slogans we pretend to conform
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:30.040]  to and mouth slogans that we find despicable we have to kneel down before mediocrities and
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:35.240]  non-entities and idiots and we have to live in fear of negative repercussions just for being
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:41.240]  honestly and authentically ourselves anybody who doesn't find that a literal hell is not somebody
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:45.720]  who's even worthy of being free but i would find it a hell i suspect most of your listeners would
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:51.560]  find that a kind of living hell as well to have to lie and bow and scrape and falsify means you
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:55.800]  can't ever be honest with anyone you can't experience love because love is around truth
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:59.960]  and honesty and virtue you can't be loved you can't tell the truth to your children you've
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:04.600]  got to shut up at the family dinner table you've got a kowtow to ridiculous slogans that are so
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:11.160]  illogical it's completely ridiculous and you have to falsify everything live in fear live as a slave
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:15.720]  live as tax livestock so that your productivity gets grabbed off and shoveled off to people
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:19.240]  who are going to vote for more and more people to oppress you you'll never be able to tell the
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:24.120]  truth you'll never be able to be honest you'll never be able to be authentic and that is what a
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:33.240]  zombie life is like no truth no honor no dignity no love no virtue that is the kind of living death
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:40.280]  we are condemned to at an emotional level if we lose and that's why i'll do almost anything to win
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:47.240]  wow and it's an attack on free will and that's living death and that's why
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:51.720]  tyranny always collapses collectivism does because the producers finally just give up
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:56.840]  commit suicide do whatever and then all the parasites are just left to kill each other
[2:03:56.840 --> 2:04:05.480]  it turns you from a soulful thinker into a mere meaty machine of exploited productivity you are
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:09.960]  turned into something less than an animal human beings what do we have the choice we have the
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:14.920]  choice to be human or nothing we don't have the choice to descend to the animal because we can't
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:19.880]  rip out the neofrontal cortex we can't just pretend that the last 200 000 years of evolution
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:25.320]  didn't happen the choice is humanity or nothing and that nothing that we've already made this
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:33.080]  transition we either go to the stars or fall into oblivion that's that's correct and everything that
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:38.520]  is so beautiful and everything that is so much to be treasured in life has to do with our capacity
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:45.000]  to be honest and the people the vicious soulless people out there who attack you for honesty
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:49.240]  even if you're wrong so what if you're wrong be corrected be corrected we all make mistakes we all
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:52.920]  should be that's right powerful stuff i'm malin and please join us again soon thank you so much

[2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:04.040]  gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is writing about it but the realtors are still embarrassed
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:08.920]  to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call uncle travis's guns
[2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:14.360]  and canned foods militia vision of preparedness well the ants may have the last laugh on the
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:19.240]  grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money but maybe you don't

[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:28.440]  but the demographics the political numbers show that he'll win that senate seat handily
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:44.840]  more than 10 to 1 what's 2 million versus versus 33 million that is a huge victory for the grassroots
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:53.320]  that's a huge victory for the constitutional movement that's taken over the republican party
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:59.320]  to a great extent and you know that paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and all of them
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:08.760]  feel us breathing down their necks and old mccain feels bls above lucifer the devil the
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:16.920]  old serpent breathing down his neck as well and now donald trump's come out and said roymore will
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:22.360]  help make america great again yeah no trump was told we'll give you your tax cuts just back our gop
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:28.200]  candidates and they immediately betrayed so trump's learning they're not going to work with him
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:35.320]  so i want to take your phone calls then we've got some other video clips i want to get to that
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:44.520]  are very very important there are so many but i want to play this clip first because i haven't
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:56.520]  gotten to this this shows that hillary is just like a broken toy where only
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:03.000]  two of the wheels are working a little car where it just goes in circles and kind of runs into the
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:10.440]  wall hillary clinton has come out on national television and said she's concerned donald trump's
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:26.680]  killing journalist now you've got this giant swath this this huge wake like a big ship just came by
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:31.240]  of dead bodies behind the clinton's hundreds and hundreds some of them lived we've interviewed
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:39.000]  where bill clinton's body cards come in and break both your legs both your arms break your esophagus
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:43.080]  think they've killed you and you know ambulance gets there hours later and you live i mean those
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:46.440]  are real people that have been interviewed we've interviewed them where they're telling them we're
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:50.760]  going to kill you for bill clinton punching you in the neck because your videotaping was jennifer
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:58.520]  flowers i mean the arab spring funding the al-qaeda takeovers i'm not going to go over all the crimes
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:02.440]  the clinton's she's blaming him for not doing enough about portorico and we've got massive aid
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:06.920]  portorico still has no power pray for the folks portorico absolutely and support them
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:12.680]  but we got hit in texas and florida i mean this is just mexico's had a bunch of earthquakes and
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:19.880]  volcanoes and i mean it's just it's you now got a quote fake news reporter who made fun of
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:26.520]  hillary was found dead in his house in phoenix yesterday so you want to know about dead reporters
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:34.840]  the only dead reporters i see around here are people opposing the globalist you know bryde bart
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:44.520]  so establishment gop senator retires rather than risk primary challenger you got that good news
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:53.400]  but we've got hillary says hopefully authoritarian trump hasn't ordered the killing
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:12:57.560]  of people and journalists that's like saying hopefully hillary didn't need a hundred pounds
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:02.200]  of horse manure this morning i mean she didn't eat a hundred pounds of horse manure but i say
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:08.040]  hopefully you know hopefully she's not raping her wife umma abedin hopefully
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:15.240]  so i saying how do you rape your wife are you a child molester and we know she defends
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:19.320]  child molesters is surrounded by him i'm not being tongue-in-cheeked there i was about
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:24.040]  you know asking to eat a hundred pounds of horse manure fresh out of the stables every morning
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:30.920]  but this statement is see trump's killing journalists this is just their next level of
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:38.440]  okay white supremacist russian agent didn't work rapist didn't work none of this work well he's kkk
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:46.280]  she said he goes after black athletes but not kkk yeah the kkk he doesn't have one person
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:49.480]  getting paid five million dollars a year the kkk is a joke
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:57.000]  the kkk are idiots i've protested the kkk many times but when it got so politically correct
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:01.400]  i don't even get the middle of it because most of them are feds i'm not going up these black
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:06.360]  lives matter things i'm just staying out of it they're all idiots kkk blm all of it just

[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:31.160]  of people and journalists and then she goes into how he's kkk
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:42.040]  kkk and of course she did praise former kkk leader robert bird

[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:45.880]  here's a short clip but i don't think he really values democracy charlie okay so he doesn't buy
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:51.240]  a democracy no i don't i think he i think he want he's not a democrat little d no he's not
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:56.760]  he's a top-down guy and he's an authoritarian he's a he he has tendencies toward authoritarianism
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:16:01.320]  he's no different than budin well he you know hopefully hasn't ordered the killing of people
[2:16:01.320 --> 2:16:08.280]  and journalists and the like but when they brought that up in the campaign at the debates
[2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:14.280]  trump said okay where has he killed somebody because i went and looked and he's never even been charged
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:20.360]  or implicated and then it turned out they got all these foundations in russia they've spent
[2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:25.640]  a hundred plus billion dollars since 1993 trying to topple russia
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:33.960]  i mean i mean they spent five billion in just one year overthrowing ukraine looked the numbers up
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:36.520]  so let's get this straight
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:44.520]  right every time one of these people got killed it was some foundation leader
[2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:51.000]  or some quote western back journalist group that got paid a bunch of money and didn't deliver
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:57.240]  or were double agents for putin and when the cia run by the globalist found out
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:03.080]  that somebody was a double agent for putin they were arrogant enough in russia to kill their ass
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:07.480]  and what i'm telling you from the highest levels so all these journalists and people you heard putin
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:11.640]  killed putin doesn't need to kill anybody he has an 80 plus percent approval rating and has for over
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:18.760]  a decade the people getting killed or have been discovered to be double agents who double cross
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:25.880]  george soros and then they recycle it and go oh look this reporter that was anti putin
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:32.120]  got shot in the back of the head or got run over or got kidnapped or got given cyanide
[2:17:35.960 --> 2:17:40.520]  when it's all complete bull there are all these opposition parties all this opposition media
[2:17:40.520 --> 2:17:43.400]  governors thumbing their nose at putin doing whatever they want in russia
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:49.080]  who's just one guy on the swamp and i'm not even lionizing him but i've gone and looked at who's
[2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:54.280]  been killed i went and actually researched who they were and it's every time somebody that took
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:18:01.000]  that money from the west but didn't fully use it and didn't follow their orders because once you
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:05.880]  take that money what kind of orders you think you get you're not just a journalist now you're a spy
[2:18:05.880 --> 2:18:09.960]  we want you to go do this we want you to go do that we want you to go kill this person
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:14.040]  and then they get scared and they go listen i don't want to kill somebody or i don't want to
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:19.800]  plant stuff and the russians go well thank you for that information boom it's all being tracked
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:26.520]  the person that does that he gets their neck broken an hour later so there's been an aggressive
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:33.320]  western intelligence operation in russia that the russians have been kicking out to a certain
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:40.920]  extent but russia is a mess overrun with foreign agents george soros publicly operates there
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:46.120]  publicly says he wants to overthrow the russian elected government and then a year ago putin
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:52.280]  finally said that's it your open society crap is over your anti christian your anti russia
[2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:58.200]  you're banned and they went oh my god he banned these groups the the united states ought to be
[2:18:58.200 --> 2:19:03.720]  banning chinese groups and mexican groups and globalist groups and the vatican and and their
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:08.600]  and their cardinals over here in america saying overthrow america and the borders you know what

[2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:13.560]  well just this morning we had the headlines that paul ryan was pushing tax increases but now
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:19.480]  the republicans are given a press conference the house and senate leadership the usual suspects that
[2:24:20.200 --> 2:24:26.040]  the president wanted a 15 percent corporate tax i've been with the lowest in the world instead
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:32.040]  of the highest and that uh they're going to give him 20 and they claim they have a deal we'll see
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:36.680]  if they get it rammed through the house and the senate and i'm all about cutting our tax so it's
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:40.600]  lower than china's corporate rate so the tens of trillions of dollars outside the country comes
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:45.720]  back in that is a tax cut for all americans major incentive more important than even cutting
[2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:50.760]  regulations at this point that would be a shot in the arm they they wrote the laws so the jobs
[2:24:50.760 --> 2:24:55.480]  would go outside the country so that's even as big as turning our coal back on but what i really
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:59.800]  want to see is a middle-class tax cut and not because i'll get a little bit more money i haven't
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:04.600]  even paid myself this year i am putting everything back into the operation i want to win against the
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:12.520]  globalist to have a future but i know that just the idea that taxes might get cut under obama the
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:20.840]  average person making 200 000 a year pays 45 percent that means you're keeping like a hundred
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:27.080]  to five thousand dollars and folks it's the middle class that buys most of stuff and creates the
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:34.200]  economy that people have discretionary income you you cut that 45 percent you know me if you go back
[2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:39.800]  to 30 35 something like that i mean you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of people
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:45.480]  that don't hoard it they spend it on restaurants and cars and buying boats getting their hair done
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:52.920]  and going on vacations and i mean that's the people we need with the money the plan calls for
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:58.440]  cutting the corporate tax right from 35 to 20 the g.o.p. proposed also calls for reducing the
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:05.480]  number of tax brackets from seven to three with a surcharge on the wealthiest americans as long as
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:10.600]  they're not exempt i'm so sick of these rich guy taxes and then they write loopholes to get out of
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:16.200]  it like we're oh but if you move over short seas then you're not you know we don't pay it so what
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:23.320]  do they say the devil is always in the details trumps always late which is fine he builds expectation
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:27.240]  he was set to speak six minutes ago we'll try to go to that as soon as he does but let's start going
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:33.800]  to your calls dan zack timothy ryan bruce they're all on the nfl and again the nfl is a diversion
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:41.000]  but them picking their fight over the nfl trying to make their move to turn us all into sjw is it
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:47.560]  failed big and this is a big victory and the the slobs at the nfl are now in full retreat
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:53.240]  so trump wins again we went again this is a big one uh dan in indiana you're on the air welcome
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:27:01.080]  yes i want to talk about one reason one reason they can take a knee and then ten times at
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:07.080]  the end times in why the rapture is relevant yes you hear that okay they should take the knee
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:13.000]  in the Lord's prayer that's what they should be taking the knee for and then the ten signs
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:20.120]  that are in times is wars and rumors of wars and you can find that in Matthew 24 six seven
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:27.560]  then you got them and them and testaments and earthquake find that in Matthew 24 seven eight
[2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:33.160]  then you have sir i agree with you i think we're seeing a lot of biblical stuff right now
[2:27:34.200 --> 2:27:41.320]  well you ask why we got all this stuff happening and it's predicted that this will happen and then
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:51.400]  the rapture is relevant because uh first Thessalonians four and that's uh chapter uh verse 16 for the
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:59.800]  Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command with the archangel call and with the
[2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:07.480]  sound of the trumpet magic that of god and the dead of christ will rise first and then let me say
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:15.080]  this it's open to interpretation my brother but let me say this i hope for pre prepare for post i'm
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:22.280]  sure you've heard that now i have well i listen i know it's in the bible i know it talks about a
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:27.160]  rapture of god's people and i sure hope that's the case but when have god's people been raptured
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:36.040]  before when evil comes upon why can't you believe in this version of what listen it's very complex
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:40.200]  and i know it's and i know it it talks about a one world government the image of the beast
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:43.960]  seen everywhere by everybody at the same time that's television holograms they say it's it's
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:48.600]  three-dimensional that you you can't have it without buying and you're buying and selling
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:53.240]  you're gonna have this mark i i know it's happening and i know the force of this world
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:58.120]  is satanic and wants us killing each other and is evil so i believe in the devil and i believe
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:02.840]  in the bible i'm just saying christ even talks about the bible not everybody's supposed to understand
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:06.200]  this well maybe i'm profane maybe i don't understand it maybe you do
[2:29:11.240 --> 2:29:15.400]  you you're saying we're going to have to go through the tribulations but i don't see nowhere
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:20.280]  it says that believers got to go through the tribulation and i've been a believer for a long
[2:29:20.280 --> 2:29:27.960]  time and nowhere in my bible says the church will suffer at the hands of satan it actually says
[2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:33.560]  he will make war against the saints and overcome them this is immediately at the tribulation
[2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:37.880]  of those days shall the sun be darkened my friend you know i don't want to debate this with you dan
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:41.480]  but but let's come back and spend a few more minutes on it because i know i agree the bible
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:47.800]  doesn't contradict itself it's very complex we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:47.800 --> 2:30:00.120]  alex jones and the gcn radio network police departments across the country are now using
[2:30:00.120 --> 2:30:06.920]  an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:14.520]  calls and text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the fbi who have
[2:30:14.520 --> 2:30:20.360]  forced our nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements forbidding them
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:26.040]  from publicly talking about the technology needless to say this is a direct violation of
[2:30:26.040 --> 2:30:31.160]  our fourth amendment and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying
[2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:36.760]  where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people

[2:33:38.840 --> 2:33:43.720]  fight with people over there interpretations the bible that's where you got thousands of
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:49.000]  nominations if you love god and you hate the devil and you love children you want to be a good person

[2:33:54.840 --> 2:33:58.760]  without works is dead absolutely if you were but it is like you have to do the works to get saved
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:03.240]  if you are saved you're gonna be doing the works and that doesn't mean i'm on some high horse and
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:10.600]  i'm perfect i pray every day that god make me not be aggressive angry hateful nasty i mean
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:15.800]  i believe me but that's in a way it's not a gift but i can see into the enemy
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:22.440]  because you know i have i have i'm falling you know i love god but i'm falling and so i can
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:26.040]  you know basically look into how these guys are operating but i sat there in a lot of
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:29.960]  sunday school i don't remember all the verses or all the books daria is kind of the bible
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:35.880]  expert she goes to church like four or five nights a week he goes out in missionaries all over texas
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:40.440]  and uh but you know she goes over it but i just know it says they come they defeat the devil and
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:45.160]  armageddon they bind him up then the dead and tricer rays and then you know all the rest of it
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:48.600]  but she just pulled up a bunch of bible verses and then dan i'm gonna hurry quicker and let you
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:52.600]  have your response but let's put one of these verses on screen for folks this is out of the king
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:58.920]  james version we had it on just for the break we can throw that up this is matthew 24 29 30
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:04.760]  immediately after the tribulation of those days shall be the sun darkened and the moon shall not
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:09.800]  give light and the stars shall have fallen from the heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:15.640]  shaken and then shall appear the son of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of
[2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:20.760]  the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven the power and glory
[2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:25.640]  and that's repeated it says only a contradiction is repeated over and over again and this whole
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:31.080]  pre-tribulation thing's about 200 years old and you know you can say it's an apostasy in the church
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:37.000]  or whatever the catholics push it now everybody pushes it the protestants push it but you go into
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:42.280]  the lion's den you go into the fiery furnace you you go into the confrontation that separates the
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:47.640]  wheat from the chaff the metal the metal from the garbage and i agree we're seeing world government
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:51.400]  we're seeing things world government you know market the beast it's all happening they're
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:57.000]  trying to make everybody in sweden take chips right now to get on trains it's here so i'd say
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:01.480]  praise lord dan it shows it's all real and true and you know what our gut and spirit tells us is
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:07.000]  right but this big debate about we're not going to have to take our election stand up for god and
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:10.760]  i'm not going to refuse cries they put a gun to my head or put me in a guillotine pull that lever
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:17.320]  i'm not that that's a pleasure to do for god because it's just a second of pain and eternity
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:22.680]  you know with the creator and that's all i want but daria you're going to make a comment daria go
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:27.880]  ahead well yeah you just pretty much already said it but the bible is very clear to when the question
[2:36:27.880 --> 2:36:35.880]  arises on where the rapt when the rapture the rapture event happens it says then uh that after
[2:36:35.880 --> 2:36:41.880]  the after the the sun and the moon go dark and and it says one does it happen and it says immediately
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:47.320]  after the tribulation so i mean that's pretty clear and it and that it describes that event
[2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:52.200]  several times the bible mirrors each other several times as to when the question arises when the
[2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:59.080]  tribulation when the rapture happens uh it always says after the tribulation when the sun and the
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:05.640]  and the moon go dark so thank you daria uh we should go on camera but you're not let's go
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:10.040]  ahead and go to dan dan i'm trying to beat you up you just said nowhere in the bible doesn't say it
[2:37:10.040 --> 2:37:15.160]  we always pull up everything we talk about so there it is can i can i respond to sir
[2:37:15.160 --> 2:37:23.560]  it also says he's gonna come as a thief in a night it has nothing to do with the sun turning
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:31.400]  black you won't know the day of the hour uh when you hear people saying uh peace and safety then
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:37.640]  sudden destruction will come upon you yes you know uh times where god delivered his people
[2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:44.920]  look at noah the thief in in the night refers to the fact that no man knows when that event is
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:49.320]  going to happen but we know that it's happening when the sun and the moon go dark and that's
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:53.960]  that happens after the tribulation but when exactly that's going to happen no one knows and
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:58.520]  that's what it says that it that it comes that he comes in as a thief in the night that's what it's
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:07.400]  referring to well i think you're taking it out of contact because uh my belief says the rapture
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:17.800]  comes before the church even have any uh part of the tribulation and then christ when he suffered
[2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:26.040]  at the cross he took all the stripes and the pain and the suffering in place of the church so we
[2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:34.600]  don't have to go through a tribulation he suffered on the cross in place of us okay so why do you have
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:40.920]  to go through a tribulation you got a martyr's complex what i believe you got you want to prove
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:48.760]  something before god no christ suffered on the cross so that you can get eternal life if you
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:55.160]  accept him as your savior that was the whole point of him suffering on the cross it has nothing to do
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:39:00.920]  with the worldly tribulations on this earth all i know is i got the global is coming after me because
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:06.440]  i'm i'm not against christ so all i know but i hear what here's the thing let's just all say we love
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:11.240]  god and that we hate the devil and that and that and we're together and we and we can debate this
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:15.720]  all day but hey world government's here that the bible told us the mark of the beast they're pushing
[2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:20.440]  it how about that dan let's just say we're right about that we all agree on that like stuff's getting
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:29.160]  biblical right well if you hire me to be your info wars theologian and pull out the scripture on
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:36.680]  on your show on a daily basis i'll say i'll agree to that all right well shoot some youtube videos
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:40.200]  and show us what you're doing but you're telling the smart guy let me tell you something i like the
[2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:44.280]  idea getting beamed out of here and i don't know this one of my kids if god showed up right now and
[2:39:44.280 --> 2:39:48.520]  said you and your kids and your wife you went out of here right now i'd be like let's get i want
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:54.440]  out of here right now but i just don't see that happening to moses or to jesus or anybody else
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:59.960]  we got to go through this but hey i hope you're right thank you dan uh daria closing comment
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:06.680]  well yeah i think it's unfortunate that most of the churches in the country even among the
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:13.240]  fundamental baptist churches who are really were the last standing in terms of teaching the bible
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:17.960]  the bible what the bible says and it's it's just really unfortunate that we don't have really the
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:22.920]  churches who teach the bible anymore and what the the word of god really says well i'm no rocket
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:27.320]  scientist but the bible is pretty clear that the beast wages war against the saints and overcomes
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:34.200]  them yeah and they they they worry about their attendance more than they worry about but how
[2:40:34.200 --> 2:40:40.520]  do they get out of the beast wages war against the saints and overcomes them exactly i mean how do
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:47.880]  you get over that sorry can you repeat that no i don't have any audio in there i'm saying if the
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:53.640]  beast wages war against us and overcomes us as a test but then it crosses the biggest revival ever
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:58.600]  like martin Luther king or gondi getting beat up that's basically what it is on a mass scale
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:05.080]  i mean how is that not clear to christians the beast is coming after us and you're gonna choose
[2:41:05.080 --> 2:41:09.000]  to kiss his ass or you're gonna choose to go through the fire everybody it's not a martyr's
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:13.720]  complex i'm not looking for any more pain but yeah it's very clear you're gonna go through this
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:18.040]  are you gonna join the devil yeah exactly and that's the whole test that's the whole point of us
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:23.480]  being here on earth is this internal struggle struggle between good and evil between satan
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:30.440]  and god and gods did suffer on the cross for us he sacrificed himself god jesus christ is the
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:35.640]  trinity uh jesus christ the son so that god couldn't say he wasn't didn't have flesh in the game
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:40.600]  i'm sorry to say again so that god so you couldn't say god didn't have flesh in the game
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:47.960]  oh absolutely so he god he actually sacrificed himself for us to give us eternal life and all
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:52.760]  we have to do is a free gift you don't have to work for it it's not a work salvation it's a
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:57.960]  salvation completely by faith all you have to do is that you do accept him to say you do accept
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:03.080]  as your savior and you're safe forever it can be taken away from you it's a free gift and the bible
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:08.280]  says that and if it wasn't real why would the un and the satanist and all of them hate it so much
[2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:13.640]  i'm sorry say again oh and others you don't have your headphones on yeah it's just a later
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:19.560]  i don't understand if it wasn't powerful why would the whole world government system be against it
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:27.400]  well yeah absolutely because the word the the bible and the word of god is the most powerful tool
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:34.840]  we have in slaying this evil of this world that's why the bible is called the sword and and and
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:41.400]  actually incidentally what that's why the bible has been has had so many translations to to um
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:47.560]  to conflate to water down what the word of god actually says that's why i always pull up the king
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:53.240]  james bible was i believe that that's the only translation that actually still has the original
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:59.880]  inspired word of god and the other translations have been completely perverted for these new churches
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:06.600]  that that promote the pre-tribulation pervert promote the work salvation it's it's just terrible
[2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:11.160]  absolutely right all right daria great points let's hurry through the other callers notice
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:18.200]  how i talk about the nfl turns in turns into pre-tribulation post-tribulation all i know is
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:23.000]  we got a world government that's really evil coming down on us so i sure hope there's a god
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:27.880]  to help us beat it which i know there is i mean it's like the whole thing's coming through
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:35.400]  we're sitting there talking about rearranging deck chairs on the titanic man i'm gonna go to
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:41.000]  zack in florida zack here on the air about the national football league or the uh losing all
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:47.800]  their viewers and uh ticket holders go ahead uh yes alex uh great beyond i wanted to discuss
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:52.200]  this nfo issue and seemingly perfect timing with the north korea issue because make no mistakes
[2:43:52.200 --> 2:43:59.160]  they are um intertwined and i believe they're sophisticated um deep-sape deep-sape uh scyop
[2:43:59.160 --> 2:44:03.720]  uh one major point that has not been brought up and which i'm very surprised i think this
[2:44:03.720 --> 2:44:07.880]  is going to be the first news outlet that's kind of on this trail you know carlin kaepernick is kind
[2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:11.880]  of a puppet he he really doesn't have any speeches behind his actions but you just need to look to
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:20.040]  his longtime partner and girlfriend nessa dyad n-e-s-s-a last name b-i-a-b so you can't even
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:25.880]  write what you know her her her background you're talking university of berkeley black lives matter
[2:44:25.880 --> 2:44:31.800]  extreme sjw the complete brain behind the operation and i'm not seeing this picked up anywhere
[2:44:31.800 --> 2:44:36.280]  which is very important i had looked at his mother's like a big socialist too
[2:44:36.280 --> 2:44:39.160]  and you've got what do you think of this guy now being investigated at west point
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:45.000]  saying he wants to kill capitalist he hates america he has a hat saying communism will win
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:51.160]  opens up his shirt he has shaguel var on it what do you make of that i mean it's it's it's it's
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:57.000]  obvious and it's a plan that's referred to in the intelligence communities as stratify compartmentalization
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:02.760]  which is just essentially layers within compartment if you could create that collage of chaos um you
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:07.640]  could really get away with a lot um and i believe the water could be in chump to assassinate the
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:12.040]  president of the united states with this race issue divide us internally while having an
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:18.200]  outside force no i agree kill the president that ignites the race war yeah it's a plan for continuity
[2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:22.280]  of government it's happening on two fronts they thought jade helm was an operational issue let's
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:26.520]  let's call this well it was just a test so let me ask you this how is it going for him it seems
[2:45:26.520 --> 2:45:32.280]  like it's blowing up in their face because the president didn't shy away he attacked it yeah i
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:36.040]  mean that's you know they're they're battling they're battling back and the president he's battling
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:41.160]  back but but what's being done here is it is a slow luring and a slow poisoning of the country to
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:47.000]  chumb the waters to create a to create a climate where this is an atmosphere for a race so where
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:52.040]  does it what does it lead to i agree well i believe it's a plan for for uh for a for continuity
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:57.960]  government sure so why is soros able to get away with this i mean if i committed one tenth of these
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:46:03.160]  crimes i'd be in prison and i deserve it why is this piece of garbage allowed to do this i mean
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:08.520]  this is insane well because they got the pulse of the american people and hollywood is god
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:12.680]  social media is god the celebrities are completely brainwashed so if they could you know they got
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:16.200]  george lopez coming out on the side of north korea all the hollywood stars at the award shows
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:20.360]  coming out they got the what really you guys are talking about the bible of force unfortunately
[2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:24.520]  you know that type of thinking doesn't exist anymore hollywood and in professional sports are
[2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:29.880]  their guides we're stuck into the phones and and china is using north korea as their set piece
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:36.840]  to see if they can force our capitulation in the south china sea absolutely cause disruption here
[2:46:36.840 --> 2:46:40.760]  all while having a legitimate issue overseas you know it's like you know you they they're not
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:44.040]  showing their hands obviously they're playing them all at once this is an all out effort
[2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:48.920]  and all out attack this is operation jade helmet because once they got the disruption in the states
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:52.680]  here and we're fighting each other's necks and we have a legitimate enemy they could pull off a
[2:46:52.680 --> 2:46:57.160]  false flag from the water staff after the president's and nobody would breath nobody would even blink an
[2:46:57.160 --> 2:47:04.600]  eye this is a very aggressive tactic let's turn the wiki lakes that's what they said
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:12.120]  it's very very aggressive tactic and you know and i i applaud trump and and what he's trying to do
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:16.440]  and like you said he used he just has an issue to fit through some of the people to show their
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:19.720]  real colors and see who's really there at the end of that's the issue what does it say to the
[2:47:19.720 --> 2:47:27.160]  republicans who are going to push tax increases till they saw their candidate in alabama defeated
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:30.840]  now they're acting like they're rolling over but you never know because they're so deceptive
[2:47:30.840 --> 2:47:35.800]  uh i believe that they're showing their true colors as well they don't want to be showed as
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:40.360]  dudes but they picked their sides a long time ago and you know ron paul you know alluded to
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:46.520]  some things about north korean not being a real a major issue and uh i love ron paul and i like
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:52.760]  him but he was accusing me of like wanting war i was saying i see both sides but i'll say this
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:56.680]  he wasn't being completely because i kept saying no they are threatening the nucleus they are
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:48:01.800]  and you go alex you keep saying they're threatening to attack america stop saying that i didn't say
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:06.200]  that north korea said that and i got all the respect i got all the respect in the world for
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:09.400]  ron paul but come on this is a guy who tried to run for president of course he didn't make and i
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:13.400]  used to be a ron paul guy and we all know what's going to happen in 2020 and ron paul knows they're
[2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:18.680]  backing a rand paul quarry bookie quarry booker ticket in order to outseat to to get trump out of
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:23.240]  there and that's already in the works everybody i know that sure i know that yeah but but but expanding
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:31.800]  on that i know it's i want to get into it but the all it is a vert nuclear war just have a future
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:37.640]  but what do you think ron paul's thinking when he says i love him to death alex stop pushing
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:43.640]  propaganda saying north korea has nukes they have hydrogen bombs he said alex stop saying they've
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:53.000]  got bombs they have the damn bombs and look donald trump won the presidency nobody saw it coming
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:57.880]  his own son ran against donald trump no i know but what are you thinking the paul things about
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:03.640]  he said just bet she's based his life on something that you know he was also you know duped by i mean
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:07.400]  unfortunately he has great intentions he's a lot of great things but when it comes to the real world
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:12.200]  and how the momentum and the clip of this thing is running out now yeah i get exactly we've got
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:19.080]  corruption on our side but just because we've got problems doesn't mean that china and north korea are
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:25.080]  good just because we're have problems doesn't mean suddenly something over there is better than us or
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:30.120]  or isn't threatening to why do you think north korea sub allegedly i get paul's point that oh well
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:34.040]  they think that they have nukes they're strongly malone but they're they're beyond saying we have
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:39.320]  nukes they're threatening and and shooting missiles over and threatening to detonate hydrogen bombs
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:43.480]  and saying we're gonna preemptively attack you it's imminent i mean if somebody said i'm gonna
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:49.000]  imminently put i'm gonna punch you in your face right now i'd go ahead and punch them so i don't
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:55.400]  want war but you got some little asshole excuse me saying that i'm going to kill you what are we
[2:49:55.400 --> 2:50:01.960]  supposed to do the greatest predictor of future reality is past reality and we always that means
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:06.360]  we're going to nuke the hell out of them and win never well they say never let a good crisis go
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:10.920]  to wait so the question really and you talk about people you showing their true colors we're seeing
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:14.920]  that north korea is being this belligerent all while our country is falling apart at the same
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:20.440]  time this is no coincidence this is a deep state thigh off this is deeper north korea it's on record
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:24.200]  that the globalist and the clinton's in the air works in with north korea and he thinks he's working
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:28.120]  with them that's why he's so belligerent i agree they're pushing that's why they all said there's
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:32.520]  gonna be a big crisis six months into trump we'll see what he does they're using this to destroy
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:37.480]  trump i agree with you skip this break let's get this problem right because i gotta get these other
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:44.360]  colors but zach clearly that's what they're doing then what do we do to stop it what's really going
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:49.000]  on and not get caught up in that you caught up in the momentum and in the in the in the in the
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:52.920]  group think we have to look at things how they are okay what happened here in the nfl you have an
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:57.560]  nfl quarterback who was on his way out he wasn't starting he was on his way out in what city is he
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:03.800]  in san francisco of course then sanctuary he's a paid off blackmailed guy god knows what he's
[2:51:03.800 --> 2:51:10.120]  involved in with a girlfriend who's a public black lives matter university of berkeley educated
[2:51:10.120 --> 2:51:14.520]  mastermind behind this thing they have a useful idiot there they have they've been they've been
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:19.800]  you know chumming the waters for for a race war in this country you know she's gonna divorce him
[2:51:19.800 --> 2:51:24.280]  and take him for everything he's got as soon as he's done he is a real bozo the clown
[2:51:25.240 --> 2:51:28.520]  oh it's a mess and you know they overstep their bounds and have done this before but they are
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:32.680]  brazen they are wild and you what we can't do is underestimate it because they are desperate and
[2:51:32.680 --> 2:51:36.600]  that's obvious but i believe that this is this is no coincidence that these two things are happening
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:40.200]  in conjunction and you have a you know there's a million plates spinning at once and trump is
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:43.400]  trying to keep them all going or try to figure out what's going on and they are creating a
[2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:47.080]  collage of chaos in order to distract the american public to pull off something big and this is a
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:52.280]  last-ditch effort we need to take it very serious you think they may be preparing to kill the
[2:51:52.280 --> 2:51:57.000]  president right now i believe they are i believe they're chumming the waters and quite frankly
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:00.840]  if you read social media and look at even the people who are supposed to look up to as role models
[2:52:00.840 --> 2:52:06.040]  the entertainers the athletes they are calling them by calling them derogatory terms they all
[2:52:06.040 --> 2:52:13.000]  think that's it they all think they're on the winning team the former cia deputy director and
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  robert miller's attache at the fp i he was in both departments shed within two months he's dead
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:28.440]  we we are at two months next thursday we're eight days out on them fulfilling their promise to kill
[2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:37.320]  the president trigger a race war bring in a civil emergency announce the elections are suspended
[2:52:38.120 --> 2:52:44.280]  kill the realignment and bring in their tyranny and they said they do it i'm glad you've helped
[2:52:44.280 --> 2:52:51.320]  us refocus act because they've said they're doing this the question is do all these people really
[2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:58.280]  think that they've taken our kindness for weakness do they really think once a hot war starts that
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:06.840]  one sink rob reiner all these guys do they really think they've got a hope in a prayers act well me
[2:53:06.840 --> 2:53:12.440]  and you think of things like this but we have to look at the the people who are reacting like this
[2:53:12.440 --> 2:53:16.680]  as a maybe like an adolescent teenager somebody actually entering the new war and you look at a
[2:53:16.680 --> 2:53:20.680]  full teenager and you think yourself how could you be acting like this how are you not grateful
[2:53:20.680 --> 2:53:25.560]  don't you see what i'm trying to do but they can't comprehend that and in their eyes this was done
[2:53:25.560 --> 2:53:31.160]  not my president was chanted right after the election and how it's been done with sophistication
[2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:35.880]  and bring into sickening this is a deep deep deep they talked about it you got the michael moores
[2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:39.320]  you got the guys on tv they didn't seem to worry don't worry you'll be out of office don't worry
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:43.800]  about it they are chumming the waters for fascination on the president and they should be
[2:53:43.800 --> 2:53:48.200]  they should be uh they should be ashamed of themselves so they don't have the capacity to
[2:53:48.200 --> 2:53:53.320]  do that because well let me tell you you know what happens historically you're a smart guy
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:54:01.080]  the people that lower the drawbridge the michael moores the enablers of this they're the first
[2:54:01.080 --> 2:54:08.200]  people that their bosses are going to kill if this is successful and they're and they're not dealing
[2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:12.920]  with the dummy here and like it's been said if you aim at the prince you better not miss
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:17.160]  donald trump is not a duke he's strong he's realizing what's going on he's allowing them to
[2:54:17.160 --> 2:54:21.640]  show their hands looking at their signs looking at their bluff and this is a marathon on a sprint
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:26.920]  but make no mistake this is a dire and they i mean we have to look at this not as you know you know
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:33.880]  several moral issues or you know a single war it's about foreign multinational godless powers
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:39.560]  overthrowing the country so issues at this point aren't even and he's still delivering on the issues
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:45.400]  i agree it's like shameful when you realize the main forces it's it's so clear this is real
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:51.400]  and people better decide which side they're on because i'm not afraid at all actually
[2:54:51.400 --> 2:54:56.520]  i think i'm quite frankly sick of playing games here uh and these people want to play and they
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:55:05.720]  want to really get down the gutter it's gonna be pretty crazy but uh it's just the way it always is
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:10.280]  i just know this everybody ought to be making a list and checking it twice who's been naughty and
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:16.680]  nice and santa claus comes visiting in the middle of the night god bless you zaga to talk to you
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:23.080]  but i tell you this has aged me a lot because i can't quit thinking about this
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:30.840]  the globalists already controlled this country
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:38.200]  but they didn't want to control the country they wanted to destroy it
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:45.960]  and it's not gonna happen and america was in a coma but as we felt their fingers
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:52.760]  wrap around our necks we went what what is that i'm gonna wake up the those like i love you just
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:59.080]  lay down oh god it's hard to kill damn die we're like wait you we threw them off they're like
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:03.800]  let me put my hands back around your neck just no no stop just hands around the neck it's like
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:13.800]  it's not happening and it's all some pissing contest a bunch of losers you're not going to win
[2:56:13.800 --> 2:56:17.800]  look you're not going to listen i already see that so i'm not going to speak to them
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:26.680]  just to all the viewers and listeners they fear you because they know you're good they fear you
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:31.240]  because they know you're strong they fear you because they know you're committed then i don't
[2:56:31.240 --> 2:56:37.560]  have to tell you what to do if they kill the president or me or anybody else i don't have to
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:48.200]  tell you what to do you know what to do they've tried to like bill they've tried to brand they've
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:56.120]  tried to sell this idea that if there's a civil war just kill cops because you kill the local cops
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:03.640]  then the globalists come in no no no your enemy this is some cop kissing exercise the cops have been
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:11.480]  laced targeted to be killed in a revolution no no no no you don't kill them you don't kill them
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:17.480]  you kill the people that said kill the cops and then you kill their bosses and i'm not saying kill
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:23.560]  anybody you're just saying kill the cops i'm just saying if you want to die we're going to make sure
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:31.320]  you die see how that works that's why almost all the globalists have already jumped on airplanes
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:35.640]  and left and they'll come back they keep thinking we're about to win they they leave for a year
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:39.960]  and they come back and they leave they come back and they're like we're not winning here's

[2:59:56.600 --> 3:00:19.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:27.880]  it's alex jones all right we're gonna Timothy ryan bros natalia and others
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:32.840]  and i don't like there's a father and four to have to talk about things like this but
[3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:39.400]  we're facing a real hardcore communist attack we're facing a real attempt over the country
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:42.520]  and everybody better get themselves straight
[3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:50.920]  realize that if it does go physical we don't respond back they're gonna end up winning
[3:00:50.920 --> 3:00:55.800]  having their way with us so once they start getting physical we gotta really hurt them bad
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:05.080]  see they already know they're whipped
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:15.560]  these people never give up till you put them six feet under so just hold your fire
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:21.720]  and just get ready because i agree with that last caller you just see what they're planning
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:30.520]  and i personally deal with the stuff they do to me it's there's actually a blessing i'm not
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:35.560]  complaining about it but they're just the worst trash the world's ever seen let me tell you something
[3:01:35.560 --> 3:01:41.880]  you can't write these checks and not cash them forever you can't sit there and write these checks
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:51.720]  and then not like to pay out on them see good people are just aware they're not perfect but
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:55.880]  if they they realize that there's something evil that comes back on me you like have a connection
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:02.760]  you go whoa even if i think of you got you dumbasses don't get it see you then you can run
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:09.480]  around pissing on everybody forever you don't think it's gonna come back on you it is you make
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:13.800]  no mistake about that you're going to pay but there's no solace in that because your piece is a
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:19.800]  garbage see that's why we should stop there's no conquering you there's no victory when we defeat
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:29.000]  you it's sad but you know this we're gonna run your ass over though we're gonna turn back and come
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:36.120]  back again to make sure you're done and that feeble light in your eyes is gone because we've seen
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:44.840]  that light before timothy in illinois thanks for holding so long we'll go to ryan and brose the
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:52.040]  dead of nights coming in timothy you're on the air go ahead hey alex uh i just wanted to say
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:59.640]  i think this whole nfl thing can be cleared at uh i've been a fan of the douse cowboy since
[3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:09.320]  70s and the douse cowboy cheerleaders before that but uh i uh i think what president trump did a
[3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:17.000]  small percentage of the people uh aren't gonna understand it but uh i was watching a video
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:25.720]  of lashan mccoy have you seen that no uh if you youtube it he plays for the buffalo bills
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:33.160]  and uh you know i have no problem with taking a knee i played football my coaches would tell us
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:41.080]  when to take knees and when not to and uh you know uh i don't think protest being on the
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:49.640]  field is the right place for it but uh i think it's up to the owners and the coaches to get control
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:56.840]  of this no i agree but it is a globalist hollywood see me but but who's the player we should look at
[3:03:56.840 --> 3:04:07.240]  what what happens in that clip lashan mccoy in that clip uh everybody's standing there for the
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:15.800]  national anthem and uh he's down on the ground stretching doing push ups uh the most disrespectful

[3:08:55.240 --> 3:09:00.840]  right now in the main fight for america not that america is perfect not that it didn't
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:07.160]  have its problems but this is a foreign scientific technocratic takeover of america and now
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:11.800]  i asked david during the break i said david what do we want to cover and he said
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:18.280]  well meler is going with the irs 11 years back into records of trump and manifold this was a
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:23.720]  russian investigation you can always find some miscalculation because when you sign an irs form
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:28.600]  you wave your rights penalty of perjury if there's a one dollar wrong it's 10 years in
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:35.000]  jail time and now meler that covered up all the clinton crimes and the nfl stuff and all this
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:47.240]  is arrogantly saying he's got trump this is incredible to witness this level of of garbage
[3:09:47.240 --> 3:09:53.320]  and even sienna admits he's violating all the laws all the regulations it's like he's the president
[3:09:53.320 --> 3:10:00.840]  robert meler is god robert meler created the planet earth robert meler is everything this is
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:07.560]  talk about security services uh taking over david nine i don't even have words to describe
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:12.360]  how corrupt robert meler is the things he's done for the clinton's and the bushes and the rest of
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:19.080]  it and now to see them doing this and to see them saying oh it's not a russian investigation
[3:10:19.080 --> 3:10:25.320]  it's a taxes investigation wow go back 11 years alex i i talked about this this morning on real
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:31.000]  news and the the title that we put it out there with was uh bring me the man and i'll find the
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:35.640]  financial crime because that's what stalin used to say bring me the man i'll find the crime
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:41.160]  it's not very hard to find a financial crime think about denis haster right alex he was picked
[3:10:41.160 --> 3:10:46.440]  by the glp establishment because he was blackmailable he was a pedophile they knew it everybody
[3:10:46.440 --> 3:10:52.040]  knew he was a pedophile what did they get him for not for that they got him because he withdrew
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:57.800]  his own money out of iris that's right well this is money they said you structured with your withdrawals
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:04.600]  this is money that it's not like he was trying to launder money as he was depositing it into the bank
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:08.280]  this is money that was already in the system it was already in the bank and he'd already paid
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:12.920]  taxes get out and he he'd you know didn't notify them took it out in small chunks and they said
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:17.640]  you're structuring that they sent him to jail for this so so again just like the new york town
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:23.240]  reported last year some poor hispanic lady 60 years running a little diner she did little checks
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:27.400]  and little things it was all legal but we took all your money in your restaurant it was structuring
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:32.840]  that's right that's right but they wanted to get denis haster because they have made sure the people
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:38.920]  who make the laws they've made sure that there is a very short statute of limitations on pedophilia
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:44.120]  that's how they all get off and so they didn't want to they couldn't get in for that so it was
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:47.880]  an embarrassment after became common knowledge that he was a pedophile they were determined
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:51.480]  they were going to send him to jail just like the establishment is determined they're going to get
[3:11:51.480 --> 3:11:55.800]  trump out so what do you do you go after him for a by the way hasterd served like two years he's
[3:11:55.800 --> 3:12:01.480]  already out yeah oh yeah yeah yeah it was just a it was just a case a show trial type of thing
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:05.160]  but alex there was something else that came up this morning and this is a report from the new
[3:12:05.160 --> 3:12:10.680]  york post a guy who did an investigation a couple of days ago and he looked at the fact that you
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:14.360]  know just like we we talked about drum course he's talked about this quite a bit the fact that
[3:12:14.360 --> 3:12:20.520]  obama funded illegally obama care by stealing money from fannie may and freddy mac investors
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:24.920]  after fannie may and freddy mac recovered they were profitable he couldn't get the
[3:12:25.880 --> 3:12:30.760]  congress to fund obama care subsidies so what he did was he just took it out of there well now
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:36.360]  we've got illegally loaded 300 million yeah kind of related to this we've now got 640 million
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:42.600]  dollar slush fund that is there because of penalties that they assessed against banks because of the
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:49.240]  mortgage shenanigans that jp morgan city bank bank of america and others did they got 640 million
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:54.280]  dollars and guess what they're doing with it they're giving it to community organizer organizations
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:13:00.520]  uh places like the laraza national council the national urban league the national community
[3:13:00.520 --> 3:13:06.120]  reinvestment coalition and that's right they take those things and illegally swap it up
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:10.680]  to give it to their little communist agitation groups the good news is though i take a few calls
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:16.920]  and let you take over how does their whole nfl thing going it's blowing up with their face
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:23.640]  don't they get there's huge opposition they don't understand they've got direct tv is giving people
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:28.520]  refunds off the nfl ticket that's something they've never done before after the season has started
[3:13:28.520 --> 3:13:31.720]  but they also are up against the wire because people are cutting the cable so they're not
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:35.720]  going to stand there for these guys their ratings are falling they're looking to see if they can get
[3:13:35.720 --> 3:13:40.680]  so that's the issue out there and try to spend this but alex they have cited with black lives matter
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:46.600]  they've cited with the antifa people they've cited with colin cavernick and that's who he cited with
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:53.720]  and they own it now exactly but don't they get that i mean i'm not bashing old folks old folks
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:58.440]  are great but the people that own the nfl these billionaires and people they still only watch
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:03.320]  mainstream tv they really don't get the rest of the world and that almost no one like 20 percent
[3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:10.200]  believes it almost no one washes it when we do we hold our nose don't they understand that we've
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:15.240]  broken with them they're now admitting okay we're sorry we boycott of the fly we're gonna stop
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:20.840]  don't they understand that the world has moved on i think there's a blind spot for these folks
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:26.680]  well i i think that you know i played a report that i did about four years ago talking about
[3:14:26.680 --> 3:14:31.480]  crony capitalism on steroids they're the subsidies of their stadiums they've been caught multiple
[3:14:31.480 --> 3:14:36.760]  times alex they've been caught with their tax exempt status they back to me were back back to
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:41.480]  the gladiatorial paying to hurt folks uh back to buying off the college athletes back to covering
[3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:47.800]  up the concussions mewler six years ago brought them under federal control no build them on all
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:54.600]  these crimes as long as they became subsidiaries and so now that mewler is the head of the fbi
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:15:01.320]  really mewler is like the president of the shadow government mccain was mewler was kind of under him
[3:15:01.320 --> 3:15:07.560]  but now you know uh he's dying of a brain tumor so mewler really is the shadow president yeah i
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:12.920]  guess he is he pretty much can do anything he wants and we got multiple bills in congress and
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:17.720]  people are saying is this going to pass constitutional muster is this going to hold up in the courts
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:22.440]  because we've got people who are the new swamp things after we get rid of people like uh luther
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:26.200]  strange after john mccain so what do we do about what do we do about tell us who are out there
[3:15:26.200 --> 3:15:30.520]  saying we're not going to let the president fire mewler so what about president mewler what do
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:37.480]  we do about this unelected arrogant sob i mean he just you watching the way he walks around i mean
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:46.120]  this is a asshole excuse me this is a jerk i mean you see mewler just his actions but his behavior
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:52.520]  i mean what a jerk well i think he has to be fired a germ course he has said that i think the longer
[3:15:52.520 --> 3:15:58.120]  that president trump lets this charade play out the worst it's going to get because now they're
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:01.800]  going back 11 years and if they're going to go back with manifold they're going to go back
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:04.920]  with trump they're going to go back with well they admit they're looking at all the tax returns
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:09.480]  yeah yeah you got a complicated i thought this was about russia oh no it's 11 years ago and
[3:16:09.480 --> 3:16:14.760]  trump's tax returns yeah yeah the the russian thing was just a red herring to cover up the crimes
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:20.840]  of uh the the uh surveillance state clapper and the others who committed perjury he committed
[3:16:20.840 --> 3:16:25.880]  perjury on stand multiple times saying we're not uh we're not listening i was talking to white house
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:30.840]  connected folks last night and others they've told them you're under criminal investigation
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:35.480]  they don't even let the attorney general talk to trump they've paralyzed so much under this fake
[3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:43.720]  investigation well well i don't know i mean you know they would uh i i would if i was trump i would
[3:16:43.720 --> 3:16:48.520]  get rid of just sessions and i would get a wartime consularity that's what he needs and he needs
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:52.600]  somebody who's going to go after these guys aggressively or they're going to come after
[3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:58.600]  him because he's up against the entire surveillance state these people are politicized uh they're the
[3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:03.720]  ones who are coming after him and uh that's the thing that really ought to scare the people in
[3:17:03.720 --> 3:17:07.720]  america the fact that we don't agree because they're not going to let trump roll over even if he rolls
[3:17:07.720 --> 3:17:12.280]  over they're going to destroy him yeah well this is war this is total commitment we're not looking
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:15.960]  for this we just wanted to have freedom but they want a war they got one i think a few calls
[3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:20.360]  let's get this network break let's go to mark in oklahoma mark you're on the air worldwide
[3:17:20.360 --> 3:17:27.880]  than a ryan and bruce go ahead mark well alex how are you the settlement i'm all right i tell you
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:35.240]  best of times worst of times well i want to give some people some glimmer of hope that the topic
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:41.000]  that i was calling in on is kind of reverse racism and in terms of how we as kind of white people
[3:17:41.000 --> 3:17:46.680]  are being treated you remember uh week or so back uh you're you had the video about carol
[3:17:46.680 --> 3:17:52.120]  carol baker on and at uh baler medical uh saying that we need to get rid of all the white people
[3:17:52.120 --> 3:17:55.560]  because a lot of white educated people don't yeah one of the head vaccine people in texas
[3:17:55.560 --> 3:18:00.920]  says whites are evil kill them and she's a white lady yes sir well i wanted to let you know that i
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:06.360]  did uh follow up with that and i called the doctor kline who is the head physician in chief or the
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:11.560]  department of pediatrics at baler medical in houston and i had a really good conversation
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:17.720]  with him he was a nice man we spoke for 10 or 15 minutes i told him exactly what we have all
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:22.600]  discussed and believe about the kind of what's going on that that vaccination overall is probably
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:26.920]  not a bad thing but it's what they're putting in the vaccines that are bad and we had a good
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:32.280]  collegial discussion and uh at the end i told him i said there is no way you can have a doctor
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:36.680]  who believes or has taken the hypocritic oath to make a statement like that and i have a problem
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:42.040]  with that and uh anyway we talked for a while and kind of towards the end of our conversation
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:47.800]  he said mark i just want to let you know that dr carol baker has been fired at baler medical
[3:18:47.800 --> 3:18:52.440]  she no longer has a job here really so is that official or has that been the news yet
[3:18:53.320 --> 3:18:58.440]  well if you go on the website alex you'll see that her page has been removed from baler medical
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:04.600]  now what i what i could not confirm is whether or not she's still at texas uh i believe it's
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:09.720]  called texas children's hospital there in houston it looked like to me she might have had some kind
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:16.120]  of role of texas children's that they're in houston as well we're fired her baler medical she's gone
[3:19:16.120 --> 3:19:21.560]  it's not vindictive you want to kill everybody we'll go to hell yeah oh yeah absolutely absolutely
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:27.080]  but i just wanted to let you guys know that you know even though the odds seem overwhelming against
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:32.120]  us that that we have these small victories here and there and they and then we need to talk about
[3:19:32.120 --> 3:19:37.160]  them we need to let people know that there are people out there like us that are doing those
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:42.040]  things and and don't let that go unnoticed that there are those things are going on i know we're
[3:19:42.040 --> 3:19:46.200]  actually we're winning because of you mark we're winning because of everybody out there don't think
[3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:50.120]  that i'm always just on to the next threat because people think i'm trying to moralize folks
[3:19:50.120 --> 3:19:53.960]  all the negativity because the enemy thinks like that i think that i got told about something bad
[3:19:53.960 --> 3:19:58.520]  i want to do something yeah does that make sense yeah yeah absolutely well that's great news we're
[3:19:58.520 --> 3:20:03.800]  going to do a whole story about that we'll look into her getting canned that's good news mark anything
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:10.120]  else well i i just think that uh you guys are right on i've read several reports from several
[3:20:10.120 --> 3:20:15.000]  different places about all this stuff going on with sorrows also want to let you know that i did
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:21.400]  call into senator langford's office yesterday and voiced my displeasure about what's going on with
[3:20:21.400 --> 3:20:27.960]  doc and what he's doing and and that the republicans have had eight years to overcome obama care and
[3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:32.280]  now they've gotten off the track and gone off of these different things and we still don't have any
[3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:37.640]  legislation to help the middle class and i told the lady specifically that and she said well i
[3:20:37.640 --> 3:20:42.280]  disagree with you on doc and i said well that may be the case but what you're going to find out is
[3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:46.440]  langford will probably be replaced at some point if he keeps this kind of stuff up because people
[3:20:46.440 --> 3:20:51.240]  in Oklahoma are sick of this stuff whether he's a christian or not or whatever we don't really
[3:20:51.240 --> 3:20:57.640]  have behind that christian stuff hammered the middle class has been hammered and that's what i told her and i said
[3:20:57.640 --> 3:21:02.440]  you know we're tired of putting up with everything we've had to put up with when the elite get to
[3:21:02.440 --> 3:21:07.400]  have their offshore bank accounts they don't care we have to live with the fact that these people are
[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:11.240]  going to be put in the public school systems and they send their kids to private schools who do you
[3:21:11.240 --> 3:21:16.920]  think's going to pay the taxes on property taxes to overcome all these people being let in that are
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:22.360]  legal to teach them english and so i kind of went round and round for a while so i encourage people
[3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:28.600]  to call their senators call their u.s representative be respectful and carry on a conversation no i
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:33.320]  agree hammering them and going to public events and shaking their hand but talking to them is the
[3:21:33.320 --> 3:21:37.160]  key as well thank you mark i was the right caller that's going to be the end of the american dream
[3:21:37.160 --> 3:21:42.680]  alex if we have to educate anybody who comes here from anywhere in the world and in uncontrolled
[3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:47.000]  numbers and educate them we can't afford to do that we won't be able to afford homes we won't even
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:51.960]  be able to afford an apartment complex so that's the end of the american dream if we have to educate
[3:21:51.960 --> 3:21:56.040]  the foreign citizens of other countries when those governments won't pay for their own citizens
[3:21:56.040 --> 3:22:00.680]  education so what's the next you to drop what's the next you drop well i'll tell you what i'm
[3:22:00.680 --> 3:22:05.720]  very optimistic today because of what happened in alabama i talked about this today we've already
[3:22:05.720 --> 3:22:10.280]  had we coming up to this people said look there's going to be a lot of republican rhinos who are
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:17.640]  going to not run for reelection if roymor wins beating the senate campaign fund that spent
[3:22:17.640 --> 3:22:22.680]  30 million dollars to assassinate his character and you wouldn't believe the garbage that they
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:26.520]  told about him the lies i told about him he didn't have the money to respond to that but he still
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:32.360]  beat them and they said if he wins because the mainstream is so discredited yeah that's right
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:37.800]  people told me i did a great job man kelly i did a terrible job she was so hated it didn't matter
[3:22:37.800 --> 3:22:42.360]  what i did yeah that's what they don't get now oh no no you did a great job and people could see
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:46.920]  through what was going on with it just like they saw that they could see through what the senate
[3:22:47.720 --> 3:22:52.840]  leadership fund was doing to judge roymor with their 30 million dollars they could see through
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:57.640]  that setup it's the same thing that meghan kelly did to you and and so the key is is that we've
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:23:02.920]  already had as soon as that happened today that happened last night today we already had bob corker
[3:23:02.920 --> 3:23:08.920]  who drum course he's done multiple articles about saying this is the republican who has uh
[3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:13.640]  the crony capitalist who's made a lot of money blocking obama care repeal he announced he's
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:16.840]  not going to run for reelection you're going to see a lot more of that and you're going to see
[3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:20.600]  people taking this back at the g.o.p primaries where it's going to have to happen and by the way
[3:23:20.600 --> 3:23:26.200]  we've had five primaries of democrats losing a republican establishment losing they are that's
[3:23:26.200 --> 3:23:31.560]  why they're panicking yeah yeah i mean this is this is this is people finally not listening to
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:36.360]  damn word they say okay there's one other thing i'm up to alex you you mentioned the police and
[3:23:36.360 --> 3:23:40.680]  the importance of local police this is going to come to a head in katalonia this weekend i talked
[3:23:40.680 --> 3:23:46.440]  to steve pacinic about what's going on there this morning and the real news show what is this is
[3:23:46.440 --> 3:23:50.520]  boiling down to there you got the central government in spain saying you're not going to have this
[3:23:50.520 --> 3:23:54.680]  election they're resting officials they are oh it's incredible talk about the next segment
[3:23:54.680 --> 3:23:58.440]  because this is so big i'm going to get on this more right over the police is what it's coming down to
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:04.440]  but if 90% of the people want independence how do you enslave them you can't yeah yeah well they
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:10.280]  have a local police force that was there as part of the uh cattle of the katalonia police force
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:15.320]  that was taken away from them when they were under a fascist dictatorship and then they got it back
[3:24:15.320 --> 3:24:19.640]  so this is like their sheriff's department and then they've got another level of police that
[3:24:19.640 --> 3:24:24.600]  are militarized they call that the guardia civil and then they've got the national police on top
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:28.600]  of that and so what they're doing is they're saying uh we're not going to let this happen and we're
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:34.280]  giving orders to the massa that's the sheriffs if you will uh in the local area and so these guys
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:37.560]  are there they said we don't want to be in the middle of this but they're gonna have to decide
[3:24:37.560 --> 3:24:42.280]  because the people there don't have a second amendment and it like jfk said if you make peaceful
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:47.720]  revolution impossible you will make violent revolution inevitable this is the force that
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:51.960]  has been unleashed this is what we're seeing here this is what's behind trump it's everywhere
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:58.120]  election yeah it's not just nationalism versus globalism it is going to be independent government
[3:24:58.120 --> 3:25:02.120]  that's it's going to continue to devolve until people feel that they're represented
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:06.760]  and their local community you know their their government and that's why this is being opposed
[3:25:06.760 --> 3:25:10.360]  now i think by the trump administration people telling them no no we got to stay with spain
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:15.000]  they got military bases in spain spain is going to oppose this because they've got a lot of financial
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:20.360]  issues uh they they are using katalonia also katalonia literally is what's holding up spain
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:25.320]  yeah it's a cash cow for them yeah it's like 40% of their economy and uh they don't want to see it
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:29.320]  go because of that but they got a separate language they got separate culture uh it's
[3:25:29.320 --> 3:25:33.400]  it's a really tasty food too is when it's going to come to a head we're katalonian food is like
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:39.160]  delicious i've never been there i have multiple times it's awesome hey uh ryan and missouri are on
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:48.920]  the air go ahead hey alex uh long time lister uh i uh first of all you guys were talking about
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:55.480]  militarization of the cops and everything it's don't the cops a lot of cops still have like the uh
[3:25:56.840 --> 3:26:03.480]  military weapons from 9 11 or whatever maybe but statistically those are using a fraction
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:08.280]  of shootings it's not the cops are perfect it's just the cops is a red herring statistically
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:14.280]  and then if we hate the cops we drive them into the arms of the globalist yeah yeah all right and
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:20.840]  uh one thing i don't know about in the nfl yeah it's a disgrace to their flag they're saying it's
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:26.440]  racist they're actually being racist to themselves in every other race because everybody in the
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:33.640]  military are a bunch of different you know it's racist so yeah it's not the people doing are just
[3:26:33.640 --> 3:26:41.080]  being told to do it the sponsors want it hollywood isn't winning so it goes militarize politicize
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:47.320]  turn every different venue into something that's political and and that's why it's blowing up
[3:26:48.280 --> 3:26:54.120]  yeah yeah it's definitely and uh but it's kind of like they can't run from it alex because uh
[3:26:54.120 --> 3:26:58.760]  you know it just because you're not interested in politics doesn't mean politics isn't interested
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:03.720]  in you what is going on with this stuff and you understand that this goes back to collin cavernic
[3:27:03.720 --> 3:27:09.480]  they've got his items from his football days stored at the african-american wing of the
[3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:13.560]  smithsonian the new museum that they got there and part of the black lives matter stuff they
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:17.960]  understand that he's part of black lives matter he's part of the antifa people he's like these people
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:23.080]  who are protesting after the election he never even registered to vote in his entire life and yet
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:28.920]  he's doing this it's a loser grandstanding who's a racist yeah he hates his wife parents he's a

[3:31:59.800 --> 3:32:05.320]  four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:10.920]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition
[3:32:10.920 --> 3:32:17.240]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[3:32:17.240 --> 3:32:23.400]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated

[3:33:04.360 --> 3:33:15.480]  alex joneshow and now your host david night welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night
[3:33:15.480 --> 3:33:20.600]  one of the things i think is really important and we're talking about this briefly with alex
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:25.160]  and he had mentioned it at the top of the hour about when things get really difficult and we're
[3:33:25.160 --> 3:33:29.880]  about to see things get really difficult in katalonia because what we're seeing there and
[3:33:29.880 --> 3:33:34.200]  of course the john birch society was on top of this for a very long time remember all the stuff
[3:33:34.200 --> 3:33:38.840]  support your local sheriff they even did a comedy movie with a takeoff of that with uh james garner
[3:33:39.560 --> 3:33:43.640]  but that's what they were talking about they were talking about keeping law enforcement local
[3:33:43.640 --> 3:33:50.360]  they understood the danger of having a national police force it's like the danger of having a
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:56.680]  standing army the founders never wanted a standing army they wanted a citizen militia that was trained
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:01.560]  that's what well regulated means it doesn't mean they got a lot of laws all over them that means
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:08.120]  that they are very well trained so that they can actually defend the country like we saw in switzerland
[3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:12.840]  because they have a militia there that is very well armed very well trained that little island
[3:34:12.840 --> 3:34:17.240]  that never got involved in world war two there's a reason for that it was not just the fact that
[3:34:17.240 --> 3:34:22.200]  they were surrounded by mountains uh they could uh the the nazis could have gotten through
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:29.320]  the mountains no it was because uh that place was an armed fortress and that's what the founders
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:34.680]  wanted in this country as well they wanted a citizenry that could protect themselves had the
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:40.040]  skills as well as the arms to protect themselves understand that at lexington and conquered they
[3:34:40.040 --> 3:34:45.240]  were not just coming for flintlocks they were coming for cannons and when they have the come
[3:34:45.240 --> 3:34:51.160]  and take it flag here in texas when santa anna was coming for the weapons and uh there they
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:56.120]  said come and take it it was a cannon that is on that flag so they're talking about the arms
[3:34:56.120 --> 3:35:01.640]  necessary to defend themselves and now what we're seeing here in catalonia as we see this escalation
[3:35:01.640 --> 3:35:08.920]  that is happening there this back and forth between spain and the catalan people they're telling them
[3:35:08.920 --> 3:35:11.960]  in the spanish government they're saying you're not going to have an election they're not going
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:17.320]  to allow an election like they allowed in the uk the uk they gave scotland a referendum they said
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:21.800]  do you want to stay in the uk or not gave them the choice they chose to stay in and then they
[3:35:21.800 --> 3:35:26.120]  had an election as to where they're not they were going to get out of the e you and as dr
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:32.040]  steve patinic pointed out today spain is an artificial construct just like the e you is
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:38.520]  every political construct is artificial the real thing that holds people together are the things
[3:35:38.520 --> 3:35:44.760]  that they have in catalonia a common language a common culture uh an economic interest that is
[3:35:44.760 --> 3:35:50.040]  common that sort of thing but people need to be able to determine whether or not they want to
[3:35:50.040 --> 3:35:54.280]  govern themselves that was a principle of the declaration of independence so i was very disappointed
[3:35:54.280 --> 3:35:59.720]  to see the american government taking a somewhat of an empire approach to this
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:06.600]  instead of taking a 1776 approach to this they don't understand the same forces that put president
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:11.960]  trump in power are going to continue to devolve power from the center and if we go back and
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:17.720]  understand if we get beyond the false history that we've been given about civil war it was
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:23.800]  a real eye-opener for me years ago uh my wife part of her family is from idli and they had
[3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:29.800]  a diary of somebody who was in the army of garibaldi and there was a civil war in idli at
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:37.800]  exactly the same time that we had our civil war here in america exactly the same time and here's
[3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:42.040]  what caused it the same thing that happened here in america no they didn't have plantations with
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:49.480]  slaves on them they had agrarian interests versus industrial interests and the industrial
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:57.080]  interests were trying to consolidate power into a nation state prior to that time in idli as well
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:37:02.280]  as through prussia and austria and others there were regional centers of power especially in idli
[3:37:02.280 --> 3:37:09.320]  it was predominantly cities that had the power and they consolidated that into a nation state and
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:14.760]  it was a movement of the industrialists who wanted to consolidate power against the agrarian
[3:37:14.760 --> 3:37:20.360]  interests who had held power previous to that and so when you look at this you realize that it
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:27.320]  wasn't just in america that we had this concentration of forces into the nation state because prior to
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:33.560]  the civil war everybody talked about the united states are the united states are then it became the
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:39.640]  united states is it was that consolidation that was a product of our civil war that turned us
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:47.240]  into an empire but it also created other nation states in idli and germany and that was a worldwide
[3:37:47.240 --> 3:37:53.160]  movement driven by the industrial revolution as a difference as a sea change and the way government
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:58.760]  was done and now we see the same type of thing happening again there is a sea change that is
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:04.280]  happening throughout the world part of it is being driven by the information revolution the fact that
[3:38:04.280 --> 3:38:09.800]  people are able to connect with each other as they were able to during the revolutionary war
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:13.400]  they had committees of correspondence well that's what the internet is isn't it that's what your
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:20.920]  social media is in a way but it's also the ability to be able to analyze and process information to
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:28.280]  connect with people who are likeminded and whatever the causes of it are and however this has come
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:35.160]  about what is happening is a movement across the globe to get control of our lives in the way that
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:40.920]  it is expressed in the declaration of independence we have certain inalienable rights that we possess
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:47.960]  as human beings as creatures of god every one of us regardless of our nation regardless of our
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:55.320]  race whatever we all have these same rights that we get from god government is created to defend
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:38:59.320]  those rights that's the principles of the declaration of independence that's the principle
[3:38:59.320 --> 3:39:03.480]  our government was created on and when the government does not protect those rights when it
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:08.840]  becomes hostile to those rights when it starts to take all those rights away that's the point
[3:39:08.840 --> 3:39:16.040]  at which we have not only the right but the duty to alter or abolish that government now we can do
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:21.480]  it peacefully or we can do it violently if you make peaceful change peaceful revolution impossible
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:25.880]  as JFK said you're going to have violent revolution so that's the question before
[3:39:25.880 --> 3:39:32.120]  Catalonia how does this evolve well it evolves into whether or not the local sheriffs are going
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:37.480]  to support a free election or not they've already taken 700 of the mayors and they've summoned them
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:44.600]  to the Spanish court lectured them said you better not do this that's about 75% of the different
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:48.280]  towns that are going to be there they came back they said now we're still going to do it they
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:53.240]  arrested 14 individuals in the national government they said now we're still going to do it they
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:59.240]  confiscated the ballots they said we're still going to do it and they are threatening to use force
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:06.440]  and they're telling the local police the massa that they are going to take orders from the central
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:12.440]  government we'll see about that I think the harder they squeeze you go back to the star wars remember
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:18.440]  when Carrie Fisher princess Leia says to him you squeeze these people they're going to like
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:22.520]  water coming through your fingers I don't remember the exact quote but that's essentially what's
[3:40:22.520 --> 3:40:27.240]  happening the harder you squeeze these people the more they're going to push back it was already
[3:40:27.880 --> 3:40:32.440]  the majority of people who wanted to have independence and I think they have hardened
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:40.680]  this even more by their oppressive reactionary movements so we look at this and we look at the
[3:40:40.680 --> 3:40:48.040]  election of Roy Moore in Alabama against the establishment and it's not just you know Trump
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:51.800]  went along with it he said all right I'm going to endorse Luther strange but when he went down
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:56.040]  Friday that's how all this stuff with the NFL started he was basically trying to distance himself
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:00.840]  from that endorsement of Luther strange he comes down he gives us rambling thing well you know on
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:05.160]  the one hand this and on the other hand that about Luther strange Roy Moore and at the end of it he
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:11.960]  says well maybe I made a mistake I don't know we'll see and so basically he just unendorsed him
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:18.760]  to the extent that Nigel Farage said I felt at that point even though he had been contacted
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:22.360]  by many of the people who had been part of the Trump revolution and this is people like
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:29.800]  Steve Bannon at the center of it but also many people throughout Republican we got Mark Meadows
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:36.200]  we got Louis Gohmert we got Sarah Palin there's a slew of people who are real conservatives
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:42.680]  Mo Brooks who was one of the Senate candidates in the primary had endorsed Roy Moore there were a
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:47.080]  lot of people who were Trump supporters hardcore Trump supporters the Freedom Caucus and so forth
[3:41:48.120 --> 3:41:52.360]  Nigel Farage said I didn't want to go there and oppose President Trump on this but he said
[3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:59.240]  he basically took the endorsement back on Friday night and he did so it is not a as NPR likes to
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:03.720]  say this is a defeat for Trump it wasn't a defeat for Trump it was a defeat for the establishment
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:09.080]  it was a defeat for Luther strange the creature of the establishment it was a big defeat for Mitch
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:15.160]  McConnell because he put everything he had into this you realize 30 million dollars on a Senate
[3:42:15.160 --> 3:42:20.760]  race think about that think about how absurd that is and that was Republicans spinning that
[3:42:20.760 --> 3:42:26.600]  against another Republican why because he was not a creature of the swamp he is not going to do
[3:42:26.600 --> 3:42:33.000]  what Mitch McConnell says Roy Moore is going to do what the Constitution says do you understand
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:38.520]  the difference the big difference a big difference between what Mitch McConnell says and what the
[3:42:38.520 --> 3:42:42.920]  Constitution says and you're going to need people like Roy Moore if you're going to get the Trump
[3:42:42.920 --> 3:42:49.240]  agenda through and we're going to have more people like Roy Moore as I pointed out people were saying
[3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:55.800]  before the election they said if this happens it is going to be a big defeat for Mitch McConnell
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:43:00.280]  and you're going to have a lot of establishment Republicans who are not going to run for re-election
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:06.040]  and the very next morning we had one of the worst establishment Republicans say that he
[3:43:06.040 --> 3:43:12.040]  is not going to run again Bob Corker somebody that Jerome Corsi has written volumes on about
[3:43:12.040 --> 3:43:19.720]  being one of the key people pushing back against Obamacare repeal and I said before this election
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:27.080]  I said let's not run through this Lindsey Graham bill let's not do that the Graham Cassidy thing
[3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:34.440]  because all we're going to do is make this socialist scheme a little more palatable for people
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:39.560]  first they put the pressure on then they relieve it a little bit and you oh that's great they
[3:43:39.560 --> 3:43:44.360]  took off some of that those onerous taxes and regulations that's good we're moving in the
[3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:49.080]  right direction no you're not it's a ratchet then they're going to ratchet it up after the next
[3:43:49.080 --> 3:43:55.240]  election so let the people feel the pain of socialism let them get an appetite to get the
[3:43:55.240 --> 3:44:00.920]  government out of our lives before we forget that it was never there before in a way that it is right
[3:44:00.920 --> 3:44:05.800]  now we used to have a free market in health care that ended in world war two as I pointed
[3:44:05.800 --> 3:44:12.520]  out this morning on the on the radio show that ended when they came in and they enacted wage
[3:44:12.520 --> 3:44:16.600]  and price controls and then as a pressure relief out they said all right we'll ease a little bit
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:21.880]  of that pain by letting the employers deduct health care insurance so then we wound up with
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:28.200]  the third party system and you broke the connection between the payer and the provider
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:34.200]  and you broke the incentives for marketplaces now when president trump ran for office he gave us a
[3:44:34.200 --> 3:44:39.880]  very detailed plan he said these are the things we're going to do we're going to have markets not
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:45.320]  mandates we're going to have competition not coercion we're going to remove the the artificial
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:50.440]  constraints on competition across straight state lines we're going to give you ownership of your
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:54.760]  health care dollar and you're going to be rewarded if you spend it wisely we're going to make sure
[3:44:54.760 --> 3:44:58.200]  that you have information so that you can spend that wisely we're going to make sure there's
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:03.080]  competition so that you can get the cost down that's the only thing that's going to drive the cost
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:09.080]  down folks you're not going to have the cost driven down by having people in washington
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:12.520]  dictate to you you're only going to have the cost come down when there's competition
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:18.680]  you know that you're americans come on we know that you only get cost down when you compete
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:25.160]  you never get cost down if you regulate if you tax they're telling us that it was affordable care
[3:45:25.160 --> 3:45:30.040]  that's the biggest gift we ever gave to obama when we called it obama care it's not affordable we
[3:45:30.040 --> 3:45:34.120]  should call it not the aca we shouldn't call it obama care we should call it the affordable
[3:45:34.120 --> 3:45:40.040]  care act it's a joke everybody knows it's not affordable everybody knows it was funded on theft
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:45.640]  from fanny fanny and freddy people the subsidies we know that the insurance companies is a bad deal
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:51.640]  for them on the on the individual policies and and so you know they're looking for ways to get out
[3:45:51.640 --> 3:45:57.080]  of it to change it and so forth we don't want the government telling us what we have to do with
[3:45:57.080 --> 3:46:03.400]  health care we want the ability and the information and the competition to have a free market and the
[3:46:03.400 --> 3:46:09.400]  government which is that one little thing that they did 60 years ago that one little thing where
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:15.320]  they broke the connection the direct connection between buyer and seller between provider and
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:21.880]  patient when they broke that when they instituted by force by mandate this third party insurance
[3:46:21.880 --> 3:46:26.200]  system that's what began to destroy our system it took a very long time because it was just one
[3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:31.560]  part that they messed up but it was a fundamental part and we're not going to allow them to socialize
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:37.240]  our medicine we're not going to allow them to take away our medical freedom and we're going to get
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:42.760]  people in office we're going to do it at the GOP primary level because the democrats are full
[3:46:42.760 --> 3:46:47.800]  on the socialism now they want to go all the way in single payer they own everything they tell us
[3:46:47.800 --> 3:46:51.960]  everything they own us completely they can prohibit what we put in our body they can force
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:57.560]  things into our body they have full control over our medicine that's what the democrats want when
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:47:04.440]  they say single payer that means you are their slave for life and you don't get medical treatment
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:09.080]  unless you do what they say we're not going to stand for that we're not going to allow that and
[3:47:09.080 --> 3:47:15.640]  we've got to get rid of obama care quickly because if we don't we'll be stuck with it just like we're
[3:47:15.640 --> 3:47:19.640]  stuck with the department of education remember it was ronald reagan who said he was going to get
[3:47:19.640 --> 3:47:23.400]  rid of the department of education it was less than four years old it had been created by jimmy
[3:47:23.400 --> 3:47:28.280]  carter and instead after eight years ronald reagan he didn't get rid of the department of
[3:47:28.280 --> 3:47:36.680]  education instead he took it from rosemary's baby and the crib to a a a well-fed adult if you will
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:40.760]  and it's been getting worse all the time and obama care is going to continue to get worse we do
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:49.160]  not want anything like lindsay grahams bill instead i said the better thing to do is to let the
[3:47:49.160 --> 3:47:56.360]  democrats own the failure of obama care not bring it on to the republican party and they say see
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:48:01.800]  you made these little tiny little free market changes to it even though they're not free market
[3:48:01.800 --> 3:48:06.840]  changes you took off some of our regulations and taxes and it all failed no let it fail
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:15.560]  don't own it let the democrats own it let the rhino republicans own it let people understand
[3:48:15.560 --> 3:48:21.320]  that they are the problem it's the establishment republicans along with the socialist democrats
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:27.080]  and get those people out of washington that's what we need to do and so that's why i think that
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:30.840]  you know we see obama care forever maybe it is forever i don't think so i think we're going to
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:36.920]  push it back and i think we're going to get more people like roymor in there at the primary level
[3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:43.240]  that is what's going to push us back that is why i am very optimistic after that election last night
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:48.440]  it's just the beginning it's just the beginning folks and these forces that are at work the forces
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:54.200]  that put president trump in place uh they don't want to talk about it but it's going there's
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:59.160]  going to be other places other than catalonia there's going to be places in america that are
[3:48:59.160 --> 3:49:04.040]  going to want independence we see this already in california we've seen it in texas remember when
[3:49:04.680 --> 3:49:09.720]  we became a nation those 13 colonies they had a population of only about two and a half million
[3:49:09.720 --> 3:49:14.680]  people they were very concerned that they would be consolidated under a central government they
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:19.800]  did not want that at all they put all kinds of checks and balances to make sure that that wouldn't
[3:49:19.800 --> 3:49:25.720]  happen uh they first organized as a confederation and even when they put in the constitution they
[3:49:25.720 --> 3:49:28.600]  said well you know we're going to split the federal government and then we're going to split the
[3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:33.320]  power between the federal government and the states and the people in various ways they knew
[3:49:33.320 --> 3:49:38.840]  that the real danger was a consolidation of power and we've seen what that consolidation of power
[3:49:38.840 --> 3:49:44.600]  has done to us with globalism and we're going to start pushing back and demanding that we
[3:49:44.600 --> 3:49:51.320]  have more control over our lives obama care is just one of the irritations that is going to drive
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:49:58.200]  the devolution of power away from the center that is ultimately the force that is at work here
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:02.920]  that's what's going on in catalonia that's what we why we see all these referenda throughout europe
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:09.160]  that's why the european union is going to break up it will break up it is unsustainable it is not
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:14.120]  only an artificial political construct it is unsustainable from an economic standpoint people
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:20.760]  don't want that anymore we don't want power to continue to concentrate at the center uh it's
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:26.040]  already uh ungovernable in a nation like this and and we're starting to see the throes of this as we
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:32.520]  see the deep divisions in the aftermath of this election what you're seeing here are the polls

[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:53.720]  my only social media that i engage with we just have learned and of course it's up on the dredge
[3:54:53.720 --> 3:55:02.040]  report feds have collected record taxes through august they still run 673.7 billion dollar deficits
[3:55:02.040 --> 3:55:08.520]  so there you go no matter how much money we collect and this is an ongoing story that we see every
[3:55:08.520 --> 3:55:15.080]  quarter dredge puts this up and it's good that he does because we need to understand that it isn't
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:22.040]  that we have not enough taxes is that we're spending money and we can't stop spending the money
[3:55:22.040 --> 3:55:24.760]  and they're not even talking about what they're going to do about this they're saying well let's
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:28.440]  just get rid of the debt ceiling all together and pretend that it doesn't exist we can just tell
[3:55:28.440 --> 3:55:34.920]  the federal reserve to keep printing money to just you know give us this this open line of credit
[3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:42.920]  understand it is a balloon note and they can and will pull it at some point in time it is a very
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:48.680]  dangerous situation that we see here it is not sustainable we have multiple forces that are pushing
[3:55:48.680 --> 3:55:56.680]  against the petrodollar right now we have china russia brazil india south africa the bricks they
[3:55:56.680 --> 3:56:01.880]  are all talking about how they need to undo the petrodollar we've had been as well i say they're
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:07.480]  no longer going to sell oil and they're one of the biggest producers of oil in the world the
[3:56:07.480 --> 3:56:14.600]  world the thing that has supported our dollar is our alliance with saudi arabia since we came off
[3:56:14.600 --> 3:56:20.600]  of the gold standard the fact that people had to purchase their energy which by the way folks is
[3:56:20.600 --> 3:56:27.080]  still oil they may not like it but it's still oil that's what makes the world run it's oil those
[3:56:27.080 --> 3:56:33.640]  fossil fuels and that is the the essence of the economy as a matter of fact we may at some point
[3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:39.400]  get to a situation where we just sell shares of energy but you've got people like countries like
[3:56:39.400 --> 3:56:45.160]  venezuela like china like russia that are deliberately pushing back against the petrodollar if they do
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:51.960]  that this exploding deficit that we have that we've been able to sustain because of the agreement
[3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:56.920]  that we have with saudi arabia that's going to come crashing down it's going to have massive
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:57:02.600]  consequences here in america and we've got russia saying that now at their ports they're no longer
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:08.920]  going to accept the dollar they're only going to accept the ruble and the shippers complained about
[3:57:08.920 --> 3:57:13.800]  that they said the ruble is just not as stable as a dollar and they said well if everybody
[3:57:13.800 --> 3:57:18.040]  is evaluating their services in it that will make it more stable they understand that they
[3:57:18.040 --> 3:57:22.840]  understand the basis of this now and we're going to get a lot of pushback a lot of competition
[3:57:22.840 --> 3:57:31.000]  from a lot of people who don't wish america well they're trying to push down the the dollar
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:36.120]  and as we look at this exploding deficit we've had generals warn us that the biggest threat to our
[3:57:36.120 --> 3:57:43.320]  national security is financial and the biggest threat to our finances is the petrodollar one
[3:57:43.320 --> 3:57:49.080]  of the other big threats to our country of course is the ability to move whenever you have somebody
[3:57:49.080 --> 3:57:54.440]  declare war what is it that they want to do they want to stop people from being able to move
[3:57:54.440 --> 3:57:58.440]  from being able to shoot from being able to communicate those are the three things that
[3:57:58.440 --> 3:58:05.320]  they go for right the first one is movement that's why we have the interstate system is because
[3:58:05.320 --> 3:58:10.120]  eisenhower said we need to be able to move the military around here and yet what is happening in
[3:58:10.120 --> 3:58:15.880]  our country we have stopped building roads and we're now starting to put in to place an infrastructure
[3:58:15.880 --> 3:58:19.800]  that will follow us around you think it's a big deal that the saudi women have a right to drive
[3:58:19.800 --> 3:58:23.560]  they still got to have a man with them in the car we're going to have to have the government
[3:58:23.560 --> 3:58:28.680]  as a guardian with us in the car everywhere we go all right that's it for the alex jones show stay
[3:58:28.680 --> 3:58:32.840]  with us the war room is coming up and join us in the morning at eight a.m. for the real news
[3:58:32.840 --> 3:58:50.760]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
