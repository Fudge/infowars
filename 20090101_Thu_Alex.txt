[00:00.000 --> 00:21.420]  All right, final segment with our two guests.
[00:21.420 --> 00:26.100]  Anything else you want to add to Detective Carroll or your email, your contact points
[00:26.100 --> 00:32.680]  for other police, other peace officers in the New Jersey, New York, surrounding area
[00:32.680 --> 00:37.760]  that want to join with you to form, I guess, police and military against the 9-Eleven cover-up
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.960]  or for a 9-Eleven investigation or whatever you want to call it.
[00:40.960 --> 00:42.800]  You want to give out a contact point or?
[00:42.800 --> 00:52.640]  Yeah, email me at jmkj918 at conquist.net And again, give that email out again slowly
[00:52.640 --> 00:53.640]  for folks.
[00:53.640 --> 01:04.120]  jmkj918 at conquist.net All right, and come out to ground zero with Luke and the guys
[01:04.120 --> 01:05.120]  and the gals.
[01:05.120 --> 01:09.560]  I mean, I know you've been having some events of your own, but let's all join forces here.
[01:09.560 --> 01:11.320]  No, absolutely.
[01:11.320 --> 01:19.840]  And just leaving, I just want to be very specific about this because I am coming out.
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.560]  I am trained very well.
[01:22.560 --> 01:25.880]  I know exactly what I'm doing here, so I'm going to be very specific.
[01:25.880 --> 01:29.040]  I'm calling on all angels.
[01:29.040 --> 01:34.320]  That means I'm calling to all the patriots that are listening, especially military employees.
[01:34.320 --> 01:37.720]  This is our responsibility.
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.480]  This is what we're doing.
[01:39.480 --> 01:42.880]  Everybody either going to be a hero or you're not.
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.040]  This is what we're trained to do.
[01:45.040 --> 01:46.040]  Wake up.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  Don't be a dope.
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.680]  Get in the mid, get in the game because I think it's going to get worse from you.
[01:51.680 --> 01:53.680]  God bless you.
[01:53.680 --> 01:54.680]  Absolutely.
[01:54.680 --> 01:55.680]  Don't leave.
[01:55.680 --> 01:58.560]  I want to have Luke say hi to you here as well.
[01:58.560 --> 02:01.760]  Luke, I hope you guys get in touch with each other and I hope more people come out to ground
[02:01.760 --> 02:02.760]  zero.
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.560]  A recap here where we are changed is going right now.
[02:07.560 --> 02:09.000]  Right now we're making a new film.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.600]  Right now we're working very hard.
[02:10.600 --> 02:11.920]  We're out there every Saturday.
[02:11.920 --> 02:13.640]  We're out there having meetings every Friday.
[02:13.640 --> 02:15.120]  We're doing excellent work.
[02:15.120 --> 02:18.960]  There's a lot of amazing good people behind us, a lot of great police officers.
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.880]  I want to salute the detective, thank him so much from the bottom of my heart.
[02:22.880 --> 02:26.680]  There's a lot of good cops out there, but we're also going through a lot of harassment
[02:26.680 --> 02:28.960]  by a lot of bad cops out there.
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.240]  Recently we went out to confront Henry Polson where I was confronted by police officers
[02:33.240 --> 02:35.240]  trying to arrest me for no reason.
[02:35.240 --> 02:41.760]  I have the video of the police officer basically stopping me, harassing me, screaming at me
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.240]  for no reason at all, for standing on the street corner where Henry Polson was supposed
[02:46.240 --> 02:47.680]  to be walking by.
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.680]  Well, he's our God, I mean he's stolen 8.5 trillion.
[02:51.680 --> 02:54.160]  We have to love the foreign banker.
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.160]  Exactly.
[02:55.160 --> 02:58.880]  And the Secret Service even admitted when we ran up to Polson and we asked him, how come
[02:58.880 --> 03:00.680]  you threaten martial law?
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.960]  How come you threaten Congress and the Senate with martial law?
[03:03.960 --> 03:07.480]  He grabbed the camera and when Polson got in his car he was like, yeah, we were watching
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.720]  you all day.
[03:08.720 --> 03:11.920]  And then we heard everything that they were talking about with other people inside the
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.000]  event that they overheard the Secret Service guys talking about us saying, look, have you
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.760]  gotten this Polson footage up on the web yet?
[03:20.760 --> 03:21.760]  Not yet.
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.760]  We're working on it.
[03:22.760 --> 03:23.760]  We're working on the film right now.
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.880]  Well, you know, did you get all the videos I just mailed you?
[03:28.880 --> 03:30.560]  I did not get anything yet.
[03:30.560 --> 03:31.560]  Okay.
[03:31.560 --> 03:35.080]  Well, I know I've seen Rob running around here dubbing videos for you guys to use for
[03:35.080 --> 03:36.080]  weeks.
[03:36.080 --> 03:37.200]  So I don't know what's going on.
[03:37.200 --> 03:38.200]  We just moved.
[03:38.200 --> 03:39.200]  It's quite a mess.
[03:39.200 --> 03:40.200]  But that's great.
[03:40.200 --> 03:44.240]  But yet again, there's a lot of good police officers that need to educate all the other
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.520]  police officers because the level of harassment is really escalating with FBI officials talking
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.360]  to our supporters down at ground zero that are not even a part of our group that are
[03:53.360 --> 03:55.480]  just there working supporting us.
[03:55.480 --> 03:57.720]  So we need to educate as many people as we can.
[03:57.720 --> 04:05.960]  Well, that's because the system is threatened and folks can find out more at WeAreChange.org.
[04:05.960 --> 04:07.960]  And you got a lot of new chapters, right, Luke?
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.040]  Yeah, we have over 77 chapters all around the world.
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.880]  Our news chapter is in Hawaii, we're working every day, all around the world, being the
[04:15.880 --> 04:18.800]  change that we want to see in this world and nothing can stop us.
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.560]  Nothing can stop our spirit, our soul in finding out what's really happened on 9-11 and fighting
[04:23.560 --> 04:24.560]  the justice.
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.080]  We have great people like Major Mike McCormick, firefighters like John Froder, family members,
[04:29.080 --> 04:34.080]  you know, Manny Badillo, Bob McLevain, being out there at ground zero with us, talking
[04:34.080 --> 04:36.680]  to regular people that don't know what's going on.
[04:36.680 --> 04:37.680]  All right.
[04:37.680 --> 04:39.720]  Luke, we're going to talk to you for a full hour in the near future.
[04:39.720 --> 04:44.000]  Let me say bye to you when we end this break and let me say goodbye to Detective John Carroll
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  right now.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.480]  John, we'll be watching your back.
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.480]  Watch ours.
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.480]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.480]  Thanks for your courage.
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.480]  Thanks, buddy.
[04:50.480 --> 04:53.120]  You joined publicly a lot of other great people.
[04:53.120 --> 04:57.640]  They're standing up and fighting for truth, putting former presidents of other countries,
[04:57.640 --> 05:02.920]  former defense ministers, you name it.
[05:02.920 --> 05:03.920]  Less is more.
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.840]  I want you to think of Life Change T as, well, a 2008 Ferrari 612.
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.880]  The Ferrari 612 is a two-door four-passenger luxury car that gives an exploding 540 horsepower
[05:14.880 --> 05:16.640]  through its six-liter V12.
[05:16.640 --> 05:22.560]  It has a top speed of 199 miles per hour and can accelerate zero to 16 in about four seconds.
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.880]  Life Change T will accelerate your life into feeling more energy, losing weight, and cleansing
[05:26.880 --> 05:29.640]  toxins out of your body so you'll live longer.
[05:29.640 --> 05:30.640]  And guess what?
[05:30.640 --> 05:35.840]  You can accelerate your life without a Ferrari 612 sticker price of $318,000.
[05:35.840 --> 05:41.240]  You can buy green tea for less, but unfortunately, it's just another daily driver with no performance.
[05:41.240 --> 05:44.680]  So for just about a dollar a day, you can drive the Ferrari of teas.
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.160]  Don't be fooled by size.
[05:46.160 --> 05:48.920]  Check our website out at GetTheT.com.
[05:48.920 --> 05:54.960]  That's GetTheT.com, where you can call us at 928-308-0408.
[05:54.960 --> 05:58.120]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[05:58.120 --> 06:01.360]  Remember, Life Change T, less is more.
[06:01.360 --> 06:06.720]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[06:06.720 --> 06:10.480]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.360]  to tell their story.
[06:17.360 --> 06:26.360]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:26.360 --> 06:31.120]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[06:31.120 --> 06:33.400]  take action against their global masters.
[06:33.400 --> 06:36.560]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[06:36.560 --> 06:42.360]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[06:42.360 --> 06:45.880]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[06:45.880 --> 06:51.720]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[06:51.720 --> 06:54.360]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[06:54.360 --> 06:58.040]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[06:58.040 --> 07:01.680]  and bring in martial law.
[07:01.680 --> 07:05.840]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.
[07:05.840 --> 07:11.800]  Right now at mainmilitary.com, you'll find savings on the top must-have military supplies.

[07:55.560 --> 08:07.240]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:07.240 --> 08:26.920]  a war on for your mind.
[08:26.920 --> 08:45.160]  And in this article it goes through the evidence that I read little blurbs in other books, other
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.960]  espionage books, other World War II guests that we interviewed letters from Patton home
[08:49.960 --> 08:56.000]  to family and others has promised to have parades and go to Congress and demand that
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.320]  thousands of U.S. soldiers captured by Nazis that were then, when the Russians on the Eastern
[09:01.320 --> 09:07.200]  Front came into Germany and Poland, they captured these U.S. servicemen, Army airmen, Army Marines
[09:07.200 --> 09:09.440]  and we're going to use them as slave labor.
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.880]  The numbers as high as 12,000.
[09:10.880 --> 09:16.800]  He got very upset about that, very patriotic, extremely patriotic, but actually did have
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.600]  allegiance to his troops.
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.960]  He expected a lot of them, but I'm some expert historian on Patton, but most people don't
[09:23.960 --> 09:24.960]  even read about World War II.
[09:24.960 --> 09:28.800]  I've read a few books about Patton, probably read about more than 60 books total about
[09:28.800 --> 09:35.280]  World War II because it's such a pivotal sea change in world society.
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.880]  But when I read this, this is what experts that we've had over the years said about
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.000]  how they favored OSS slash CIA way to kill somebody.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.840]  They rammed his car with a truck, jumped up, shot him in the low velocity bullet, the
[09:48.840 --> 09:54.960]  throat didn't kill him, so then they sit in NKVD to kill him.
[09:54.960 --> 10:00.320]  And we knew he was saying the Russians were a threat that, you know, that same thing MacArthur
[10:00.320 --> 10:09.320]  got relieved from when the Chinese poured across the Yalu River there in, there in
[10:09.320 --> 10:10.320]  the Korea.
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.360]  He wanted to use nukes and then they went to the UN and stopped the whole deal because
[10:15.360 --> 10:22.480]  of course MacArthur wasn't at that grid level, which now totally declassified that actually
[10:22.480 --> 10:29.560]  the United States put the Soviets, you know, in with money in 1917 along with the Bank
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.560]  of England.
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.280]  And of course in 1949 now completely declassified even on the history channel, the CIA actually
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.240]  went with Mao Zedong against Shanghai Shek and the Nationalists.
[10:39.240 --> 10:45.520]  So that was part of a larger strategic plan to create a false bipolar world.
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.360]  And so the, but you know, I'm getting off the issue here and I appreciate our guest
[10:50.360 --> 10:56.600]  joining us, but this is an example of General George S. Patton who was upset about a lot
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.800]  of things being murdered and a lot of telegraphs gone over the evidence and says they believe
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.400]  it's conclusive.
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.960]  The author talked to the famous OSS spy and assassin before he died.
[11:06.960 --> 11:11.240]  He also has his diary and a lot of other eyewitness reports and material.
[11:11.240 --> 11:14.640]  And it fits in with, it's kind of like Gulf of Tonkin.
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.160]  You know, we always knew that was staged, but now it's declassified, CIA admits it.
[11:18.160 --> 11:19.160]  Well, same thing here.
[11:19.160 --> 11:22.320]  So we have the expert on with us for the next 15 minutes.
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.960]  And I appreciate Robert K. Wilcox, author of Target Patton.
[11:26.960 --> 11:29.800]  And this is a book I will be getting and I will be reading.
[11:29.800 --> 11:31.680]  In fact, we have an online bookstore at info wars.com.
[11:31.680 --> 11:35.480]  Maybe I should call a publisher and buy a few hundred and sell them on the site because
[11:35.480 --> 11:37.640]  this is something people need to know.
[11:37.640 --> 11:41.200]  But again, thank you so much for coming on the show with us, Mr. Wilcox.
[11:41.200 --> 11:43.160]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.600]  Tell us about yourself, how you got into this as a historian and then break down what really
[11:48.600 --> 11:49.600]  happened to Patton.
[11:49.600 --> 11:57.280]  Well, I'm a writer and I'm always looking for good stories and my cousin is a, he owns
[11:57.280 --> 12:03.840]  a detective agency and we were working out one day and he just blurts out that he knew
[12:03.840 --> 12:09.800]  that Patton had been killed because he talked to the guy who had a lot of information about
[12:09.800 --> 12:10.800]  it.
[12:10.800 --> 12:17.960]  Now, I was like most people, I thought that Patton had been, had died from a normal accident,
[12:17.960 --> 12:18.960]  a car accident.
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.960]  And that's what I told him.
[12:19.960 --> 12:20.960]  He said, oh no, no.
[12:20.960 --> 12:22.680]  He said, I can put you in touch with the guy.
[12:22.680 --> 12:24.080]  He'll tell you about it.
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.960]  Well, he didn't say, tell me about it.
[12:25.960 --> 12:30.320]  But anyway, he can put me in touch with the guy and I, I then, as you mentioned earlier,
[12:30.320 --> 12:35.360]  went and talked to Douglas Pizotta, who was in fact an OSS assassin.
[12:35.360 --> 12:42.000]  Now, I want to preface this by saying that Pizotta had lived a long life as a clandestine.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.080]  He had stayed on after World War II.
[12:45.080 --> 12:46.760]  He had been one of the first jet birds.
[12:46.760 --> 12:54.800]  This was the beginning of our special forces and had jumped in to behind Nazi lines in
[12:54.800 --> 12:58.760]  conjunction with D-Day and had organized the Machi Stirling guy.
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.480]  And one of the things I did was go right into the National Archives and found his records.
[13:02.480 --> 13:05.880]  Luckily, they had been finally declassified.
[13:05.880 --> 13:08.440]  And this guy had won as many medals as anybody.
[13:08.440 --> 13:10.760]  He was just a terrific, terrific guy.
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.320]  But he had spent a long time as a clandestine and would have never talked to me in a million
[13:15.320 --> 13:17.480]  years, I'm sure.
[13:17.480 --> 13:23.080]  But he had had a stroke and he also had been promised that he would be given a big job
[13:23.080 --> 13:24.080]  in the CIA.
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.920]  And when he came back, of course, they didn't know who he was.
[13:26.920 --> 13:29.280]  There were never any records of anything like here.
[13:29.280 --> 13:36.800]  He had to fight to get all of his VA benefits for being stabbed, shot, all these other
[13:36.800 --> 13:37.800]  things.
[13:37.800 --> 13:40.880]  And he became very, very mad about it all.
[13:40.880 --> 13:41.880]  And so all of those things...
[13:41.880 --> 13:43.280]  Yeah, that's why E. Howard Hunt went public.
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.880]  He knows they killed his wife, blew her up, and he did a deathbed confession about running
[13:47.880 --> 13:49.000]  me off to kill Kennedy.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.720]  But side issue, please continue.
[13:50.720 --> 13:53.000]  Yeah, well, so that's very true.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.320]  So all these things conversed and I got him when he was sort of his guard was down.
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.320]  And he just began to tell me about it.
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.680]  And while I did not think that he had been involved, I thought he just knew, he then
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.120]  told me that he had been given an order by the head of the OSS, Wild Bill Donovan, to
[14:12.120 --> 14:13.120]  kill Patton.
[14:13.120 --> 14:19.560]  And this, by the way, was the result of a long plot, which was we could call stop Patton.
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.160]  And this is bonafide, and when you read in Target Patton, my book, you'll see that way,
[14:24.160 --> 14:28.720]  way back in 44 and 43, they began to not like Patton.
[14:28.720 --> 14:32.200]  He had tremendous jealousy because he was so good.
[14:32.200 --> 14:33.200]  And then...
[14:33.200 --> 14:34.200]  He was anti-communist.
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.200]  He wasn't a globalist.
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.200]  He was America.
[14:36.200 --> 14:41.160]  I mean, he had this long pedigree back to, you know, closely related to George Washington
[14:41.160 --> 14:45.680]  and then all the famous confederate, you know, some of the famous confederate generals.
[14:45.680 --> 14:48.600]  So he had this incredible pedigree that they didn't happen.
[14:48.600 --> 14:54.800]  We know that Eisenhower was very, very jealous of him because he was just a desk clerk, and
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.080]  he wasn't playing ball with Uncle Joe Stalin.
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.320]  But the key here is this assassin, and that's what the Telegraph researched your book, and
[15:02.320 --> 15:05.100]  they say, yeah, this guy hung out with a royal family.
[15:05.100 --> 15:09.920]  This guy was like an undercover movie star with the elite, you know, this commando.
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.240]  So you know, he is who he says he was, and you have the government records.
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.840]  Very much so, and I became very impressed with him not because of basically what he told
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.760]  me, but by going in and researching him, everything he told me was true.
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.000]  So when we get to this point, you know, I've got to give him the benefit of the doubt when
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.320]  he told me about this.
[15:28.320 --> 15:34.240]  But anyway, Patton, as you've so ably described, you know, he wanted to go to war with the
[15:34.240 --> 15:35.240]  Russians right then.
[15:35.240 --> 15:36.240]  He was very pre-issued.
[15:36.240 --> 15:38.240]  He saw what was going on.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.520]  There are so many motives.
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.520]  You've met him.
[15:40.520 --> 15:41.520]  That's the word for Patton.
[15:41.520 --> 15:42.520]  He was pression.
[15:42.520 --> 15:43.520]  Absolutely.
[15:43.520 --> 15:44.520]  He's the leader of a good general.
[15:44.520 --> 15:45.520]  Go ahead.
[15:45.520 --> 15:51.200]  And he was fighting basically an administration which started with FDR, and then by the time
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.320]  this happened, with Truman, who was just following FDRs, that loved the Russians.
[15:56.320 --> 15:58.240]  They wanted to do everything they could.
[15:58.240 --> 16:05.640]  FDR called Stalin Uncle Joe, and they were so blinded or worse, because Stalin just
[16:05.640 --> 16:09.880]  wanted, as you know, to take over the Eastern Europe and use it as a buffer, and that's
[16:09.880 --> 16:11.800]  what he got.
[16:11.800 --> 16:14.240]  But Patton was just nuts over this.
[16:14.240 --> 16:15.240]  They thought he was nuts.
[16:15.240 --> 16:16.800]  He was so mad because he said...
[16:16.800 --> 16:23.600]  Yeah, the looting of the jewels of the Western world as gulag slaves, and of course, they
[16:23.600 --> 16:24.600]  mention a line of it.
[16:24.600 --> 16:25.600]  I haven't read your book yet.
[16:25.600 --> 16:27.200]  A line about U.S. prisoners.
[16:27.200 --> 16:29.280]  I mean, I haven't read your book yet.
[16:29.280 --> 16:31.080]  Is it in there about the 11,000?
[16:31.080 --> 16:32.160]  It is in there.
[16:32.160 --> 16:35.280]  That was another thing that Patton was livid over.
[16:35.280 --> 16:41.360]  You know, once they took over those countries, whoever was in there, including American soldiers,
[16:41.360 --> 16:45.400]  they were just chucked off to the gulag, and that is still an untold story.
[16:45.400 --> 16:47.640]  I believe that you can find books about it now.
[16:47.640 --> 16:53.360]  Yeah, some numbers say 22,000, but confirmed right at 12,000 U.S. soldiers who were in
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.560]  German camps, the Russians take them over, and then our government just said, screw
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.600]  our troops, and Patton's like, screw our troops, so here he is getting in trouble for slapping
[17:02.600 --> 17:09.400]  cowards around, you know, to keep morale up, because this guy's sniveling and crying.
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.000]  And again, using that as PR to make him look bad, but meanwhile, he actually really cared
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  about the troops.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.960]  Oh, he cared terribly about them, and it was worse than even what you've said.
[17:19.960 --> 17:24.560]  I mean, FDR squelched and told people that they could not talk.
[17:24.560 --> 17:26.040]  This is FDR himself.
[17:26.040 --> 17:32.720]  You know, the famous Katyan massacre, where the Russians massacred most of the Polish
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.840]  leadership so they could take over the country and then blamed it on the Nazis.
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.040]  Well, the Russians have now admitted this in the last few years, what had really happened,
[17:41.040 --> 17:42.040]  that it was the Russians.
[17:42.040 --> 17:46.320]  Yeah, they've now dug up the bodies, and there's even Russian bayonets and bullets
[17:46.320 --> 17:47.320]  on them.
[17:47.320 --> 17:48.320]  Exactly.
[17:48.320 --> 17:50.280]  Well, there's no question, because the Russians have admitted it now.
[17:50.280 --> 17:54.240]  They've, you know, sort of a cleanse their soul type of thing, that it was us.
[17:54.240 --> 18:02.120]  But at that time, FDR would not allow the records that he had commissioned, he had
[18:02.120 --> 18:07.560]  an investigation, to be made public, because it made the Russians look bad.
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.200]  He was such a dirtbag, and from what I've read, I've read your book yet.
[18:11.200 --> 18:15.080]  The last straw, though, was the 12,000 troops going to death camps.
[18:15.080 --> 18:19.640]  Well, I can't confirm that, but that is the figure that I've heard, too.
[18:19.640 --> 18:22.680]  And I know that there were Americans that were taken away.
[18:22.680 --> 18:27.480]  Well, how dare Patton not want to send U.S. troops to Russian camps for no reason?
[18:27.480 --> 18:28.840]  He deserved to die.
[18:28.840 --> 18:29.840]  He wasn't a good American.
[18:29.840 --> 18:33.480]  And of course, that's what Wild Bill said, he said, he's a great patriot, but I need
[18:33.480 --> 18:34.480]  you to kill him.
[18:34.480 --> 18:39.240]  Yeah, that was, this is the culmination of a series of meetings that Bazzata said he
[18:39.240 --> 18:42.360]  had, which started with the Stop Patton.
[18:42.360 --> 18:48.360]  And it's a historical fact, we know, that when Patton, after he'd roared through France,
[18:48.360 --> 18:56.640]  he was poised in 1944 in September to go into Germany, he would have ended that war in a
[18:56.640 --> 19:01.040]  month or two and imagine all the American lives that would have been saved.
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.600]  Well they stopped him because Eisenhower, who was a diplomat, not a fighter, not a
[19:05.600 --> 19:14.320]  coward, he got, he wanted the British to, to, you know, the bridge too far, a Montgomery.
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.120]  And he wanted Montgomery to do this, so they stopped Patton at the German border and they
[19:19.120 --> 19:20.120]  took his gas.
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.200]  This is a matter of historical record.
[19:22.200 --> 19:25.760]  That's even in the Battle of the Bulge movie, and of course that's kind of the official
[19:25.760 --> 19:26.760]  spin.
[19:26.760 --> 19:28.920]  They really wanted the Soviets to get half the country.
[19:28.920 --> 19:32.440]  Well, and what happened afterwards?
[19:32.440 --> 19:34.520]  I mean Germany, half of Germany, go ahead.
[19:34.520 --> 19:41.200]  Yeah, because, because Patton couldn't go in there, he had to go and stop the same Germans
[19:41.200 --> 19:46.000]  who then were able to regroup and hit us at the Battle of the Bulge, which was our worst
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.080]  defeat.
[19:47.080 --> 19:49.520]  We lost more guys there than we did at D-Day.
[19:49.520 --> 19:52.600]  Well, riveting, stay there sir, we're gonna come right back to you and let you go to the
[19:52.600 --> 19:54.080]  book, play by play here.

[21:01.280 --> 21:04.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[21:04.200 --> 21:08.640]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[21:08.640 --> 21:09.640]  for your IRA?
[21:09.640 --> 21:15.480]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the
[21:15.480 --> 21:21.320]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[21:21.320 --> 21:26.560]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments, like stocks, bonds and
[21:26.560 --> 21:29.480]  CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[21:29.480 --> 21:33.600]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[21:33.600 --> 21:34.920]  you in paper.
[21:34.920 --> 21:40.840]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[21:40.840 --> 21:45.360]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[21:45.360 --> 21:50.720]  Call 800-686-2237, make sure that you secure your future.
[21:50.720 --> 22:00.800]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[22:00.800 --> 22:06.060]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[22:06.060 --> 22:07.560]  against this country.
[22:07.560 --> 22:11.320]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[22:11.320 --> 22:12.320]  Bin Laden.
[22:12.320 --> 22:13.320]  This is his MO.
[22:13.320 --> 22:16.960]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[22:16.960 --> 22:21.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[22:21.560 --> 22:24.160]  networks inside the United States.
[22:24.160 --> 22:28.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[22:28.640 --> 22:30.800]  in and on the U.S.
[22:30.800 --> 22:34.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:34.480 --> 22:39.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[22:39.960 --> 22:44.080]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[22:44.080 --> 22:45.080]  much more.
[22:45.080 --> 22:46.080]  Fabled Enemies.

[23:02.080 --> 23:05.200]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[23:05.200 --> 23:08.120]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.360]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[23:12.360 --> 23:17.800]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.

[24:05.840 --> 24:06.840]  Short segment.
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.040]  A long one coming up, so I want to hurry right back to our guest, Robert K. Wilcox, author
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.040]  of Target Patton.
[24:13.040 --> 24:18.680]  That's right, he interviewed the special forces OSS assassin.
[24:18.680 --> 24:27.440]  Let's go through with the start of Stop Patton, discredit him, attack him, don't let him race
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.200]  too fast because we've got to let the Soviets divide this in half, we've got to deal with
[24:32.200 --> 24:33.200]  them.
[24:33.200 --> 24:36.720]  Kind of like the Nazis you divided Poland previously in 1939.
[24:36.720 --> 24:37.720]  Continue.
[24:37.720 --> 24:43.800]  Well, that Stop Patton order came out early, and it's a combination.
[24:43.800 --> 24:46.520]  He was just a guy who spoke his mind.
[24:46.520 --> 24:49.720]  He was too good for his own britches, so to speak.
[24:49.720 --> 24:52.040]  He was better than anybody else, and he proved it.
[24:52.040 --> 24:57.440]  He just roared through France, and so they stopped him right there, and what happened
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.000]  was the Germans, who will tell you themselves that they were in disarray and would have
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  been defeated, they then were able to regroup.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.800]  Because he was running a Blitzkrieg similar to what the Desert Fox would do, but by holding
[25:11.800 --> 25:13.000]  him back, they gave him time.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  Go ahead.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.520]  He traveled and took more ground than any commander ever in the history of the world
[25:18.520 --> 25:19.520]  at that time.
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.440]  His tanks were rolling 400, 500 miles in three or four days, well not three or four days,
[25:25.440 --> 25:28.160]  but maybe in a week, and it was just amazing.
[25:28.160 --> 25:29.680]  The Germans were in disarray.
[25:29.680 --> 25:31.440]  He had pushed them out of France.
[25:31.440 --> 25:32.440]  They didn't know what to do.
[25:32.440 --> 25:33.440]  They would have been beaten.
[25:33.440 --> 25:34.440]  It was a route.
[25:34.440 --> 25:39.440]  It was a route big time, and he couldn't believe that suddenly they're stopping him and they're
[25:39.440 --> 25:47.600]  giving the whole war to Montgomery, his arch-rival, and Montgomery blew it again, which he had
[25:47.600 --> 25:57.080]  done so many times, and the worst, the Germans were able to mount this, get back together,
[25:57.080 --> 26:07.720]  and mount a battle of the Bulge, which almost kicked us out of France, but if it hadn't,
[26:07.720 --> 26:14.920]  but there was Patton right there, and Eisenhower, who had set this all up, just he called his
[26:14.920 --> 26:17.400]  generals to get in and said, what are we going to do, what are we going to do?
[26:17.400 --> 26:19.720]  They didn't know what to do, but Patton said, I know what to do.
[26:19.720 --> 26:27.000]  I'd already planned for it, and he turned this huge third army all the way up and stopped
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.360]  the battle of the Bulge and beat the Germans there, and then was sent back into Germany,
[26:32.360 --> 26:37.720]  and the worst thing that ever happened to him, the day he cried, literally, was when
[26:37.720 --> 26:45.200]  he could not go to Berlin, but the allies of our sides decided to let the Russians
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.960]  come in, as was all planned by Stalin, he had engineered all this, and they took Berlin
[26:50.960 --> 26:57.640]  and the rest of Eastern Europe, and Patton had to sit on the sidelines, so that is probably,
[26:57.640 --> 27:03.520]  in my opinion, the biggest reason that if he was killed, and understand it is a mystery
[27:03.520 --> 27:09.640]  still to me, but I believe that I could go to a grand jury and get an indictment based
[27:09.640 --> 27:15.400]  on what we now know, whether or not it would go to a conviction, we'd have to let that
[27:15.400 --> 27:20.480]  play out, but there's a lot more evidence here, and when you're ready, I'll just start
[27:20.480 --> 27:21.480]  it off.
[27:21.480 --> 27:26.160]  Yeah, let's go over what happened, you know, they failed the assassination attempt that
[27:26.160 --> 27:29.440]  wounded them, and then the NKVD finishing the job.
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.520]  Yeah, as I said, when I first heard about this, I, like most people, thought that he
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.800]  had just died in a normal accident, but then I studied the accident, and it is really,
[27:38.800 --> 27:39.800]  really mysterious.
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.040]  It's the last day before Patton is to leave, there have already been three or four very,
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.760]  very suspicious attempts on his life, in my opinion, which you'll read, and then here's
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.600]  the last day, he's decided to leave the army, because they have strings on him, so that
[27:54.600 --> 28:01.080]  he can go home, and he's going to fight against the Russians, which of course is anathema
[28:01.080 --> 28:05.640]  to the administration, and he's also going to tell the secrets of how the war had been
[28:05.640 --> 28:10.320]  badly managed, and how so many Americans died when they shouldn't have, how he could have
[28:10.320 --> 28:16.360]  gone on and taken Berlin, so he's on this lonely road outside of Mannheim, Germany,
[28:16.360 --> 28:24.560]  it's December 9th, 1945, probably 60 years ago, and it's just a lonely road, and a
[28:24.560 --> 28:33.000]  truck, there's this army truck that's been waiting for him, they stop at a railroad track,
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.240]  and then they start up, so they're not going very fast, and the driver, there's two other
[28:37.240 --> 28:42.880]  people in the car with Patton, another general who is his aide, is on the left side, Patton's
[28:42.880 --> 28:46.920]  on the right side in the back seat, they're in a Cadillac, which is a limousine, it's
[28:46.920 --> 28:51.800]  a big thing, it's got a lot of leg room, and there's a driver there, and this driver notices
[28:51.800 --> 28:58.400]  this truck which starts up when they start up after the railroad track, and it just comes
[28:58.400 --> 29:04.400]  up slowly, almost a breath, and then suddenly, without signaling, turns in front of Patton's
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.840]  car, Patton's driver tries to turn a little to the left, they hit on the right hand side,
[29:09.840 --> 29:17.600]  it's really a fender bender, but Patton ends up with a broken neck, a tremendous cut on
[29:17.600 --> 29:23.880]  his face, and the other two guys don't even move, now this is strange, why did this happen,
[29:23.880 --> 29:28.720]  how could they have a smash, and two guys in the car don't get scratched, and try to
[29:28.720 --> 29:29.720]  get a broken neck.
[29:29.720 --> 29:36.440]  Stay there, stay there, by the way, in declassified, admitted MI6 and CI assassinations, the staged
[29:36.440 --> 29:40.880]  auto accidents are their favorite, they will kill you, put you in a car, and then smash
[29:40.880 --> 29:45.520]  your truck into it, or they will smash your truck in it, then kill you, that's how they
[29:45.520 --> 29:51.320]  kill Diana, so a favorite way to kill, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[29:51.320 --> 30:01.720]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[32:02.160 --> 32:04.120]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[32:04.120 --> 32:07.840]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[32:07.840 --> 32:13.480]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing
[32:13.480 --> 32:15.040]  their food supplies.
[32:15.040 --> 32:19.040]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the
[32:19.040 --> 32:24.960]  21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident
[32:24.960 --> 32:27.880]  to make some unpopular decisions.
[32:27.880 --> 32:32.360]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[32:32.360 --> 32:37.640]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation
[32:37.640 --> 32:40.520]  and availability of food distribution.
[32:40.520 --> 32:44.720]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow
[32:44.720 --> 32:46.120]  for shipping.
[32:46.120 --> 32:50.560]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[32:50.560 --> 32:57.560]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633.
[33:20.560 --> 33:36.560]  All right, Robert K. Wilcox, author of Target Pattons, our guest.
[33:36.560 --> 33:41.560]  Look, what we know is this.
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.760]  It's in mainline history, but there were at least 12,000, right at 12,000.
[33:46.760 --> 33:48.800]  Some estimates are above 22,000.
[33:48.800 --> 33:53.840]  Let's just say 12,000 U.S. troops captured in Poland, captured in Eastern Germany, and
[33:53.840 --> 34:00.560]  other areas captured out in the Caucasus, captured in Serbia, what's Serbia today.
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.720]  I mean, he's a lot of these highly decorated special forces and people.
[34:04.720 --> 34:06.720]  And what did they get for that?
[34:06.720 --> 34:08.840]  Ask Stalin, we love you.
[34:08.840 --> 34:09.840]  We love what you're doing.
[34:09.840 --> 34:10.920]  Our bankers love you.
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.240]  They love your new world order.
[34:13.240 --> 34:15.320]  We're going to just let you keep those guys.
[34:15.320 --> 34:16.480]  How's that sound a little present?
[34:16.480 --> 34:19.880]  We'll never see their families again, you'll work them to death, torture them to get all
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.280]  our secrets.
[34:21.280 --> 34:23.520]  That's okay, because we love you.
[34:23.520 --> 34:26.360]  And Patton was hopping mad about that, and he died.
[34:26.360 --> 34:33.360]  Now, so he's in the car, fender bender, but in that second of the jolt, that's a secret
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.720]  service favorite, they'll have their Patsy just shoot a.22 in the air, and then they
[34:37.720 --> 34:40.680]  grab the president and pump the round in them up against him.
[34:40.680 --> 34:44.800]  But side issue, they love distractions, they love sleight of hand, that's how they killed
[34:44.800 --> 34:48.680]  Yishak Rabin, they shot him in the car on the way to the hospital, and we've interviewed
[34:48.680 --> 34:52.520]  the folks from the hospital, the coroner, the doctors, everybody.
[34:52.520 --> 34:57.960]  But let's continue with, okay, so this truck pulls in front, and they have a small fender
[34:57.960 --> 35:00.960]  bender with his Cadillac.
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.560]  What happened next?
[35:02.560 --> 35:14.520]  Well everybody speculated when the crash ends, Patton is laying on the general next to him
[35:14.520 --> 35:19.440]  and he's got a bloody face, and he's got a broken neck.
[35:19.440 --> 35:22.520]  The other guys are not even fazed.
[35:22.520 --> 35:28.800]  And to jump ahead a little bit, Douglas Pizotta, the OSS assassin, said that he shot through
[35:28.800 --> 35:35.800]  the window a special air blown type gun that was specially made, and he's behind a bunch
[35:35.800 --> 35:44.360]  of old wrecks and so on, which, and they actually engineered a way, this truck that
[35:44.360 --> 35:52.000]  turned without signalling, set up a firing lane for Pizotta, and he shot what amounted
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.040]  to a bolt that would not enter the body but would break the neck.
[35:56.040 --> 36:02.000]  And that's what pushed Patton right across this guy, but nobody saw in the car what happened.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.800]  The general who was next to him was looking out the left hand window, Patton is looking
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.680]  out the right hand window, and the driver's forward, and the last thing Patton says, according
[36:12.680 --> 36:18.480]  to a memoir which I found, is that, look at that, which makes you wonder, what's he saying?
[36:18.480 --> 36:19.480]  Look at what?
[36:19.480 --> 36:20.480]  Look at what?
[36:20.480 --> 36:22.720]  At a gun pointed at him, at a guy shooting at him, or what?
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.400]  Then bam, the crash, as you said in that instant, boom, there's the crash, and then he's laying
[36:28.400 --> 36:29.720]  on top of the general.
[36:29.720 --> 36:38.160]  Well, the general and the driver all speculated without seeing that Patton had flown through
[36:38.160 --> 36:47.760]  the air in the car, and had hit his head on a post that's in between the driver.
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.400]  By the way, that's what they said Benazir Budo died from, and they released the video
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.960]  of her being a machine gun, and the bullets going, they said she hit her head.
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.920]  So that's it, I hope nobody shoots me, and I'm on TV being shot with bullets, like Scarface,
[37:00.920 --> 37:03.160]  and they go, oh look, he hit his head.
[37:03.160 --> 37:10.560]  Well, that's so true, and this, as you said, this is the major number one way to kill people,
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.560]  because an accident always looks like an accident, and even this bolt that he hit, that he says
[37:16.560 --> 37:22.400]  he hit Patton with in the face, it goes into the wreckage, and then you don't, nobody thinks
[37:22.400 --> 37:26.120]  anything of it, it's not a bullet, it didn't enter his body, and this kind of thing.
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.000]  So it's so heavy, a big bolt, it hits you, and then snaps the neck, a cushion weapon.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.400]  Well, that's what Bazzata said, you know, I've never done it, but that's it, and I have
[37:34.400 --> 37:39.320]  to take him at his word, you know, this is part of the mystery of all this.
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.280]  But anyway, so the speculation was that he had somehow hit something and broken his neck
[37:45.280 --> 37:46.280]  that way.
[37:46.280 --> 37:52.560]  Well, I can tell you, I had an accident investigator look at this scene, and because of the way
[37:52.560 --> 37:59.320]  that the car turned just before the hit, Patton would never have flown through the air the
[37:59.320 --> 38:08.360]  four feet in the back of the car strictly longitudinally, the direction of the car when it hit would
[38:08.360 --> 38:12.280]  have made him hit just the window that he was looking at.
[38:12.280 --> 38:19.880]  So that is false anyway, but this is the story that has always gone down, and all the historians
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.080]  just picked it up, you know, they write their great books about Patton's life, when it comes
[38:25.080 --> 38:29.680]  down to how he died, do they want to spend another two years to investigate it like I
[38:29.680 --> 38:30.680]  did?
[38:30.680 --> 38:31.680]  No, and they didn't.
[38:31.680 --> 38:32.680]  Well, what about the media, though?
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.680]  I mean, I haven't seen the film in decades, but don't they have a horse cart killing him?
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.560]  Well, now this is, I mentioned earlier, there were three or four instances, but I think
[38:41.560 --> 38:44.680]  were attempts to kill him earlier.
[38:44.680 --> 38:45.960]  And that is one of them.
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.280]  In that famous film, Patton at the end, there's a cart, and this did happen.
[38:51.280 --> 38:56.600]  He was in a jeep, and a cart comes out of an alley, and he's driving by, and it has
[38:56.600 --> 38:58.040]  a scythe on it.
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.480]  That's a long stick with a knife on it, and they use it to cut wheat with.
[39:02.480 --> 39:06.240]  And this scythe just about cuts his head off, but it misses him.
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.640]  That's one of three attempts before what I'm talking about.
[39:10.640 --> 39:13.440]  Let's go over the other, let's briefly go over the other attempts.
[39:13.440 --> 39:18.720]  Okay, the other, the earliest was another type jeep accident, where he has just hit
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.040]  in a car, and he's in a jeep, and he is injured a little bit, and this happened about three
[39:24.040 --> 39:26.040]  months before what I'm talking about.
[39:26.040 --> 39:31.040]  But the most sensational one, and the one which is really fishy, is that right at the
[39:31.040 --> 39:37.680]  end of the war, Patton is flying in his Piper Cub, and he's at a very low altitude, and
[39:37.680 --> 39:44.360]  all of a sudden, five Spitfires, which are supposedly Polish, and remember the Russians
[39:44.360 --> 39:52.400]  have taken over Poland at this time, five Polish Spitfires see him, and three or four
[39:52.400 --> 39:59.320]  of them circle, while one of them goes down and starts shooting at Patton's Piper Cub.
[39:59.320 --> 40:07.280]  Thank God the pilot of the Piper Cub is so good, he's able to get so low and into the
[40:07.280 --> 40:16.360]  hills that the Spitfire crashes, and this is all in Patton's Diaries, and they are livid.
[40:16.360 --> 40:17.360]  What's going on here?
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.800]  Well, that was, in my opinion, covered up by saying, oh, it was a mistake.
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.880]  We didn't, he was a young guy, and he didn't realize it wasn't a Nazi airplane.
[40:27.880 --> 40:33.440]  Well, this is a little Piper Cub, you're not going to think this is a Nazi airplane,
[40:33.440 --> 40:38.040]  and why are these four other guys circling up there, sort of like watching, you know,
[40:38.040 --> 40:39.760]  they're the signal guys.
[40:39.760 --> 40:46.560]  So anyway, this ends in the death of the Spitfire pilot, and they didn't shoot him down, and
[40:46.560 --> 40:49.800]  I think that those three incidents were moving up.
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.960]  And so was that Soviets in the captured Polish German Spitfires?
[40:54.960 --> 40:59.720]  You never know, there are no records, and this is a big part of the evidence here.
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.160]  You know that I've looked everywhere, and there are no records on the accident that
[41:04.160 --> 41:08.760]  I've described, on the Polish Spitfire, it's all gone.
[41:08.760 --> 41:14.720]  And I'm not talking about two or three reports on the accident, this mysterious accident
[41:14.720 --> 41:15.720]  that Patton had.
[41:15.720 --> 41:21.960]  I'm talking about at least five, including an investigation, and possibly eight, and
[41:21.960 --> 41:23.560]  they are all gone.
[41:23.560 --> 41:27.400]  Now we know that he's, and of course, cover up his evidence of the crime generally.
[41:27.400 --> 41:28.400]  It is a cover up.
[41:28.400 --> 41:29.400]  There's no question about that.
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.520]  So, so we have the motive, Patton's already saying he's going to go back and speak out
[41:33.520 --> 41:38.040]  against the Soviets, he's going to go back and tell Congress, kind of like we saw MacArthur
[41:38.040 --> 41:39.040]  do later.
[41:39.040 --> 41:40.040]  And tell secrets?
[41:40.040 --> 41:41.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's going to tell secrets.
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.560]  He knows they're helping the Soviets, he knows they took 12,000 US troops, you know, he's
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.640]  going to blow the whistle, he's going to destroy the future presidential chances of Dwight D.
[41:50.640 --> 41:51.640]  Eisenhower.
[41:51.640 --> 41:52.640]  Absolutely.
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.400]  That can't be allowed, and the Soviets don't like him, you know, they want America to go
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.960]  quietly into the night and go along with Uncle Joe, who already killed 40-something million
[42:00.960 --> 42:02.880]  people by that time.
[42:02.880 --> 42:06.200]  Let's go through what they cover in the London Telegraph and then, you know, what's in your
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.280]  book, Target Patton about, you know, the collusion, but it doesn't kill him.
[42:11.280 --> 42:12.880]  He's alive in the hospital.
[42:12.880 --> 42:15.760]  What comes next?
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.280]  He goes to the hospital and he's going to die.
[42:19.280 --> 42:20.280]  Everybody thinks he's going to die.
[42:20.280 --> 42:26.760]  I mean, this is a bad thing, he can't move from the neck down, but he's a tough guy and
[42:26.760 --> 42:28.240]  he rallies.
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.600]  And within a week and a half, he's doing so well, there are twitches in his fingers and
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.960]  his legs, and they're going to move him, they're going to fly him back to Boston, which is
[42:36.960 --> 42:41.440]  no easy trip at that time, which shows you how well he had become.
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.920]  And suddenly he has a downturn, and within 14 hours he's dead.
[42:46.920 --> 42:54.360]  And a basara says that it was the NKVD that went in there and used a poison on him.
[42:54.360 --> 43:00.680]  The cause of death was embolism, which is sort of a blood clot going through your brain,
[43:00.680 --> 43:01.680]  through your...
[43:01.680 --> 43:02.680]  Stroke him.
[43:02.680 --> 43:03.680]  Yeah.
[43:03.680 --> 43:09.840]  But there's no autopsy done on Patton, so we don't really know what happened to him.
[43:09.840 --> 43:15.360]  And recently one of the family members of the Pattons was actually approached by a Russian
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.400]  who said, I want to tell you some information.
[43:18.400 --> 43:22.520]  And putting it all together, and to be real succinct about it, I think that they used
[43:22.520 --> 43:25.640]  a poison that mimics this, that then they can do that.
[43:25.640 --> 43:33.840]  And they were doing both the OSS and the NKVD had labs where they made these kinds of poisons,
[43:33.840 --> 43:37.960]  which would mimic a natural cause of death.
[43:37.960 --> 43:44.240]  Now again, the NKVD was the internal apparatus for keeping control of the Soviet Union, and
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.520]  it was being brought into Western Europe at that time.
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.120]  And specifically, let's get into that, while Bill Donovan then made a deal, I mean, go
[43:53.120 --> 43:58.640]  specifically through what the assassin told you about this, and then continue.
[43:58.640 --> 44:05.520]  Well, even, you know, not many people know that the OSS and the NKVD were in collusion.
[44:05.520 --> 44:12.760]  They, early on in the war, Donovan flew to Russia and proposed that the two of them worked
[44:12.760 --> 44:15.560]  together, which was a good idea at that time.
[44:15.560 --> 44:21.960]  I mean, the Russians were fighting the Nazis, and you know, Donovan is a very enigmatic
[44:21.960 --> 44:26.520]  man, perhaps the most enigmatic of all in World War II.
[44:26.520 --> 44:28.480]  And he was a guy who would take a chance.
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.640]  He, you know, he'd make a deal with the devil.
[44:30.640 --> 44:33.960]  He's the guy that flew bombers off an aircraft carrier to bomb Tokyo.
[44:33.960 --> 44:35.920]  Yeah, I think he's probably his idea.
[44:35.920 --> 44:42.640]  I'm not certain about that, but anyway, he went there and he made a deal with the NKVD.
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.440]  Now, let me say that the NKVD just played him for a fool, because they already had so
[44:48.440 --> 44:53.120]  many spies in America, right up to the White House.
[44:53.120 --> 44:56.920]  We were inundated with in the State Department.
[44:56.920 --> 45:01.640]  And so, you know, McCarthy, whatever his methods were, he didn't know the half of it.
[45:01.640 --> 45:02.640]  And we know it.
[45:02.640 --> 45:06.320]  Well, when McCarthy was useful, the set of a police state, when he was just going after
[45:06.320 --> 45:10.800]  Little Pankos, when he found out that the army was basically running Russia, and if
[45:10.800 --> 45:14.760]  you really study this, sounds like you're pretty educated, that communism was only a
[45:14.760 --> 45:17.720]  fake system of the Anglo-American Empire.
[45:17.720 --> 45:21.400]  As the head of Georgetown political science, Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, said,
[45:21.400 --> 45:26.040]  they wanted to work with fascist and communist, as the Milner group in England said about
[45:26.040 --> 45:33.880]  a hundred years ago, what, 98 years ago, that they wanted to work with tyrannical regimes.
[45:33.880 --> 45:40.240]  And so, bottom line, that's why the U.S. in England put Mao in, put Lenin in, put all
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.640]  these people in, was, you know, kind of these fake counter-revolutions that look like they're
[45:44.640 --> 45:47.720]  for the people, but they really aren't.
[45:47.720 --> 45:52.680]  And so, you know, as long as he was saying it was a communist threat from Russia to take
[45:52.680 --> 45:57.200]  over America, that was fine, when really that's butt backwards.
[45:57.200 --> 46:03.240]  It was the globalist that we know of today, who were actually finger-puppeting the Soviets.
[46:03.240 --> 46:04.240]  Go ahead.
[46:04.240 --> 46:08.160]  Well, Alex, you're really ahead of me on that one, you know an awful lot about that.
[46:08.160 --> 46:14.520]  But what I do know is that Venona, which was our breaking of the Russian codes during World
[46:14.520 --> 46:21.200]  War II, and which has been kept secret until just recently, now shows us that there were
[46:21.200 --> 46:28.920]  many, many, many hundreds of spies in our government apparatus, Russian spies, who were
[46:28.920 --> 46:31.880]  telling Stalin daily what was going on.
[46:31.880 --> 46:38.000]  So, going back to the OSS collusion with the NKVD, they didn't really need it, but they
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.360]  went ahead with it because it served their purposes and they played Donovan like a marionette.
[46:44.360 --> 46:51.120]  But again, do you see how the western overarching Anglo-American Empire used its Soviet base
[46:51.120 --> 46:58.560]  as a system to send in spies that were untraceable with even the NKVD, KGB spies, in the case
[46:58.560 --> 47:03.280]  of the U.S., not even knowing they were under the control of the larger system?
[47:03.280 --> 47:05.200]  Well, that certainly could be true.
[47:05.200 --> 47:07.440]  I just don't know any more than what I've done here.
[47:07.440 --> 47:10.120]  Well, when McCarthy found out about it, that's when they blew him away.
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.480]  Well, that's when they politically shut him down.
[47:12.480 --> 47:18.160]  There are probably 20 books here to detail all this, but all I could really talk about
[47:18.160 --> 47:20.440]  is Patton and what happened to him.
[47:20.440 --> 47:30.680]  We haven't spoken about one thing, and that is that on the NKVD side, I tracked down an
[47:30.680 --> 47:33.360]  American agent who was with Patton's armies.
[47:33.360 --> 47:40.240]  He was a CIC agent, a counterintelligence agency, and his job was to find these kinds
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.200]  of plots, and he was dealing with the Russians.
[47:44.200 --> 47:52.560]  He found out that Stalin had put Patton on a death list, a hit list, and so he went back
[47:52.560 --> 47:58.280]  and he tried to stop this, and he had to deal with Wild Bill Donovan.
[47:58.280 --> 48:00.240]  This is all written in this man's book.
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.320]  I did not speak to him, he died, but I found his book, which was really written for his
[48:05.320 --> 48:06.320]  children.
[48:06.320 --> 48:12.880]  They gave it to me, and it is an amazing, amazing document, and it talks all about this.
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.640]  Through three different sources at three different times, this agent, who had been with Patton
[48:18.640 --> 48:25.640]  and was in Germany at that time, as was Bazzata at the time of Patton's death, he was run
[48:25.640 --> 48:33.480]  out by Donovan under threat of his life, and he had to live here that way for many years.
[48:33.480 --> 48:42.600]  He eventually came out of that and became a Republican staffer type, and he worked for
[48:42.600 --> 48:44.440]  Reagan and some others.
[48:44.440 --> 48:51.000]  Both Bazzata and this other agent, Steven Skubick, are two great, great witnesses in
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  this.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  They really have a lot of credibility.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.880]  On that side, on the Russian side, Skubick found out that they had this plan, that they
[49:00.880 --> 49:07.000]  were working with the OSS to kill Patton, tried to stop it, and was run out of Germany
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.400]  under threat of his life.
[49:09.400 --> 49:12.920]  Just unbelievably amazing.
[49:12.920 --> 49:18.400]  When you were talking to the assassin, why was he telling you he was going public about
[49:18.400 --> 49:19.400]  this?
[49:19.400 --> 49:21.200]  Well, that's a great question.
[49:21.200 --> 49:27.000]  He never would have gotten gone public, but as he came back, as I mentioned earlier, he'd
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.520]  been promised a great job with the CIA.
[49:30.520 --> 49:31.520]  Nobody knew him.
[49:31.520 --> 49:33.800]  He had to fight for his benefits.
[49:33.800 --> 49:35.960]  So they screwed him?
[49:35.960 --> 49:38.520]  They screwed him royally.
[49:38.520 --> 49:43.720]  He began to see things that he had always kept quiet, be put out in books.
[49:43.720 --> 49:49.560]  He became really disenchanted with the whole situation.
[49:49.560 --> 50:00.880]  He actually did, in 1979, make a statement to the spotlight, which was a newspaper which
[50:00.880 --> 50:02.800]  is no longer around.
[50:02.800 --> 50:03.800]  It was in...
[50:03.800 --> 50:05.440]  It's now American Free Press.
[50:05.440 --> 50:06.440]  Yes.
[50:06.440 --> 50:13.080]  In that statement, he said, I know who killed Patton because I was given money to do so.
[50:13.080 --> 50:15.640]  It wasn't me, but I know who did it.
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.400]  This was his first act of kind of, I'm tired of this.
[50:19.400 --> 50:24.960]  No, I'm not going to sit on this any longer, because his father, by the way, was a Presbyterian
[50:24.960 --> 50:31.720]  minister of great reputation in New Jersey, and he had a lot of pangs about that, living
[50:31.720 --> 50:38.360]  the life that he had as an assassin for many, many years for his government.
[50:38.360 --> 50:43.200]  He just had to get this out of him, and when he had the stroke, that finally broke down
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.680]  his barriers, and I came along, and he began to tell me this whole thing.
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.840]  That's right, I'm prepared to go across the river Styx.
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.840]  A lot of people finally have the courage to tell the truth and get the wickedness off
[50:57.840 --> 50:58.840]  their chest.
[50:58.840 --> 51:01.320]  Will you do it before you die?
[51:01.320 --> 51:04.760]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[51:04.760 --> 51:06.680]  Only to find the one that you have is broken.
[51:06.680 --> 51:09.400]  The batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough.
[51:09.400 --> 51:10.960]  You need the pack light.
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.000]  The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.240]  battery and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[51:19.240 --> 51:22.720]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.560]  The pack light can survive severe impact, be frozen solid and still work flawlessly.
[51:27.560 --> 51:31.520]  The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the
[51:31.520 --> 51:33.920]  New York Times and Backpacker magazine.
[51:33.920 --> 51:38.600]  The pack light comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices startages $12.99.

[52:00.800 --> 52:06.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.520]  against this country.
[52:07.520 --> 52:11.720]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[52:11.720 --> 52:12.720]  Bin Laden.
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.840]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:16.840 --> 52:21.520]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[52:21.520 --> 52:24.120]  networks inside the United States.
[52:24.120 --> 52:28.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[52:28.600 --> 52:30.760]  in and on the U.S.
[52:30.760 --> 52:34.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.440 --> 52:39.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:39.880 --> 52:43.920]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[52:43.920 --> 52:44.920]  much more.

[53:58.600 --> 54:23.160]  This is not America, Patton refused to be quiet, about 12,000 US troops captured by Soviets
[54:23.160 --> 54:29.960]  out of German prisoner of war camps, knowing the slave gulags, few of the men escaped and
[54:29.960 --> 54:33.680]  books are written about the subject, there's been mainstream news shows about it, but they
[54:33.680 --> 54:39.240]  claimed the US didn't know, no the US knew they could care less about those troops, that's
[54:39.240 --> 54:45.720]  how evil the government was then, and you imagine how bad they are now, sir I want to
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.200]  have you back up for a full hour in the next few weeks after the new year, just to take
[54:49.200 --> 54:52.360]  calls from listeners and all the angles they're going to cover, I'm going to get your book
[54:52.360 --> 54:57.200]  target Patton, I know it's available at amazon.com and bookstores everywhere and I hope people
[54:57.200 --> 54:58.960]  will get it.
[54:58.960 --> 55:06.080]  In closing we've got about two minutes left, other key points you haven't gotten to.
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.680]  Not really, I think we've covered, well yes there is one great one, the fake car, I thought
[55:11.680 --> 55:18.640]  that I would go to the Patton Museum where they have the car they say that Patton was
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.560]  injured in and I would be able to at last sort of see the crime scene and see what happened
[55:24.560 --> 55:32.800]  there, well I took an expert from Detroit on Cadillacs, specifically that Cadillac,
[55:32.800 --> 55:41.720]  the 1938 Cadillac limousine 7533 is what it's technically called and we found out that that
[55:41.720 --> 55:52.000]  is not the car, it's a 1939 car that has been rebuilt and the major discovery was that you
[55:52.000 --> 55:58.680]  know a VIN number, you can take a VIN even today, it's a vehicle identification number,
[55:58.680 --> 56:07.920]  it's soldered into the chassis and every car has it and this VIN number was scraped out
[56:07.920 --> 56:15.040]  so there's no question that somebody wanted the museum to think that it was the real car
[56:15.040 --> 56:19.840]  which they did but it is not the real car, it's a 1939.
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.160]  So more evidence of cover up, we're going to have to have you back, do you want to fire
[56:23.160 --> 56:25.080]  out your specific website Mr. Wilcox?
[56:25.080 --> 56:33.640]  Sure, I'm at www.RobertKWilcox.com, that's my name, Robert K. Wilcox but as you said
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.520]  Amazon has the book and it's something that everyone needs to read.
[56:38.520 --> 56:42.360]  All right, I want you to have a great Christmas, great holiday and again I want to have you
[56:42.360 --> 56:44.760]  back up for an hour sometime in January.
[56:44.760 --> 56:47.000]  I'll be glad Alex, thank you very much.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.320]  Thank you for coming on, great knowledge, everything that guy say checks out with my
[56:50.320 --> 56:53.560]  own research and then he expands on it for us.
[56:53.560 --> 56:58.040]  Speaking of Christmas, I'm not going to be live tomorrow, I may be live Friday, tomorrow
[56:58.040 --> 57:02.280]  I'm going to be downtown serving homeless, there's a lot of groups doing that but I'm
[57:02.280 --> 57:06.840]  going to be with my children and my wife downtown, I'm not saying I'm going to eat two shoes
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.200]  but that's how I help the community, also give money to groups feeding the homeless
[57:11.200 --> 57:19.240]  and helping old people because we have to teach our children not to be decadent, we
[57:19.240 --> 57:23.240]  have to show people how poor folks are living so it's also an education, that's how I'm
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.960]  enriched by helping them and it's our job to do that so I know it's fun to sit around
[57:27.960 --> 57:31.720]  sucking your thumb watching football or baseball and thinking about yourself all day but if
[57:31.720 --> 57:36.640]  we don't think about each other, we have no future at all.
[57:36.640 --> 57:40.800]  You should also think about yourself and get financially viable and with all these made
[57:40.800 --> 57:45.760]  off scammers running Wall Street, the dollar and the currency's dead, meat.
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.520]  And Ted Anderson had a pitch for you today, a gold he bought at 770, they happened to
[57:49.520 --> 57:54.200]  get 50 buffalo coins in that nobody can get and there isn't even a premium on these, these
[57:54.200 --> 58:02.920]  are factored in at the 770 level, 800-686-2237, British sovereigns at 252, Franks at 203,
[58:02.920 --> 58:07.400]  you can't meet that deal on Franks and walking Liberty half dollar, silver dollars, 840 a
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.640]  piece, you can't find a deal like that anywhere folks, this is a great deal, check it out,
[58:11.640 --> 58:17.240]  the brokers will be there through midnight tonight, 800-686-237 and it's still not too

[59:10.280 --> 59:15.040]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just
[59:15.040 --> 59:17.360]  criticism to grow at our own door.
[59:17.360 --> 59:22.560]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:22.560 --> 59:27.160]  An inside job, how dare you?
[59:27.160 --> 59:33.520]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:33.520 --> 59:44.960]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue, truth rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv

[59:49.760 --> 59:53.640]  next level.
[59:53.640 --> 1:00:05.400]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:11.240]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:19.520]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin,
[1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:24.520]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:31.880]  I was going to go back to Ben in Canada talking about Ben unemployed for months and how much
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:32.880]  trouble he's in.
[1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:34.880]  No, I hear you and it's horrible.
[1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:36.880]  But Ben hung up.
[1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:39.760]  It's very, very serious.
[1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:43.880]  But it's designed that way to domesticate us to get us under their control.
[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:46.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Colorado.
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:47.160]  Robert, you're on the air.
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:48.160]  Welcome.
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:50.040]  Good morning, thanks for making my call, Alex.
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:51.560]  A couple of things.
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:58.000]  Number one, you were asking the question earlier about who was the guy that found out about
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.440]  the US giving secrets of Russians during World War II.
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:03.480]  Were you alluding to Major Jordan's Diaries?
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:11.280]  No, I was mentioning, I was talking about Patton.
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:12.280]  Oh, okay.
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:13.280]  Okay.
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:17.040]  You mean I did that whole 10-minute spiel and I'm not a good communicator, I guess.
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:19.280]  You didn't know I was talking about a murdering Patton?
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:23.600]  Well, yeah, you did say that, but it just, what clicked into my brain was Major Jordan's
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:25.480]  Diaries, which was along those same lines.
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:28.400]  He was the guy who found out basically the same thing that we were giving the secrets
[1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:30.360]  to the Russians and so on and so forth.
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:31.560]  That's what made me think of that.
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.000]  No, you said Patton, so I guess that's my mistake.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:44.440]  The other thing is that, Alex, back during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans,
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:48.640]  you were on the police pretty hard about, they should be fired for relieving their posts
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:49.640]  and so forth.
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:52.280]  Since then, when I hear you mentioned it, you've kind of softened your stance.
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:55.880]  Have you found out something different about what happened there or what are your feelings
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:56.880]  about it?
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:00.120]  Well, yeah, I mean, we didn't know for three days that FEMA jammed all the cell phones
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:04.920]  and went in and physically cut all the police radio towers physically with fire axes.
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:08.760]  And so within three or four days after, I mean, at first when it said that they walked
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:12.920]  off their post, I said, how dare them, we didn't know that the feds had come in and
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:15.360]  cut their communications.
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.200]  So I reversed myself immediately at that point.
[1:02:18.200 --> 1:02:19.600]  That makes sense.
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:21.320]  Okay, keep up the good work.
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:22.320]  Thank you.
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:23.320]  I appreciate your call.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:28.240]  It's kind of like the first two hours of the NATO sneak attack on South Ossetia against
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:29.240]  the Russians.
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:34.320]  CNN was announcing the Russians at Snuck Attack and I'm not even prepared to deal with
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:35.520]  lies of that level.
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:37.600]  So I thought, my God, this is incredible.
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:40.880]  CNN's reporting the Russians at Snuck Attack.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:45.240]  And then a couple hours later, I went and read the foreign news and then even read addendums
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:46.240]  on CNN.
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:51.400]  They're like, well, actually after Georgia attacks South Ossetia, so I had to reverse
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:52.400]  myself.
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:59.840]  I mean, much can be made of these things, but I routinely get things wrong.
[1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:03.920]  And then we go back and correct that.
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:06.160]  A lot is taken out of context as well.
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:15.880]  Just like on Y2K, ABC News announces, a missile has been fired from Russia at the United States.
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:18.840]  And all the phones start ringing, everybody's calling the show about it and I say, that's
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:20.240]  not true.
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:25.240]  So I run out during the break, turn on ABC News and they're announcing it.
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:29.200]  I go back on air and I say, yeah, it's happening.
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.800]  And then about 10 minutes later, we said, no, from NORAD, it was just a scud missile.
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:38.960]  And I said, that was weird because they had the Russians with them at NORAD and the Russians
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:43.440]  in the U.S. had a weird press conference after, so that was some Psyop.
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:45.640]  Well, what did Co and Telpro do?
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:50.040]  They claimed I put out the story about the missile when it had been on ABC News and call
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:51.040]  her to the show.
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:54.480]  It'd be like a caller called in and said, I just heard a missile was fired from Russia
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:55.680]  and I go, okay, let me check.
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:57.040]  Yeah, they say that's true.
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:59.440]  We don't know if this is true.
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:04.600]  And then the government takes that, edits it and says that I said, Russia, just out
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:08.960]  of nowhere, I just came on air and announced that a missile had been fired from Russia.
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:13.080]  So that's the kind of deception that we deal with.
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:19.560]  Jim, Troy, Maggie, Eric, we're going to get to all of you with our guest, F. William Engdahl,
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:24.840]  that's coming up after the break.
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:27.560]  Some of the other news I have later in the show, I have time, I'm going to read this
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:32.000]  in its entirety, General George S. Patton was assassinated to silence his criticism
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.920]  of Allied war leaders on a telegraph.
[1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:37.920]  Another one here.
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:38.920]  Robots ready to run the world.
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:44.680]  I want to get to that out of Russia today.
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:45.680]  More on the bill.
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:46.680]  Nobody noticed.
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:53.280]  National DNA data bank, now law and a lot more coming up today.
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:05:00.000]  We'll also get more into Bernard Madoff, the front man for a larger Ponzi swindles.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.360]  Stay well.
[1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:06.000]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:10.800]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:11.800]  Hi, folks.
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:12.800]  Alex Jones here.

[1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:06.320]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:07.320]  against this country.
[1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:11.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:12.560]  bin Laden.
[1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:13.560]  This is his M.O.
[1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:17.120]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:21.800]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.400]  networks inside the United States.
[1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:28.880]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:31.040]  in and on the U.S.
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:34.680]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:40.200]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:44.200]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:45.200]  much more.
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:46.200]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:24.520]  here in the U.S.
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:27.160]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.

[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:18.800]  She survived the Pentagon strike.
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:23.080]  She's now found suiting against Bush and Cheney for carrying out the 9-11 attacks and endangering
[1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:24.080]  her life.
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:32.440]  Not every child, her lawyer joins us coming up in about two hours from now.

[1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:45.400]  We'll get his take on where things are going.
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:49.240]  Before we go to our first guest of the day, and yes, your phone call is in this hour,
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:59.360]  we're going to be talking about full spectrum dominance with our guest, F. William Engdahl.
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:08.600]  Before we do that, I do want to encourage all of our listeners out there to remember
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:13.160]  that just because those of us that listen to this show or that are informed about the
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:17.520]  New World Order and how the world really operates, just because we know what's going on doesn't
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:20.840]  mean our neighbors, our friends, our family do, and you may have tried to wake them up
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:23.920]  a year ago, two years ago, whatever, and they weren't listening.
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:27.360]  Now people are more apt to listen.
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:34.480]  And even if they don't listen now, they will remember what you said today a year from now,
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:36.760]  two years from now, three years from now.
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:40.240]  And that's the reason this radio show is just exploding exponentially.
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:45.560]  My books, the films, the materials is because everything we talked about has come true.
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:48.560]  Everything we've discussed has unfolded.
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:51.240]  Unfortunately, I wish we were wrong.
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:57.640]  So I do want to encourage everybody to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today.
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:00.040]  PrisonPlanet.tv is $5.95 a month.
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:04.640]  You can sign up for a monthly trial membership or get a year until Christmas, just a few
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:12.880]  days left, and you can get five plus months free.
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:17.480]  So you pay for 6.7 months of your membership, you get 5.3 months if you want to get technical.
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:22.040]  So five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:25.380]  And up to six people can use the same passcode.
[1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:29.240]  So buy yourself a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and then give it to a few of your friends
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  and family.
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:35.400]  Just explain to them that they can't share their passcode with anybody else or it will
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.360]  cease to work.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:39.240]  Now that doesn't mean it will cease to work forever.
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:43.000]  It will just time out and then all six of you are trying to log on at the same time
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.200]  it won't work.
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:48.720]  So again, our goal here is to get the word out to people on the subject of GMOs, deadly
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:54.120]  vaccines, militarization of the police, the banker takeover.
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:11:00.720]  I mean, there are thousands of audio interviews, got to be close to a thousand video interviews.
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:06.160]  When I make films, I'll take everything that's on the cutting room floor, like Endgame 1.5,
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:10.280]  all the really good stuff that we couldn't put in, an hour and 45 minutes extra, put
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:16.000]  it up at PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, an e-book format,
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.680]  his book's out of print, mine's about to be, so you can get it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:25.000]  Put the videos, put the books on disk, burn them to disk, give them to friends, family,
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  neighbors.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.520]  Use it as a library in the fight against the new world order.
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:34.920]  Believe me folks, the reason tyranny always tries to crack down on free speech is that
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:39.200]  free speech hurts tyranny, and that's why they're moving against the web and going
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:42.760]  with their full spectrum dominance right now, because they know the things they're doing
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:46.240]  are so unpopular, they're not going to be able to get away with it.
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:50.360]  That's why Cheney's trying to say, hey, we've got the nukes, we can nuke all of you, we're
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:55.040]  above the law, we can torture children, they're trying to just set a precedent that the sky's
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:01.480]  the limit, 8.5 trillion stolen in eight weeks, and that's two week old numbers, it just keeps
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:02.480]  growing.
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:10.000]  I mean, the level of wanton abandon and lawlessness we're seeing, it must be met with resistance,
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.680]  we must speak out against it.
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:16.260]  So again, PrisonPlanet.tv, if you're not online, you want them in super high quality
[1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:22.400]  on DVD, TerrorStorm, in-game, truth rising, fabled enemies, the Money Masters, they're
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:27.480]  all available at huge discounts at infowars.com on DVD, and a bunch of other great books and
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:39.480]  videos at infowars.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:49.920]  We are now joined by F. William Engdahl, and if I try to describe everything he does, it
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:55.640]  would take too long, but his research bridges economics, politics, and the less known field
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:13:00.040]  of geopolitics, his work is influenced by numerous economists, but most especially by
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:05.140]  the German historian, economist, Frederick List, he has authored the book, A Century
[1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:10.320]  of War, Anglo-American Oil, Politics, and the New World Order, and he's done a lot of
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:16.240]  other work written for major publications around the world, and he joins us for five
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:18.680]  minutes to the next hour, then Mr. Schiff joins us.
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:21.000]  I appreciate you coming on.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.600]  Your new book doesn't come out until January, but we're going to talk about it.
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:28.120]  Full Spectrum Dominance, give us the full title, Mr. Engdahl, and then break down what
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:33.600]  full spectrum dominance or complete technological enslavement system is.
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  Okay, Alex, enjoying being with you again.
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:45.280]  The book Full Spectrum Dominance, the subtitle I think tells it all, it's Totalitarian Democracy
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:54.360]  in the New World Order, and basically, as I see it, the post-war U.S. informal empire,
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:14:00.040]  if you want to call it that, the post-war U.S. projection of power post-1945 was really
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:02.600]  based on two fundamental pillars.
[1:14:02.600 --> 1:14:09.960]  One was the power of Wall Street and the dollar-based system of, then the gold standard and later
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:14.440]  simply the dollar-based fiat money system after 1971.
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:18.440]  The role of New York as the financial capital of the world, as it had been with the British
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:25.960]  Empire a century earlier, was the key element to controlling the world or controlling the
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:29.520]  dominant trends of world politics in the post-war period.
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:35.400]  That is now going up in flames with the crisis that we're living through right now.
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:38.520]  It's going to get horrendously worse.
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:43.000]  The American economy is going to go through pure hell worse than anything in the 1930s,
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.760]  and that means the second pillar is the only thing that the U.S. elites have left, and
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:50.680]  that is the military.
[1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.760]  Military power projection, the Pentagon calls it full spectrum dominance.
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.280]  Now, what do I imply by that?
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:03.480]  Well, number one, they have to permanently try to take off of the table the potential
[1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:10.160]  of the nations of Western Europe, Germany, France, Italy, and so forth, and Russia and
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:16.560]  China coming together, perhaps with India at some point joining them, and creating an
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:23.040]  economic trade zone or zone of cooperation, whatever you want to call it, but somewhere
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:30.360]  where they begin being less dependent on the dollar system and more dependent on the protective
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.000]  kind of currency and trade zones that will keep the real economies going in those places.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:39.680]  They have all the natural resources they require for that among them.
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:45.600]  Russia has the mineral resources, Russia has the world's largest reserves of natural gas,
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:51.280]  it has pipeline building capacities to China and so forth, and Western Europe has the machine
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:57.600]  tools, the advanced industry, and that not, but they lack the labor base.
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:00.800]  They lack the demographic crisis in Germany and so forth.
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:06.080]  It's beginning to kick in, so if you combine that into a common economic space, that is
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:12.720]  the one threat that the United States elites, the American century, if you want to call,
[1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:14.600]  it simply can't cope with that.
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:19.440]  Brzezinski has said it repeatedly in his writings, this is the number one threat.
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:28.320]  The whole Cheney Pentagon agenda since he was Defense Secretary in 1992 has been about preempting,
[1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:33.840]  preemptive wars are nothing more or less than preempting this kind of cooperation in Eurasia.
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:40.480]  So the book really is about that agenda and how unbeknownst to most people, certainly in
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:46.160]  Europe and in the United States, because our media simply doesn't tell us in detail and
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:51.960]  certainly not our politicians, the Pentagon has never stopped the Cold War.
[1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:59.280]  It never for one second paused in its move to have total military dominance, cyberspace,
[1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:04.240]  outer space, inner space, the oceans, the land and so forth.
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:09.400]  And that is the Bush presidency and now it's being continued into Bush Mach 2, which is
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:11.440]  called Obama for some reason.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:17.400]  The Bush presidency is really about this, gearing up this full spectrum dominance because
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:24.200]  they realized, I think back in the 99, 2000 period when the dot-com bubble was pumped
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:29.520]  up and inevitably crashed, that they didn't have many more cards to play on the financial
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:35.760]  field and therefore they're going to have to turn to very hard military means.
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:44.720]  Well, doesn't this take us back to what we saw in the late 40s with the British commission
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.600]  on population?
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:51.840]  They say the Western world, the US and England predominantly, the Anglo-American elite are
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:58.240]  threatened by other populations developing their own industrial basis, so we have to
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:04.080]  go around the world destabilizing nations, getting them to have local theater wars, basically
[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:08.960]  more great game geopolitical type stuff.
[1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:14.640]  And then they expanded, they said, carrying out eugenics, but then domestically they say
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:16.880]  we've also got to dumb our own people down.
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:22.520]  This is in the documents that dumbing us down so we're more easily managed, that attacking
[1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:26.960]  and starving other nations, playing them off against each other.
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:31.720]  This is really the policy, and if you look at it from a cold-blooded military policy
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:35.680]  of you're the elites, how do you dominate the world?
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:36.680]  Divide and conquer.
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:42.000]  They might as well have us born without brains, and I hate to give them ideas, but that's
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.680]  what they're cold-bloodedly doing.
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:51.280]  So this really is the full spectrum dominance, is control freaks on steroids, micromanaging
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:52.480]  every facet of our lives.
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:57.160]  I mean, we can act like the Pentagon is separately over here by itself doing all of this.
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:02.240]  They work for the big Anglo-American banks, and they're given their marching orders,
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:05.960]  and that is dominate the American people, dominate the British people, dominate the
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:08.600]  people of Europe who don't want to do this.
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:13.720]  That's basically enslave everybody and then start wars all over the planet to wreck everything,
[1:19:13.720 --> 1:19:17.280]  so there's nothing viable but your one unipolar system.
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:18.280]  Yeah.
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:24.880]  In a nutshell, that's what the full spectrum book is documenting, and putting it in a context
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:28.080]  where people can really understand a lot of these things.
[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:34.680]  For example, the Darfur campaign is to take one small example.
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:40.000]  Suddenly Hollywood actors start lining up to be the great champions against Sudanese
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:43.040]  genocide in Darfur, southern Sudan.
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.280]  Nobody tells them that the reason that the Bush administration or Washington is talking
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:52.920]  about genocide in southern Sudan is because China has built oil pipelines to one of the
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:57.760]  richest oil potentials in all of Africa in the Darfur region.
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.160]  All right, stay there.
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:00.720]  We'll be right back with our gift.
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:06.440]  Did you know that it's a documented fact, 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:10.000]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.360]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:18.080]  diseases from these parasites, and your doctor would never know it.
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:22.600]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:25.440]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:30.160]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally
[1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:35.600]  and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:36.960]  beverage once a day.
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:42.520]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:43.520]  Organics.

[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:05.240]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:10.240]  May the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:17.840]  a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:22.400]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:24.280]  called the Federal Reserve System.
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:27.120]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:32.680]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce, however
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:37.080]  shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.040]  in a stock portfolio.
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:42.360]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[1:21:48.280 --> 1:21:49.280]  debt.

[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:56.360]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:22:00.560]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:02.560]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:06.240]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:08.600]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:11.640]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:15.880]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:17.400]  World Order master plan.
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:21.640]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:27.000]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.880]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:48.200]  more.

[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:02.120]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:04.360]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:06.640]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:07.640]  Sound familiar?
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:10.760]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:34.920]  F. William Engdahl is our guest.
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:41.920]  Got a link to his website up on infowars.com right now.
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:46.440]  William, you know, Dick Cheney comes out of the weekend and says, look, of course the
[1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:48.800]  president's above Congress and above the law.
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:53.920]  He can nuke the entire earth if he wants to, so they keep going back to this military power.
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:25:00.040]  Vice-chair of the British Ministry of Defense said, you know what, the military really does
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:08.000]  work for financial interest and we may have to use neutron bombs on the general public
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.080]  if they try to get out of line or overthrow our government.
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:16.920]  So within the officer corps, it's even taught now that they work for financial interest
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:22.920]  and our countries are basically gone and that it is tyranny and that torture is good and
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:27.920]  that secret arrest is good and that we're moving into a very dark phase of life.
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:30.920]  And I guess these guys just enjoy the power.
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:33.920]  Where do you see all this going?
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:41.920]  Well, certainly in terms of the US, the military, the Nordcom redeployments in the last months
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:48.920]  toward domestic deployments and the building that up with thousands of troops inside the
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:54.920]  states is something that we haven't seen since the bonus army march where the great hero,
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:59.920]  General Douglas MacArthur, started shooting on innocent women and children and veterans
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:05.920]  who were demanding payment during the depression of their World War I bonuses on an early basis
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:11.920]  so they could feed their families and MacArthur comes in and starts wildly shooting.
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:16.920]  They did that one on a technicality to get around Posse Comitatus, but what's happening now,
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:19.920]  they're just not even thinking about...
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:22.920]  Wasn't Patton involved in that too?
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:23.920]  Patton was involved.
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:30.920]  He was not yet a general, but I think he was a captain or a major.
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:32.920]  He was involved in the blasting.
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:38.920]  I'll only say that because look how they paid him back when the Russians grabbed a bunch of US troops
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:42.920]  out of a German camp and he wanted them back and the Russians said no.
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:43.920]  He threw a fit.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:47.920]  Did you know the one in Telegraph is now reporting?
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:49.920]  Yes, I saw that.
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:51.920]  That's quite interesting.
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:53.920]  Well, my point is that's how he gets repaid.
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:54.920]  Yeah.
[1:26:54.920 --> 1:26:59.920]  I mean, for all these guys that think it's cute and funny to kill US citizens and fun to ride down
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:03.920]  women and children, look how it ends up.
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:05.920]  There is no honor among thieves.
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:07.920]  That's certainly true.
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:09.920]  Nothing personal, just business.
[1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:10.920]  Absolutely.
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  So their master plan, bottom line, what are they shooting for?
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:16.920]  What are they going to try to do?
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:22.920]  Well, I think the old, as I said at the beginning of the show, Alex, the only option that they have
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:30.920]  at this point is to use the mailed fist to take off the velvet glove and just try to project
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:33.920]  in an economy that's going down the tubes.
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:37.920]  They're in a very, very shaky basis to do this, but they...
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:43.920]  You know, these are people on the Titanic who simply fold down the torpedo's full speed ahead
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:45.920]  kind of mentality.
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:51.920]  And I don't think they're psychologically capable of recalibrating that the entire model
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:56.920]  that they built the American Century on from 1939 is fundamentally flawed and they have
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:01.920]  to redesign the thing and project a more modest profile in the world.
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:02.920]  Well, what was the shift?
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:07.920]  I mean, we know that Biden and Obama are going to continue the same policies.
[1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:10.920]  They're just puppets of the system.
[1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:18.920]  But when Dick Cheney starts coming out and talking about basically being God, or when
[1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:24.920]  Hayden comes out and says, the Fourth Amendment does not say we need any due process or any
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:25.920]  probable cause.
[1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:27.920]  Entire war, yeah.
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:32.920]  But he says it doesn't even say that in the Fourth Amendment.
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:34.920]  I mean, so we're seeing...
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:37.920]  I mean, we know they're not delusional, but they believe...
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:38.920]  Well, I don't know.
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:42.920]  I'm not going to swear at that, Alex.
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:46.920]  Who knows what kind of a heart medication that Cheney is on and how it affects his mind?
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:54.920]  Well, I mean, we do remember Roe telling the Washington Post that we are history's actors,
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:29:02.920]  that we control history, and so that what everybody else says or thinks doesn't matter,
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:03.920]  only we matter.
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:06.920]  So there's definitely megalomania going on.
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:11.920]  The point I'm making is that when Hayden tells people the Fourth Amendment does not
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:19.920]  say probable cause, when it does say probable cause, that is a contempt.
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:20.920]  Yes.
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:26.920]  Well, they have nothing but contempt for any kind of constitutional procedure.
[1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:33.920]  They're in a domain where the world is moved beyond that for them, and they're just...
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:38.920]  Power is the only language that counts in Washington.
[1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:43.920]  And the final equation of that is, forget your home, forget your family, forget your
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:45.920]  free market, forget your future.
[1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:46.920]  We have nukes.
[1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:50.920]  We have militarized police, shut up, we're taking over.
[1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:51.920]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:54.920]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.920 --> 1:30:00.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:01.920]  Hello.
[1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.920]  This is Tom with hempusa.org.
[1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:08.920]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that
[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:11.920]  the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:16.920]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for
[1:30:16.920 --> 1:30:19.920]  yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:25.920]  At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying
[1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:26.920]  times ahead.

[1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:48.920]  shelf life.
[1:30:48.920 --> 1:30:52.920]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:59.920]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:06.920]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:07.920]  this country.
[1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:09.920]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:11.920]  But who is the enemy?
[1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:12.920]  Bin Laden.
[1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:13.920]  This is his MO.
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:14.920]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:16.920]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:21.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:23.920]  networks inside the United States.
[1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:27.920]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:29.920]  spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:33.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:38.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:42.920]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow
[1:31:42.920 --> 1:31:44.920]  government, and much, much more.
[1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:45.920]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:47.920]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:52.920]  Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:59.920]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:25.920]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:28.920]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:32.920]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:36.920]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't
[1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:37.920]  neutralize it.
[1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:38.920]  Do your part.
[1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:41.920]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[1:32:41.920 --> 1:32:46.920]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:50.920]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:56.920]  Drink your bottle of Alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[1:32:56.920 --> 1:33:03.920]  Again, that's alcovision.com.
[1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:10.920]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:16.920]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:33:16.920 --> 1:33:22.920]  Author, researcher, historian, William Engdahl is our guest.
[1:33:22.920 --> 1:33:29.920]  We're going to open the phones up here in about 10 minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:32.920]  It is the 22nd day of December 2008.
[1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:38.920]  Just a program note, I am getting over a stomach virus of some hard type.
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:41.920]  So I sound a little bit out of it today or different.
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:45.920]  That is the reason.
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:47.920]  Engdahl continuing.
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:49.920]  Look, I mean, you're an expert on this.
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:51.920]  You study this all the time.
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:52.920]  I study it continually.
[1:33:52.920 --> 1:33:54.920]  My audience does.
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:34:00.920]  And I guess more and more of the solution to this whole problem is just historically looking
[1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:06.920]  at what happens when you get power tripping elites into control.
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:12.920]  But nowhere in history did they have nuclear weapons or biological weapons to this extent.
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:19.920]  And it's just every parallel, every scenario I look at, it goes from bad to worse.
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:26.920]  First specifically, I mean, I know you understand this is a controlled economic consolidation.
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:31.920]  This is a military financial attack, a strike on the middle class of the world,
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:38.920]  but also on Russia and China and the Middle East to destroy their fledgling economies.
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:44.920]  And again, even the so-called elites of this country are tied in financially with these other nations.
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:54.920]  Isn't this a super class or super elite at the top of the elite who are really bringing us towards the precipice?
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:59.920]  And if you really analyze it, it's not even for their interest long term,
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:03.920]  but they just are hyper aggressive and so they can't help it.
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:05.920]  I would answer that yes and no.
[1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:10.920]  There is a super elite, the so-called Davos consensus, I hate that term,
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:16.920]  but I've been to Davos nine times and I know what the consensus is or isn't around this.
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.920]  But the idea of this globalization, well, that was the project.
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:23.920]  And it tied in the top elites of Europe, the top elites of Japan,
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:28.920]  the top elites of many nations of the world, Brazil, Mexico and so forth.
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:32.920]  But there was a center of gravity to the project.
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:39.920]  And now the thing has come to a point where that whole process is breaking down and it's not under control.
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:48.920]  You know, the best laid plans, you can't control every single thing and every single being on the entire planet.
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:57.920]  Either you're going to blow up the whole planet through nukes or through biological catastrophe or whatever,
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:02.920]  or you're going to come a cropper one way or the other.
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:07.920]  The world is not responsive to computer programmed war scenarios.
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:09.920]  No, no, I understand that.
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.920]  I'm saying specifically from memory the last time you were on with us about them trying to control,
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:16.920]  to consolidate power, the financial crisis.
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:20.920]  I agree that I'll control what happens militarily and...
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:21.920]  Also financially.
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:31.920]  I don't think we're in such a centrally controlled breakdown crisis that they're going to regroup and so forth.
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:34.920]  I think the thing has really gotten out of control.
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:39.920]  Paulson and his Goldman Sachs cronies in the Treasury Department and certainly Bernanke,
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:48.920]  when he ramps interest rates down to zero and desperately tries to pump liquidity into the system and keep the thing going.
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:53.920]  I understand, but it was their nature to create the derivatives bubble so they could buy up real assets.
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:54.920]  It was their nature.
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:58.920]  We know banks like to control these implosions, engineer them to consolidate,
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:03.920]  but I agree that the greed is so great that it may be now falling apart.
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:08.920]  Some people want to say that the whole Madoff thing is a conspiracy and it may be that at the end of the day,
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:13.920]  so his sons and the rest of his company wouldn't go under, he blew the whistle on himself.
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:18.920]  Clearly, he wasn't running this 50 to 100 billion dollar scam by himself,
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:25.920]  but just the fact that the founder of the NASDAQ and the former head of the NASDAQ would be now in so much trouble
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  and people saying they never heard of him, that gives us an idea of this criminal class.
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:32.920]  Well, Alex, I see it.
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:39.920]  The Madoff thing is really the symbol of the entire Wall Street dollar system is a giant Ponzi scheme
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:45.920]  and that's what depends on sucking ever more volumes of money into the system
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:47.920]  and now the music stopped.
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:52.920]  It stopped with the Lehman Brothers' decision to let it go under in the middle of September
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:56.920]  and that really has triggered unintended consequences, I think,
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:02.920]  and the way I see different national governments reacting in Europe and so forth,
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:07.920]  even the European Union, which a lot of people thought was the unit of action in Europe,
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:10.920]  is no longer the center of things, it's national government.
[1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:15.920]  They said, okay, we've got to save our own behind here and we're facing elections next year,
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:18.920]  not the bureaucrats in Brussels who are unelected,
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:23.920]  so we've got to do something to make sure the voter base is at least halfway with us.
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:29.920]  We don't have that problem here because they control the two parties at such an extent
[1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:34.920]  and also have their voting machines that that part of the equation worrying about the voters doesn't matter.
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:38.920]  Fortunately, it's not quite that advanced in Europe.
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:41.920]  Yes, so we don't have total global full-spectrum dominance.
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:44.920]  Now, full-spectrum dominance goes into everything.
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:46.920]  Everything, yes.
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:52.920]  And now I think you're going to see the emphasis shift from the financial dominance to the military
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:57.920]  in order to get the financial back under control, control world money, control the world.
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:02.920]  And we've seen Obama say, I mean, you think a trillion plus is a big defense budget.
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:05.920]  How about a trillion and a half? How about two trillion?
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:07.920]  Yeah.
[1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:12.920]  Well, look at the fact that he renominated Robert Gates to be defense secretary
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:19.920]  and that says Robert Gates has spent most of his adult life as a house servant of the Bush dynasty.
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:23.920]  I mean, that's pretty much right there.
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:28.920]  Well, you know, Cheney's on TV making fun of Obama and Biden. That's the headline.
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:34.920]  Meanwhile, they're groveling and saying that they're going to protect him and make sure he doesn't get any trouble.
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:41.920]  Regardless of what you think of Obama or Biden, I mean, that shows that they know who the real power is.
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:43.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:48.920]  There's just such an unbridled arrogance that's coming out of Washington.
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:57.920]  It would be lappable if it weren't these people still have some hands on the levers of power.
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.920]  And I guess the military men at the high levels, they like it, too.
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:08.920]  But, you know, it was too much for, too much for Fox Fallon, though.
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:16.920]  They had a sent com at the time when they wanted him to attack US ships with Navy SEALs.
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:18.920]  He did resign over that. We now know.
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:25.920]  So at least some of them up there don't, you know, don't like staging terror attacks or maybe he didn't mind a terror attack.
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  Maybe he didn't want to start World War III.
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:30.920]  Whatever, yeah.
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:39.920]  He certainly made clear that he wasn't on the program of Chinese to launch a nuclear strike on Iran.
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:48.920]  Well, I could throw out a lot of questions at you, but other things that are on your mind since we talked a few months ago that you think are most important.
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:59.920]  Well, I think the, of course, now much of the intelligent world is woken up to the fact that there is no regime change that's taken place with the US-November elections.
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:06.920]  That it's simply continuity of government, continuity of the elite's power behind the scene, the permanent institutions.
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:08.920]  I don't think we need to dwell on that.
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:14.920]  That's really so obvious by now in the appointments that President-elect Obama has made.
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:29.920]  The financial disintegration that's taking place at the spillover into the real economy is something I'd like to share a few thoughts with you on this,
[1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:32.920]  because I've been looking at this closely over the last days.
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:39.920]  It's an element that very few people have begun to speak up about openly in connection with the crisis.
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:45.920]  And that is the dramatic demographic shift that's about to take place.
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:49.920]  It's about to kick in 2011, 2013, in that time period.
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:58.920]  And that is that the baby boomer generation, the generation that was born after the war, beginning 45, 46, however you want to date it,
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:07.920]  but reached its peak around 65, that generation in about two years is going to come big time into retirement.
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:18.920]  And this is the generation that has allowed the financial boom of the post-1982 period in the U.S. to be created on Wall Street.
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:25.920]  It's made an industry out of the mutual funds with 401Ks and all sorts of other savings for retirement,
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:33.920]  because they were coming into their peak earning years, the kids had gone to college and they had their home paid down most of them.
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:35.920]  This is, I'm talking about middle class America.
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:37.920]  This is the investor class.
[1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:43.920]  Yeah, and you know, the small private investor that's been the lifeblood of Wall Street.
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:51.920]  And now not only has the stock market tanked in the last months to half its value at the beginning of the year,
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:55.920]  it's going to tank a lot further as the economic crisis gets worse.
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:43:00.920]  But the fact is now this generation is coming big time into retirement.
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:03.920]  And right as they do, they're not going to have their money.
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:06.920]  They're going to have to live off there for what they have to cash in.
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:11.920]  So they're going to cash in in a falling stock market, a bond market and so forth.
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:19.920]  And hyperinflation is on the cards for perhaps 9-12 months at the rate that the Fed is monetizing.
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:21.920]  But William, I mean, that's it.
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:27.920]  Notice how this happened right in time for the moment they were about to cash in on their retirements.
[1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:33.920]  And the cities, the counties, the states have all been investing in the secret double set of books,
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:35.920]  the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:37.920]  You know about those, right?
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:39.920]  No, I'm not familiar with that.
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:41.920]  There's a double set of books.
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:47.920]  And so I'm saying from the evidence I have, this is a planned swindle by these ruthless people
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:49.920]  to make sure the baby boomers don't get their money.
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:51.920]  But continue with your thought.
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:59.920]  Well, what the point that I was making is that people talk about a one or two year recession.
[1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:07.920]  Nouriel Roubini, who's got quite a following in the economic domain in recent months,
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:11.920]  is talking about a 5% peak to trough dip in the recession.
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:15.920]  I think this is just a rosy-eyed optimism to the extreme.
[1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:21.920]  We're going to have a depression in the United States that's going to exceed anything we saw during the 1930s.
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:25.920]  It's going to be categorized as a very great depression, VGD.
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:31.920]  And not just great depression by future economists, if there are any left around to calculate this.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:39.920]  And this 401, this baby boom retirement factor is going to be the thing that's going to kick it into,
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:47.920]  at least I see as a, under most optimistic scenario, a 10-year process of depression in the U.S. economy.
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:55.920]  I don't see any new blood coming into the credit system that's going to boost it up.
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:07.920]  So in that environment, I think the military option is going to be the option of last resort for the U.S. power elites.
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:09.920]  They will see no other chance.
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:16.920]  Now for those that don't understand history, Mr. Engel explained to them why in a bad economy there is a military option.
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.920]  What the social architects believe that will do, not for the public but for themselves,
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:27.920]  have people rally around the government, around the flag as painful things happen at home,
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:35.920]  further consolidate power, create a growth sector in the economy.
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:40.920]  Well, let's take the best example for most Americans who are over 60.
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:47.920]  The Great Depression ended when Roosevelt began secretly at first,
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:54.920]  letting contracts, Pentagon contracts for the buildup for a coming war with Germany and Japan,
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:46:01.920]  which after 1939, after 41 rather, after Pearl Harbor was called World War II.
[1:46:01.920 --> 1:46:11.920]  And it was that military spending, huge military spending, that brought the U.S. out of the Great Depression.
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:16.920]  But the military spending was by the government, which had never been done on that scale before in American history.
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:20.920]  And why was that an economic positive?
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:30.920]  Well, it wasn't an economic positive because bombs and jet airplanes and B-52s or whatever the bees were in those days
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:35.920]  are socially unproductive. They're a net minus on that.
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:39.920]  But when the war ended, those factories could now make costs.
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:41.920]  That's the point, Alex.
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:48.920]  When the war ended, not only U.S. factories were the state of the art in world production capacity.
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:54.920]  All of Europe was a rubble heap. Japan was bomb the smithereens, nuclear and otherwise.
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:47:04.920]  And the U.S. had no rival on the planet that Russia had lost, or the Soviet Union had lost 23 million of its prime youth
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:09.920]  in the slaughter there in Europe, trying to defeat Nazi Germany.
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:17.920]  And Roosevelt, after his death, Truman and Churchill simply chuckled up their sleeve and said,
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:25.920]  well, look, they've slaughtered each other, and now the U.S. was in a position to declare what Henry Luce said in 1941 triumphally,
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:28.920]  this is the dawn of the American century.
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:31.920]  Now, think about that a minute.
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:40.920]  What they knew was they had all of the world's monetary gold in Fort Knox or in the New York Federal Reserve vaults.
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:47.920]  They had intact the production facilities. They had the aluminum production.
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:56.920]  They had the hydroelectric power in the Northwest that they built through the Great Depression on slave labor wages through public works programs.
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:04.920]  And now the United States was in a position, the United States elites, led by the Rockefeller family back then.
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:17.920]  David, John D. III, Nelson, and Lawrence Rockefeller, they were in a position literally to dominate the entire world.
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:21.920]  And that's the kind of thinking that these elites have.
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:31.920]  I'm convinced that that's what they're mulling around how they can do that, how they can systematically defang the one nuclear power on the planet
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:41.920]  and offer them a challenge, and that's Russia. As bankrupt as Russia is, I was in Russia recently, and I saw you have new cars everywhere in Moscow,
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:45.920]  but you have 20 million people living in an overcrowded condition in that city.
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:51.920]  It's going to take at least 10 years for the social situation to stabilize in Russia under the best of conditions,
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:58.920]  and now they have a collapsed energy price oiled down in the 40s instead of over 100.
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:06.920]  So it's going to be a very, very dicey time for the entire world in the next months.
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:14.920]  And I think if I want to leave your listeners with one message is to see the reality of what's coming
[1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:20.920]  and not try to have illusions that there's going to be a one or two year post-war typical recession
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:28.920]  and that somehow Obama's going to have a kinder and gentler America and this.
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:37.920]  And the other thing, this is an imperial system in desperation, in irreversible decline.
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:42.920]  The system is not the people, the people are the victims of the system.
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:51.920]  But they can't, it's like the road runner cartoons, they're running off the cliff and they can't do anything to slow the legs down.
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:59.920]  So 2009 is going to be, as the Chinese say, a very interesting year.
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:07.920]  I agree with you. We're going to come back in this segment and one other and take phone calls from Maggie, Eric, Tracy, Don and Paul.
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:13.920]  When do you see the crises peaking somewhere out in 12,014 or so?
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:16.920]  Or this is so big, such a massive shift.
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:22.920]  Somewhere in that ballpark between 12 and 14, 2012, 2014.
[1:50:22.920 --> 1:50:29.920]  This is going to really be a long, dragged out affair.
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:37.920]  Well, I know the establishment seems very pleased with all of us. They're going to love the domestic police state, they're going to foist through on this.
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:45.920]  I mean, they've spent decades, William, setting all this up, preparing all their preparations right on time for this moment.
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:50.920]  I know it's by design. I know it's been engineered.
[1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:56.920]  And they have wrought something that is just absolutely horrific.
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:00.920]  All right, we'll be right back and take some phone calls for our guest.
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:04.920]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off,

[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:07.920]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra and we knew what to do.
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:09.920]  Or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:15.920]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:24.920]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:31.920]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:40.920]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:40.920 --> 1:52:49.920]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:06.920]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget. If you're ready to start saving at the pump, fuel saver technologies can help.

[1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:05.920]  Spend a little and save a lot.
[1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:13.920]  Some very wicked people are in control.
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:22.920]  We've got a decadent population that doesn't know that the dice are loaded.
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:30.920]  How do we reach out to them? How do we get them to stand up and say no and not go quietly into the night?
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:34.920]  Well, the good news is the establishment at least had to give us a fake savior like Obama.
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:42.920]  They at least nodded towards the fact that they need the public fooled.
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:45.920]  But it isn't working. I'm jamming some calls here.
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:57.920]  But William, the point I was just thinking of, Obama could have appointed insiders who weren't well-known retreads.
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:03.920]  Again, it shows an innate disdain for the public by the establishment.
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:12.920]  Sure, a contempt. Deep down they have nothing but contempt for us normal people.
[1:55:12.920 --> 1:55:17.920]  I think that's their fundamental weakness as well. This isn't an aristocracy of excellence.
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:31.920]  This is a degenerate paranoid elite that really belongs in psychiatric care and not in government.
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:34.920]  Well, I guess that's the Norman history to have nuts in control.
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:40.920]  That's what normally happens. That's the nature. Normal people don't want the power.
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:43.920]  Maggie in Texas, you're on the air with our guests. Go ahead.
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:47.920]  Oh, hi, Alex. I got in line before your guests came on.
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:48.920]  I understand. Go ahead.
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:53.920]  Okay. So my comment is a bit off topic, but I would like to...
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:57.920]  Listen, let me just tell you and everybody else something. We don't screen the phone calls.
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:01.920]  And so unless I specifically say it's just for the guests, it's fine.
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.920]  Oh, okay.
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:03.920]  So just go ahead.
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:18.920]  Yeah, I would like to plug my new blog on fluoride. And it is at www.fluoridefreeaustin.com.
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:22.920]  And you guys are fighting to get fluoride removed out of the water here locally, right?
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:27.920]  Well, there are several different people working on it from several different angles.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:30.920]  I'm not the only one. This is my particular contribution.
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:32.920]  No, I understand. I'm saying there's an Austin movement.
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:41.920]  Yes, yes. There are a bunch of people. And in fact, one of them is under the umbrella of freedom force.
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:47.920]  And John Bush, whom you know is leading that, is deeply involved in that.
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:53.920]  And there is another group or person somewhere who is also using the name fluoride free Austin.
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:57:00.920]  And in fact, I will admit that he had it first, but he is doing it through my space.
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:06.920]  Well, I think activists should worry less about who's doing what first and more about getting the fluoride out.
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:12.920]  Right. The more people, the more people the better. And yes, I will work with anybody who's interested in this subject.
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:18.920]  This is my particular contribution and I'm going to be doing some reporting on that blog.
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:24.920]  And I've been talking in front of the Austin City Council and recording my little lectures.
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:27.920]  Maggie, you keep it up. We got to go because the segment's over.
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:33.920]  But William, what about that subject? What is the establishment going to do as the public becomes educated?
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:41.920]  Say on GMO foods and stops eating them and the free market dictates then that we want organic.
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:47.920]  What are they going to do as people find out about mercury in the vaccines or fluoride in the water and demand it out?
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:56.920]  What are they going to do as the public just says no, but the establishment wants to continue to carry out its forced medication of the public?
[1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:05.920]  Well, I think that's up for grabs and no one can predict when a population realizes how brutally they have been abused
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:13.920]  by the so-called misnamed health care that they've been given through the traditional mainstream hospitalization
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:20.920]  and medical system in the last decades. Then you're going to have some pretty angry people.
[1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:32.920]  And I saw a statistic recently that there are more people who die from mishandling mistakes in the hospital than die of cancer in the United States.
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:34.920]  That's pretty frightening statistic.
[1:58:34.920 --> 1:59:00.920]  $300,000 a year just from bad drug interactions. Stay there for one more segment.
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:05.920]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:13.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:19.920]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:23.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:23.920 --> 1:59:30.920]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:35.920]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.
[1:59:35.920 --> 1:59:42.920]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:42.920 --> 1:59:52.920]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:52.920 --> 2:00:04.920]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:04.920 --> 2:00:12.920]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:24.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.920 --> 2:00:30.920]  Peter Schiff, financial expert. He'll be joining us coming up in about 25 minutes.
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:40.920]  I'm going to take your phone calls the next segment after our guest has left us so we can finish up with him.
[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:47.920]  Coming back to F. William Engdahl, William, give folks your website. Tell them when your newest book is coming out.
[2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:52.920]  And then I want to get into the other, you know, briefly other areas of full spectrum dominance.
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:00:59.920]  It's not just the military with the satellites and the face scanners going up worldwide to track everywhere we go in real time.
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:08.920]  And, you know, full spectrum dominance, the national ID cards to buy and sell, set into a world ID system, you know, where the whole world's a prisonplanet.
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:13.920]  There's also other facets of full spectrum dominance, and that's the medical, but go ahead.
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:33.920]  Okay. First of all, the website is www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net.
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:43.920]  My book, The Seeds of Destruction, the Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation, which is published by globalresearch.ca in Canada.
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:54.920]  In there, I document the second of three major control mechanisms of the post-war U.S. elites.
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:59.920]  You control the oil, you control whole nations, their economic growth rates and so forth.
[2:01:59.920 --> 2:02:03.920]  You control food, and you can control people.
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:07.920]  The third being, of course, if you control money, you control the whole world.
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:10.920]  The Seeds of Destruction was written from that standpoint.
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:26.920]  There are a lot of books out there which talk about the uncertainties of a diet of genetically modified soybeans or corn or whatever in our cattle feed and our direct human consumption.
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:33.920]  But what's lacking in the reason I wrote the book is the geopolitical background of this.
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:35.920]  Who financed this project in the beginning?
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:38.920]  It didn't just pop out of thin air as a great advance of science.
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:45.920]  It's based on absolutely wrong sciences, based on reductionism, upside down science, I call it.
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:53.920]  And it was designed and financed from the beginning, back going to a project back in 1938 by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  Dr. Warren Weaver of the Rockefeller Foundation, an atomic physicist, said,
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:08.920]  well, let's apply the same concept as atomic physics to the field of biology and reduce life to a hard little ball of matter that we call a gene.
[2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:11.920]  And these were dedicated, passionate eugenicists.
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:15.920]  The eugenicists are people who think you can build a master race.
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:21.920]  In fact, the same Rockefeller Foundation at that time was financing eugenics research in Nazi Germany.
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:23.920]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and others.
[2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:31.920]  And literally every evil I find, like putting mercury in vaccines or discovering that most cancer was viral,
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:35.920]  and then putting it in vaccines, and then owning the big cancer clinics,
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:44.920]  and then literally controlling the whole industry, and then even having fads, studies in the 50s about having cancer be part of the fad,
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:52.920]  and then socializing it where it's a social event, and the women go play and have fun while they die of cancer in the cancer ward.
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:54.920]  And, oh, girl, you've got it now, too.
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:57.920]  Kind of how they made having AIDS fashionable.
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:03:59.920]  I mean, this is mass murder of the public.
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:00.920]  Of course.
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:01.920]  It's unbelievable.
[2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  You go back to the 1920s, one of the first projects of the newly created Rockefeller Foundation,
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:13.920]  which is a standard oil trust fortune, a tax avoidance scheme for the Rockefeller fortune.
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:18.920]  They focused on education, and especially on medical education in America.
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  They closed down naturopathic clinics and hospitals all over the United States, medical schools,
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:30.920]  and allowed only those who followed the agenda, the vaccination agenda and otherwise,
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:37.920]  of the Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller University for medical research and so forth.
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:42.920]  And that defined the entire field of how modern medicine is applied.
[2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:44.920]  Well, that's how they take control.
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:50.920]  They take over industries, and then the profits flow, but it's really all about the control.
[2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:52.920]  Fire out the website, sir.
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:58.920]  www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net
[2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:23.920]  All right, sir.
[2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:54.920]  All right, sir.
[2:05:54.920 --> 2:06:04.920]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:06:04.920 --> 2:06:09.920]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:06:09.920 --> 2:06:12.920]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:06:12.920 --> 2:06:15.920]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:18.920]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:28.920]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:34.920]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:38.920]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:40.920]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:44.920]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:06:44.920 --> 2:06:46.920]  They're after power. That's their after-easy.
[2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:51.920]  You can watch the game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com

[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:36.920]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Hello and thank you for joining us.
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:41.920]  We're live at prisonplanet.te for the next hour and 51 minutes.
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:47.920]  We've got Peter Schiff coming up joining us, president and CEO of Europe Pacific Capital.
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:53.920]  I'm going to talk about what's happening with the economy here in the United States and around the world in about 20 minutes.
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:08:57.920]  I also want to go to some of your phone calls right now.
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:05.920]  For those of you that have been holding patiently, it is December 22, 2008.
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:11.920]  And we are a little more than two hours into the regularly scheduled radio show.
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:18.920]  And then every day of the last hour, but some days even more, we go live at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:28.920]  We're also developing this studio and another studio to put a once a week TV program on National Cable slash Dish Network Direct TV.
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:33.920]  And we've now moved into our new offices and set up one of the studios that's phase one.
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:41.920]  Now phase two is getting it on television, but it's all live right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:51.920]  Now, before I go to Eric, Tracy, Don, Paul and others that are patiently holding,
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:10:00.920]  I did briefly want to tell you about a couple of sponsors that make this broadcast possible.
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:10.920]  One of those sponsors is eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect is the longest continually operating storeable foods company in the nation.
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:15.920]  Bottom line, you'll never need to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:19.920]  And with as corrupt as this elite is with the depression that they've been engineering,
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:22.920]  so they can consolidate power and bring in their world government.
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:28.920]  It is more important than ever to have firearms, to have precious metals, to have water filters, and of course to have swirable foods.
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:33.920]  And this is the place to get them eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:40.920]  If you give them a call, they can send you a free brochure or audio CD about their materials, or if you go online to eFoodsDirect.com,
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:45.920]  they have a bunch of videos up there which describe their fine products, their line of products, and what they have to offer.
[2:10:45.920 --> 2:10:54.920]  I hope you'll check out eFoodsDirect.com, the best horrible foods company out there, the best prices bar none, 800-409-5633.
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:11:00.920]  Another one of the sponsors that makes this transmission possible is Acola Blue.
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:05.920]  And Acola Blue is a atmospheric water filter.
[2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:11.920]  You know, they're trying to put meters on wells, they're trying to ban people having wells on their own property, you're trying to tax them, restrict them.
[2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:19.920]  Well, this way it's a little unit, plugs into your house or plugs into a solar panel, and via condensation gets around 7.5 gallons a day.
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  Some areas more, some areas less, depending on your humidity in your area.
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  And you can find out more at AcolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com, AcolaBlue.com, or give them a call at 866-585-4044.
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:35.920]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[2:11:35.920 --> 2:11:41.920]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins, neutral pH, and then it goes through five filtration systems.
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:46.920]  And then one of the filters has multiple filters, so technically seven, but we'll just say five here.
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:53.920]  Passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then a taste and odor removal filter,
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  and a stored and eliminated tank by an antibacterial fungal UV light.
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:05.920]  Again, 866-585-4044 or acolablue.com.
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  Okay, that said, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:14.920]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut. Eric here on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:19.920]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call and greetings from the frigid northeast.
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:24.920]  I'm getting myself a birthday present, or a Christmas present this year, a Berkelight.
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:29.920]  That's a great system. How are you doing with the horrible global warming up there?
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:35.920]  Is it tropical in Connecticut right now, or are you experiencing the coldest temperatures in more than 20 years?
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:42.920]  I was looking forward to being able to open my pool up in January, but I can't do that because it's like 20 degrees outside.
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:46.920]  Well, listen, if you don't worry about all the GMO food killing everybody,
[2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:50.920]  and don't worry about the bad drug interactions killing 300,000 a year,
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:53.920]  and don't worry about all the toxic waste on the real environmental problems,
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:59.920]  you can just pay a bunch of taxes to private bankers, carbon indulgences, and then everything will be okay.
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:00.920]  How's that sound?
[2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:04.920]  You know, Alex, that sounds great, and I think if I can pay them the more,
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:11.920]  I'll be able to sleep a little better at night because they work so hard trying to get us under their thumb.
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:19.920]  Well, even if you believe that man-made carbon dioxide and methane from Cal's flatulence is destroying the ozone layer
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:23.920]  and heating the earth up, which of course it's not,
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:30.920]  why moving it to China and India where they have no restrictions and actually increasing the level of carbon dioxide,
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:33.920]  how is that actually going to cool the earth down?
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  I mean, even if we believe their official story, how is...
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:43.920]  I was going to say, Alex, if you read their studies, I mean, people don't believe it when I tell them at work.
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  I say, all you need to do is go and research and read what these elites are saying they're going to do.
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:53.920]  I mean, they come basically, they come right out, but they're counting on the average American citizen
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:56.920]  to basically just sit down and watch TV and not even pay attention.
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:59.920]  Well, that's because they knew people were lazy. They told them in the 50s,
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.920]  you don't have to worry about government anymore, you don't have to be involved anymore, trust the elites.
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:07.920]  There's no such thing as corruption. It doesn't exist.
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:12.920]  It's like telling somebody there's no such thing as cancer. Go ahead and smoke five packs of cigarettes a day.
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:17.920]  And then now we've got cancer and they're going, but there's no such thing.
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:23.920]  And you're like, no, there is, pal. They're like, no, I heard Al-Qaeda talks like that.
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:28.920]  I heard Al-Qaeda said, hold on, hold on, you know, it's shut up.
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:33.920]  I mean, basically, if you think that there's any corruption in our government, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  I mean, imagine what the government's done.
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:39.920]  Oh, and denial is their greatest ally.
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:43.920]  And that's what people need to realize, that denial is their best friend,
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:47.920]  because it prevents people from researching, it prevents people from taking action,
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:53.920]  it prevents people from waking up, and they can, the elites can just sit back and rub their hands together.
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:56.920]  And you even see it on TV. I remember back in the 90s and earlier,
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:02.920]  you had shows that would portray the government as questionable, corrupt, dubious, evil.
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:07.920]  Now you look at a lot of these programs, I saw a preview for this program where I see nothing but these,
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:11.920]  these heroes, quote, unquote, running around in their little ninja outfits, bustin' door-downs.
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:17.920]  It's a program called Homeland Security. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I saw that one.
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:19.920]  Homeland Security USA.
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:21.920]  Yeah, these shows are-
[2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:24.920]  It's where the USA, you're not against the USA, are you?
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:31.920]  Yeah, and I'm hearing, you know, I like the way Alan Stang puts it, shallow Sean Hannits with.
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:35.920]  They're talking about these concerts they go to, where everybody has a tear in his eye,
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:39.920]  because they're singing about the war on terror and everything else with all these country stars.
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:45.920]  Well, don't they realize that greed has replaced common sense in this country?
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:47.920]  We've lost our way in large part.
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  Well, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call. What's happened is, people bought into the delusion.
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:54.920]  They bought into the Republican, the Democratic illusion.
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:59.920]  They bought into that we're the good guys, and we're gonna kill some Arabs, and it's good,
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:03.920]  and we're gonna take our liberty so El Qaeda didn't get them.
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:07.920]  And they have no idea they've been completely set up.
[2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:12.920]  Oh yeah, Hannity has these Pentagon worshipping events.
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:17.920]  And then meanwhile, the Pentagon is a foreign alien group destroying America.
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.920]  It's like the main seat of the cancer for the Federal Reserve.
[2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:25.920]  It's taking over the United States, overthrowing our nation like some third world country.
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:31.920]  And then meanwhile, there's country stars, everybody crying, playing, you know, proud to be an American.
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:34.920]  Because at least I know I'm free.
[2:16:34.920 --> 2:16:39.920]  And then they talk about how they're giving the money to children who lost their family members in Iraq.
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:42.920]  How about don't send them to Iraq?
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:50.920]  How about don't kill a million and a half Iraqis in the last five and a half years?
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:51.920]  It doesn't matter.
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:56.920]  All these illusional people, their time's running out, they're gonna find out what they've helped the New World Order do.
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:17:01.920]  Don and Alabama, no, no, actually Tracy's next. Tracy in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:07.920]  Hello, Alex. Alex, the last time I spoke with you was about seven years ago.
[2:17:07.920 --> 2:17:11.920]  I've been listening to you since you were on shortwave.
[2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:19.920]  And one thing that has always remained the same with you listening to you talking about this,
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:25.920]  is you bring us wonderful information, information we couldn't get anywhere else,
[2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:28.920]  unless we spend all our time doing it, which we can't.
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:42.920]  But you've never told us where we can go, who we can talk to, what we can do to bring this to a halt.
[2:17:42.920 --> 2:17:48.920]  Because everything you've suggested so far doesn't work, it's not gonna work, it's not designed to work.
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:51.920]  They've got us by the you-know-what.
[2:17:51.920 --> 2:17:54.920]  And the only box left is the cartridge box.
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:18:03.920]  I want to know if there's any groups anywhere that are preparing for this to stand up and defend themselves.
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:05.920]  And they are, I'd like to join.
[2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:08.920]  And the time for talking is over.
[2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:10.920]  The time for listening is over.
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:14.920]  And the time for waking idiots up is over.
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:16.920]  It's time for us to do something.
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:19.920]  It has been for years.
[2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:21.920]  Those are my thoughts.
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:24.920]  What are yours?
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:34.920]  Well, look, as things get worse, more people are gonna wake up and listen to what we have to say.
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:38.920]  And it's during the greatest crisis that it's the time for talking.
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:48.920]  I mean, that's why the establishment pays tens of billions of dollars a year alone domestically for fake newscasts, disinformation, fake bloggers.
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:52.920]  So 90% of a war, according to the Pentagon, is info war.
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:56.920]  They use deception and lies and deceit and fake patriotism.
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:18:59.920]  We use the truth and true patriotism to counter them.
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:02.920]  By number one, pointing out they're not American, they're anti-American.
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:05.920]  They work for offshore banks who've stolen 8.5 trillion.
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:08.920]  People say that now is not the time for talking.
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:11.920]  Well, that's because you've been awake for decades, probably.
[2:19:11.920 --> 2:19:24.920]  And unfortunately, so many people that know what's going on have decided to just pull their antenna in and not wake people up, not being involved anymore.
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:32.920]  And so I see the establishment staging terror attacks all the time to try to say that we're violent so they have a pretext to crack down on the public.
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:39.920]  So I don't think violence is the answer. The people I hear on the radio talking about violence, they never seem to get in trouble for calling for that.
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:41.920]  That's because they're feds.
[2:19:41.920 --> 2:19:44.920]  If I called for that, I'd be arrested very, very quickly.
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:50.920]  So no, we need to hear a lot more talk and a lot louder, and we need to hear it right now.
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:52.920]  Does that answer your question?
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:55.920]  So your answer to my question is you think I'm a fed.
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:59.920]  No, that's not what I just said. I said I'm a radio, sir. Stay there. I'll talk.
[2:19:59.920 --> 2:20:02.920]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:07.920]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[2:20:07.920 --> 2:20:09.920]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:15.920]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:18.920]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[2:20:18.920 --> 2:20:22.920]  Have a fighting chance with sprayyourplate.com's photo blocker.
[2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself to be the most effective device available against traffic cameras.

[2:20:56.920 --> 2:20:59.920]  And when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  Hi, John Hughner from Mitus Resources.
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:05.920]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:10.920]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of 20 billion a week,
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:14.920]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:18.920]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:22.920]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:24.920]  How much are you willing to lose?
[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:30.920]  Take action now. Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:34.920]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:37.920]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:44.920]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:50.920]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:52.920]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:59.920]  Call me, John Hughner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:06.920]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:10.920]  An enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:15.920]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:22:15.920 --> 2:22:22.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:29.920]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:33.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:40.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:44.920]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[2:22:59.920 --> 2:23:04.920]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed. Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:08.920]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:12.920]  Be smart. Be safe. Trust pepper spray instead of your luck.

[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:00.320]  And then it'll be time for people that have done all this talking about how they're not
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:04.080]  going to talk to actually get in a shooting war.
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:09.000]  You know, I'm not going to a FEMA camp, I'm not turning my firearms in, I'm not going
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.720]  along with the New World Order.
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:19.440]  But I mean, I'm a radio host, and it's not my job to charge off like George Washington
[2:25:19.440 --> 2:25:24.640]  and get into a shooting war with the feds, and I'm not saying you're doing this, I'm
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:28.920]  saying I'm criticized a lot by people for being all talk.
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:33.200]  Well, our talk has defeated hundreds and hundreds of bad pieces of legislation.
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:37.240]  Our talk has exposed a lot of bad things.
[2:25:37.240 --> 2:25:44.840]  Talk a few weeks ago, shot down, at least for now, a constitutional convention.
[2:25:44.840 --> 2:25:46.160]  Is Tracy still there?
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:52.200]  Yeah, we're still in the shape we're in, we're still facing what we're facing, nothing's
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:53.200]  changed.
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:54.200]  Who's the commander then?
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:56.480]  I mean, Tracy, who are you going to shoot?
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:25:57.480]  Stop, stop.
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:03.040]  Okay, who is Tracy in New Mexico going to go out and blast?
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:05.880]  I'm not exactly sure.
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:08.680]  Well don't look for me to tell you to go shoot.
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:12.200]  Waking up people isn't stopping this.
[2:26:12.200 --> 2:26:17.440]  They don't care if we're awake, they don't care if we're watching them, as long as we
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:19.880]  don't try to stop them.
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:25.720]  They'll continue to do what they're doing, as long as all we do is talk about, find out
[2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:26.720]  things.
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:30.280]  Let me throw something out here to you.
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:36.560]  The police arrested about 3,000 people, actually a little bit more than 3,000 people in New
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:46.360]  York in 2004 at the RNC, I was there, peaceful people, AP reporters, radio reporters, spectator
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:48.960]  reporters, you know, even conservatives.
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:54.040]  They put them in a FEMA camp, Pier 57, had the police come over and threaten to arrest
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:57.160]  me for just videotaping and across the street.
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:00.480]  Now nobody got in a shooting war with the police.
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:05.200]  Lawsuits were filed, they lost over a thousand lawsuits, hundreds of millions of dollars,
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:08.920]  and now the New York police don't claim you to permit to march.
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:14.080]  Now they don't claim there's free speech zones, and all over the country, take Austin.
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.920]  Austin police would arrest you back a decade ago if you protested anywhere without a permit.
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:21.800]  Now, they don't because they lost a bunch of lawsuits.
[2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:25.960]  Now, I mean, that example right there, are you saying it would have been better for people
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:28.200]  just to blast the police?
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:30.920]  I mean, I'm trying to understand this.
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:36.480]  Well, I'm trying to understand it myself after you've done all this.
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:40.960]  But you're saying nothing's better than people, sir, sir, they're being forced to admit there's
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:43.120]  world government now.
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:48.560]  Congress has a 9% approval rating right now, the lowest it's ever been, and so in a way
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:49.560]  you're right.
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:50.560]  You're right.
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:52.560]  The people are awake, but still they go forward.
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:56.200]  But they go forward with less and less support, more and more leaks.
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:01.800]  When Dick Cheney wanted to blow up US ships and blame it on Iran, the Admiral resigned
[2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:07.120]  and then suddenly it was leaked to New Yorker magazine.
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:09.560]  We have friends in government as well.
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:15.000]  We don't want to just randomly go pick some innocent cop out, you know, who's parked
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.280]  in a doughnut, you know, places parking lot and walk up and shoot him in the head three
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:20.280]  times.
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:26.720]  Well, I guess all this talking and all this waking up is going to stop them from doing
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:27.720]  what they're doing.
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:32.280]  We're just, they're going to be afraid that we've found them out.
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:37.240]  No, sir, when it comes to the physical, listen, listen, violence is probably inevitable down
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:41.760]  the road, like you see in Greece, under places, but on a much wider scale.
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:47.040]  But we need to have as many people awake as we can before it comes to that.
[2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:49.960]  Well, I'll agree with you on that.
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:54.280]  I mean, I mean, certainly understand my position and my job is to hope we wake up the police
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:59.160]  and military so they don't come to our houses to take us to FEMA camps, is to wake up people
[2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:03.480]  that go to their churches so that they find out their preachers are secretly paid by
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:08.280]  FEMA or spies so they can expose that in their church and hand out flyers in the parking
[2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:12.360]  lot after they're kicked out of church to break that church up so we can have real
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:13.360]  churches.
[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:16.160]  Look, the solution is in the mirror.
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:19.640]  And all I'm saying is yes, they're arrogant.
[2:29:19.640 --> 2:29:20.640]  Yes, they're brutal.
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:21.640]  Yes, they're stupid.
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:23.120]  Yes, they want a physical fight.
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:25.480]  And don't worry, man, they're going to get one.
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:26.480]  Let me ask you a question.
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:27.480]  You ever killed anybody?
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:28.480]  Nope.
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:35.680]  I mean, you ever look, my whole point is, sir, you don't want to get into this position.
[2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:39.360]  You don't want to get into a hot war with these people.
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:41.640]  And they don't want to get into a hot war with us either.
[2:29:41.640 --> 2:29:48.480]  It's like that Apple seed fella said, mutually assured destruction will be right back.
[2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:50.880]  Stay with us.
[2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:52.160]  We're on the march.
[2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:54.560]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:30:01.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:04.320]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:30:04.320 --> 2:30:08.000]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  world.
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:13.960]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who
[2:30:13.960 --> 2:30:18.840]  offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates
[2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:20.400]  or saline solutions.
[2:30:20.400 --> 2:30:24.960]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:26.360]  at the cellular level.
[2:30:26.360 --> 2:30:30.920]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:35.200]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold
[2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:39.160]  and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:30:39.160 --> 2:30:43.440]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[2:30:43.440 --> 2:30:47.360]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
[2:30:47.360 --> 2:30:56.200]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's U-T-O-P-I-A, silver.com, or call 888-213-4338,
[2:30:56.200 --> 2:31:00.160]  888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:02.160]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:31:02.160 --> 2:31:04.160]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:05.160]  9-11 was an inside job.
[2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:06.160]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:07.160]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:08.160]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:09.160]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:10.160]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:11.160]  to grow at our own door.
[2:31:11.160 --> 2:31:22.160]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global war broke out in the U.S.
[2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:33.160]  It's the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:31:33.160 --> 2:31:34.160]  How dare you?
[2:31:34.160 --> 2:31:46.160]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:46.160 --> 2:32:05.400]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, ready reserve foods
[2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:09.760]  in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration

[2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:24.080]  prices.

[2:32:25.600 --> 2:32:29.560]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[2:32:29.560 --> 2:32:33.960]  Ready reserve food offers only the highest quality to hydrated food, packed in doubly
[2:32:33.960 --> 2:32:39.280]  nammed cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15-plus-year shelf life.

[2:32:55.640 --> 2:33:12.400]  Man thinks, cause he rules it up, he can do it as he pleads, and if things don't change
[2:33:12.400 --> 2:33:24.800]  soon, he will, for man is invented, he's doomed, first step was touching the moon, now that
[2:33:24.800 --> 2:33:28.200]  he's a man, he's a woman, all my blood.
[2:33:28.200 --> 2:33:32.360]  All right, for the next 30 minutes we're joined by Peter Schiff, President and Chief Global
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:35.360]  Strategist for Euro-Pacific Capital.
[2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:42.280]  I'm going to link up to that up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:46.360]  Especially lately, he's been on TV, national, international TV quite a bit over the years,
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:48.600]  but he really doesn't need any introduction these days.
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:54.160]  He's on television and mainline radio constantly because so many of his predictions have come.
[2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:58.040]  Really is also one of the chief advisors, the Congressman Ron Paul, when he was running
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:01.920]  for president, Ron Paul gets a lot of his financial advice from Peter Schiff.
[2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:06.920]  So I wanted to get Peter Schiff here on the show before we run out, before the year is
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:07.920]  over.
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:09.240]  Mr. Schiff, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:11.640]  Well, thanks for having me.
[2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:15.720]  In the limited time we've got in this 30 minutes, let's get right into it.
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:21.000]  I mean, what we've seen with the Banker Takeover Bill, they're given almost omnipotent power,
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:26.160]  and then the San Francisco Chronicle reports two weeks ago, 8.5 trillion is missing.
[2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:31.680]  Bloomberg is told that they won't, the Federal Reserve won't tell them, or several trillion,
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:34.880]  two trillion of that has gone.
[2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:43.600]  And now we have the AFP reporting, the head of the private Spanish central bank saying
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:48.320]  world, economic meltdown, total meltdown, worse than the Great Depression.
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:53.280]  We have the prime minister of Canada saying similar things.
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:59.160]  What's really happening here, and are these guys trying to cause a world depression?
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:01.840]  Well, I don't think they're trying to.
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:04.680]  I think it's going to happen, although not necessarily worldwide.
[2:35:04.680 --> 2:35:09.400]  I certainly think there's going to be a inflationary depression in the United States.
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.680]  Hopefully the rest of the world will have a good sense not to follow us down that path,
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:16.960]  because it certainly doesn't have to be.
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:20.800]  But you know, I think it's interesting too, your men talking about all the bars being
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:25.360]  seated to the government, to the Federal Reserve, as if they didn't do enough damage with the
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:29.680]  powers that they already had, because remember that the problem that we're facing right now
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:33.960]  is a result of government interference in the free market, a government manipulation
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:38.880]  of interest rates, government attempts to artificially stimulate the economy by using
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:46.520]  monetary and fiscal policy, by interfering, by guaranteeing certain debts to encourage
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:48.000]  a risk-taking in certain areas.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:52.440]  I mean, this is, we have been micromanaging the economy into this gigantic bubble that
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:57.320]  has now burst, and now what we're supposedly learned from all this is that we need even
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:01.560]  more government, that we need government doing even more than it did before.
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:04.080]  More decisions need to be turned over to government.
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:06.840]  More resources need to be allocated, more government.
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:11.240]  Government should be picking the winners and losers, and reallocating wealth, and this
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:15.160]  is going to lead to a complete disaster, much greater than anything we're trying to deal
[2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:16.160]  with now.
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:20.080]  So a completely controlled economy, and the mainstream media has really been involved
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:21.080]  in a huge hoax.
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:25.200]  I'd like you to speak to that, Mr. Sheff, saying that the free market did this when
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:31.560]  really this was crony capitalism, this was groups of regulators in revolving doors between
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:38.000]  government and select brokerage firms and banks, I mean, take the Madoff situation where
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:42.360]  the SEC was told about what he was doing, but didn't enforce the rules they had.
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:47.520]  Yeah, look, this is certainly not a creature of capitalism, but we would not be in this
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:51.120]  mess where we are more of a capitalistic economy.
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:56.320]  It's only because a government was allowed to permeate into so much of our economy, particularly
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:00.240]  the Federal Reserve being the chief culprit there, none of this would have happened.
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:05.040]  The bubbles wouldn't have been inflated, and so there would be no deflation of a bubble
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:07.360]  had it never been inflated in the first place.
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:11.960]  And remember, what's happening right now, at least what the public perceives as being
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:18.000]  a problem, which is falling home prices, people losing their jobs, credit no longer flowing,
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:22.240]  this is another, this is the problem, this is all the consequence of the problem.
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:25.760]  The problem is all the reckless borrowing and spending in the years that preceded the
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:28.240]  collapse, and why did all that take place?
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:32.080]  That all took place because of the Federal Reserve, because of the monetary policy to
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:37.800]  pursue that led to all this irresponsible borrowing, both on Wall Street to finance
[2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:42.920]  speculation, and on Main Street to speculate the finance consumption and speculation.
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:47.000]  And all these bad decisions are coming back to bite us.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.680]  You've got a great telephone, it's over driving, can you back off of it a bit?
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:51.680]  Sure, sure.
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:56.000]  Fantastic, we're hearing you loud and clear that it was just over driving, thank you.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:03.320]  Specifically though, we see hyperinflation in certain areas continuing, and we see trillions
[2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:08.360]  of dollars being issued out into the world economy just by the Federal Reserve and the
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:14.280]  Treasury here alone, and so there's talk of hyperinflation rearing its head in the next
[2:38:14.280 --> 2:38:15.280]  couple years.
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:20.880]  So don't we really just have a depression within the real Main Street economy, but then
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:27.840]  when it goes into the Wall Street economy, that it's actually generating a competing
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:32.600]  force of inflation, and how do you see those two things playing out?
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:36.400]  Well, I mean, all these problems are consequence of inflation.
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:39.520]  The government has been too easy and has created too much money.
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:44.480]  For a while, the inflation, the cheap money went into stocks and it went into real estate
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:49.680]  and distorted the economy and distorted our decision-making process, our consumption and
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:53.880]  savings decisions, and the economy is way out of balance.
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:58.120]  But right now, as the market is trying to correct the imbalances brought about by all
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:03.600]  the inflation government credit, they're creating even more inflation, and people don't understand
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:06.280]  how dangerous this inflation is going to be.
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:12.280]  It is going to show up in consumer prices almost exclusively and in commodity prices.
[2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:19.480]  Right now, the effect of all that inflation on prices is being hidden based on some of
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:24.880]  the shorter-term effects downward pressures being put on prices, that are the result
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:30.880]  of the leveraging and bankruptcies and things like that, but these are short-term factors.
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:36.000]  The factors that are pushing prices down are temporary and they will go away soon, whereas
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:40.520]  the factors that are going to be sending prices through the roof are simply gaining momentum
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:41.520]  as we speak.
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:44.160]  How bad is this going to get?
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:45.160]  Very, very bad.
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:50.360]  It's unfortunate because the worse it gets, the more the government is going to interfere
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:52.200]  to try to save us.
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:56.840]  So the more the government interferes, the more they try to stimulate the economy, the
[2:39:56.840 --> 2:40:00.960]  more they try to revive it, the more they're going to stifle it.
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:05.640]  You know, basically, there's a fire and the only way the government knows to put it out
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:06.640]  is with gasoline.
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:11.560]  And the bigger the fire grows, the more gasoline they throw on it.
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:15.600]  And they don't make the connection between the bigger fire and the gasoline because the
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:19.040]  only thing they know about a fire is throw gas on it.
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:24.840]  And so it's going to be a raging wildfire that's going to consume everything because
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:26.640]  the government is going to keep feeding it.
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:31.480]  Well, don't the government bureaucrats also like the power they get by selectively handing
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:32.840]  out trillions of dollars?
[2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:36.760]  So there's a reason for this, too.
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:43.240]  It's kind of a self-perpetuating loop where the government likes the idea that they need
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:45.040]  more power.
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:50.120]  And the worse the economy gets, the more they can justify the power grab, and the more likely
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:54.760]  citizens are to give up their rights and to give more power to government because they're
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:59.160]  convinced that the government's going to use that power benevolently for their benefit.
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:02.640]  But of course, we all know that power corrupts, and when you give the government absolute
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:04.640]  power, it will corrupt absolutely.
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:06.560]  That is basically what we're doing.
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:10.720]  Peter Schiff, I mean, you've been very successful in investments, investing in over a billion
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:15.320]  dollars, getting great returns for folks, your predictions are what have been even more
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:18.000]  stunningly accurate out there.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:21.660]  Where do you see the United States in six months, a year, two years?
[2:41:21.660 --> 2:41:26.440]  Give us a forecast of not where you'd like us to go or where different decisions of you
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:31.600]  or Ron Paul were running the Treasury, but where do you think they're taking us?
[2:41:31.600 --> 2:41:35.640]  Well, they're taking us in the wrong direction.
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:42.160]  What we need in this country is we need to address the root causes of these imbalances,
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:43.640]  our lack of savings.
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:45.560]  Why is it that we're not saving enough money?
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:47.000]  Well, interest rates are too low.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:48.640]  They need to be much higher.
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:54.360]  People need to be rewarded for saving, and we need to make it expensive to borrow.
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:41:55.800]  We need to produce more.
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:41:58.640]  We need to make more stuff, not consume more stuff.
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:00.640]  And in order to do that, we need more capital.
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:05.600]  And again, we need more savings to get more capital, but we also need capital to be efficient,
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:07.960]  which means we need less regulations.
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:10.560]  We need fewer regulations, not more regulations.
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:14.520]  We need a smaller government, because if we're going to get more capital, if we have lower
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:19.120]  taxes, but we can't get lower taxes unless we get a smaller government.
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:22.840]  But right now, everything we're doing, we're getting more regulation, bigger government,
[2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:25.720]  more expensive government, more onerous regulation.
[2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.800]  We're trying to force-feed more credit into the American economy.
[2:42:29.800 --> 2:42:32.200]  We're keeping interest rates much too low.
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:36.720]  We're encouraging all of the wrong behavior, and we're punishing all the right behavior.
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:41.040]  We're bailing out companies that should be failing, that should be going bankrupt, and
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:45.000]  we're taxing or taking money away from the companies that are successful, and that we
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.320]  need to expand.
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:53.400]  And we can't have a successful economy where you take all the free market forces and cage
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:43:00.000]  them, and instead, resources are allocated, companies fail and succeed based on the whims
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:01.560]  of politicians.
[2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:08.680]  But it's not a function of how good you can do something, but who you know, and what political
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:12.400]  connections you have, and that's not how to run the economy.
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:17.400]  Well, let's take the case of Bernard Madoff.
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:22.400]  We've got this guy, they're saying $50 to $100 billion, and no one seems to know.
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:27.480]  Big banks involved, big brokerage firms involved, investing with him, and he's now claiming
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:33.560]  that he alone ran this whole scam, generated the spreadsheets, what was mailed out to investors
[2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:36.480]  that no one, including his sons, didn't know.
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:39.080]  Sounds like he's taken the fall for a bunch of other people.
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:40.480]  Well, it sounds like he is.
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:41.800]  I mean, he's 70 years old.
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:45.360]  He probably figures, you know, how bad is the life sentence for him?
[2:43:45.360 --> 2:43:47.840]  He's probably, I'm sure that other people knew.
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:52.640]  I just can't believe that he could have orchestrated the whole thing, and not a single other person
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:57.760]  in his organization knew that these trades weren't being made, that the returns were
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:43:58.760]  phony.
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.560]  But, you know, the bigger issue here, and I think there's two issues, number one is theoretically
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:09.520]  all of this happened under the watchful eye of the SEC and to a lesser extent FINRA, the
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:14.240]  companies that regulate broker dealers and investment managers.
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:18.120]  And if they couldn't catch that, I mean, that's kind of ridiculous that they couldn't
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:19.120]  catch it.
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:24.480]  But I think that a lot of people, one of the reasons that so many people just kind of accepted
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:28.520]  that it was true was because they assumed that the government was regulating it all,
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:33.440]  and assumed that government regulators were on the job protecting the fraud.
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:39.320]  And I think in general, government regulation does more harm than good for no other reason
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:41.240]  than it breeds complacency.
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:46.080]  I think the public, you know, would have been a lot more skeptical of a MADOC had their
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:51.920]  MADOC rather, had there been no SEC, had there been no FINRA, had people realized that, you
[2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:56.520]  know, that they're dishonest people, they might have done a better job, the free market
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:45:00.920]  might have done a much better job of policing this than the government did.
[2:45:00.920 --> 2:45:07.000]  But also, I think, you know, I think the bigger lesson here is that Ponzi schemes don't work,
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:11.160]  and they don't work when a private citizen tries it, but they also don't work when the
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:15.560]  government does it, which means social security is going to meet the same fate.
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:17.160]  That was my next point.
[2:45:17.160 --> 2:45:18.160]  That was my next point.
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:23.640]  But instead, the Ponzi scheme's gotten so big with, you know, thousands of quadrillions
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:29.860]  or whatever globally, that when does that Ponzi scheme come to, are we seeing the Ponzi
[2:45:29.860 --> 2:45:30.860]  scheme fall?
[2:45:30.860 --> 2:45:31.860]  I mean...
[2:45:31.860 --> 2:45:32.860]  Yeah, I think we are.
[2:45:32.860 --> 2:45:35.440]  I mean, first of all, remember, there's a lot of naturally occurring Ponzi schemes in
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:36.440]  the market.
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:37.880]  The housing bubble was a Ponzi scheme.
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:39.880]  The stock market bubble was a Ponzi scheme.
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:43.080]  The whole idea was that you have a greater fool.
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:47.720]  The investment returns not come from the investment, but from cashing out to a greater fool.
[2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:49.560]  That's all Ponzi dynamic.
[2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:52.840]  Think about the way the United States operates its budget.
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:54.600]  We borrow money forever.
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:56.400]  The national debt always gets bigger.
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:45:58.040]  It never gets smaller.
[2:45:58.040 --> 2:46:02.520]  Whenever the debt's mature, we have to go borrow more money to pay it off.
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:03.520]  But the final equation is...
[2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:06.560]  Whatever we have to make an interest payment, we have to go deeper into debt.
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:08.560]  But in the final equation, that's what Dick Cheney says.
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:11.560]  He says, we have the nukes, and we can nuke the whole planet.
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:18.680]  You know, he said that Sunday on Fox News, and he said, the president is all powerful.
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:20.940]  You can't question the president's power.
[2:46:20.940 --> 2:46:23.000]  After all, he's got the nuclear football.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.480]  So, what does he mean by that, that if people don't want to buy our bonds, we're going to
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:28.480]  nuke them?
[2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:29.480]  I don't know what that means.
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:34.240]  Every time he gives a speech now or talks, he just says, the president's above the law.
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:35.640]  No one can question him.
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:36.960]  I can play the clip if you want to hear it.
[2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:37.960]  The point is...
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:42.840]  That's a nonsense, and it's very frightening that somebody is even saying that, and we're
[2:46:42.840 --> 2:46:44.560]  just allowing it.
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:50.880]  But I think that's the delusional megalomania, and now Obama's coming in, promising to give
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:53.680]  people millions of jobs and more taxes.
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:55.560]  I like the way he changed his mind.
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:59.600]  He said, he's not going to do two million jobs with three million jobs, but why not
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:00.600]  five million jobs?
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:02.600]  Why not 10 million jobs?
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:06.040]  Like he can just create jobs, however many he decides, that's how many he's going to
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:07.040]  create.
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:08.040]  He's not stupid.
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:12.920]  He may not be as smart as an economist or investor as you are, but they know that raising
[2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:14.520]  taxes is going to hurt the economy.
[2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:18.720]  Well, they're not even planning on raising, except they might raise taxes on employers,
[2:47:18.720 --> 2:47:22.960]  but they're not talking about big tax increases.
[2:47:22.960 --> 2:47:24.640]  They're just talking about printing money.
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:30.800]  See, the problem is, they think that printing money and spending it is as good as actually
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:37.000]  earning it, or that wealth can come from a printing press, and they don't understand
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:38.720]  how legitimate wealth is created.
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:39.720]  They already did.
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:40.720]  So where is this going?
[2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:42.480]  I mean, how bad, I mean, you say it's going to get very bad.
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:43.480]  What is very bad?
[2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:46.000]  You know, 24 months from now, what's the United States going to buy?
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:49.280]  Very bad is runaway inflation.
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:56.480]  Very bad is shortages of basic goods, food and energy products that we now take for
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:01.920]  granted becoming prohibitively expensive and hard to come by because of government and
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:02.920]  price controls.
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:09.520]  Because of distribution problems, what we're looking at is sky-high interest rates for
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:11.240]  everybody but the government.
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:13.800]  The only people that are going to be able to borrow is going to be the government, and
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:16.680]  all they're going to be able to do is give us money that doesn't buy anything.
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.640]  I mean, we're talking about a situation where instead of worrying about Mexicans coming
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:26.720]  across the border, we're going to be worrying about Americans going in the other direction.
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:29.760]  Well, that's already happening with a lot of wealthy people that see the riding on
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:30.760]  the wall.
[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:34.120]  They're not just wealthy people, we've told young people who are looking for opportunities
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.880]  and know they don't find any here because the government has stifled them all.
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:42.200]  Well, that's why it has to do with people, when people immigrated, that second generation
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:46.860]  Americans start going back to their home country, where their parents came from because there's
[2:48:46.860 --> 2:48:50.080]  more opportunities outside the United States than within.
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:51.800]  That's where we're headed.
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:58.280]  Because the bureaucrats, like a horde of locusts, came to the United States and basically ate
[2:48:58.280 --> 2:48:59.560]  it down to the bone.
[2:48:59.560 --> 2:49:03.640]  I want to come back and talk about solutions, way to avert this, if it can be averted, or
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:08.840]  ways to individually protect ourselves in a final short segment with Peter Schiff, and
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:12.360]  we'll tell you about his website and more of the information he has, also his radio
[2:49:12.360 --> 2:49:14.120]  show that he does.
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:18.240]  But speaking of government solutions, you know they've announced 20,000 battle-hardened
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:22.840]  trips for Homeland Security for North America under Northcom.
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:28.000]  The Army War College now says they are preparing to engage militarily the American people,
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:32.880]  the people try to remove the government in Washington, in the spirit of 1776 that the
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:36.000]  military will engage us.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  Where do you see that going?
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  Excuse me, what did you say again?
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:40.400]  I thought I was going to a break.
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:43.520]  No, no, I mean, we're going to go to a break and then we're going to come back.
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:46.920]  But I was asking you briefly, you've heard about the plan, well, they're already doing
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:51.120]  it, to put 20,000 US troops on the streets to engage the American people?
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:53.120]  No, I hadn't heard about that.
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:54.120]  Really?
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:55.120]  You haven't heard about that?
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:56.120]  No.
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:00.200]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if, I mean, ultimately, as I said, I've been forecasting
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:06.140]  that there would be civil unrest and rioting in response to government-created shortages
[2:50:06.140 --> 2:50:07.640]  and lack of opportunity.
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:10.760]  A lot of people are going to be losing their jobs in the next several years and because
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:13.120]  of government policy, they're not going to find new jobs.
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:17.560]  And I think unemployed people who are hungry get very frustrated and I thought maybe the
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:22.320]  government knows that this is going to happen, they're trying to get the troops on the streets
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:23.320]  in advance.
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:27.080]  And I mean, they've been quietly setting this up for decades, but now they're going
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:31.120]  to add Northcom, Homeland Security is for the American people.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:33.520]  That's quite a totalitarian shift, isn't it?
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:38.800]  Yeah, but it's a shift in the wrong direction and we're headed there fast.
[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:42.040]  Okay, sir, there's several websites.
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:44.480]  Which one should we plug here on there?
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:47.480]  My website, www.europack.net.
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:50.640]  Yep, www.europack.net.
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:56.000]  Your shift is our guest will put his website up on screen right now at www.prisonplanet.tv.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.560]  Final second with him straight ahead with some solutions.
[2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:00.640]  Stay with us.
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:05.600]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what
[2:51:05.600 --> 2:51:09.760]  can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:11.400]  your dinner table?
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:12.800]  Garden in a can.
[2:51:12.800 --> 2:51:16.920]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[2:51:16.920 --> 2:51:20.640]  Garden in a can is ready when you are, plant them now or store them for when you really
[2:51:20.640 --> 2:51:21.640]  need them.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:26.600]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds, along with
[2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:31.440]  detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[2:51:31.440 --> 2:51:32.440]  Garden in a can.
[2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:36.360]  It's that simple, fresh, healthy, easy.
[2:51:36.360 --> 2:51:42.280]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables, ready when you are.
[2:51:42.280 --> 2:51:46.240]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a can.

[2:51:49.800 --> 2:51:59.760]  That's Gardeninacan.com or call 866-598-7396-866-598-7396.
[2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:05.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:06.500]  against this country.
[2:52:06.500 --> 2:52:09.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:10.360]  Who is the enemy?
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:11.360]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:12.360]  This is his MO.
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:13.360]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:15.360]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:19.880]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:23.040]  intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:27.480]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:29.680]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:33.360]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:38.800]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:43.000]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  much more.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:03.200]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:05.760]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:07.240]  Why settle for less?
[2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:09.080]  There is an alternative.

[2:53:56.240 --> 2:54:00.280]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:07.280]  Before you slip into our conscience.
[2:54:07.280 --> 2:54:14.080]  The little book of bold moves in bear markets is his latest bestseller, Jim Rogers calls
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:19.640]  it a must-read book, Ron Paul, says everybody needs to read it.
[2:54:19.640 --> 2:54:24.160]  Anyone wishing to know why the economy is in trouble should read this book.
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:30.640]  So you can check those out simply by Googling Peter Schiff or go to his website.
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:33.520]  We have up on screen right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:39.520]  Don't forget, my websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:46.960]  Okay, in the four minutes we have left with you, if we could fix government, what would
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:48.720]  be the good moves there to fix this?
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:50.640]  But obviously, that's not going to happen.
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:55.440]  Secondarily, what can we do individually from your educated opinion, sir?
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:58.280]  Well, individually is about the only thing we can do.
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:02.480]  We could try to influence the politicians, but it doesn't look like that's going to
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:03.480]  work.
[2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:06.720]  If you look at what's on this course, they're going to drive this bus right over the edge
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:07.720]  of a cliff.
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:11.800]  And, you know, we can try to scream and get them to change course, but the bottom line
[2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:13.480]  is we're probably going to go over that cliff.
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:17.920]  So the best thing that we can do is try to get off the bus ourselves.
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:21.000]  And that's what I'm helping people do with their investments, with trying to understand
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:25.920]  that it's the dollar that's going to be the big casualty here, the value of our money,
[2:55:25.920 --> 2:55:28.960]  and that if people want to protect their wealth, if they don't want to be stuck foot
[2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:32.880]  in the bill for all the bailouts and all the stimulus packages, they need to get their
[2:55:32.880 --> 2:55:37.600]  money out of U.S. assets, they need to be out of dollars completely out of U.S. currency.
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:40.280]  That means out of money markets, CDs, bonds.
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:44.480]  If you can, out of U.S. real estate, I think out of most U.S. stocks, and move your money
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:45.480]  abroad.
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:48.800]  I mean, being foreign currencies, being foreign government bonds, corporate bonds, foreign
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:53.360]  stocks around the world, owning assets that earn their revenues and pay their dividends.
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:55.520]  What about gold and silver?
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:01.120]  And certainly owning precious metals, owning gold, owning silver, having some physical gold
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:06.720]  in your possession, having more gold outside the United States, where it might be even
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:07.720]  safer.
[2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:12.080]  Investing in mining companies, and people have to understand and plan for what's going
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:13.080]  to happen.
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:16.000]  As bad as it's going to be, we can at least plan for it.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:21.560]  We can at least try to minimize the impact on our own lives and our own finances, although
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:28.560]  in many respects, the way it's going to play out in our personal lives may weigh over
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:31.360]  shadow any success we might have at the best of out.
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:33.840]  I was about to say, I mean, crime is already exploding.
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:35.360]  How bad do you think it's going to get?
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:39.880]  Well, look, I certainly think it's going to get worse as economic conditions worsen.
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:41.880]  And I don't think we're a civilist society.
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:45.760]  I mean, maybe I'm wrong here, but I don't think we're as civil as our grandparents were
[2:56:45.760 --> 2:56:46.760]  during the 1930s.
[2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:47.760]  No, I think you're right.
[2:56:47.760 --> 2:56:52.060]  I don't think that the type of hardship that we're going to have is going to be greeted
[2:56:52.060 --> 2:56:53.060]  the way it was.
[2:56:53.060 --> 2:56:56.520]  I think we have an entire generation of dependency in this country of people who think they're
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:56:57.520]  entitled to something.
[2:56:57.520 --> 2:57:02.960]  And I think a lot of people are going to react very differently than the way our grandparents
[2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:03.960]  did.
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:04.960]  I think it's worse than that.
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:05.960]  I mean, I agree with you.
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:12.280]  If 90% of our forebears were agrarian and now we're 90% urban, even if they were nice
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:15.160]  people socially, how are they going to feed themselves?
[2:57:15.160 --> 2:57:16.160]  Oh, yeah.
[2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:21.280]  I mean, as I said, it's going to be difficult and it's already amazing in a nation that's
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:23.960]  supposedly so abundant when it comes to food.
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:27.800]  You know, 90% of our seafood is imported.
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:28.880]  You know, I mean, it's crazy.
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:32.920]  We have all these oceans, two oceans, we have all these lakes, yet we import 90% of our
[2:57:32.920 --> 2:57:33.920]  fish.
[2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:34.920]  Well, in closing.
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:38.040]  Now, when the dollar collapses and that fish isn't coming in, you know, it's not going
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:39.040]  to be there.
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:41.880]  And it's not, you know, it's not like we've got a bunch of boats and fishermen ready to
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:43.880]  go, you know, to pick up the slack.
[2:57:43.880 --> 2:57:45.480]  No, you're absolutely right.
[2:57:45.480 --> 2:57:47.560]  Well, I mean, take global warming and closing.
[2:57:47.560 --> 2:57:53.400]  Even if you believe that our breath, you know, our breathing and our cars and cow flatulences
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:57.880]  is killing the earth, moving everything to China and India where they have no standards
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:00.120]  is going to boost the level of those gases.
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:01.480]  So it's the same thing.
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:03.280]  Government is literally killing our economy.
[2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:04.280]  Well, that's it.
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:08.880]  I mean, what we've got to do is kill government before it kills us like a cancer.
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:11.400]  And you know, the cancer keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[2:58:11.400 --> 2:58:15.720]  And we're feeding the cancer as opposed to trying to fight it off.
[2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:16.880]  All right.
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:19.440]  Have a great Christmas and have a great new year.
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:25.000]  And I look forward to talking to you coming up next year as this unfolds.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  Thank you so much.

[2:59:53.200 --> 3:00:10.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:17.280]  We have April Gallup's lawyer, Bill Beal, on the line with us.
[3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:23.600]  Our listeners five, six months ago raised money with April Gallup here on the show to
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:28.320]  be able to file a suit against George Bush and Dick Cheney for the 9-11 attacks.
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:32.840]  In this lawsuit, they're going to get discovery unless they declare national security, which
[3:00:32.840 --> 3:00:33.840]  should be very, very interesting.
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:37.600]  That should be revealing in and of itself.
[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:42.840]  The ex-GI plaintiff alleges she has been denied government support since then because she
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:47.640]  raised painful questions about the inexplainable failure of military defense that depending
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:51.880]  on that day, the suit charges that Cheney Rumsfeld admires conducted a conspiracy to
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:56.080]  facilitate the attacks and alleges that other unnamed individuals had foreknowledge.
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:00:58.000]  She was there smelling the explosives.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:02.080]  She was right in the zone with the supposed aircraft hit, you know, cutting cleanly through
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:03.080]  the walls.
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:05.200]  No airplane wreckage found.
[3:01:05.200 --> 3:01:08.920]  And then they showed up at the hospital telling her what she did see and basically threatening
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:09.920]  her.
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:10.920]  That's what she started asking questions.
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:15.040]  She brought her baby to work that day, which she'd been authorized to do.
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:17.920]  They were then claiming that, you know, she shouldn't have done that as if she could go
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:20.880]  into the building without them knowing she had her baby.
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:25.080]  Just an amazing story with April Gallup.
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:31.360]  And so I wanted to get her lawyer on to first recap what happened to her and then why he's
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:34.400]  chosen to take this case and where the case is going.
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:37.920]  This is a landmark, obviously landmark case and its importance.
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:42.360]  Kind of it goes anywhere, extremely important, historical.
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:43.360]  So thank you.
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:44.360]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:46.520]  No, you bet.
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:47.520]  Short segment now.
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:51.440]  Just just recap what happened to April, why she's suing, and then let's get into the details
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  of the suit itself.
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:02:01.240]  Well, you know, she was, it was the first date back from maternity leave and she showed
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:06.400]  up at the Pentagon and she was going to take her kid to daycare and they said, no, we want
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:11.120]  her to go in there and finish up some job that had to be done at the, at the computer
[3:02:11.120 --> 3:02:14.280]  and they say you can take your kid to daycare if you get finished at.
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:22.120]  So she went in and basically sat down and turned the computer on and, you know, the
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:24.600]  place just blew up.
[3:02:24.600 --> 3:02:30.640]  There were enormous explosions and she was knocked unconscious and, you know, came to
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:35.840]  her after some period of time and she really didn't know how long that was and managed
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:44.720]  to gather herself and her child at two months old up and she and other people who were in
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:52.600]  similar position managed to struggle out through the dust and the smoke and, and what
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:53.600]  fire there was.
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:03:00.520]  That wouldn't have been much fire at that point and, you know, stepping over all kinds
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:04.920]  of debris and probably people.
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:07.640]  All that jet fuel and hardly any fire.
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:08.640]  Yeah.
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:09.640]  Well, yeah.
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:14.200]  I mean, there were fires coming out of the computers that she remembers, but what she,
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:20.600]  her, her primary focus and her memory of getting out of there was just through smoke
[3:03:20.600 --> 3:03:28.880]  and dust and then she saw light and people were kind of helping her and, and she struggled
[3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:31.200]  that out onto the, onto the lawn there.
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:39.320]  She stepped over the last barrier of the wall and basically collapsed out on the lawn there
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:41.960]  and next thing she knew she was in the hospital.
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:50.880]  I mean, it's just a horrendous moment of anybody's life, but she is an inspiring character in
[3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:58.080]  so many ways and, you know, you just can't let her be courageous by herself that she's
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:04:05.760]  inspired in that way and so the only people with the, the ability to find justice under
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:09.560]  these circumstances are lawyers and, and I happen to be one.
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:12.520]  Well, Bill, that was the next thing I was going to say to Bill Ville here.
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:13.920]  You are courageous.
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:15.440]  You have a lot of courage.
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:18.480]  They clearly, a lot of evidence shows they just whacked a guy, you know, involved with
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:22.560]  Carl Rowe for exposing some things and we know they kill people every day, you know,
[3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:24.240]  they kill 3,000 on 9-11.
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:26.160]  So they'll, they'll stoop to anything.
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:31.440]  So we'll be praying for you here and when we come back specifically, why you decided
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:37.480]  to take the case, what her standing is and what it's alleging, where this is going.
[3:04:37.480 --> 3:04:42.400]  I mean, imagine folks, we have a plaintiff who clearly has the standing because she was
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:47.400]  in a victim of the attack and they are going forward with a suit.
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:50.680]  We'll tell you exactly why when we get back with our guest.
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:52.240]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:58.480]  This is the GCN radio network, websites are prisonplanet.tv and infowars.net.

[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:04.240]  What does humidity mean to you?
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:08.600]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:12.000]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:14.960]  That's why I'd like you to visit acoloblu.com.

[3:06:00.280 --> 3:06:05.840]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:06:05.840 --> 3:06:07.360]  against this country.
[3:06:07.360 --> 3:06:09.560]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:11.560]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:11.560 --> 3:06:12.560]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:12.560 --> 3:06:13.560]  This is his MO.
[3:06:13.560 --> 3:06:14.560]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:16.560]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:21.360]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:06:21.360 --> 3:06:23.920]  networks inside the United States.
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:28.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:30.560]  in and on the U.S.
[3:06:30.560 --> 3:06:34.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:34.560 --> 3:06:39.720]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:39.720 --> 3:06:43.880]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:06:43.880 --> 3:06:44.880]  much more.

[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:14.520]  Please, the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:19.720]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and our guest is attorney Bill Veal.
[3:08:19.720 --> 3:08:25.760]  Bill, tell us a little bit about yourself, I know you're called a 9-Eleven Truth, specifically
[3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:34.680]  white, you decided to take this on, and then let's get into the suit itself, because it
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:38.400]  is bringing out a lot of really powerful information.
[3:08:38.400 --> 3:08:47.520]  Well, I did 30 some years as a public defender, I retired as chief assistant in Contra Costa
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:55.600]  County a couple of years ago, and at that point I was pretty much like normal, average
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:09:04.400]  Americans, unbelieving, and I didn't have any particular suspicions about 9-Eleven,
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:13.600]  and a colleague of mine threw a book at me one day, and I started reading, and I was
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:19.440]  inspired by, at the time I was inspired by the enormity of the atrocity that had taken
[3:09:19.440 --> 3:09:25.520]  place, no matter who did it, but after you do the reading and you do the research and
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:36.600]  you learn about what went on, then you become inspired by the just stunning, you know, unbreathtaking,
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:43.760]  colossal sense of the nature of the crime itself and the overwhelming arrogance of the
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:48.880]  people who were engaged, and the most powerful people in the world, and their thought that
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:53.000]  they could get away, basically, with what they did.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:59.880]  Well, they think they can get away with stealing 8.5 trillion with the banker takeover, I mean
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:04.920]  arrogance, who would think they would write up memos saying we can torture children in
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:08.560]  front of their parents, and then being questioned about it and saying yes, the president has
[3:10:08.560 --> 3:10:11.840]  that power, but I'm sorry, I interrupt, go ahead.
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:17.920]  Well, so I'm inspired by the enormity of the crime, I'm inspired by their arrogance, and
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:24.560]  I'm inspired by the courage of April Gallup, and so I decided that nobody else is going
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:25.560]  to do it.
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:29.000]  I mean, you know, in a perfect world, for God's sake, there would have been some U.S.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:33.680]  attorney someplace who would have said, gee whiz, this is, you know, it smells a little
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:37.760]  funny to me, I think maybe we ought to look into it, and they would have sent out some
[3:10:37.760 --> 3:10:41.800]  investigators and, you know, you don't have to look that hard to find something to latch
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:45.920]  on to that leads you to another place and leads you to another place, and then you,
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:50.440]  you know, if you keep your eyes open and your ears open, you learn what's went on here.
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:54.560]  This is not hard, this is not really a close case.
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:58.100]  And so, you know, you would have thought there would have been somebody in the long
[3:10:58.100 --> 3:11:04.320]  those lines, some in law enforcement person in this country, a lawyer who would have taken
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:09.800]  on the job, but that didn't happen, so it's left to the private citizens.
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:17.280]  And, you know, there I am, and I've got a friend who is a veteran civil rights lawyer,
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:22.000]  Dennis Cunningham, and the two of us decided that this was something that had to be done,
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  so we did it.
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:28.160]  Okay, so Dennis Cunningham has signed his name onto this declaration against tyranny
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:33.880]  as well, you know, reading from the suit itself, by helping the attack succeed, defendants
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:39.600]  in their cohorts created a basis for the seizure of extraordinary power, a pretext for launching
[3:11:39.600 --> 3:11:44.720]  the so-called global war on terror, and the guys of which they were free to pursue plans
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:49.680]  for military conquest, full spectrum dominance, and American supremacy around the world, as
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:52.520]  they have done, reads the lawsuit.
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:58.280]  And so, are you going to motive everything, walk us through the basics of the suit and
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:12:01.760]  what her standing is, and where you think this will go, what courts it's going to be
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:02.760]  heard in?
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:09.680]  Yeah, well, you know, April was, she was hurt, it's as simple as that.
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:13.680]  You know, if you assault somebody, they have a cause of action against you.
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:18.080]  So that's, we're playing this on the simplest and most basic level.
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:23.880]  She was hurt by these people, and so she has standing to sue.
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:29.880]  The Congress of the United States decided very shortly after 9-11 with very little thought
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:35.480]  as far as I can see, that everything, every claim that there would be made, that would
[3:12:35.480 --> 3:12:42.240]  be made throughout the country, that had anything to do with 9-11, would have, the jurisdiction
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:46.400]  for that claim would be in the Southern District of New York, in the federal court.
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:50.360]  So that's where we filed the lawsuit.
[3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:56.120]  And we believe that, you know, it's going to be a hard fight here, because these guys
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:13:00.040]  got power, but pretty hard to really conceive of.
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:09.000]  But anyway, so we make the claim that there was a conspiracy, it included the, you know,
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:14.080]  the highest people in the government, the Cheney, Bumsfeld, Myers, and lots of other
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:20.680]  people too, that we did not name, we named them as John Doze, as you do in federal court.
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:25.640]  And we believe that they got together and decided that this was a moment that was required
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:31.080]  by American history, that a sleeping nation basically needed to be awakened from its torpor
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:36.200]  and made to understand the dangers of the 21st century and how, you know, we needed
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:44.160]  to project our power around the world so that, you know, we could run things as were required
[3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:48.720]  by, you know, those who know best, those who have the power in this country.
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:56.440]  So they left enough evidence behind that we could see what they had done.
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:14:03.880]  We don't know the precise mechanisms in many instances, but we don't have to.
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:04.880]  And so...
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:05.880]  That's right.
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:14.480]  We know the official story has been a disproven fairytale hoax of fraud, a sham, a giant cockamamie
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:18.960]  fraud, and this has to be done.
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:26.560]  Now specifically, did you guys file the suit right as Bush is leaving office hoping that
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.280]  during the transition, someone in the establishment might not be able to block or slow the suit
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:33.840]  down as fast as they might have been able to?
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:36.320]  No, if this is a matter of...
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:41.280]  It's taken us this long to get it together to the point where we thought we were comfortable
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:42.280]  to go ahead with it.
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:47.640]  It's an enormous amount of work, and we had a lot of research to do.
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:52.040]  There's, you know, an enormous amount of material has been written, and we had to get on top
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:57.600]  of as much of it as we could in order to have the lawsuit make sense and then make claims
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:01.360]  that we thought we could back up, and that's what we've done.
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:10.320]  And so, you know, we filed it when we got it ready, and as soon as we could do it, and
[3:15:10.320 --> 3:15:13.160]  there was no particular hope that...
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:16.400]  I don't think things seem to change that much, you know, with the new administration.
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:17.560]  No, I agree with you, man.
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  I was just saying...
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:23.440]  So, I mean, you know, people with different attitudes will be in positions where they
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:29.680]  could affect things, but those people have been a position to speak out along before
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:31.840]  this, and nothing's been said.
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:32.840]  So, I don't...
[3:15:32.840 --> 3:15:33.840]  No, no, I agree.
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:38.600]  I mean, if there was any questions about Obama, all of his appointments should leave,
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:43.600]  and his announcements should leave, no questions about where he is going.
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:44.600]  Well, I shagged.
[3:15:44.600 --> 3:15:46.200]  I would disagree with you there.
[3:15:46.200 --> 3:15:50.200]  I've got great hope, as a matter of fact, for him in many respects, but I think that
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:56.440]  this is simply an issue that is too big for anybody with that kind of access to speak
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:15:58.120]  on at this point.
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:02.920]  Maybe at some point or another, you know, it'll be put in a position where they will
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:03.920]  have to say something.
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:04.920]  That's kind of what we're doing.
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:08.680]  Well, listen, you're a smart guy, Mr. Veal, look, you've got...
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:10.200]  I mean, seriously, you've got over...
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:12.960]  I mean, you can figure out 9-11, you can figure this out.
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:17.040]  You've got Bush setting up the military to police the American people, and then Obama
[3:16:17.040 --> 3:16:21.960]  is cheerleading it, ready to get all this new power, and he's keeping Gates in.
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:24.880]  I mean, they are passing the baton.
[3:16:24.880 --> 3:16:28.800]  They are in unison, like it's an Olympic relay team here.
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:34.880]  Well, you know, I think, you know, your points are well-taken, and I'm a hopeful person.
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:41.040]  I feel I've filed this lawsuit because I'm a hopeful person, and I'm going to wait and
[3:16:41.040 --> 3:16:46.360]  let those people who have obtained power, disappoint me.
[3:16:46.360 --> 3:16:47.360]  Sure.
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:48.360]  How do you see them?
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:49.360]  How do you see them?
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:50.360]  What do I do?
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:51.360]  I'm going to maintain my hope.
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:52.360]  Sure.
[3:16:52.360 --> 3:16:53.360]  How do you see them coming at you?
[3:16:53.360 --> 3:16:54.360]  We're trying to block it.
[3:16:54.360 --> 3:16:55.360]  Oh, I don't think...
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:59.720]  You know, they've got, you know, these people don't have lawyers.
[3:16:59.720 --> 3:17:00.720]  They have law firms.
[3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:03.240]  It's going to be enormous, and they will kill you.
[3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:09.800]  I like how you go after them for covering up the attack, and that's one of the points
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:10.800]  in the suit.
[3:17:10.800 --> 3:17:12.360]  This is a very detailed suit.
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:13.360]  Please continue.
[3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:20.520]  Well, it's, you know, the important thing about this, well, I don't know, not the most
[3:17:20.520 --> 3:17:29.160]  important thing, but one of the reasons why we're in a position where we are is the cover-up
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:32.120]  basically was conceived before the crime was conceived.
[3:17:32.120 --> 3:17:33.120]  That's right.
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:38.720]  Now, everything had to be done with the thought that, okay, there is going to be, at some
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:42.560]  point or another, somebody looking in this direction, so we need to misdirect you at
[3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:43.560]  that point.
[3:17:43.560 --> 3:17:47.400]  And then they look and make you look over here, and then misdirect you at that point.
[3:17:47.400 --> 3:17:48.400]  Exactly.
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:50.280]  The cover-up is the evidence of the crime.
[3:17:50.280 --> 3:17:56.320]  I mean, I would say, you know, Admission A, or the piece of evidence being brought
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:18:01.000]  in A, is that two months before they changed the shoot-down power from the generals and
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:07.160]  admirals of their, or their designates to only Dick Cheney or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld,
[3:18:07.160 --> 3:18:14.320]  I mean, that was the first time since 57 they'd done that, or then, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:23.560]  Yeah, no, well, you know, if you look at the, some of the stuff that's come out, you know,
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:29.840]  and the investigation's been done by, you know, normal people, people who are not in
[3:18:29.840 --> 3:18:34.840]  the business of doing these kinds of investigations have produced enormous attacks.
[3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:45.240]  The pilots who managed to get the MTSB flight simulation data, the black box data, and it
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:50.520]  is, you know, conflicts on a very basic level with that produced by the 9-11 Commission.
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:18:55.680]  So we have these two entities of the United States government disagreeing with each other
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:19:02.680]  about where the airplane went, and the evidence that they gave us from the MTSB to the pilots,
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:08.160]  through the pilots for 9-11 Truth, shows that the airplane that was flying there was too
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:10.160]  high to hit the building.
[3:19:10.160 --> 3:19:11.160]  That's right.
[3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:14.760]  They're all kinds, and each place you look, there is...
[3:19:14.760 --> 3:19:18.240]  Now, the key here is there's many official stories.
[3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:23.320]  There's many official fables, and by doing this shoot, you're going to get that, or hopefully
[3:19:23.320 --> 3:19:24.320]  get that discovery.
[3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:27.600]  Well, that will be the point.
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:34.360]  We're going to be telling the judge that we have said enough here to say, okay, now we
[3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:40.720]  begin the lawsuit, now we begin the fact-finding process, and that gives us the peanut power.
[3:19:40.720 --> 3:19:44.920]  We get to say, okay, that's how these people come in, sit down, and we'll take their depositions
[3:19:44.920 --> 3:19:47.400]  and see what they have to say.
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:51.520]  You know, when Norman Manetta was testifying before the 9-11 Commission...
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:54.600]  Stay there, stay there, one more segment with us.
[3:19:54.600 --> 3:19:56.920]  Our guest is Attorney Bill Ville.
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:20:26.840]  A lot of courage to be doing what he's doing.
[3:20:26.840 --> 3:20:41.160]  Thank you.
[3:20:56.840 --> 3:20:59.160]  That's ionicszone.com today.

[3:21:29.760 --> 3:21:33.080]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[3:21:33.080 --> 3:21:36.440]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[3:21:36.440 --> 3:21:39.640]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[3:21:39.640 --> 3:21:42.560]  Midas has the Kennedy versus Fed document.

[3:22:00.360 --> 3:22:04.960]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:08.280]  I went to ground here and we knew what to do.
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:09.480]  At least we thought we did.
[3:22:09.480 --> 3:22:12.360]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[3:22:12.360 --> 3:22:16.520]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:22:16.520 --> 3:22:22.680]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:25.400]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:28.280]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:32.520]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:22:32.520 --> 3:22:35.720]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:22:35.720 --> 3:22:41.480]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:22:55.960 --> 3:23:00.320]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:23:00.320 --> 3:23:06.080]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:08.320]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:10.360]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[3:23:10.360 --> 3:23:14.480]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.

[3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:17.800]  Hey, I was just talking to Ted Anderson during the break.
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:20.960]  Did you know that Peter Schiff's father is Irwin Schiff?
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:24.880]  Well, I've interviewed many times.
[3:24:24.880 --> 3:24:31.040]  He's one of the few people in U.S. history to be imprisoned for writing a book.
[3:24:31.040 --> 3:24:33.400]  That's what he's in jail for right now.
[3:24:33.400 --> 3:24:36.240]  They told him like three or four years ago, they said, don't publish that anymore.
[3:24:36.240 --> 3:24:39.360]  He did and they put him in jail for a long time.
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:42.560]  Yeah, there's all sorts of dangerous things happening.
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:46.160]  Our guest will be with us until about 45 after then I'm going to hit some other news, recap
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:50.840]  it and take some of your phone calls for those of you that have been holding.
[3:24:50.840 --> 3:24:58.960]  I know a New Jersey cop who actually had architects and engineers founder Gage in the town has
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:00.200]  been holding for a while.
[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:04.720]  I apologize to those folks having to hold, but I have had all these guests on.
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:07.240]  This is a short segment and we've got one more with our guest.
[3:25:07.240 --> 3:25:09.920]  I want to finish up with Bill Veal.
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:14.120]  Yeah, let's go through the key points, I mean the bullet points.
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:19.400]  We wrote a story at prisonplanet.com titled, Career Army Officer, Susan Cheney Rumsfeld
[3:25:19.400 --> 3:25:23.760]  for 9-11 Complicity, but at the end of the article, we post your suit and everybody should
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:30.480]  go read this because it reads as a who's who of the evidence of an inside job and they're
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:37.360]  going to have a hard time rejecting this, but if they do, where do you go from there?
[3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:38.360]  Where do you go from there?
[3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:39.840]  After you lost to me?
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:41.640]  Well, you'd appeal it, right?
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:46.520]  Well, yeah, no, I mean, we expect frankly to be in the appellate courts.
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:56.920]  I mean, I'm sorry to have a kind of a negative view, but the history is that these people
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:03.120]  of power are able to manipulate things in such a way that they get to run out the string
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:07.080]  for as long as anybody can imagine in the appellate courts.
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:13.480]  And so I expect that they will find some argument that they can make that the judge will say,
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:20.080]  okay, well, I think that's right, and then we will have to appeal that judgment.
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:25.080]  And that's what we'll do, we'll take it wherever we have to take it.
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:31.800]  And each time a judge rules against us, it'll be an opportunity for the media in this country
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:35.680]  to see whether or not there's duplicity going on here, whether people being honest about
[3:26:35.680 --> 3:26:37.560]  themselves.
[3:26:37.560 --> 3:26:42.480]  And if the judge rules in a dishonest way, then yeah, that's a time for everybody to
[3:26:42.480 --> 3:26:46.080]  watch the unmasking that's going on.
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:50.640]  I think that our facts are unassailable, and we've got the law.
[3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:55.920]  I think that the judge is going to have a very hard time saying, oh no, this isn't a
[3:26:55.920 --> 3:26:56.920]  lawsuit.
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:00.280]  I think they're going to have a very hard time doing that, but if they do, we'll pursue
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:01.280]  them.
[3:27:01.280 --> 3:27:06.880]  Well, one area in your suit that I may have missed, it may be in there, but I didn't see
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:10.680]  it, is a predisposition or a history.
[3:27:10.680 --> 3:27:14.160]  They admit the USS Liberty was staged now, they admit the Gulf of Tonkin was staged,
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:20.320]  they admit Operation Ajax with Iran was staged, over 200 declassified, admitted examples of
[3:27:20.320 --> 3:27:26.080]  the US government staging terror attacks against its own installations or against friends
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:31.160]  who they then want to basically sick on their enemies.
[3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:35.400]  So in this long history of false flagged terror, don't you think that's an important piece
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:39.240]  of evidence that, hey, the people who are charging with this have done this over and
[3:27:39.240 --> 3:27:40.240]  over again?
[3:27:40.240 --> 3:27:42.040]  It's extremely important.
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:49.040]  It's not the kind of thing that we needed to put in the complaint because the history
[3:27:49.040 --> 3:27:54.080]  by itself is not going to be enough to get you over, but when the time comes for the
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:59.080]  trial, boy, the history is going to be really important there because what we have, one
[3:27:59.080 --> 3:28:05.920]  of the large problems that we have in this situation is there's been this fortress of
[3:28:05.920 --> 3:28:10.440]  denial erected by each of us, each human being.
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:13.320]  Fortress of denial, I'm going to steal that term.
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:20.520]  Well, and it's really, it's an enormous fortress, it's strong, and you can't really
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:26.760]  get there, you can't fight against it in a massive way, you have to kind of chip around.
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:33.960]  And one of the things that seems to me that's helpful trying to deceive that fortress is
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:41.320]  by alerting people to the fact of the false flag operation and its history, and our history
[3:28:41.320 --> 3:28:42.320]  with it.
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:48.080]  It's been their countless examples, not countless, but they are many examples, important examples
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:51.160]  of beginning wars with the false flag.
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:58.840]  And the idea that the United States is somehow, you know, is above that or something or different
[3:28:58.840 --> 3:29:04.680]  from other nations and wouldn't use that sort of strategy is just preposterous.
[3:29:04.680 --> 3:29:08.920]  And so the people of the United States need to think, oh, okay, well, wait a minute, what
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:11.280]  is about us?
[3:29:11.280 --> 3:29:16.960]  What is about our history in the last 70 years, just for example, that means that we are incapable
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:19.280]  of these things?
[3:29:19.280 --> 3:29:22.920]  And when you start to ask those questions, then the answer is there is nothing about
[3:29:22.920 --> 3:29:25.040]  us that makes us incapable of them.
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:29.080]  And then you have motive, and then you have the people running things, this is one of
[3:29:29.080 --> 3:29:30.080]  their favorite tools.
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:32.680]  I bet you're going to try to bring Northwoods into the trial.
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:34.320]  Well, I would think so.
[3:29:34.320 --> 3:29:40.960]  I mean, it's right there in black and white, Northwood, you know, but if you ask, you know,
[3:29:40.960 --> 3:29:44.320]  can you imagine, for example, the Soviet Union or Russia?
[3:29:44.320 --> 3:29:45.320]  Hold on.
[3:29:45.320 --> 3:29:46.320]  Stay there.
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:47.320]  Stay there.
[3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:48.320]  Final segment.
[3:29:48.320 --> 3:29:49.320]  Stay there, Bill.
[3:29:49.320 --> 3:29:50.640]  We'll be right back to you.
[3:29:50.640 --> 3:30:00.880]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:04.320]  Everyone knows that omega three should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[3:30:04.320 --> 3:30:08.160]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple, yet effective
[3:30:08.160 --> 3:30:10.000]  way to get your daily intake?
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:14.320]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer.
[3:30:14.320 --> 3:30:19.400]  Nature's Gem, premium omega three, unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:24.160]  our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours
[3:30:24.160 --> 3:30:28.120]  producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around.
[3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:33.240]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds by size and weight, keeping only
[3:30:33.240 --> 3:30:36.840]  the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega three.
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:40.120]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[3:30:40.120 --> 3:30:42.280]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.
[3:30:42.280 --> 3:30:45.800]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non GMO.

[3:30:59.120 --> 3:31:00.120]  Free shipping included.
[3:31:00.120 --> 3:31:05.840]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:31:05.840 --> 3:31:07.320]  against this country.
[3:31:07.320 --> 3:31:11.520]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:31:11.520 --> 3:31:12.520]  Bin Laden.
[3:31:12.520 --> 3:31:13.520]  This is his MO.
[3:31:13.520 --> 3:31:14.520]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:31:14.520 --> 3:31:16.520]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:21.320]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:23.920]  networks inside the United States.
[3:31:23.920 --> 3:31:28.360]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:31:28.360 --> 3:31:30.520]  in and on the U.S.
[3:31:30.520 --> 3:31:34.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:34.240 --> 3:31:39.680]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:31:39.680 --> 3:31:43.840]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:31:43.840 --> 3:31:44.840]  much more.
[3:31:44.840 --> 3:31:45.840]  Fabled Enemies.
[3:31:45.840 --> 3:31:50.840]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super-high quality, along with hundreds of
[3:31:50.840 --> 3:31:52.840]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:31:57.840 --> 3:32:01.840]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[3:32:01.840 --> 3:32:07.240]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when
[3:32:07.240 --> 3:32:09.960]  they should be finished stocking up on food.
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:14.160]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're
[3:32:14.160 --> 3:32:18.720]  desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually
[3:32:18.720 --> 3:32:20.200]  increasingly hot water.
[3:32:20.200 --> 3:32:21.520]  We'll snap out of it.
[3:32:21.520 --> 3:32:22.960]  We now have a deadline.
[3:32:22.960 --> 3:32:25.200]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[3:32:25.200 --> 3:32:29.840]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about
[3:32:29.840 --> 3:32:34.600]  January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:37.000]  make unpopular decisions.
[3:32:37.000 --> 3:32:41.240]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[3:32:41.240 --> 3:32:47.280]  prior to the inauguration. Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:48.280]  disaster.
[3:32:48.280 --> 3:32:52.760]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon, or too little too late?
[3:32:52.760 --> 3:33:19.240]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.

[3:34:31.940 --> 3:34:36.280]  Veith woke up, was someone to give him a book about 911 being an inside job, I was aware
[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:39.560]  of the history, that's why I was warning about the attacks in the World Trade Center
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:44.560]  because under the feds it bombed it unsuccessfully in 93, that's why I was on air saying call
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:47.960]  the White House, tell Bush, don't blow up the World Trade Center, two months before
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:51.920]  it happened, well really years before it happened I was saying they're going to stage
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:55.800]  large terror attacks but we could see the preparation for what was happening there.
[3:34:55.800 --> 3:34:59.960]  Bill before we finish up with you and hopefully you in April, back on in the near future as
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:05.200]  this unfolds, fire out your website or a PO box for anybody that wants to financially
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:10.840]  support with the suit against George Bush and Dick Cheney for carrying out or aiding
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:12.240]  in the crimes of 911.
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:19.760]  Well I can be contacted at the Center for 911 Justice at genemail.com and I'd be glad
[3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:26.200]  to have contact to discuss it or talk to anybody about how they can support us but if anybody
[3:35:26.200 --> 3:35:31.000]  wanted to send some money, I mean be honest to God this is going to be an enormous enterprise
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  and it's going to be carried out thanks to just normal citizens sending $5, $50, whatever
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:50.440]  they can do and the address is 2033 North Main Street, Walnut Creek, California, 94596.
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:55.160]  That's the address and we'll take anything that anybody can give us because this is going
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:56.160]  to be a fight.
[3:35:56.160 --> 3:36:04.160]  Give that address out one more time, yeah, 2033 North Main Street, Walnut Creek, California
[3:36:04.160 --> 3:36:05.160]  94596.
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:06.160]  All right.
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:14.880]  In fact, guys, if I give you that address again, can my TV crew get that up on screen?
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:23.600]  Give that address out one more time, okay, 2033 North Main Street, Walnut Creek, California
[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:27.360]  94596.
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:29.560]  Address those checks to who?
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:35.200]  Well just at the Center for 911 Justice.
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:36.600]  Say that again.
[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:38.840]  Center for 911 Justice.
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:42.880]  Center for 911 Justice in the websites, Center for 911 Justice at...
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:47.000]  Well there is no, we're lawyers and we're not, we haven't gotten this far as a website
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  yet.
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.160]  I understand, give your email out again.
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:53.760]  Email address is centerfor911justiceatgmail.com.
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:36:57.120]  All right, well people ask me for solutions all day.
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:03.520]  All I can do is have every courageous good group on that's fighting tyranny on 100 different
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:05.000]  subjects a week.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.600]  And this is one of the most important I can think of and I want to thank the Lesers for
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:11.160]  previously supporting you guys and for them doing it now and I hope that they will.
[3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:12.160]  We'll put that up on screen.
[3:37:12.160 --> 3:37:16.000]  We've only got about six, seven minutes left with you, sir, and I appreciate your time.
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  Recapping and then getting into more key areas of the case.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  I also interrupted you when you were getting up to the part of people can't believe our
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:26.080]  government would do this, though it just came out that they killed General Patton as we
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:31.880]  already knew, but now it's declassified because he wanted to get our troops out of a Soviet
[3:37:31.880 --> 3:37:34.640]  gulag that they'd taken from the Germans.
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:37.520]  So oh, you want to get 12,000 US troops away from the Soviets?
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:40.240]  Well, we'll, you know, US troops will just kill you.
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:44.520]  So I mean, people need to come to grips with the military mind, the mind of the elite we
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:45.520]  have.
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  Please continue.
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:50.640]  I just think if you turn it around a little bit and you say, all right, you talk to the
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:59.960]  normal citizen, do you think that the Soviet Union or Russia now is capable of, for example,
[3:37:59.960 --> 3:38:04.600]  bombing apartment buildings and claiming that it's Chechen rebels who are doing it?
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:07.000]  Do you think that they're capable of that?
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:10.200]  Most people would say, well, certainly those sorts of people do that kind of thing all
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:12.200]  the time.
[3:38:12.200 --> 3:38:18.600]  Now, what about the Japanese in 1931 at the Mukbin Bridge?
[3:38:18.600 --> 3:38:23.880]  Were they capable of massacring your own troops and then claiming it was the Chinese
[3:38:23.880 --> 3:38:24.880]  who did it?
[3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:26.760]  Well, oh, we'll say shortly.
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:30.720]  Certainly I think that's quite possible, those kind of people, other people, not the
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:31.720]  United States.
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:34.000]  Well, we'll think about it.
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:37.840]  What really does differentiate us from other countries?
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:42.440]  Why are we incapable of that kind of, look at the history and it turns out we've been
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:51.480]  using that technique plenty of times to start various things or if we didn't do it ourselves,
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:57.840]  we managed to implement a propaganda exercise, which in essence, according to somebody else
[3:38:57.840 --> 3:38:58.840]  had done.
[3:38:58.840 --> 3:39:03.680]  Yeah, one of their favorites, one of their favorites is to hire a proxy group to do it.
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:08.320]  And then how to frame Patsy's is also included in things like North Wedge.
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:12.800]  What are some of the other areas you're going into in the suit?
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:14.680]  And what is the suit seeking?
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:22.760]  Well, the suit will seek damages for pain and suffering and all that sort of thing, but
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:23.760]  punitive damages.
[3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:29.520]  This is going to be an opportunity if we get to trial, which I hope we will, for the American
[3:39:29.520 --> 3:39:35.320]  people literally to say, okay, what is the penalty for something like this?
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:42.160]  And then the only thing that you can do is put zeros up, but that's basically where we
[3:39:42.160 --> 3:39:43.160]  are.
[3:39:43.160 --> 3:39:47.960]  Since nobody in the justice system decided these people needed to be investigated on a
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:51.720]  criminal basis, it's been left to the civil law.
[3:39:51.720 --> 3:39:57.360]  And so we brought the suit and alleged that they've committed these crimes through a conspiracy.
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:39:59.720]  We're talking about Cheney, Rumsfeld and Myers.
[3:39:59.720 --> 3:40:04.320]  This is a common law conspiracy to cause death and great bodily harm, and certainly hurt
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:07.960]  her and her child, and a lot of other people killed some folks as well.
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:14.440]  Well, it's all right, but it's also a civil rights action for denial of civil rights.
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:21.120]  And it's also a claim that they have retaliated against her for opening her mouth about what
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:23.000]  she saw and what she knew.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:27.960]  And so these are various causes of action under the common law, and indeed, and under
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:34.320]  the Bivens case, which is the famous federal civil rights case, we've said you have denied
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:39.680]  her federal civil rights, and so therefore you deserve justice.
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:44.840]  She deserves justice, and you have to pay for her denial of those rights, the denial
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:45.840]  of her rights.
[3:40:45.840 --> 3:40:49.720]  So that's how you put it when the time comes.
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:56.280]  But we will be making the arguments in court, and the wonderful thing about this case, if
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:02.720]  there is anything wonderful about it, is the fact that it's across this enormous panoply
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:03.880]  of evidence.
[3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:07.360]  We have every single kind of evidence that exists.
[3:41:07.360 --> 3:41:08.360]  It's incredible.
[3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:12.600]  Well, people always say something this big, they would be caught doing it.
[3:41:12.600 --> 3:41:13.920]  They do get caught.
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:17.320]  It's just they've always controlled the mainstream media, so they keep that information from
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:18.320]  getting out of the public.
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:21.320]  Well, they control the media, and that's extremely important.
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:26.000]  Obviously, we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are today if it weren't for the complicity,
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:29.160]  either knowing or unwitting complicity of the media.
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:37.560]  I think the most stunning example of that, Jim Dwyer of the New York Times was the person
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:42.680]  who on behalf of the New York Times sued the state of New York and the city of New York
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:48.160]  to get the firefighters' stories from that day.
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:54.800]  And wrote in an email to me when we were having correspondence, saying there's nothing from
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:00.880]  a personal, there's no human evidence, there's no human testimony that supports the idea
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:03.920]  of controlled demolition, for example, of the Twin Towers or...
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:06.360]  And then all over the tapes, it's there.
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:13.760]  But what is the level of denial that can exist that allows a person who actually goes to
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:22.400]  the extent of filing a lawsuit gets them the 500 stories of the firefighters and the EMTs,
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:27.400]  which include a hundred and some examples of people talking about the explosions that
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:29.120]  went off in those buildings?
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:32.760]  How do you get to say that that doesn't exist?
[3:42:32.760 --> 3:42:39.840]  So I don't know, frankly, it's a fascinating subject to plumb the depths of the denial
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:45.120]  that goes on here and ask people the question whether or not they're actually acting honestly.
[3:42:45.120 --> 3:42:49.160]  Listen, listen, there are people in denial that the Federal Reserve is private.
[3:42:49.160 --> 3:42:54.680]  There are people in denial that they've stolen $8.5 trillion, and that's what we know of,
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:56.040]  the numbers growing.
[3:42:56.040 --> 3:42:57.040]  People are in denial.
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:04.160]  Neocons on the radio still say that WMDs were found in Iraq.
[3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:06.320]  So there is a religion of denial.
[3:43:06.320 --> 3:43:11.360]  Sir, I want to get you back up in the near future as this develops and as this unfolds
[3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:14.360]  and to get more into this landmark case.
[3:43:14.360 --> 3:43:18.200]  Bill, thank you so much for the time you've spent with us today.
[3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:19.600]  And sir, thank you for your work.
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:20.600]  I appreciate it.
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:21.600]  You bet.
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:25.920]  You know, in the new year or as this progresses, one last question specifically, I mean, I
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:27.320]  have the filings here.
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:29.000]  This is going into court where?
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  But in the Southern District of New York, the Federal Court in the Southern District
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  of New York.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  Okay.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  And how long until we get some answers on this?
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:40.000]  Okay.
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  Who knows?
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:43.600]  It's going to be months anyway.
[3:43:43.600 --> 3:43:44.600]  All right.
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:46.760]  Well, we'll watch this as it develops.
[3:43:46.760 --> 3:43:50.560]  Is April Gallup excited that you took her case and are doing this?
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:43:54.840]  Well, nobody's excited about this, but she's a courageous woman.
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:43:58.360]  It's just an inspiration, frankly, to know her.
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:43:59.360]  Well, I mean, I'm excited.
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:02.040]  I mean, when you almost fly off a cliff in a car, it's exciting.
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:03.040]  I mean, she...
[3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:05.280]  You make a good point, sir.
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:08.880]  I mean, if she fired up, though, that, I mean, you know, you guys have actually...
[3:44:08.880 --> 3:44:09.880]  Oh, she doesn't.
[3:44:09.880 --> 3:44:11.440]  She's a soldier and she wants this done.
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:12.440]  That's right.
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:13.440]  I mean, she's...
[3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:19.400]  I guess excited would be a word that you could use, but she's made the decision.
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:21.480]  We're going forward here and let's do it.
[3:44:21.480 --> 3:44:23.160]  I think the right word is she's committed.
[3:44:23.160 --> 3:44:25.000]  Oh, there's no doubt about that.
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:26.160]  There's no doubt about that.
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:28.680]  Well, we appreciate your commitment, Bill.
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:34.600]  I can't imagine how much work and time and energy and also the courage it takes a bill
[3:44:34.600 --> 3:44:38.680]  for you to do this and your colleague, the other lawyer that's involved, but our prayers
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:39.680]  go out to you.
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:40.680]  I'm cutting him.
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:41.680]  Yes.
[3:44:41.680 --> 3:44:42.680]  Thank you.
[3:44:42.680 --> 3:44:43.680]  Yes.
[3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:44.680]  I appreciate it.
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:45.680]  So, Viocindius.
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:46.680]  Okay.
[3:44:46.680 --> 3:44:47.680]  Thanks, sir.
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:48.680]  Take care.
[3:44:48.680 --> 3:44:49.680]  Good to talk to you.
[3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:50.680]  On a lighter note, I'm going to come back and take a few final calls in the last second,
[3:44:50.680 --> 3:44:53.200]  but on a lighter note, we have some really serious world news.
[3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:55.520]  World faces total financial meltdown.
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:45:01.880]  The bank head of the private bank in Spain, as to say, and we have the made-off guy stealing
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:05.920]  more than a hundred billion and saying he did it all alone.
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:07.760]  This is part of the course in Wall Street.
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:10.960]  How do we protect ourselves from the bankers in uncertain times?
[3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:40.920]  With our little leprechaun, Ted Anderson, and here is his theme song.
[3:45:40.920 --> 3:46:04.240]  Thank you.
[3:46:04.240 --> 3:46:23.920]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, and now the Swedish leprechaun.
[3:46:23.920 --> 3:46:28.640]  He's an exchange student from the Emerald Isle.
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:32.840]  The Swedish leprechaun, Ted Anderson, 30 years in the gold and silver business joins us.
[3:46:32.840 --> 3:46:36.280]  Ted, good to have you here popping in with us on the 22nd of December, 2008.
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:38.680]  Hey, it's a great day to be here, too, Alex.
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:46.040]  Of course, you know, the auto manufacturer, why can't I even say Toyota?
[3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:47.480]  Do you like your little intro song?
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:48.280]  Yeah, I like that.
[3:46:48.280 --> 3:46:48.840]  That's cute.
[3:46:48.840 --> 3:46:49.880]  I mean, I was laughing.
[3:46:49.880 --> 3:46:55.160]  That's why I can't think of Toyota, of course, posting billion-dollar losses first time since
[3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:58.840]  they've been in business, that they've had to post losses on their auto sales.
[3:46:58.840 --> 3:47:00.360]  I mean, the market has really turned around.
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:01.720]  I bet they want to know where to go, Ted.
[3:47:01.720 --> 3:47:06.760]  Yeah, well, you know, we just had Peter Schiff on talking about how people need gold and
[3:47:06.760 --> 3:47:09.080]  silver, and he's not a gold or silver broker.
[3:47:09.080 --> 3:47:14.920]  And, you know, talking about total depression, total collapse, I had Gerald Salente on.
[3:47:14.920 --> 3:47:20.120]  I mean, I've got bank heads, prime ministers saying this, people have to get out of dollars
[3:47:20.120 --> 3:47:21.720]  and they have to get out of them now.
[3:47:21.720 --> 3:47:28.200]  And the reason we've got you here today, Ted, is so people can protect themselves from
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:33.240]  Wall Street run by a bunch of Madoffs who will and have stolen your pension funds dry.
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:36.120]  People need to convert a large portion into silver or gold.
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:38.040]  They need to get a good place to physically hold it.
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:39.080]  Who do you trust?
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:42.440]  Trust yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, to physically hold it.
[3:47:42.440 --> 3:47:46.680]  And Ted bought gold a week and a half ago when it was $770.
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:48.440]  It's $850 something today.
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:49.400]  It's up today.
[3:47:49.960 --> 3:47:51.080]  Move now.
[3:47:51.080 --> 3:47:54.360]  Buy it at $770 because Ted bought it early.
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:57.080]  He's almost sold out of that new position.
[3:47:57.080 --> 3:48:02.040]  Remember when it was $700 and it was $820 and Ted was selling it from 700 levels?
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:05.480]  Now it's $770, you know, that he bought it at and it's $850.
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:07.640]  Don't wait again while it goes up and up and up.
[3:48:07.640 --> 3:48:09.320]  He uses it as a buying opportunity.
[3:48:09.320 --> 3:48:12.120]  Ted, tell people how they protect themselves from Madoff.
[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:13.080]  Well, here's the thing.
[3:48:13.080 --> 3:48:17.000]  I mean, they do, they should take gold and they should get it in their own physical position
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:18.840]  and their own physical possession.
[3:48:18.840 --> 3:48:22.200]  I mean, when it comes down to the point where if you're hungry, you don't want a picture of
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:22.760]  can of beans.
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:26.040]  You want the beans on the table and that's the same thing with the gold.
[3:48:26.040 --> 3:48:29.640]  When the economy fails, everything falls apart.
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:34.920]  You don't want to have your gold stored at some brokerage firm in New York City or wherever.
[3:48:34.920 --> 3:48:36.600]  You want it in your hands.
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:38.360]  And that's why I suggest that you look at it.
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:41.640]  Does a leprechaun have it in his hand or in a foreign bank?
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:43.880]  No, they don't have it in foreign banks, I'm sure.
[3:48:43.880 --> 3:48:45.160]  But I can tell you right now.
[3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:47.080]  He got the gold in his hand.
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:48.360]  Yeah, you better believe it.
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:54.200]  But if you want to protect yourself from the kind of economy that we're facing right now,
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:59.320]  you do not want to have your gold stored at some place or buy some shares or some stock,
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:00.040]  anything like that.
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:04.520]  You need to have it physically in your position and so in your possession.
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:09.480]  And right now, like you said, Alex, 203 for the Franks, that's the same price.
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:16.840]  That's the same price that I was offering them when gold was down there at the price of 770.
[3:49:16.840 --> 3:49:18.440]  So the gold prices have gone up.
[3:49:18.440 --> 3:49:19.720]  They're up again today.
[3:49:19.720 --> 3:49:25.080]  British sovereigns, like I said on those British sovereigns, I've been getting them out of Belgium
[3:49:25.080 --> 3:49:28.200]  and at first everything was circulated that I was getting.
[3:49:28.200 --> 3:49:29.800]  Now I'm getting brand new coins.
[3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:33.320]  They're obviously dipping into the reserves that are new.
[3:49:33.320 --> 3:49:36.200]  They want to get rid of their junk first and now they're getting rid of their good stuff.
[3:49:37.480 --> 3:49:38.280]  The British sovereigns...
[3:49:38.280 --> 3:49:39.880]  Not as if gold coins are junk.
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:42.200]  That's a term in industry for circulated.
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:48.680]  I've got up on prisonplanet.tv, minusresources.com with the number 800-686-2237.
[3:49:48.680 --> 3:49:51.880]  And now Ted, at that 770 price, you've got what?
[3:49:52.440 --> 3:49:56.040]  The British sovereigns, the Franks, the European Franks.
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:49:57.400]  Are those uncirculated as well?
[3:49:57.400 --> 3:49:57.560]  Yeah.
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:49:59.320]  Well, the European Franks are coming in.
[3:49:59.320 --> 3:50:01.560]  A lot of them are uncirculated, but the British sovereigns...
[3:50:01.560 --> 3:50:02.280]  So a super deal there.
[3:50:02.280 --> 3:50:03.960]  What else do you have at the 770 level?
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:05.880]  Well, that British sovereign at 252.
[3:50:05.880 --> 3:50:07.640]  I also have silver right now.
[3:50:07.640 --> 3:50:10.120]  The silver walking Liberty haves at 840.
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:13.800]  Now, mind you, silver is at $11 an ounce and it was at 9.
[3:50:13.800 --> 3:50:16.920]  That's a $2 increase and I still have the...
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:20.120]  And plus, there's a huge premium on all gold and silver out there.
[3:50:20.120 --> 3:50:23.000]  Instead of paying a premium to get it because everybody's buying it up,
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:26.840]  you're paying below what the market is because Ted buys when it's low
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:31.480]  and then is selling it right now while it's high and passing all those savings on to you.
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:37.560]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:39.080]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[3:50:39.080 --> 3:50:42.200]  Well, for sure till midnight and I'm watching the market too and I got to see
[3:50:42.200 --> 3:50:45.640]  how many people are going to be ordering, but I do order supply when the price is dip.
[3:50:45.640 --> 3:50:50.520]  And you know, just it doesn't take a rocket scientist to watch what's going on in this economy.
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:53.240]  But you are running out of the 770 position?
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:55.080]  You bet, that's starting to sell out.
[3:50:55.080 --> 3:50:57.000]  We sold an awful lot of it last week.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:58.360]  Hold on Ted, hold on, hold on.
[3:51:00.360 --> 3:51:03.800]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:51:03.800 --> 3:51:06.760]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:09.240]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:14.360]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:51:14.360 --> 3:51:18.360]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water
[3:51:18.360 --> 3:51:21.880]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron.
[3:51:21.880 --> 3:51:25.880]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:51:25.880 --> 3:51:29.800]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[3:51:29.800 --> 3:51:31.720]  or one year whichever comes first.
[3:51:31.720 --> 3:51:36.040]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:51:36.040 --> 3:51:37.960]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:38.920]  What about you?

[3:52:27.400 --> 3:52:31.480]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[3:52:31.480 --> 3:52:35.320]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:52:50.920 --> 3:52:53.560]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[3:52:53.560 --> 3:52:59.400]  Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:52:59.400 --> 3:53:00.760]  Are you one of the people who think,
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:03.640]  I have plenty of time, nothing's ever gonna happen bad to me?
[3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:07.160]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government
[3:53:07.160 --> 3:53:09.080]  will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[3:53:09.080 --> 3:53:11.960]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[3:53:11.960 --> 3:53:14.760]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist heard on this network.
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:18.040]  Survival Enterprises sells real food, canned for long-term storage.
[3:53:18.040 --> 3:53:21.880]  Beef, chicken, turkey, bacon, butter, cheese, eggs, freeze-dried fruits and vegetables,
[3:53:21.880 --> 3:53:25.560]  Mountain House freeze-dried meals, MREs, a full nutritional line,
[3:53:25.560 --> 3:53:27.800]  the British Birkfeld water filter and more.
[3:53:27.800 --> 3:53:30.840]  If you want to prepare now, go to beforeitstoolate.us.
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:35.640]  That's before itstoolate.us or call 1-800-753-1981.
[3:53:35.640 --> 3:53:38.440]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[3:53:38.440 --> 3:53:42.760]  Or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple in the corporate control flock.
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:46.360]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[3:53:46.360 --> 3:53:51.080]  And my useless landmines are not supposed to be destroyed with useless violence.
[3:53:51.320 --> 3:53:52.120]  Liege!
[3:53:52.120 --> 3:53:53.080]  Aaaaaaah!
[3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:54.520]  Liege!
[3:54:01.800 --> 3:54:05.000]  You know, there was a lot of stuff I meant to get to in the show, we ran out of time today.
[3:54:05.720 --> 3:54:09.960]  One of them was, I knew in California, they threw out most of the red light cameras,
[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:14.840]  because there wasn't a police officer riding the ticket, which is a citation
[3:54:14.840 --> 3:54:20.120]  that he has to swear to, instead it was Lockheed Martin in the case of San Diego, so it was
[3:54:20.120 --> 3:54:21.120]  thrown out.
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:25.280]  And in Texas, in most other states, you have to be registered as a private detective, if
[3:54:25.280 --> 3:54:29.760]  you're gathering data for the state, and there's a bunch of special licenses for that.
[3:54:29.760 --> 3:54:32.920]  In Texas, from Dallas to Austin, they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars with
[3:54:32.920 --> 3:54:34.880]  these illegal red light cameras.
[3:54:34.880 --> 3:54:42.040]  And when the Texas Supreme Court and others said, you can't do this anymore, this is illegal.
[3:54:42.040 --> 3:54:45.800]  Austin, of all the cities, said, we don't care if it breaks the law, we're keeping them
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:46.800]  all there.
[3:54:46.800 --> 3:54:51.080]  I mean, it's just, the government is out of control, and I want to take one final call,
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:54.040]  who's been holding the longest here in just a moment, John New Jersey, but before we do
[3:54:54.040 --> 3:54:58.120]  that, Ted Anderson, when everything's going to hell in a handbasket, and you can't trust
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:02.240]  the system, you need gold, you need silver, you need firearms, you need guts, you need
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:07.280]  God, and you need water filters, you need to be self-sufficient.
[3:55:07.280 --> 3:55:10.000]  That's a great deal on gold and silver, people aren't going to find a better deal.
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:14.760]  I can't explain to them that you buy gold, you have to 770 level, it's 850 plus right
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:18.440]  now, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of this deal.
[3:55:18.440 --> 3:55:21.000]  Don't they understand there's huge premiums everywhere else?
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.320]  Most places can't even get gold and silver, but you can.
[3:55:23.320 --> 3:55:27.040]  Well, that's the thing, I mean, the premiums are going up like crazy, and that's why I
[3:55:27.040 --> 3:55:28.960]  try to buy at the lower prices.
[3:55:28.960 --> 3:55:35.160]  When the gold and silver shoots up, it gives the customers, the listeners a break, a chance
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:37.320]  to buy at a better price.
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:42.400]  You know, yeah, if I go back in the marketplace and just try to repurchase what I'm offering
[3:55:42.400 --> 3:55:46.040]  for you today, you know, it's going to be $20, $30 higher coin.
[3:55:46.040 --> 3:55:51.040]  I mean, that's how much it's gone up, and it'll happen like that anyways, because with
[3:55:51.040 --> 3:55:56.880]  Toyota melting down and all of Detroit being shut down and-
[3:55:56.880 --> 3:55:59.720]  Yeah, bottom line, don't trust in the government.
[3:55:59.720 --> 3:56:02.800]  They want you dependent, do the opposite, and become independent.
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:07.680]  People say, well, why gold or silver, because that's one of the few real currencies.
[3:56:07.680 --> 3:56:10.440]  Gold and silver have been used for more than 6,000 years.
[3:56:10.440 --> 3:56:12.480]  It is the basis of society.
[3:56:12.480 --> 3:56:15.600]  It will always have intrinsic value, and it's portable.
[3:56:15.600 --> 3:56:16.600]  It's portable.
[3:56:16.600 --> 3:56:19.680]  You know, they can put a property tax on your land and take it away from you.
[3:56:19.680 --> 3:56:23.760]  They can kick you out of your house, and they can even confiscate gold, but it's hard to
[3:56:23.760 --> 3:56:24.760]  find.
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:29.280]  And so, bottom line, 800-686-2237, Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[3:56:29.280 --> 3:56:30.520]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:33.320]  You bet, and the Ruggers will hold this deal through tonight, correct?
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:35.120]  Right through tonight, right up into midnight.
[3:56:35.120 --> 3:56:38.160]  Okay, and they were there the other day, you said at 2 a.m. taking calls, right?
[3:56:38.160 --> 3:56:39.680]  2 a.m., they're still doing it at 2, yep.
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:44.560]  So if you see a relationship at 2 a.m., go ahead and try, 800-686-2237, 800-686-237,
[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:49.080]  and I told you on other deals, folks, this will go away.
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:51.600]  That's not some tactic I'm telling you, it's the truth.
[3:56:51.600 --> 3:56:52.600]  800-686-2237.
[3:56:52.600 --> 3:57:00.440]  Okay, last two minutes of the show, nice guy, John up in New Jersey, a New Jersey detective
[3:57:00.440 --> 3:57:01.440]  and a 9-11 first responder.
[3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:04.520]  I know he's had Richard Gage in to speak to his group and others.
[3:57:04.520 --> 3:57:05.520]  We appreciate him.
[3:57:05.520 --> 3:57:08.480]  He's been holding for about an hour, so I'm going to let him have a little bit of time
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:09.480]  here at the end.
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:10.480]  John, go ahead.
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:12.480]  Sorry, he'd be holding.
[3:57:12.480 --> 3:57:13.480]  Absolutely, Alex.
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:14.480]  I really appreciate it.
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:15.480]  We're almost out of time.
[3:57:15.480 --> 3:57:16.480]  Go ahead.
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:23.120]  Yeah, what I'm asking of you yourself and your audience, what I want to do is pretty
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:25.840]  much refuse to go to work anymore.
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:35.000]  I want to, that 9-11 was an inside job, I've solicited my superiors, my supervisors, I
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:37.880]  should say, and they refused to even address it.
[3:57:37.880 --> 3:57:42.600]  The blind sheet that was in General Square up in Jerry City, the storage, that's back
[3:57:42.600 --> 3:57:48.720]  in 1993, Mallory Avenue, that's where they stored most of the explosives.
[3:57:48.720 --> 3:57:53.480]  We have promised here, we have legal premise to further investigate this, and they simply
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:58.680]  won't address it, and I'm a 15-year guy, I have all the bells and whistles, I've got
[3:57:58.680 --> 3:58:00.680]  all the awards, I'm approachable.
[3:58:00.680 --> 3:58:02.240]  Hold on, let me do this.
[3:58:02.240 --> 3:58:06.120]  Let me have you on the show as a proper guest tomorrow, because we don't screen calls,
[3:58:06.120 --> 3:58:08.000]  so I didn't know what you were calling in about.
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:12.920]  I just recognized your name, and let me set you up for the show tomorrow, can we do that
[3:58:12.920 --> 3:58:13.920]  right now?
[3:58:13.920 --> 3:58:14.920]  Absolutely.
[3:58:14.920 --> 3:58:19.440]  Okay, give, I mean, I've got your full name, but give your number to John right now when
[3:58:19.440 --> 3:58:22.720]  the show ends, and then I'm going to call you up right now, okay?
[3:58:22.720 --> 3:58:23.720]  Right now.
[3:58:23.720 --> 3:58:25.720]  Okay, go ahead and get that, John.
[3:58:25.720 --> 3:58:26.720]  Thank you.
[3:58:26.720 --> 3:58:30.080]  I've still got a cold here, probably the cough.
[3:58:30.080 --> 3:58:36.200]  We broadcast starts now, one place, infowars.com, here in the Info War, and we had Peter Schiff
[3:58:36.200 --> 3:58:41.160]  on a bunch of other people today, it all starts on the screens info.
[3:58:41.160 --> 3:58:50.520]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:50.520 --> 3:58:55.720]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:58:55.720 --> 3:58:57.240]  against this country.
[3:58:57.240 --> 3:59:01.040]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:59:01.040 --> 3:59:02.040]  bin Laden.
[3:59:02.040 --> 3:59:03.040]  This is his MO.
[3:59:03.040 --> 3:59:06.400]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:59:06.400 --> 3:59:11.200]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:13.800]  networks inside the United States.
[3:59:13.800 --> 3:59:17.680]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[3:59:17.680 --> 3:59:20.440]  spying in and on the U.S.
[3:59:20.440 --> 3:59:24.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:59:24.160 --> 3:59:50.840]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, and the U.S.
