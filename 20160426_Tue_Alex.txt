[00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:12.512]  A lot of my friends are what I would quantify as average American citizens in my family.
[00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:21.561]  What do they do at a participatory level to either encourage or discourage things that they don't agree with?
[00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:41.647]  And I think it takes a little bit more savvy, if we're in the info war, it takes a little bit more savvy to know how to get into those systems in a way that we can leverage our own position, just like the social justice warriors do, but at the same time not resort to the kind of the scummy part of it all, which is sort of leading people astray.
[00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:41.807]  Look,
[00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:47.196]  When you use the word liberty, most people don't find that word sexy.
[00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:52.019]  You know, racist has a lot more ooh-ahh to it than libertarian.
[00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:59.285]  Libertarian sounds like you're stuck in the back of a truck with Ron Paul and he's talking to you about like, you know, policy papers and freedom.
[00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:01.807]  It doesn't sound very exciting to me, okay?
[00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:03.669]  You know, I tend to like the social argument.
[00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:19.831]  You have to start, this would be my argument, you have to start by identifying that the most powerful thing in the world right now are these technocratic systems that are in place, search engines, the way we connect on these social platforms.
[00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:28.804]  Governments have either encouraged these things to come along or quickly realized that they were the new arms of control.
[00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:34.148]  And so you have to ask yourself whether your participation in these systems is actually enslaving you.
[00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:45.336]  Then you have to drill down a little further and you have to want to ask questions about if what you're doing and participating in is truly as open as it seems.
[00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.196]  So if Twitter, for example, is full of people of a diversity of opinions, and you feel like, hey, it's capitalist.
[00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:54.558]  It's my idea versus yours.
[00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:55.298]  Who tweets more?
[00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:56.339]  Who gets more retweets?
[00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:58.401]  Who says the right incendiary thing?
[00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.543]  Who does the right mean?
[00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:00.303]  Great.
[00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:01.665]  That's America.
[00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:01.865]  Great.
[00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:05.968]  And I would only argue, you know, where do you cross the line?
[00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:06.989]  And you see it all the time.
[00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.851]  I mean, InfoWars puts up articles.
[00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:18.298]  As somebody who's in the world, and I have to watch what I say, when you see a page that's literally, and the page is, the Facebook page is, assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:21.880]  And I believe Facebook comes out and says, that doesn't violate our standards and practices.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.606]  Okay, that's where somebody like myself has to ask, is my participation in the Facebook system, and I would call it a system,
[00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:34.508]  Am I actually encouraging something which, as an American, I find offensive.
[00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:42.410]  And I also find it offensive that a business would support... You can call... I would have no problem with a page that said, Donald Trump's a racist.
[00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.631]  Donald Trump's a homophobe.
[00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.431]  Because that's just opinion.
[00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.932]  The minute you talk about killing someone... Sorry.
[00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:53.633]  That's where you need to step in as a business and say, I will not support that.
[00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:57.584]  So why is that okay?
[00:02:57.584 --> 00:03:03.285]  But you can imagine what page you could create on Facebook today, and there would be calls for you to never work here at InfoWars ever again.
[00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:04.185]  Right.
[00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:05.885]  That's where it gets funky.
[00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:16.528]  So you have to be sophisticated enough to look at those systems and say, is my participation encouraging something that I know deep down is intrinsically not only flawed, but counterintuitive to what I want to be part of?
[00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:20.569]  And in essence, your participation is condonement.
[00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.850]  Now, I run a business.
[00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.290]  I have a Facebook page.
[00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.631]  I need the Facebook page at this day to run my business.
[00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:27.972]  It's an effective system.
[00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:29.272]  I don't like everything.
[00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:33.774]  So that's just another piece of information that may ultimately push me off Facebook.
[00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:42.197]  And I'm willing to take the commercial and public hit of not having that reach that I have to the four million plus people that follow us on Facebook.
[00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:44.858]  Because at the end of the day, I as an American can't support that.
[00:03:45.578 --> 00:03:46.719]  So, does it bother me?
[00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.660]  Yes.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.182]  Do I have to have the argument in my head?
[00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:50.042]  Yes.
[00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:51.864]  To this point, I haven't made that decision.
[00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:55.047]  If you're not having that argument in your own head, then you're not participating.
[00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:58.971]  And then, to use Alex's term, you're just a drone who's just falling around.
[00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.792]  You're pretending you have no influence, and you do.
[00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:11.371]  And I think, too, it's really time for a lot of us who are libertarians and who are for freedom and who are concerned and who do... We're not kind of in the trance.
[00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:20.834]  We do see... We do need to start coming together and working and setting up our own systems to counteract their systems that they have.
[00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:22.754]  That's why we use the word empowerment.
[00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:26.435]  Empowering people with... Let's not call it the facts and the truth.
[00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.456]  The facts and truth are always kind of ephemeral.
[00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.116]  It's this eye of the beholder stuff.
[00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:37.321]  Empowering people to have a better range of decision-making as far as how they approach their social systems, I think that's powerful.
[00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:52.511]  Then if you take the extra step and you say, like, maybe InfoWars sets up its own version of social media so that like-minded businesses are able to participate in a system that is ultimately holistic to the ideas that you would believe in.
[00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.872]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:54.393]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.574]  This Tuesday edition is going to be absolutely jam-packed.
[00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:58.416]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.658 --> 00:05:09.104]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes less and less transparent.
[00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:14.308]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the conflict here.
[00:05:14.308 --> 00:05:20.452]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.581]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:26.303]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[00:05:26.303 --> 00:05:30.286]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.128]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7pm as we cover the primaries in the Northeast.
[00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:03.982]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:12.225]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:17.646]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:17.646 --> 00:06:20.187]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:20.187 --> 00:06:22.288]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:26.469]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:31.444]  Shower Filters.
[00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:33.165]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:06:33.165 --> 00:06:37.227]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:42.049]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:49.132]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:56.094]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax Shower Filter from ProPure today.
[00:07:00.296 --> 00:07:02.378]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:03.620]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.201]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:08.305]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:09.366]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:10.347]  I'd been working all day.
[00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.850]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.271]  I get in here at 8 30.
[00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.173]  I was kind of run down.
[00:07:16.173 --> 00:07:17.875]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:19.976]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:21.817]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:22.858]  I popped two of them.
[00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:27.040]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.601]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:29.942]  People really love it.
[00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:30.542]  Read about it.
[00:07:30.542 --> 00:07:34.364]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:07:34.364 --> 00:07:39.647]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:07:39.827 --> 00:07:43.868]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:50.010]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.932]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:18.012 --> 00:08:24.495]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:26.455]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:34.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today as we broadcast worldwide.
[00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:37.220]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.942]  It is Tuesday, the 26th day of April 2016.
[00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:48.647]  We have Leanne McAdoo who's going to be with us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:08:48.647 --> 00:09:05.503]  She interviewed a gentleman who was convinced to have his genitalia removed by a leftist psychological warfare operation and then realized later that he'd basically been inducted into a cult.
[00:09:06.237 --> 00:09:11.362]  And that's exactly what this is, a eugenics end of humanity cult on many fronts.
[00:09:11.362 --> 00:09:22.374]  I am not attacking people that make these decisions and think this is the right decision for them, but bullying children and young people into it is going on and that is well known.
[00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:28.260]  It is being pushed whole hog across the board and is part of the takedown of civilization.
[00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:33.674]  Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, will cover the news and the latest developments with us in the third hour.
[00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:45.624]  And David Knight will command and chair, honcho, run, anchor, host the fourth hour today in the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:53.149]  We'll be covering the big primary tonight, one of the most important so far, with live extended coverage kicking off at 7 p.m.
[00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:54.310]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.952]  There'll be free video feeds and more at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:58.612 --> 00:09:58.912]  Good news!
[00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:01.234]  There is the headline NBC News Trump Reaches 50% Support
[00:10:25.532 --> 00:10:28.695]  Nationally for the first time in a national poll.
[00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:29.755]  That's actually not true.
[00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.477]  I've seen it in other polls.
[00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:31.937]  Poll.
[00:10:31.937 --> 00:10:35.220]  Trump makes it to 50% nationally.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:40.364]  And in many polls, he is neck and neck or in a dead heat with Herr Hillary.
[00:10:40.364 --> 00:10:42.646]  Hitler-y.
[00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:44.567]  There's just too many fun puns with her name.
[00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:49.872]  There's some we can't say on air.
[00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:52.894]  But at the same time, he is also ahead of her in many polls.
[00:10:52.894 --> 00:10:54.475]  But the reason he will dominate her
[00:10:55.504 --> 00:11:17.791]  Is that numbers already showed double the number of black Americans crossing over, Reagan Democrats, blue collar Democrats, but also a lot of wealthy people, even Politico was reporting last week, who have been more liberal, who don't like unfair trade deals, and want to have a prosperous economy, a true free market economy, not a managed crony capitalist system.
[00:11:18.823 --> 00:11:21.704]  So very exciting numbers there.
[00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:26.645]  Polls predict huge primary victories for Trump tonight.
[00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:36.108]  Cruz-Kasich tag team gets rolling as Neocon's Blue Sky, a third party.
[00:11:36.108 --> 00:11:39.109]  They're the ones talking about third parties to derail things now.
[00:11:39.109 --> 00:11:42.330]  There's also reports that the anti-Trump alliance is self-destructing.
[00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.731]  We're going to be going over those reports as well.
[00:11:47.867 --> 00:11:54.949]  Carly Fiorina, who didn't do anything in Hewlett-Packard, but come in and basically downsize it and sell parts of it off.
[00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:57.510]  So I guess she's a poster child for corporate downsizing.
[00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.311]  That's not a success of the company.
[00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.612]  Is now being floated as a possible Ted Cruz VP pick.
[00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:07.533]  And for the life of me, I love James Woods.
[00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:09.974]  Great actor, great brain, great tweets.
[00:12:09.974 --> 00:12:12.715]  Why he likes her, I don't know.
[00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:16.736]  Other than the fact that some people say he's such a good actor, he may be
[00:12:18.254 --> 00:12:19.435]  Carly Finarina.
[00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:20.476]  They kind of look the same.
[00:12:20.476 --> 00:12:25.702]  I'm being sarcastic before the New York Times or Esquire or Vanity Fair runs with that.
[00:12:25.702 --> 00:12:27.664]  That's a joke.
[00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:28.946]  That's a joke.
[00:12:28.946 --> 00:12:33.330]  But I don't know why he supports her because maybe he knows her and she's a nice lady.
[00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.472]  She might be a nice lady.
[00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:39.157]  I just don't get why she's the person we're supposed to go for.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.262]  So we've got all of that there that we're going to be getting into.
[00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:58.368]  Also, we're going to be looking at how Obama's global warming plan cost poor Americans $44 billion just in the last eight years, seven and a half years, raised taxes by 166%.
[00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:05.111]  Very important article out of the Daily Caller that we're going to be going over today.
[00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:08.133]  Another report that's from InfoWars.com
[00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.435]  By Julie Fidler.
[00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:13.456]  Excellent article.
[00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:15.818]  A strange, sad story though.
[00:13:15.818 --> 00:13:22.604]  Birth defect is on the rise in the United States, says the CDC.
[00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:25.507]  Federally funded studies are aimed at documenting the cause.
[00:13:25.507 --> 00:13:28.549]  Well, there's all sorts of birth defects that are on the rise.
[00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:30.871]  In fact, everything's on the rise.
[00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:32.473]  Infant mortality is on the rise.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.382]  Infant cancer is exploding.
[00:13:37.382 --> 00:13:42.505]  Pediatric cancer is just meteoric in its rise.
[00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:44.165]  Breast cancer's off the chart.
[00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:47.888]  Type 1, Type 2 diabetes off the chart.
[00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.129]  Children go and they get their second or third round of shots.
[00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:55.957]  It gives boys autism because they don't have as good a blood-brain barrier as the girls.
[00:13:55.957 --> 00:13:56.877]  That's a medical fact.
[00:13:56.877 --> 00:14:01.460]  It's undisputed that female fetuses and babies are about twice as tough.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:08.945]  That's why almost all the survivors of abortion, where it's a six-month-old baby that's thrown in the trash can, there's scores of these people.
[00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:10.006]  They're all women.
[00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:11.936]  You see them testify to Congress.
[00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:13.157]  Survivors of abortion.
[00:14:13.157 --> 00:14:13.697]  You don't believe me?
[00:14:13.697 --> 00:14:15.397]  Just Google survivors of abortion.
[00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:16.118]  These are famous women.
[00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:16.818]  We've had some of them on.
[00:14:16.818 --> 00:14:17.878]  I'm going to get them back on.
[00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:19.939]  Black, white, Hispanic, you name it.
[00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:22.599]  I've never heard of a man surviving this because they just can't.
[00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:23.620]  There's not enough stuff.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:29.041]  The point is, is that women have a stronger blood-brain barrier.
[00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:30.442]  Men don't.
[00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:33.362]  And it just goes right through into the brain directly and fries it.
[00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:35.143]  But women have a higher incidence
[00:14:37.023 --> 00:14:40.966]  of their pancreas failing when they get pancreatitis.
[00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:54.718]  And when you read the different vaccines, like MMR and other flu inserts that we've read on air and shown you, it says pancreatitis and diabetes.
[00:14:54.718 --> 00:14:57.000]  Pancreatitis slash diabetes.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.444]  And I know three families in Austin that are friends of mine.
[00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.085]  Three families.
[00:15:04.718 --> 00:15:18.167]  That when they took their girls in, and two families, a boy and the other, and got them their second round of shots, at about a year old, and in the other case the girl was three and got shots, has a fever,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:28.243]  And then suddenly their system shuts down and they tell them, oh, you have type 1 diabetes, which means it's genetic.
[00:15:28.243 --> 00:15:35.606]  Well, yeah, it's genetic that if you smoke four packs of cigarettes and you're predisposed to lung cancer, you're going to get it pretty young.
[00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:44.409]  Whereas there's some old mountain men that don't have that, you know, pre-distribution that they're famously drinking a bottle of whiskey every day and smoking four packs of cigarettes and they're 100 years old.
[00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:47.307]  But you smoke them long enough, it's gonna kill you.
[00:15:47.307 --> 00:15:49.248]  The point is, it's gonna kill some people real quick.
[00:15:49.248 --> 00:16:02.054]  Like, I'm predisposed, on my mother's side of the family, with all a bunch of Taipei men, on both sides of her family, that executives, corporate chiefs, always successful, just all of them successful, right down the line.
[00:16:02.054 --> 00:16:03.835]  Gigantic heart attacks at 55.
[00:16:03.835 --> 00:16:05.855]  Just, the hearts blow.
[00:16:05.855 --> 00:16:06.756]  And so I better watch it.
[00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:11.584]  The clock is... And a lot of them exercise and stuff too.
[00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:18.049]  It's just your super type A personality, your heart's going... You know, a lot faster than the rate.
[00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:21.351]  Anyways, I digress.
[00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:24.454]  The point is, is that we're going to get into that article.
[00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:29.477]  A strange birth defect is on the rise in the United States, says the CDC.
[00:16:29.477 --> 00:16:33.881]  So we're going to be looking at all of this and more.
[00:16:35.396 --> 00:16:42.020]  But first, I cut a report last night for the Nightly News, and I didn't give them a very good headline.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.762]  I screwed up with a better headline than this.
[00:16:43.762 --> 00:16:49.906]  Alex Jones responds to Esquire hit piece.
[00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:50.926]  The headline should be changed.
[00:16:50.926 --> 00:17:02.334]  I want to post it on InfoWars.com, retweet it, Facebook it, and I want to change the YouTube to Esquire destroyed.
[00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:12.284]  Or, Esquire destroys itself in attempt to cover up for CIA.
[00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:15.605]  Or, Esquire caught trying to cover up for the CIA, discredited.
[00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:18.807]  Something like that.
[00:17:18.807 --> 00:17:21.149]  Because, it's not just Esquire.
[00:17:21.149 --> 00:17:22.209]  No exaggeration.
[00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.511]  I can't keep track of it all.
[00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:25.651]  New York Daily News.
[00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:27.773]  I'll show a document cam for TV viewers.
[00:17:27.773 --> 00:17:30.834]  New York Daily News.
[00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:31.275]  Gawker.
[00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:37.670]  Esquire, they led the way.
[00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.453]  And other publications, just scores of them yesterday.
[00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:43.657]  I looked last night, it was like 15.
[00:17:43.657 --> 00:17:45.418]  Meaning this was a directive.
[00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:49.002]  They chose to go with this just like Jade Helm.
[00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.085]  Last year, six months before they're gonna launch it.
[00:17:53.049 --> 00:17:56.190]  Joe Biggs walks in and says, you see this new army memo that's out?
[00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:04.392]  It's confirmed, it's on their site, where they list Texas as hostile in other areas, and they say they're going to invade and, you know, basically train to conquer the territory.
[00:18:04.392 --> 00:18:19.777]  We talked to our special forces forces, they said, no, indeed, it is multinational in that it can be used overseas, but the targeting is to condition the public, and this also has a use inside the U.S., which has admitted they've been getting the military ready for, quote, insurrection and all the rest of it.
[00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:28.587]  They had, no exaggeration, some days 3,000 newspapers, TV stations, and publications.
[00:18:28.587 --> 00:18:30.908]  I'd get the Google alerts.
[00:18:30.908 --> 00:18:33.210]  And they'd come in and it would say, you know, 3,600.
[00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.731]  The next day, 2,000.
[00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:36.673]  Every 24 hours it turns over.
[00:18:36.673 --> 00:18:40.075]  Tens of thousands of articles a week.
[00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:42.157]  Some cases for months on end.
[00:18:42.157 --> 00:18:44.038]  It'd go for a month and only have 20 a day.
[00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:46.540]  And then, you know, for a week it'd be a couple hundred a day.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.001]  And then it'd be a couple thousand a day.
[00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:49.443]  Sometimes three plus thousand a day.
[00:18:50.484 --> 00:18:59.148]  Saying, Alex Jones says there'll be martial law in July and August and that the army is coming to confiscate your guns.
[00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:00.729]  When all they're doing is a drill.
[00:19:00.729 --> 00:19:04.611]  That was public inoculation that I'm crazy and I'm a liar.
[00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:06.072]  And we came out and showed how they were doing it.
[00:19:06.072 --> 00:19:07.333]  And I said, now watch.
[00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:13.076]  When they don't attack in July and August, they will say I'm discredited.
[00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:14.296]  And that's what they did.
[00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:17.518]  And it didn't discredit us because people know that that's enemy media.
[00:19:18.613 --> 00:19:37.567]  And they also know and are fully aware of the fact, expanding on that, that there's constant deception going on and that we do have militarized police and more and more military on the streets.
[00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:42.110]  So that's just some of what we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.131]  And they've come out with this Beyonce.
[00:19:44.488 --> 00:19:46.189]  For the first time ever on this station, U.S.
[00:19:46.189 --> 00:19:48.591]  government gold offered at cost for only $139 each.
[00:19:48.591 --> 00:19:51.092]  With Wall Street suffering its worst start to a trading year in history,
[00:20:12.466 --> 00:20:15.809]  Now is especially the time to be paying attention to gold.
[00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:17.110]  This first-ever U.S.
[00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:23.374]  legal tender government gold offered at cost for only $139 each is from the U.S.
[00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:24.235]  Money Reserve.
[00:20:24.235 --> 00:20:27.478]  Call them at 1-866-944-GOLD.
[00:20:27.478 --> 00:20:30.140]  Gold is on the move, so don't miss out.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.482]  For the first time ever on this station, U.S.
[00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.183]  government gold offered at cost
[00:20:34.343 --> 00:20:34.703]  I think so.
[00:21:00.456 --> 00:21:03.498]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:21:03.498 --> 00:21:06.140]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:06.880]  Croix River.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.122]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:12.084]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:12.944]  His excuse?
[00:21:12.944 --> 00:21:14.285]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:15.906]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:21.650]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.711]  Don't wait.

[00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.276]  You've woke up to the deception.
[00:21:32.276 --> 00:21:35.777]  You understand how big government and corporations are controlling you.
[00:21:35.777 --> 00:21:36.477]  Guess what?
[00:21:36.477 --> 00:21:38.217]  The trail goes even deeper.

[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.362]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:22:04.362 --> 00:22:05.002]  It's true.
[00:22:05.002 --> 00:22:09.143]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:09.143 --> 00:22:11.544]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:22:11.544 --> 00:22:16.006]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:22:16.306 --> 00:22:29.193]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[00:24:08.024 --> 00:24:11.309]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:21.945]  Now last night I shot a report with a headline that Esquire had been caught with its pants down covering up the CIA and domestic media operations.
[00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:31.132]  But today, we can report that it's a globalist operation to try to discredit myself and others.
[00:24:31.132 --> 00:24:32.993]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:46.299]  It's known that hundreds of different federal agencies, there's hundreds of them, spend sometimes billions apiece a year, like the Department of Education, paying for what they call behavior placement.
[00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:57.247]  When a company like McDonald's pays to have their food eaten in a movie, or some beer maker like Coors Light pays to have somebody drink it in a movie, that's called product placement.
[00:24:57.247 --> 00:25:00.609]  The government calls it behavior placement.
[00:25:00.609 --> 00:25:05.192]  I call it propaganda placement.
[00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:08.254]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:25:08.254 --> 00:25:09.475]  And it's admitted that
[00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:21.704]  Rocky 3 and Rambo 3 are defeat the Russians, Cold War, and those scripts were approved by the CIA and the Pentagon.
[00:25:21.704 --> 00:25:23.205]  That's a historical admitted fact.
[00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:29.690]  I've seen Sylvester Stallone in interviews talk about how it was anti-Russian propaganda.
[00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.991]  I'm not defending the Russians either.
[00:25:30.991 --> 00:25:37.977]  The point is, they think we're so childlike that they have
[00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:45.783]  The very media hooked in to culture control.
[00:25:45.783 --> 00:25:54.488]  I mean, Esquire, New York Daily News, they have long histories on record working with the government to control perspectives.
[00:25:54.488 --> 00:25:58.070]  Gawker, you name it.
[00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:04.253]  But what's crazy is they legalized three years ago deceiving the American people.
[00:26:04.253 --> 00:26:10.297]  You can pull up the Washington Post, you can pull up Foreign Affairs, we can put some of those on screen, just type in
[00:26:11.775 --> 00:26:24.679]  Congress legalizes CIA operating domestically with propaganda, and you'll get all the articles, and in the video they're attacking, I show those articles.
[00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:24.839]  U.S.
[00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:30.140]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans, including lying, deception.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.181]  That's in the law change.
[00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:36.662]  Now, this has been going on for a while, but here's a new one today.
[00:26:38.183 --> 00:26:43.169]  The State Department has come out now that they're putting publicly thousands of U.S.
[00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:49.296]  troops, it's hundreds a week they're adding, into Syria to quote battle ISIS.
[00:26:49.296 --> 00:26:57.305]  No they're not, they're trying to battle groups within the coalition of Saudi Arabian terrorists and others that aren't following orders.
[00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:05.031]  And we have the State Department saying it is a total conspiracy theory and a lie.
[00:27:05.031 --> 00:27:11.114]  Obama and the administration never said no boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:27:12.602 --> 00:27:16.323]  They said over and over again, we promise just an air war, no boots on the ground.
[00:27:16.323 --> 00:27:18.524]  They've been saying that for four years.
[00:27:18.524 --> 00:27:24.885]  We can pull up the Obama clips, we can pull up the White House press secretary clips, we can pull up the news clips.
[00:27:24.885 --> 00:27:29.726]  USA Today, 16 times Obama said there would be no boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:27:29.726 --> 00:27:34.448]  We have 16 times, four of them in press conferences.
[00:27:34.448 --> 00:27:37.789]  Do I need to go get the video clips and play them?
[00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:39.069]  And then show the State Department?
[00:27:40.595 --> 00:27:41.416]  I guess we will.
[00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:43.297]  Go ahead and get the Obama clips.
[00:27:43.297 --> 00:27:51.984]  I'm not just going to show you yesterday, I'm going to show the clip, and then I'm going to show him, and I'm going to show the State Department saying they never said it three years later.
[00:27:51.984 --> 00:28:03.353]  And this is what Esquire, and the New York Daily News, and Gawker, and I'm told CNN's done a piece, and MSNBC, my phone was ringing this morning about it, Alex Jones claims Beyonce's working with the CIA!
[00:28:03.353 --> 00:28:04.073]  Ho ho ho!
[00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:14.857]  Well, Robert David Steele, on record, actually, field commander, CIA, you name it.
[00:28:14.857 --> 00:28:25.820]  And not just some analyst like Buck Sexton, where all these Ivy League and rich people have their kids be CIA like they're supermen, they can barely touch their toes.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.901]  They have Bob Big Boy haircuts.
[00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:28.881]  I'm like, I'm CIA!
[00:28:28.881 --> 00:28:29.641]  I'm CIA!
[00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.522]  I'm giving you a break.
[00:28:33.976 --> 00:28:38.758]  You guys couldn't break anybody's neck or slap these throats or bust out these skulls.
[00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:41.039]  You sure couldn't infiltrate anything.
[00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:42.999]  Couldn't fight you out of a wet paper bag!
[00:28:42.999 --> 00:28:44.900]  You're pathetic anti-American filth!
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.960]  Excuse me.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.481]  Gosh, you're a collaborating scum.
[00:28:47.481 --> 00:28:49.181]  Give yourself a little title.
[00:28:49.181 --> 00:28:51.302]  I like your little plastic card in your wallet.
[00:28:51.302 --> 00:28:52.323]  I'm so scared.
[00:28:52.323 --> 00:28:53.963]  Anyways, I digress.
[00:28:53.963 --> 00:28:56.804]  He wants to come on, definitely to break down.
[00:28:56.804 --> 00:28:58.285]  Yes, it's all CIA.
[00:28:58.285 --> 00:29:01.306]  And Cynthia McKinney, the former Congresswoman who they demonized because they're so scared of her.
[00:29:02.008 --> 00:29:12.976]  You'll hear the real lady on this saying absolutely it's meant to cause race war and to stereotype blacks as racist and dangerous and out of control for an attack on black people.
[00:29:12.976 --> 00:29:14.117]  Exactly what I said.
[00:29:14.117 --> 00:29:20.061]  She's got PhDs in media and PhDs in how they manipulate stuff.
[00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:21.141]  She's a smart lady.
[00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:24.444]  She's coming on to agree with me, but isn't agreeing with me.
[00:29:25.865 --> 00:29:27.846]  There is a drone program.
[00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:31.467]  I don't care if Gibbs told us it didn't exist.
[00:29:31.467 --> 00:29:35.289]  There is a ground war going on with our troops in Syria.
[00:29:35.289 --> 00:29:37.050]  Obama lied, he did say it.
[00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.411]  He also said Obamacare would be free.
[00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:39.711]  It isn't.
[00:29:40.563 --> 00:29:41.384]  Okay?
[00:29:41.384 --> 00:29:42.685]  He said there wasn't any penalties.
[00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:44.207]  There are.
[00:29:44.207 --> 00:29:47.531]  And 2 plus 2 does equal 4, Esquire.
[00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:48.952]  Yes, it does!
[00:29:48.952 --> 00:29:50.234]  Yes, it does!
[00:29:50.234 --> 00:29:53.737]  And the CIA is operating domestically!
[00:29:53.737 --> 00:29:55.740]  You filthy filth!
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.403]  You lying, collaborating idiots!
[00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:09.191]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes less and less transparent.
[00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:14.874]  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the conflict here.
[00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:20.517]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:22.666]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:30:22.666 --> 00:30:26.388]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[00:30:26.388 --> 00:30:30.351]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:59.241]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7pm as we cover the primaries in the Northeast.
[00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:08.918]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:31:08.918 --> 00:31:10.138]  A 360 win.
[00:31:10.138 --> 00:31:16.680]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at Infowarshore.com.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.362]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:24.624]  Because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:31:24.624 --> 00:31:29.286]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:31:29.286 --> 00:31:35.789]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:43.593]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:31:43.593 --> 00:31:50.036]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:31:50.276 --> 00:31:51.756]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:54.197]  Win, win, win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:54.197 --> 00:31:56.178]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:31:56.178 --> 00:32:00.559]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:01.219]  Uh, yeah.
[00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:07.041]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:07.981]  I use them all.
[00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:08.982]  They're phenomenal.
[00:32:08.982 --> 00:32:09.722]  They work.
[00:32:09.722 --> 00:32:10.562]  Buy them, folks.
[00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:11.102]  Thank you, brother.
[00:32:11.102 --> 00:32:12.923]  I want to thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:32:13.283 --> 00:32:19.808]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:32:19.808 --> 00:32:21.169]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:27.034]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:32:27.034 --> 00:32:27.755]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:32:27.755 --> 00:32:31.658]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, COSQO FX, nascent iodine.
[00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:32.438]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:32:32.438 --> 00:32:33.319]  Have they worked for you?
[00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:36.321]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:37.402]  What products are you taking?
[00:32:37.402 --> 00:32:45.689]  Everything from Supermail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:32:45.689 --> 00:32:49.333]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:54.377]  Visit InfoWarsLives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:32:54.377 --> 00:32:56.419]  That's InfoWarsLives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:16.768 --> 00:33:19.922]  You're receiving this transmission.
[00:33:19.922 --> 00:33:21.248]  You are the resistance.
[00:33:21.248 --> 00:33:21.469]  Live!
[00:33:22.882 --> 00:33:27.924]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:32.006]  That's right, if you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance that's in the game.
[00:33:32.006 --> 00:33:41.450]  We've been captured by offshore megamanks who have an ideology of dehumanization and dumbing you down in preparation for a mass forced killing.
[00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:48.913]  It'll be the ultimate final war against humanity carried out by the psychopaths and their AI collaborators.
[00:33:48.913 --> 00:33:50.134]  We are the human resistance.
[00:33:51.405 --> 00:33:54.947]  Shaping the future battle space now.
[00:33:54.947 --> 00:34:00.469]  Get ready for the cancer rates, all the other neurological disorders that explode, the mystery illnesses, the birth defects.
[00:34:00.469 --> 00:34:02.490]  You are under enemy attack.
[00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.431]  The sooner you wake up to that, the sooner we turn this around.
[00:34:05.431 --> 00:34:07.852]  Keep playing games, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:34:07.852 --> 00:34:10.593]  You're living in a science fiction movie.
[00:34:10.593 --> 00:34:12.614]  Globalists are coming for everybody.
[00:34:12.614 --> 00:34:14.775]  By the way, Chuck Norris has a big article
[00:34:15.672 --> 00:34:18.413]  That he's come out with called Sky Criminals.
[00:34:18.413 --> 00:34:20.053]  That is huge.
[00:34:20.053 --> 00:34:21.854]  Absolutely huge.
[00:34:21.854 --> 00:34:25.035]  And we have an article about it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:25.035 --> 00:34:33.698]  He talks about country legend Merle Haggard being worried about condensation trails being filled with chemicals and barium, salts, alum, dioxides, and how Prince was worried about it.
[00:34:33.698 --> 00:34:35.978]  Obviously, Chuck is a daily listener of the show.
[00:34:35.978 --> 00:34:37.739]  I want to say hi to Chuck Norris out there.
[00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.000]  He's been on the show before, but he's kind of semi-retired.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.920]  He shouldn't be at 77.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.401]  But his son's a frequent guest as well.
[00:34:44.998 --> 00:34:47.580]  And obviously this pushed him over the edge.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:53.564]  He's come out against GMO as well and against Monsanto, the Super Patriot.
[00:34:53.564 --> 00:34:55.806]  And now he's come out and taken on Chemtrails.
[00:34:55.806 --> 00:35:00.229]  So no matter what the establishment does, the truth will out.
[00:35:00.229 --> 00:35:01.170]  And it is coming out.
[00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.271]  Our story is Chuck Norris takes on Chemtrails.
[00:35:03.271 --> 00:35:08.375]  Martial arts legend accuses sky criminals of waging secret war on the public.
[00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:10.977]  So can't stop the signal.
[00:35:10.977 --> 00:35:12.578]  If you're watching this transmission or listening,
[00:35:14.192 --> 00:35:17.354]  We're on the same side now as Chuck Norris, so.
[00:35:17.354 --> 00:35:19.556]  And this isn't a movie with Chuck Norris.
[00:35:19.556 --> 00:35:21.937]  This is the real world, folks, so welcome.
[00:35:21.937 --> 00:35:23.478]  Welcome to the fight against the globalists.
[00:35:23.478 --> 00:35:28.501]  It's kind of like spies like us when they get down in the bunker and they say, welcome to WOMP.
[00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:33.385]  I gotta tell you, but we're actually going after the folks who try to run a false flag like WOMP.
[00:35:33.385 --> 00:35:35.026]  You know, that was your brother's favorite movie.
[00:35:35.606 --> 00:35:36.787]  Gentlemen have a Pepsi.
[00:35:36.787 --> 00:35:38.407]  Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?
[00:35:38.407 --> 00:35:45.811]  We've got Buckley Stratton Hammond, and no, that's not the name of a brokerage firm, in the Wolf of Wall Street, that's his real name.
[00:35:45.811 --> 00:36:00.537]  And he's here, helped me start InfoWars, really 22 years ago, but 21 years ago, getting on air, and then he's had a hiatus for 12 years up in Chicago, and he's been down there with us for a few years, doing a great job helping us get updated and retrofitted.
[00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:04.839]  And he was talking to me during the break about this whole Beyonce thing, and I said, well look, we're just gonna make Mr. Slick
[00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:06.640]  He didn't know he was coming on today.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.821]  He's always dressed like this.
[00:36:07.821 --> 00:36:09.482]  This is not an Austin Slacker, thank God.
[00:36:09.482 --> 00:36:10.763]  No.
[00:36:10.763 --> 00:36:12.004]  Oh, please help me.
[00:36:12.004 --> 00:36:16.207]  Anyway, these are not Austinites that want to run around and be lazy all day, I've got to tell you.
[00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.127]  They're not Texans either.
[00:36:17.127 --> 00:36:27.494]  They're a bunch of losers from failed Democrat-held states coming here to suck our blood vampirically and then hopping around trying to turn this environment into their previous environment.
[00:36:27.494 --> 00:36:28.996]  It's like pooping in the pool.
[00:36:28.996 --> 00:36:32.338]  But listen, I digress.
[00:36:32.338 --> 00:36:33.719]  We were talking about this Beyonce thing.
[00:36:35.523 --> 00:36:37.404]  This is definitely a government op.
[00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:48.052]  That's why it's one article comes out in a flagship publication like Esquire, then dozens of other establishments all fire at once, and then by tomorrow it'll be hundreds, and then maybe even thousands.
[00:36:48.052 --> 00:36:50.914]  And we've been contacted by Mr. Steele, formerly the CIA.
[00:36:50.914 --> 00:36:54.196]  He wants to come on, talk about the CIA and the media.
[00:36:54.196 --> 00:36:55.938]  And he's a guy that's done false flags himself.
[00:36:55.938 --> 00:37:01.401]  And Cynthia McKinney, the former Congresswoman, she's basically done her treatise on media manipulation, and they're trying to cause race war.
[00:37:02.298 --> 00:37:03.138]  Well, she agrees.
[00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:14.244]  Showing Beyonce, misrepresenting Black Panthers, uh, like they're the new Black Panther Party, race war stuff, anti-police stuff, bashing out the windows, a war against men and women.
[00:37:14.244 --> 00:37:17.806]  This is admittedly the purview of the CIA.
[00:37:17.806 --> 00:37:22.008]  The NFL, everything you see on there is basically government paid for.
[00:37:22.008 --> 00:37:23.289]  Okay?
[00:37:23.289 --> 00:37:28.131]  I mean, not just the hundreds of millions a year for the quote, you know, pro-military stuff to get you to join the military.
[00:37:28.131 --> 00:37:31.753]  The point is it's controlled and they have declassified
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.043]  Almost all of this.
[00:37:36.043 --> 00:37:41.007]  So what's frustrating to me is, again, you can pull it up, the headlines, U.S.
[00:37:41.007 --> 00:37:45.651]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans, including deception.
[00:37:45.651 --> 00:37:53.499]  And on that note, an interesting thing to me is that obviously we've been doing this long enough to just see the patterns as they happen and emerge.
[00:37:53.499 --> 00:37:54.580]  It's almost, you know,
[00:37:55.767 --> 00:37:57.528]  The Globos are on a big operation.
[00:37:57.528 --> 00:37:58.568]  This stuff is shake and bake.
[00:37:58.568 --> 00:37:59.289]  It's formulaic.
[00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:00.269]  It's got an M.O.
[00:38:00.269 --> 00:38:09.213]  So obviously when you did that Facebook mentions you touched a nerve because it is just sort of spiraled off into this and it's bloomed, interestingly enough.
[00:38:09.213 --> 00:38:11.414]  Well let me tell you the nerves since you bring that up because I meant to cover that.
[00:38:12.614 --> 00:38:20.980]  They have got a battle plan to take real things I say and then misrepresent it in the CIA, domestic media, military operations, domestically.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:28.526]  They now basically seize on any big rollout we do exposing something and then just say it isn't true and then misrepresent what we say.
[00:38:29.286 --> 00:38:37.028]  To then try to again inoculate the public to when they do hear the CIA is running the media, well it's okay because you know the kooks said it was bad.
[00:38:37.028 --> 00:38:38.569]  That's all they're doing is preparing people.
[00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:43.530]  Absolutely and that I mean that feeds into this canard that a lot of people say that you're controlled opposition.
[00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:52.493]  Because you'll come out and you'll say something very pointedly very true and you will give evidence and you will show how it's been propagated throughout history and how it's been done very specifically.
[00:38:52.893 --> 00:38:54.374]  And then they do exactly what you said.
[00:38:54.374 --> 00:39:00.777]  They'll take one or two weird little sentences that you say out of context, amplify it, and then publish that out into the world.
[00:39:00.777 --> 00:39:03.178]  And then you have all these people who are like, oh, see?
[00:39:03.178 --> 00:39:04.699]  Alex Jones, he's working with them.
[00:39:04.699 --> 00:39:05.840]  He's controlled opposition.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.321]  He's saying almost the truth, but not quite.
[00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:09.601]  And then they amplify that.
[00:39:09.601 --> 00:39:13.884]  And so that's the irony of all the people that say that you're controlled opposition, I think.
[00:39:14.984 --> 00:39:19.887]  That don't really dig into the minutiae of it and really pay attention and see where all the dots connect.
[00:39:19.887 --> 00:39:22.089]  So, that's just one take of that.
[00:39:22.089 --> 00:39:22.369]  Sure.
[00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:24.230]  Well, that's also another form of divide and conquer.
[00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:44.464]  It's a fake intellectual crutch to just have opposition to tyranny, never get organized or fight back, because they're always too busy sitting back as purists, saying everyone's a government op, but never covering the real FEMA camps, never covering the real cancer viruses and the vaccines, or the polio vaccine recalled two weeks ago, giving kids across the world cancer.
[00:39:45.184 --> 00:39:46.005]  No, no, no, no.
[00:39:46.005 --> 00:39:50.570]  Don't actually save people or move to get fluoride out of the water that's now happening all over the world.
[00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:57.317]  Don't actually have victories or, you know, get glyphosate listed as a carcinogen now being removed everywhere.
[00:39:57.317 --> 00:39:58.979]  Don't actually have victories.
[00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:00.340]  Don't actually go out and expose.
[00:40:01.545 --> 00:40:05.746]  That they're trying to steal the election and then have opposition to it and win.
[00:40:05.746 --> 00:40:10.128]  No, no, just roll around and just be defeatist losers.
[00:40:10.128 --> 00:40:20.871]  Because there is a paradigm to exposing tyranny that there are kind of the victim mentality people who would buy into the whole Democrat cosmology as well that the man did something to them so they can't be successful.
[00:40:20.871 --> 00:40:21.491]  Well, so what?
[00:40:21.491 --> 00:40:22.372]  The man did something to you.
[00:40:22.372 --> 00:40:23.932]  Let's go around that overlap.
[00:40:23.932 --> 00:40:26.893]  You know, let's find people that want to work with us to build our own paradigm.
[00:40:27.333 --> 00:40:34.040]  So there's also a loser segment that gets into conspiracy and then kind of makes their own reality.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:42.047]  What you're getting in InfoWars, ladies and gentlemen, I don't mean to go off into us, is historical research with a red-blooded Americana
[00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:46.173]  aspect to it, doing our very, very best.
[00:40:46.173 --> 00:40:47.413]  The tally lights have changed now.
[00:40:47.413 --> 00:40:48.354]  Or is it this camera?
[00:40:48.354 --> 00:40:49.255]  Okay, there.
[00:40:49.255 --> 00:40:50.775]  I can't tell which camera it is anymore.
[00:40:50.775 --> 00:40:51.416]  No, is it that one?
[00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:52.716]  No, no, that's camera two.
[00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.898]  And that's camera one, but it wasn't lit up anymore.
[00:40:54.898 --> 00:40:56.859]  It's driving me crazy sometimes.
[00:40:56.859 --> 00:41:02.302]  I thought it's red when the light's on, but now the right... It's confusing, because it usually is.
[00:41:02.302 --> 00:41:04.723]  The point is, it's a radio show, folks.
[00:41:04.723 --> 00:41:05.764]  If you tuned in, we're also TV.
[00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:09.086]  You can find it easiest at fullwords.com forward slash show.
[00:41:09.086 --> 00:41:10.467]  But, Buckley, I want to get into Beyoncé with you.
[00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:19.938]  Regardless, let's just say I'm a horrible government operative, I'm the worst person, I'm a vampire, I drink blood, I'm a bad guy.
[00:41:19.938 --> 00:41:25.419]  What are you going to do out there to take on the new world order?
[00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:31.100]  How are you going to try to affect change and respond to the globalists?
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.701]  Or are you just deciding you don't have any power?
[00:41:32.701 --> 00:41:38.622]  Well no, our listeners aren't the trolls, they aren't the minions, they aren't the loser types, they aren't the people that have, you know,
[00:41:39.844 --> 00:41:45.048]  You know, you have different psychological problems, so they want to have a cosmology of failure.
[00:41:45.048 --> 00:42:04.101]  We have a cosmology and a system of winning, and of dominating the globalists, and of exposing them and bringing back a renaissance economy based on free will, free association, and free market, and real choice, and true liberalism, and going to the moon, Mars, and Elvis and Turis, and empowering humanity and bringing us together.
[00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:08.605]  And if you want to say you're a dog, or a woman if you're a man, or an Easter Bunny, that's your issue.
[00:42:08.605 --> 00:42:13.569]  You're just not going to make us accept that in a form of cultural dominance wound up by the CIA.
[00:42:13.569 --> 00:42:24.197]  So since the government's scared of this, and since the criminals are scared, I'm going to get the church hearings, I'm going to get the videos and all the articles of CBS News, admitting most of the newspapers are run by the CIA.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.940]  Operation Mockingbird.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:36.162]  I'm going to get thousands of articles together, thousands, showing other Department of Education, Department of Energy brainwashing, lying, different agencies doing it, how it's controlled.
[00:42:36.162 --> 00:42:46.023]  And we're going to walk through more and more, which is our job, showing you how they're domestically involved, lying to you and deceiving you.
[00:42:46.023 --> 00:42:47.144]  And here's the key.
[00:42:47.144 --> 00:42:54.985]  When you unconsciously watch their propaganda on Fox TV or NBC, you know, entertainment, that's what the real brainwashing is.
[00:42:56.374 --> 00:43:01.045]  It hits you, it controls you, your children, your family, accept it, it's game over.
[00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:03.370]  But, but, win!
[00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:03.971]  And this is key.
[00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:25.193]  When you are conscious of it, you go, oh my God, the message is, take all these deadly pharmaceuticals, take these vaccines, humans are ugly and bad, the family's ugly and bad, America's ugly and bad, manhood's bad, the family's evil, I need to just give up and crawl in a hole and die, because their propaganda's designed for people that aren't paying attention.
[00:43:25.193 --> 00:43:32.217]  Absolutely, and this exemplifies exactly what we were talking about real briefly in the break, because what I'm about to tell our listeners,
[00:43:32.677 --> 00:43:37.600]  I'll guarantee you that 90% of our listeners don't even know this information because they're not in the bubble.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.282]  They're outside of the cultural bubble.
[00:43:40.282 --> 00:43:43.364]  Yeah, in a way, we're outside the globalist bubble.
[00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:46.086]  I don't watch all this entertainment, which is where the real war is going on.
[00:43:46.086 --> 00:43:49.869]  We're trying to now go into the bubble and notice how they're freaking out.
[00:43:49.869 --> 00:44:01.436]  They don't want us hijacking their bubble and we're just beginning to do it because bubble people inside the bubble don't know what the CIA even is, probably, or that it's overseas or it's in movies.
[00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:03.718]  There's an agenda against them.
[00:44:22.134 --> 00:44:27.798]  And the theory that's surrounding it is that the album is called Lemonade because when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.
[00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:44.128]  And in basically the whole album, and there was also an hour-long video that was released on HBO, that what she talked about in her circumstance and her lives and everything alludes to the fact that her husband, the hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, has been cheating on her with another woman.
[00:44:44.628 --> 00:45:04.621]  And this other woman's name is Rachel Roy, and she was supposedly the husband of this guy named Damon Dash, who was, I don't know why I know all this, but the guy was his business partner's ex-wife, and supposedly there was a fight with Beyonce's sister in an elevator over this woman, etc.
[00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:10.505]  So there's this whole long, convoluted, you know, social control story that's behind it.
[00:45:10.865 --> 00:45:11.666]  Soap opera.
[00:45:11.666 --> 00:45:12.606]  Exactly, soap opera.
[00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:25.295]  But the point is, is that, sure, there's this soap opera that's been carefully crafted and built around this whole idea to sell this album, which is completely and utterly made up.
[00:45:25.295 --> 00:45:26.056]  And it's a fake?
[00:45:26.576 --> 00:45:27.517]  That's the rest of the story.
[00:45:27.517 --> 00:45:47.717]  It's a fake soap opera story that even demonizes made-up people but real people mixed into it and now she's mad at men running around beating things with a baseball bat and blowing things up with young women imprinting on her to be an angry, bitter, mentally ill, crazy woman and that's just the whole anti-family, anti-male, female
[00:45:48.257 --> 00:45:48.817]  I don't know.
[00:45:59.019 --> 00:46:21.996]  I'm pointing out that as just an overall name on government propaganda because it's one of the biggest and one of the worst with the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, and all these other private groups that are above government that are even bigger than the CIA when it comes to the social engineering like saying we need to teach your four-year-old about trannies and tell them that maybe they want to have a sex change when they're seven.
[00:46:21.996 --> 00:46:24.578]  This is the government involved sexually
[00:46:25.459 --> 00:46:33.784]  Assaulting your children, trying to get them to be confused about their gender, and trying to take parental rights away to make them get sex changes when they're children.
[00:46:33.784 --> 00:46:53.235]  Exactly, and this is a perfect learning example because A. it's multi-layered, it shows that on one layer it's projecting out into the people whose consciousness is absorbed by this fake Hollywood celebrity culture, and it's attacking them on that layer, and then there's a secondary subconscious layer which is created by this
[00:46:53.755 --> 00:47:09.401]  Definitive propaganda that's being spread that is creating all these, you know, racial divisiveness, sexual divisiveness, twisting people's ideas about what reality is, and doing it in a very attacked and very scientific level.
[00:47:09.401 --> 00:47:10.102]  And let me be clear.
[00:47:10.102 --> 00:47:15.964]  I mean, just type into Google, CIA put out deviant art to break down society starting in the 1950s.
[00:47:15.964 --> 00:47:17.385]  Well, we already knew that.
[00:47:17.385 --> 00:47:20.026]  It came out in the church committees and others, but they've released it.
[00:47:20.586 --> 00:47:23.469]  And look, we're not against you making deviant art if you want.
[00:47:23.469 --> 00:47:27.272]  It's the point is they're force-feeding it so that people get confused.
[00:47:27.272 --> 00:47:30.855]  Modern art was CIA weapon, London Independent, boom.
[00:47:30.855 --> 00:47:41.665]  And if you read actually into what they were doing, it was to just create a system where they could define whatever they wanted as the new trend to control reality.
[00:47:41.665 --> 00:47:42.786]  And here's another article
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:49.003]  out on that today with how the CIA writes history.
[00:47:49.003 --> 00:48:00.790]  And this article goes through with links to the admissions that they control history by classifying billions of things basically and then they can put out a fake narrative about what has really happened.
[00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:07.114]  That's an excellent article that breaks all of us down at the intercept by Jefferson Morley.
[00:48:08.325 --> 00:48:10.786]  The point is, this is all completely known.
[00:48:10.786 --> 00:48:21.108]  This is like me saying, okay, five years before Obama even got in, they had a drone program killing people outside of law, outside of warrants, that violates the Geneva Convention.
[00:48:21.108 --> 00:48:28.990]  Obama continued it, and four years into his administration, they came out and said,
[00:48:30.276 --> 00:48:32.178]  That there was no drone program.
[00:48:32.178 --> 00:48:42.809]  Well, this is like Obama saying, and I'm gonna play this when we come back from break, over and over again, I guess 16 times USA Today's found, that there will be no boots on the ground ever in Syria, period.
[00:48:42.809 --> 00:48:43.589]  We are not doing it.
[00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:45.531]  There were already boots on the ground then.
[00:48:45.531 --> 00:48:50.076]  Now they've had the State Department come out and say, Obama never said that, and it's a lie.
[00:48:51.274 --> 00:48:53.736]  Buckley, finishing up, because we're about to go to break here.
[00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:55.178]  I just wanted you to come in.
[00:48:55.178 --> 00:48:59.963]  Let me just say one thing that really, a long time ago, really, really opened up my eyes.
[00:48:59.963 --> 00:49:02.946]  And you've talked about this before a lot.
[00:49:02.946 --> 00:49:06.329]  There's a book, which is the textbook for all of this.
[00:49:06.329 --> 00:49:08.411]  It was written by Edward Bernays.
[00:49:08.411 --> 00:49:09.612]  It's called Propaganda.
[00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:16.256]  And it describes very succinctly and very distinctly exactly how... How they use fads.
[00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:18.077]  How they create fake culture.
[00:49:18.077 --> 00:49:19.838]  This is how they get everybody to follow along.
[00:49:19.838 --> 00:49:23.820]  How do they get you to have smart cars that control your life and drive for you?
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.242]  The $200,000 Mercedes coming out drives for you.
[00:49:26.242 --> 00:49:27.122]  It's already here.
[00:49:27.122 --> 00:49:27.582]  Exactly.
[00:49:27.582 --> 00:49:30.224]  See, see, oh you pay extra to be the slave.
[00:49:30.224 --> 00:49:30.624]  Exactly.
[00:49:30.624 --> 00:49:32.065]  They make the chains cool.
[00:49:32.785 --> 00:49:40.407]  Just like the ruling elite of China 3,000 years ago, the women couldn't walk because they were too royal to walk, they bound their feet.
[00:49:40.407 --> 00:49:42.268]  No, they wanted the women to be slaves.
[00:49:42.268 --> 00:49:47.050]  And the Chinese leaders, the men, wrote about it laughing in the manuals how they controlled them.
[00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:53.011]  Right, so for those of you who haven't read the book, I would at least implore you to go look at the Wikipedia page or read a little bit about it.
[00:49:53.011 --> 00:49:56.293]  And if you can't get your hands on the book, read it because it was written in like 1924.
[00:49:57.853 --> 00:50:00.895]  It was written in 1924, even before the advent of what we would call the modern era.
[00:50:00.895 --> 00:50:02.756]  He's the reason you eat bacon with eggs.
[00:50:02.756 --> 00:50:04.897]  He's the reason women smoke cigarettes.
[00:50:04.897 --> 00:50:05.557]  All of it.
[00:50:05.557 --> 00:50:06.358]  Absolutely.
[00:50:06.358 --> 00:50:06.958]  All of it.
[00:50:06.958 --> 00:50:07.678]  Absolutely.
[00:50:07.678 --> 00:50:11.500]  And so I would highly suggest... Yeah, the full name of the book is History as a Weapon.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:11.981]  Propaganda, 1928.
[00:50:12.901 --> 00:50:21.223]  Yeah, and I would suggest that anybody goes out and read that book because it really defines... Listen, here's the bigger issue.
[00:50:21.223 --> 00:50:29.285]  Who are the people in the government and in the media that knowingly want to make Americans dumb and inject us with cancer viruses?
[00:50:29.285 --> 00:50:34.466]  We should just shift away from even trying to wake up some of the public that doesn't know the CIA is lying to them.
[00:50:35.306 --> 00:50:37.487]  And debating that Obama said no boots on the ground.
[00:50:37.487 --> 00:50:38.827]  I'm not even going to play the clip.
[00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:44.469]  If you don't remember him saying it, just go cough and drink fluoride and just be an idiot, okay?
[00:50:44.469 --> 00:50:51.551]  We need to just talk to people that do know what's happening and are informed outside the system, in the system, and say, look, we're going into total tyranny.
[00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:52.531]  It's time to stop it.
[00:50:52.531 --> 00:50:58.953]  Thanks for coming in Buckley and popping in and sharing the whole story on Beyonce and the whole fake narrative of somebody cheating on her.
[00:50:58.953 --> 00:51:00.514]  We'll be back with the clips of Obama.
[00:51:00.854 --> 00:51:02.235]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[00:53:48.663 --> 00:53:50.925]  Johnny Cash bringing us in with the Threat Resonance song.
[00:53:50.925 --> 00:53:51.545]  I hurt myself today.
[00:53:51.545 --> 00:53:52.586]  Let's see if I still feel focused.
[00:53:52.586 --> 00:53:53.087]  I hurt myself today.
[00:54:21.738 --> 00:54:27.380]  I focused on the pain when I was doing those deadlifts.
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:31.341]  The only thing that's real.
[00:54:31.341 --> 00:54:33.222]  And when you stop hurting, you start dying.
[00:54:33.222 --> 00:54:39.103]  It is true that pain is weakness leaving the body in many cases.
[00:54:39.103 --> 00:54:46.446]  And if you want to know the real propaganda, it's the laziness and how we've been inducted to think it's cool not to care.
[00:54:48.296 --> 00:54:55.340]  When we as a species are under attack by a bunch of nasty psychopaths who want to steal the world.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.881]  What have I become, my sweetest friend?
[00:54:57.881 --> 00:55:11.048]  Should I even play the president saying 16 times we have it, no boots on the ground in Syria ever, and then play the State Department yesterday saying he never said that?
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.801]  Should I even show you hundreds of articles and admissions of the CIA engaged in domestic propaganda?
[00:55:18.801 --> 00:55:24.283]  And the Ford Foundation and Soros funding, the race war, male against female garbage.
[00:55:24.283 --> 00:55:29.064]  It's all on record that the CIA funded Miss Magazine.
[00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:32.685]  And Gloria Steinem, look it up!
[00:55:32.685 --> 00:55:34.085]  It's ridiculous!
[00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.472]  But they lied to you straight to your face.
[00:55:38.472 --> 00:55:40.294]  I'm going to play those clips here in a moment.
[00:55:40.294 --> 00:55:46.181]  Briefly, we're only running this special max until next week.
[00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:47.483]  And if it causes them to
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.521]  Sell out?
[00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:52.122]  They're producing new food every few weeks, but it's so fresh.
[00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:58.867]  And My Patriot Supply will have to stop earlier, because that's just not good business to completely sell out and then have nothing to sell for weeks.
[00:55:58.867 --> 00:56:00.328]  So 30 to 40% off.
[00:56:00.328 --> 00:56:02.630]  People are buying food at the fastest rate ever.
[00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:03.591]  That's smart.
[00:56:03.591 --> 00:56:04.772]  This stuff lasts 25 years.
[00:56:04.772 --> 00:56:05.432]  InfoWare Select.
[00:56:05.432 --> 00:56:06.793]  This is My Patriot Supply.
[00:56:06.793 --> 00:56:08.414]  Private label, so I'm able to go even lower.
[00:56:08.414 --> 00:56:15.580]  30 to 40% off the already discounted retail, and it's in these high-quality plastic tote containers.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.203]  The containers are really expensive at the store, but they buy them in bulk and get them really good.
[00:56:20.203 --> 00:56:26.547]  And then they're in good pouch containers inside, and cans.
[00:56:26.547 --> 00:56:28.748]  It's just super high quality.
[00:56:28.748 --> 00:56:30.949]  Special diets, you name it, all of it.
[00:56:30.949 --> 00:56:35.092]  Infowarsstore.com or infowarsselect.com.
[00:56:35.092 --> 00:56:36.893]  We'll take you right to the subsection with the storable food.
[00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:42.397]  Whether you get it from my Patreon supply at infowarsstore.com or the Infowars Select, it's all super high quality.
[00:56:44.278 --> 00:56:45.859]  And the specials will end.
[00:56:45.859 --> 00:56:46.940]  It could be a matter of days.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.760]  It could be next Monday.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.240]  I'm not sure.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.321]  We're going to have to gauge it.
[00:56:49.321 --> 00:56:53.904]  But at current rates, this is the most food that we've ever sold and that they've ever sold.
[00:56:53.904 --> 00:56:55.404]  People are buying it so fast.
[00:56:55.404 --> 00:56:58.486]  And that's because people see how dangerous the world is right now, what's going on.
[00:56:58.486 --> 00:56:59.927]  And also, it's such a good deal.
[00:56:59.927 --> 00:57:03.289]  And that's important, though, because funding is really a big issue here.
[00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:04.750]  And it's very expensive to run this operation.
[00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:05.710]  So it's a win-win.
[00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:08.352]  Get high quality, affordable food and fund the InfoWar.
[00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:26.660]  On top of that, ladies and gentlemen, we also, you can get 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip for the nutraceuticals, the Hillary, the President shirts, but stuff that's good for AutoShip is like the Wake Up America coffee and other items like that, X2, Lung Cleanse, you name it.
[00:57:28.092 --> 00:57:32.733]  Ultra-powerful secret 12 vitamin B12 is back and available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:32.733 --> 00:57:38.855]  Just research vitamin B12 deficiency being epidemic across the Western world because of gut flora problems.
[00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.615]  Unable to absorb the vitamin B12.
[00:57:40.615 --> 00:57:42.656]  That was even in the New York Times last week.
[00:57:42.656 --> 00:57:44.016]  Life science, you name it.
[00:57:44.016 --> 00:57:49.718]  Linked to mental illness, depression, all sorts of other problems in children.
[00:57:49.718 --> 00:57:51.719]  Absolutely connected to autism.
[00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:52.299]  Just see what
[00:57:54.042 --> 00:57:57.004]  Good old God gave us through Mother Earth with Secret 12.
[00:57:57.004 --> 00:57:58.225]  Absorb it under the tongue.
[00:57:58.225 --> 00:57:59.386]  Just hold it in your mouth for about a minute.
[00:57:59.386 --> 00:58:00.287]  Tastes really good.
[00:58:00.287 --> 00:58:02.008]  It's pure vitamin B12.
[00:58:02.008 --> 00:58:08.433]  80% methylcobalamin and acetaminocobalamin, or however you pronounce it, that's even more powerful, that's very expensive, for the upload.
[00:58:08.433 --> 00:58:09.854]  That's what allows it to be uploaded.
[00:58:10.815 --> 00:58:14.978]  But the medical bottle is the stuff that's in the shots.
[00:58:14.978 --> 00:58:17.800]  You don't inject this, folks, but that's what it is.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.562]  And oh, by the way, consult your physician before you take vitamin B12.
[00:58:21.562 --> 00:58:23.964]  And consult your physician before you do the liver cleanse.
[00:58:23.964 --> 00:58:25.305]  And consult your physician before you take X2.
[00:58:25.305 --> 00:58:28.247]  Because some of this stuff really is powerful.
[00:58:28.247 --> 00:58:31.549]  It's all recognized as safe, but people can always make up whatever they want.
[00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:32.530]  So I want to say this.
[00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.772]  Consult your physician or health care provider before you breathe.
[00:58:36.552 --> 00:58:40.735]  Before you drink water, or before you walk out your front door in the morning, we'll be back with a second hour.

[00:59:53.099 --> 00:59:55.709]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.543 --> 01:00:17.486]  We are on the march.
[01:00:17.486 --> 01:00:20.630]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.133]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.185 --> 01:00:32.428]  Leanne McAdoo is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.931]  She's got a big interview premiering tonight.
[01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:44.762]  We're going to air a clip of it with a gentleman that says he was abused, and I agree this goes on, as a young person and then targeted for sex operation.
[01:00:44.762 --> 01:00:46.424]  There's a whole lobby out there pushing it.
[01:00:47.684 --> 01:00:48.605]  Let's get this straight.
[01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:51.967]  I don't care if you turn yourself into a dog or an Easter Bunny.
[01:00:51.967 --> 01:00:52.767]  I mean, get that straight.
[01:00:52.767 --> 01:01:00.152]  I know it makes it a bigger treat and makes it funner if I'm being bigoted and closed-minded and I can't handle you wanting to be a woman or a man.
[01:01:00.152 --> 01:01:02.494]  I don't want to pay for it with tax money.
[01:01:02.494 --> 01:01:04.875]  I'm sick of hearing about bathrooms all day.
[01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:08.317]  This is all culture war to break down society.
[01:01:08.317 --> 01:01:13.881]  It doesn't mean because you are who you are or who you think you are that you're bad inherently.
[01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:22.933]  It's like a hatchet can be used to cut up lumber or logs or firewood, or you can use it to kill somebody.
[01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:24.694]  You can use it to murder someone.
[01:01:24.694 --> 01:01:33.037]  So I'm not saying people that are, quote, gay, I'll use the words you say, you're the boss now, homosexual, heterosexual.
[01:01:33.037 --> 01:01:35.919]  There's a war on using words.
[01:01:35.919 --> 01:01:37.559]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:42.382]  And it's classic Edward Bernays, End of the Family, CIA funding Ms.
[01:01:42.382 --> 01:01:42.902]  Magazine,
[01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:47.218]  The CIA is heavily involved with sports and the NFL.
[01:01:47.218 --> 01:01:55.535]  It's on record and heavily involved in domestic spying and heavily involved in manipulating scripts in Hollywood.
[01:01:57.455 --> 01:02:11.387]  And there were a lot of investigations dealing with it five or six years ago, and so they just responded by having Congress pass a law, the 2013 NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act, saying you can lie to the American people and use their taxpayer money against them.
[01:02:11.387 --> 01:02:17.952]  And when we come back from break, I will go directly to it, I've been mentioning it, the montage of Obama.
[01:02:17.952 --> 01:02:19.554]  You also print me USA Today.
[01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:28.302]  Because quizlings and cognitive dissonance people that are programmed in a trance, they will say we edited the Obama or took it out of context.
[01:02:28.302 --> 01:02:35.366]  I want to show them even an authority figure publication saying it isn't true.
[01:02:35.366 --> 01:02:39.629]  And that's because USA Today understands if they completely do nothing but lie, they'll have no readers.
[01:02:40.892 --> 01:02:42.893]  But mainstream media has already killed itself.
[01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:51.578]  But to the credit of USA Today, they had an article out three days ago basically saying that all scientists don't agree on man-made climate change and say it's a big carbon tax scam.
[01:02:51.578 --> 01:02:55.140]  Well, actually most scientists that have been polled say that, because it's true.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.441]  And they're scientists.
[01:02:56.441 --> 01:03:06.747]  And there's this big hoax of, the scientists all know, but you the little people, you know, it's your car that makes the earth hot, not the sun.
[01:03:06.747 --> 01:03:08.868]  This is how they bully people.
[01:03:09.736 --> 01:03:11.318]  She can type it in.
[01:03:11.318 --> 01:03:24.210]  Obama said 16 times he pledged no boots on the ground in Syria and now the State Department says they've never said it and it's not true.
[01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:49.944]  Not true, and of course the CIA is not involved in race war, divide and conquer, balkanization, sex war, social justice warrior brainwashing, even though the federal government, the Department of Education, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, the CIA, all of them are on record writing the guidelines for UNESCO and the UN for not just U.S.
[01:03:49.944 --> 01:03:50.504]  education,
[01:03:51.124 --> 01:04:11.624]  But worldwide adoption of standards tailored for the sociology, psychology and cultures in their area to devastate the family, atomize any tribal structure into individuals helpless, dumbed down to be victims of the global corporate combine system taking over.
[01:04:11.624 --> 01:04:13.186]  Now I'm going to ask all the twits.
[01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:17.019]  Over at Esquire and Gawker and everywhere else.
[01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.661]  I know if you don't tell the lie, they'll just fire and bring somebody else in.
[01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:20.542]  Let me give you a news flash.
[01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:22.203]  The worm is turning.
[01:04:22.203 --> 01:04:30.209]  You'd make more money, dumbos, starting your own websites and coming out and telling the truth, than you would lying for these publications.
[01:04:30.209 --> 01:04:30.850]  But here's the deal.
[01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:32.011]  You like lying.
[01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:33.212]  You don't know how to tell the truth.
[01:04:33.212 --> 01:04:34.513]  You don't recognize it.
[01:04:34.513 --> 01:04:41.899]  And you get off on snuggling up to the establishment, even though it's a rotting dinosaur with maggots coming out of its eyes.
[01:04:43.306 --> 01:04:43.827]  I get it.
[01:04:43.827 --> 01:04:46.311]  You're of your father.
[01:04:46.311 --> 01:04:47.793]  You love death.
[01:04:47.793 --> 01:04:49.415]  You love lies.
[01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:51.378]  You come from bad families.
[01:04:51.378 --> 01:04:52.860]  I'll use your own eugenics line on you.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.926]  You come from predatory, twisted, screwed up gene pools.
[01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.989]  And you're not going to end up getting into space.
[01:04:58.989 --> 01:04:59.430]  We are!
[01:05:00.546 --> 01:05:12.509]  Refrigerators zapped off in kitchens across Venezuela as the government turned off the electricity supply to help ease the power outage that is worsening the country's economic crisis, reports Yahoo News.
[01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:21.251]  It is the latest drastic measure by the government in a crisis that has already seen Venezuelans waiting for hours to buy scarce supplies in shops.
[01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:25.292]  Machines for processing bank card payments also wouldn't work without power.
[01:05:25.492 --> 01:05:28.494]  Meaning that some left stores without buying anything.
[01:05:28.494 --> 01:05:32.437]  President Nicolas Maduro's government blames the power outage on weather.
[01:05:32.437 --> 01:05:38.983]  Critics, however, say it is the result of economic mismanagement and inefficient running of the energy network.
[01:05:38.983 --> 01:05:44.487]  Venezuela's economy has plunged along with the price of the oil it relies on for foreign revenues.
[01:05:44.787 --> 01:05:50.096]  Citizens are suffering shortages of medicines and goods such as toilet paper and cooking oil.
[01:05:50.096 --> 01:05:53.883]  Maduro blames the collapse on an economic war by capitalists.
[01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:57.609]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:01.276]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:06:01.276 --> 01:06:01.857]  Good, brother.
[01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:03.577]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:03.577 --> 01:06:05.518]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:05.518 --> 01:06:09.580]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.161]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:14.602]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:14.602 --> 01:06:22.465]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[01:06:26.009 --> 01:06:27.551]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:30.594]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:30.594 --> 01:06:32.236]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:32.236 --> 01:06:37.602]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:38.423]  We're good to go.
[01:07:00.231 --> 01:07:03.432]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:03.432 --> 01:07:05.792]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:07:49.373 --> 01:07:54.596]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake.
[01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:18.412]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:08:18.412 --> 01:08:19.952]  Oh well, she cried.
[01:08:19.952 --> 01:08:21.173]  I'll take you in.
[01:08:21.173 --> 01:08:23.434]  And I'll take care of you.
[01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:25.454]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:25.454 --> 01:08:27.375]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:29.996]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:29.996 --> 01:08:34.618]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[01:08:34.618 --> 01:08:37.139]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:37.139 --> 01:08:39.439]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.940]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.984]  Beside the vicious snake.
[01:08:45.984 --> 01:08:48.946]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:08:48.946 --> 01:08:51.589]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:08:51.589 --> 01:08:56.974]  But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you might have died.
[01:08:56.974 --> 01:09:02.018]  She stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:09:03.089 --> 01:09:11.156]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:09:11.156 --> 01:09:12.758]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[01:09:13.815 --> 01:09:17.418]  And you've bit me, heavens why?
[01:09:17.418 --> 01:09:22.922]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[01:09:22.922 --> 01:09:27.866]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:09:27.866 --> 01:09:33.050]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:48.543]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet Offensive, Tet-style offensive, in Europe.
[01:09:48.543 --> 01:09:50.045]  And the same thing is being done to this country.
[01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:58.731]  By the way, we have the former Navy SEAL that has been warning of this and writing articles about it and likening it to Tet-2.
[01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:03.553]  Joining us, coming up tomorrow, Roger Stone is also going to be on.
[01:10:03.553 --> 01:10:09.455]  Basically, one of the top generals surrounding the Trump campaign.
[01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:13.717]  But even CNN and Politico and the New York Times go, Roger Stone and
[01:10:15.137 --> 01:10:18.620]  His business partner are the top advisors to Trump.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:26.205]  And wow, the intel I get from Roger about what's going on, as he knows he can tell me stuff in confidence, is amazing.
[01:10:26.205 --> 01:10:33.751]  What's happening, but I'll see how much we can get him to say on air tomorrow.
[01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:39.796]  Now, if you just joined us, there's the intros I've been playing here in the second hour.
[01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:47.060]  They have New York Daily News, they have Esquire, they have Gawker, they have just a whole bunch of other publications coming out.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.622]  Oh look, a conspiracy theory about Beyonce and the CIA.
[01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:56.985]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones says Beyonce's lemonade is part of a CIA plot to start a civil war.
[01:10:56.985 --> 01:11:00.307]  Alex Jones, Beyonce's lemonade was fun about the CIA to start a race war.
[01:11:00.307 --> 01:11:06.591]  Yeah, what I say in the video is that Beyonce is promoting
[01:11:08.737 --> 01:11:21.040]  Division in this country, and that the NFL is funded by a whole bunch of federal agencies, the Department of Defense, CIA, Department of Education, you name it, and then even the big corporations are being subsidized.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.101]  The ads they run to have anti-father messages.
[01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:31.163]  Why do you think the last two Super Bowls, one had four, one had six, anti-father messages?
[01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:32.103]  We did reports on it.
[01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:40.808]  Five years ago, Audi, during the Super Bowl, had a green police hat.
[01:11:40.808 --> 01:11:47.433]  And I noticed they were wearing the actual white tops, green bottoms of real green police in Australia and in areas of the U.S.
[01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:49.635]  that had already been put in.
[01:11:49.635 --> 01:12:02.246]  And I went and looked up the PR firm, I knew they did a lot of government work, and I said on air, and we wrote articles, I said, this appears to be funded for the rollout of the green police to condition the public to accept a whole new level of tyranny.
[01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:31.492]  Ladies and gentlemen, a year later, the mayor of San Francisco was in the San Francisco Chronicle and bragged in a joint interview, it was like a conference they were having, with the head of the PR company and they bragged how they got federal money to pay for the Audi ad on the Super Bowl and to pay for the ad itself, super high budget, to roll out the new green police and the exact uniform.
[01:12:33.964 --> 01:12:39.466]  Of course it was, but they admitted it.
[01:12:39.466 --> 01:12:40.447]  This is what's going on.
[01:12:40.447 --> 01:12:43.428]  This is how they finance everything.
[01:12:43.428 --> 01:12:57.813]  I'm on stations around the country and they'll have federal hospital funded districts where federal Obama money's coming in and they'll come into the hospitals, give them this chunk of grant money, and then the hospital comes and says, we're going to advertise for a year, $300,000, $500,000 in one case, but we want Alex Jones off the air.
[01:13:03.841 --> 01:13:10.546]  And I've even had stations go, don't tell anybody, you know, specifically who told you this, but yeah.
[01:13:10.546 --> 01:13:13.248]  The public has no idea what's going on, folks.
[01:13:13.248 --> 01:13:14.629]  No idea.
[01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:16.690]  No idea.
[01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:24.396]  And then they sit there and they make jokes when, just type in the CIA is engaged in deception in the US, you'll get mainstream news.
[01:13:24.396 --> 01:13:26.738]  You'll get the Washington Post.
[01:13:26.738 --> 01:13:27.098]  You'll get
[01:13:29.352 --> 01:13:35.614]  All these publications admitting this to you, but saying it's good, you see.
[01:13:35.614 --> 01:13:41.616]  But they never tell you what they're doing.
[01:13:41.616 --> 01:13:48.399]  They never tell you, they never tell you exactly what's going on.
[01:13:48.399 --> 01:13:53.841]  They don't tell you what the message is of the CIA, or the Ford Foundation, or the Department of Education.
[01:13:54.861 --> 01:14:01.864]  And again, they give them money, but they also get them in these big RTF meetings, sometimes on C-SPAN, but usually in private.
[01:14:01.864 --> 01:14:05.165]  In Chicago, in New York, in D.C., in London sometimes.
[01:14:05.165 --> 01:14:18.511]  We've gotten the transcripts of these through foyers, but sometimes they have it on C-SPAN, or they have parts of it on C-SPAN, and they get up there and they say, like they live, the Power Alliance has done well, we're enslaving them, good job!
[01:14:18.511 --> 01:14:21.392]  I mean, it's literally like that, with the Attorney General going,
[01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:25.727]  I know you're doing good, but you can't just be anti-gun once a week.
[01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:33.053]  You've got to be anti-gun constantly, every few minutes, and brainwash the public.
[01:14:33.053 --> 01:14:35.755]  And memos have come out from the big production companies.
[01:14:35.755 --> 01:14:40.458]  Sumner Redstone, Viacom, CBS, MTV, you name it.
[01:14:40.458 --> 01:14:41.379]  Biggest media company in the world.
[01:14:41.379 --> 01:14:45.101]  And it says, you will put fathers in a bad light.
[01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:47.223]  You will put women in the light of the Savior.
[01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:50.408]  That isn't to empower women.
[01:14:50.408 --> 01:14:58.432]  That is to screw everything up and make women not respect men and everything falls apart and vice versa.
[01:14:58.432 --> 01:15:03.435]  Imagine the government involved with social engineers in our biology.
[01:15:03.435 --> 01:15:06.836]  They hate us so much.
[01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:11.779]  And the stupid idiots that work at Viacom and that work at Esquire and that work at all these places in Gawker.
[01:15:12.895 --> 01:15:24.902]  Their kids are going to die of cancer young, they're going to die young, they're going to have neurological disorders, and they're so cowardly that when they're dying, they're not even ever going to admit the globalists killed them.
[01:15:24.902 --> 01:15:33.868]  They're not going to go look at the actuaries, the numbers, the admissions, the White House science czars, eco-science, they're not going to read any of it.
[01:15:33.868 --> 01:15:36.730]  I'll tell you who is going to read it, not just somebody who won
[01:15:38.797 --> 01:15:38.977]  I think?
[01:15:58.419 --> 01:16:03.021]  The most hilarious comedy series, Walker Texas Ranger, in history.
[01:16:03.021 --> 01:16:11.425]  And believe me, inside baseball, they know it's entertaining, it's fun, has a family values message, but it's also entertaining and funny.
[01:16:11.425 --> 01:16:13.265]  People that can't laugh at themselves have a big problem.
[01:16:13.265 --> 01:16:15.346]  Chuck Norris is an amazing person.
[01:16:15.346 --> 01:16:18.748]  Chuck Norris takes on Kim Trails, martial arts legend.
[01:16:19.488 --> 01:16:24.092]  Talks about sky criminals waging war on our atmosphere and our health.
[01:16:24.092 --> 01:16:26.754]  And the point is, you can't stop the signal.
[01:16:26.754 --> 01:16:29.677]  Merle Haggard, Prince, Chuck Norris, all of them.
[01:16:29.677 --> 01:16:32.039]  All listeners of this show, by the way.
[01:16:32.039 --> 01:16:34.061]  But let's expand on that.
[01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:35.482]  We've confirmed Merle Haggard was as well.
[01:16:39.807 --> 01:16:47.550]  I remember Willie Nelson like 10 years ago, they're playing chess with him, he goes, I know you talk about the chemtrails, I notice they stay up there longer than they used to.
[01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:48.910]  What are they doing?
[01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.131]  Changing the weather?
[01:16:51.131 --> 01:16:53.992]  The point is, you can't fool everybody, okay?
[01:16:53.992 --> 01:16:59.474]  And it's admitted they're doing these secret tests, they just classify the details.
[01:16:59.474 --> 01:17:03.035]  It's called geoengineering.
[01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:09.177]  So the good news is, this medical scientific global takeover is now getting ready to come down.
[01:17:10.962 --> 01:17:22.611]  And why would anybody want to work in this deception and get talking points from criminals in the government to go out and wage war against your own fellow humans?
[01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:25.674]  I'm going to skip this one break today on the nature of time here because this is so important.
[01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:31.779]  I want to play now Unadmitted Lie, but if you're a new viewer or new listener or somebody at Esquire or somebody at
[01:17:32.975 --> 01:17:34.076]  CNN.
[01:17:34.076 --> 01:17:35.417]  I've met a lot of these propagandists.
[01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.278]  The high-level ones know what they're doing.
[01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.118]  They know they're evil.
[01:17:38.118 --> 01:17:38.919]  They know the deception.
[01:17:38.919 --> 01:17:50.586]  But the mid-levels just are real silly wannabe comedian types who are real cynical, hateful, and laugh at everything, and just don't even have any culture or ideas.
[01:17:50.586 --> 01:17:51.666]  They just do whatever they're told.
[01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.307]  They're sociopathic.
[01:17:53.307 --> 01:17:55.909]  And I want to explain to little sociopaths.
[01:17:55.909 --> 01:18:00.592]  You aren't going to get as much government cheese as this system collapses.
[01:18:01.716 --> 01:18:08.460]  You're being screwed over by this, so if you're even a sociopath, you shouldn't want world government.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.222]  You shouldn't have to avoid the fluoride in the water.
[01:18:11.222 --> 01:18:12.342]  And of course, these people never do.
[01:18:12.342 --> 01:18:14.223]  They go, I don't care if it kills me, big deal.
[01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:15.164]  There aren't too many people.
[01:18:15.164 --> 01:18:16.045]  Okay, fine.
[01:18:16.045 --> 01:18:17.205]  Harvard admits it's killing us.
[01:18:17.205 --> 01:18:17.686]  I don't care.
[01:18:17.686 --> 01:18:20.607]  Because they don't want to admit they're under attack.
[01:18:20.607 --> 01:18:23.169]  When it's proven, they go, fine, I accept it.
[01:18:23.169 --> 01:18:28.352]  Because of fundamental laziness, lack of vision, and lack of destiny.
[01:18:29.735 --> 01:18:30.917]  They love death.
[01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:31.899]  They love rolling over.
[01:18:31.899 --> 01:18:33.562]  They love not existing.
[01:18:33.562 --> 01:18:36.226]  They don't like the animating contests of life.
[01:18:36.226 --> 01:18:37.448]  They're dead.
[01:18:37.448 --> 01:18:38.169]  They're sleeping.
[01:18:39.392 --> 01:18:44.956]  And if you've been asleep your whole life and bombarded with nothing but evil culture, you become that.
[01:18:44.956 --> 01:19:03.669]  If you didn't have an over-driving stamp of God on you and a stamp of love of life and God's creation and vision, and if you weren't ever opened up to the God of the universe, not the God of this world, you are blinded by the God of this world and you can't resonate with what I'm saying.
[01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:07.012]  People that do click totally get it, but those that are spiritually blind
[01:19:10.836 --> 01:19:12.896]  In many cases cannot ever be reached again.
[01:19:12.896 --> 01:19:22.078]  So just stop spending your time with someone that giggles and laughs and hops up and down like a demon at you and move on to people that actually debate you or want to listen.
[01:19:22.078 --> 01:19:35.960]  And then give them a pep talk and work with others to form together with people who understand what's happening to enrich each other and edify each other and build a resistance to this.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.101]  And realize we've just got to form the resistance.
[01:19:38.101 --> 01:19:38.941]  God's going to do the rest.
[01:19:40.319 --> 01:19:42.961]  We gotta take those first steps.
[01:19:42.961 --> 01:19:45.543]  The secret is a load of bull from Oprah Winfrey and all that.
[01:19:45.543 --> 01:19:47.444]  You just imagine and hope something happens?
[01:19:47.444 --> 01:19:48.465]  No.
[01:19:48.465 --> 01:19:52.468]  Sure, energy if you have a good attitude is positive and some good things will come back to you.
[01:19:52.468 --> 01:19:58.493]  But you've gotta have the will, you've gotta be doing it for the right reason, you've gotta be committed, and you've gotta be persecuted.
[01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:04.858]  And every time you get persecuted and go through it, then the doors open up.
[01:20:04.858 --> 01:20:07.680]  But no guts, no glory, folks.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.141]  Fortune favors the bold.
[01:20:09.141 --> 01:20:10.042]  Our fortune is liberty.
[01:20:11.519 --> 01:20:26.543]  So, try if you're a new listener and you tune in, a lot of people tune in for entertainment, and to feel superior, look at someone who's real, someone who stumbles, someone who comes off provincial at times, but also intellectual.
[01:20:26.543 --> 01:20:30.164]  A lot of pseudo-intellectuals like to watch to feel important.
[01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:37.806]  Come down off that horse for a minute and ask yourself, you feel safe with a government that told you Obamacare would be free when it didn't?
[01:20:37.806 --> 01:20:40.027]  You feel safe with them telling you 2 plus 2 equals whatever they say?
[01:20:41.107 --> 01:20:48.430]  You think we're going in a good direction when they tell you they never were going to put troops on the ground, never said they would, and it's a lie?
[01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:54.252]  When they're gearing up with armored redoubts and putting all sorts of garbage in the food and water, you go, oh, there's nothing in the food and water.
[01:20:54.252 --> 01:20:56.293]  Yes, there is, and you know it.
[01:20:56.293 --> 01:21:04.316]  They knew full well what aspartame and glyphosate and MSG and all the rest of the garbage does.
[01:21:04.316 --> 01:21:06.177]  They know what the mercury does in the vaccines.
[01:21:06.177 --> 01:21:07.858]  They know what the adjuvants do.
[01:21:07.858 --> 01:21:09.378]  They know.
[01:21:09.378 --> 01:21:10.519]  And it just continues on.
[01:21:12.298 --> 01:21:15.740]  And they don't take it out even when they get caught.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.541]  Because they're committed.
[01:21:16.541 --> 01:21:19.162]  They're breaking us right now.
[01:21:19.162 --> 01:21:24.645]  You really think someone identifying as a male or female or saying mother or father, he or she, hurts someone?
[01:21:24.645 --> 01:21:25.986]  So don't say he or she.
[01:21:25.986 --> 01:21:28.568]  No, that's a cult teaching you you can't use any words.
[01:21:28.568 --> 01:21:35.072]  They start out with, let's not hurt gay people's feelings, so don't say the word homosexual, heterosexual, homosexual.
[01:21:35.072 --> 01:21:38.934]  They say don't use the word negro, because that sounds like the n-word.
[01:21:38.934 --> 01:21:40.335]  Well, it just comes from Latin, meaning dark.
[01:21:42.984 --> 01:21:43.464]  What next?
[01:21:43.464 --> 01:21:45.045]  Don't use the word Caucasian.
[01:21:45.045 --> 01:21:46.385]  That sounds weird.
[01:21:46.385 --> 01:21:49.486]  People that are scared by a science term say don't use it.
[01:21:49.486 --> 01:21:50.946]  This means the Caucasus Mountains.
[01:21:50.946 --> 01:21:52.446]  Caucasoid.
[01:21:52.446 --> 01:21:59.308]  Caucasoid skeletons that were discovered.
[01:21:59.308 --> 01:22:00.028]  Cro-Magnon.
[01:22:00.028 --> 01:22:05.930]  Of course, they've done the genetic testing.
[01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:09.671]  You know that the Neanderthals didn't die out.
[01:22:09.671 --> 01:22:10.571]  They were bred out.
[01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:17.173]  And you look at Europeans today, you're looking at a hybrid between the Anderthal and Cro-Magnon.
[01:22:17.173 --> 01:22:20.615]  But listen, people just aren't informed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:20.615 --> 01:22:22.716]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:22:22.716 --> 01:22:24.057]  They don't understand.
[01:22:24.057 --> 01:22:24.717]  They're ignorant.
[01:22:26.519 --> 01:22:29.781]  And the truth is exciting, it's wild, it's interesting.
[01:22:29.781 --> 01:22:36.285]  Let me tell you, you're going to wake up, if you turn into the reality and look into this for yourself, in a science fiction horror film.
[01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:48.352]  But it's animating, it's fun, it's exciting to be involved, to know what's going on, and to flip the switches in your body to resist it that are designed to make you survive and thrive.
[01:22:50.313 --> 01:23:02.876]  It is this animating pressure that is going to empower us, and the enemy would say, that's why we're doing it, to make people that are going to be empowered become empowered, but those that fall to it, they deserve to die and be destroyed by eugenics.
[01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:06.357]  That's a very immoral, evil program, and I'll go one further.
[01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:14.960]  You're not just doing that, that's your public outside porch, outside the true inner party,
[01:23:15.922 --> 01:23:19.943]  Program to tell people you're doing eugenics to empower the species.
[01:23:19.943 --> 01:23:23.805]  That's pop psychology.
[01:23:23.805 --> 01:23:25.325]  That's pop eugenics.
[01:23:25.325 --> 01:23:43.571]  Real eugenics is about targeting super genes, elite genes, innovative genes, trailblazing genes, loving genes that the sociopath control freaks, psychopathic inbred OCD, mental patient control guilds are threatened by.
[01:23:45.441 --> 01:23:59.128]  The satanic bloodlines, it's not that it's Jewish or it's black or it's white or it's Asian, it's in every group, Asian, black, whatever, it's about the same number of psychopaths and sociopaths and other people that are predisposed.
[01:23:59.128 --> 01:24:00.429]  Nature loads the gun.
[01:24:01.829 --> 01:24:03.570]  Environment pulls the trigger.
[01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:05.592]  Epigenetics, all the rest of it.
[01:24:05.592 --> 01:24:18.721]  And you've got a certain number of people that are psychopaths, another number that are sociopaths, and then they're artificially engaging in cultural brainwashing to produce artificial sociopaths as their armies.
[01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:24.265]  But soon that won't matter because the machines are coming in who will follow orders and are autonomous under globalist control.
[01:24:26.198 --> 01:24:32.240]  So this is an attack on you and your family, and they don't want you to know they're doing it, even though it's declassified.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:40.203]  So, what I'm telling you is a fact, it's worse than I'm saying, because there's no way to describe how horrible this is, and how big this is, and how stinking this is.
[01:24:40.203 --> 01:24:44.344]  I can't tell you about the Matrix, you're gonna have to decide, you wanna take the red pill and see it for yourself.
[01:24:44.344 --> 01:24:49.746]  It's all I'm offering is the truth.
[01:24:49.746 --> 01:24:52.207]  Now, now, now, now, continuing here,
[01:24:53.973 --> 01:25:06.145]  With this, let's go ahead and play Obama's, I'm not going to play all 16 times because of time, but here's Obama 16 times in the last four years saying we'll never put boots on the ground in Syria, just let me bomb Syria.
[01:25:06.145 --> 01:25:16.256]  Now they're putting boots on the ground, they were always there, but they're expanding it openly because body bags are coming back, and they are now telling everyone
[01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:20.911]  That they never said this, and Obama's not lying to you.
[01:25:20.911 --> 01:25:23.693]  I mean, who's teaching the people of the State Department?
[01:25:23.693 --> 01:25:24.733]  Jonathan Gruber?
[01:25:24.733 --> 01:25:25.854]  Here it is.
[01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:39.983]  I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground in Syria, would not only be good for America, but also would be good for Syria.
[01:25:39.983 --> 01:25:42.244]  My answer is simple.
[01:25:42.244 --> 01:25:45.206]  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.
[01:25:46.656 --> 01:25:51.322]  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.
[01:25:51.322 --> 01:25:52.002]  2013.
[01:25:52.002 --> 01:25:56.888]  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.
[01:25:56.888 --> 01:26:00.112]  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective.
[01:26:00.112 --> 01:26:02.455]  Libya and Kosovo were destabilization programs.
[01:26:02.455 --> 01:26:06.620]  What matters is what matters and where we go from here.
[01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:16.210]  Over the past two years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad... You know what, I'm not going to play all 16.
[01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:17.570]  Just turn it off.
[01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:20.731]  Okay, I can't look at him anymore.
[01:26:20.731 --> 01:26:24.092]  You notice Kosovo and Libya were about putting radical jihadists in charge.
[01:26:24.092 --> 01:26:29.393]  They gave a third of Serbia to radical jihadists, Wahhabists.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.321]  They gave Libya to them.
[01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:40.083]  This is the globalists giving air support to Saudi Arabian proxy armies all over the world.
[01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:44.584]  And now they got boots on the ground claiming they're fighting ISIS.
[01:26:44.584 --> 01:26:46.265]  I don't believe any of it.
[01:26:46.265 --> 01:26:48.786]  And from my sources, it's all pure bull.
[01:26:48.786 --> 01:26:50.386]  So who knows what they're doing?
[01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:53.807]  Mainly putting weapons caches in and then running off from them under orders.
[01:26:53.807 --> 01:26:55.208]  And that's why the military is so awake.
[01:26:55.208 --> 01:26:57.048]  But let's go ahead and go to another clip.
[01:26:57.048 --> 01:26:58.429]  This is a State Department yesterday
[01:27:00.452 --> 01:27:06.117]  Where this rodent, I forget his name, it'll be on screen, is telling you, we never said there would be boots, what are you talking about?
[01:27:06.117 --> 01:27:10.560]  There were never elections, you never voted in primaries!
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.322]  Come on!
[01:27:12.322 --> 01:27:15.524]  Ha ha, never had a right to, women never breastfed children!
[01:27:17.042 --> 01:27:18.203]  What are you talking about?
[01:27:18.203 --> 01:27:19.944]  There was others that said things like father, mother.
[01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.004]  Those words are illegal.
[01:27:21.004 --> 01:27:22.325]  That's where they're all going.
[01:27:22.325 --> 01:27:23.826]  And you're like, that's cultic.
[01:27:23.826 --> 01:27:25.627]  It's a cult of control.
[01:27:25.627 --> 01:27:26.167]  Here they are.
[01:27:26.167 --> 01:27:26.888]  He never said it.
[01:27:26.888 --> 01:27:29.790]  He didn't say it 16 times himself in press conferences.
[01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:30.530]  Here it is.
[01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:38.775]  The point is that for months and months and months that the mantra from the president and everyone else in the administration has been no boots on the ground.
[01:27:38.775 --> 01:27:39.936]  No, that is not true.
[01:27:40.677 --> 01:27:41.137]  What?
[01:27:41.137 --> 01:27:42.098]  It's just not true, Matt.
[01:27:42.098 --> 01:27:43.780]  It is!
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:44.981]  It's true!
[01:27:44.981 --> 01:27:46.442]  No, it's not!
[01:27:46.442 --> 01:27:52.727]  I just flatly, absolutely disagree with you, but I've been speaking to this when I was in uniform for over two years.
[01:27:52.727 --> 01:27:59.693]  Okay, your predecessor up here, you know, all options are on the table except boots on the ground.
[01:27:59.693 --> 01:28:01.334]  I never said that.
[01:28:01.334 --> 01:28:04.356]  Well, that was the whole line from the President on down.
[01:28:07.398 --> 01:28:16.162]  John Kirby, are you saying that this is not the same thing as saying one thing and then doing the other completely?
[01:28:16.162 --> 01:28:19.564]  I'm absolutely rejecting that thesis, yes.
[01:28:19.564 --> 01:28:21.064]  That's enough.
[01:28:21.064 --> 01:28:30.789]  Let's take him saying that and then put it in with the no boots on the ground and let's put in you didn't build your business and you can keep your doctor and him saying later I never said you could keep your doctor.
[01:28:30.789 --> 01:28:32.590]  I mean the lies are getting long here but here's the deal.
[01:28:33.772 --> 01:28:45.040]  He knows they know that that was said hundreds of times by the Pentagon and press briefings and 16 times by him and hundreds of times other places by other members of the administration.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:53.046]  That guy is in a psyop to make those people all feel alone and by themselves and to know they're going to go out and report he's a liar.
[01:28:54.255 --> 01:28:58.856]  As they titrate the dose up of lies conditioning us to accept lies.
[01:28:58.856 --> 01:29:03.957]  So he beats his hand on the table on purpose to demoralize you and say, that's not true.
[01:29:03.957 --> 01:29:05.337]  And he smiles and laughs.
[01:29:05.337 --> 01:29:07.177]  And then he goes, I never said that.
[01:29:07.177 --> 01:29:08.638]  And then smiles.
[01:29:08.638 --> 01:29:11.098]  And they're all looking upset, having their humanity insulted.
[01:29:11.098 --> 01:29:18.339]  And he's like, look, you people lie for a living in smaller ways, like smoking a Cuban cigar, you know, while somebody's cooking meth next door.
[01:29:18.339 --> 01:29:19.720]  But it's both illegal.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.340]  Either the laws are frauds or follow them.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.345]  He's there going, listen, we'll do whatever we want.
[01:29:25.345 --> 01:29:26.907]  And you all feel real safe?
[01:29:26.907 --> 01:29:29.350]  You think there'll be a good economy under a system like this?
[01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:31.313]  You think we should all screw each other over?
[01:29:31.313 --> 01:29:32.314]  We'll get ahead that way?
[01:29:32.314 --> 01:29:32.354]  No!
[01:29:34.275 --> 01:29:34.795]  Media!
[01:29:34.795 --> 01:29:35.856]  Stop lying!
[01:29:35.856 --> 01:29:37.116]  Stop going along with it!
[01:29:37.116 --> 01:29:37.836]  CIA!
[01:29:37.836 --> 01:29:38.597]  Military!
[01:29:38.597 --> 01:29:39.397]  FBI!
[01:29:39.397 --> 01:29:40.458]  Stop it!
[01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:43.079]  You're destroying our future by design!
[01:29:43.079 --> 01:29:45.520]  We know where the new old order is taking us!
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.460]  It's taking us into eugenics!
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.521]  World government!
[01:29:48.521 --> 01:29:50.141]  Mass extermination!
[01:29:50.141 --> 01:29:51.542]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:53.123]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.123 --> 01:29:55.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.644 --> 01:29:56.604]  Leanne's coming in.
[01:29:56.604 --> 01:29:58.545]  Leanne's coming in.
[01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:09.140]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes less and less transparent.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:14.823]  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the conflict here.
[01:30:14.823 --> 01:30:20.486]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[01:30:21.394 --> 01:30:22.615]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:30:22.615 --> 01:30:26.337]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[01:30:26.337 --> 01:30:30.300]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[01:30:51.354 --> 01:30:59.186]  Join Info Wars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7pm as we cover the primaries in the Northeast.
[01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:03.932]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:03.932 --> 01:31:12.175]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:17.597]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:17.597 --> 01:31:20.118]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:20.118 --> 01:31:22.239]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:31:30.422 --> 01:31:31.343]  Shower Filters.
[01:31:31.343 --> 01:31:33.064]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:31:33.064 --> 01:31:37.128]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[01:31:37.128 --> 01:31:41.952]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:31:41.952 --> 01:31:49.039]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:31:49.039 --> 01:31:51.561]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free

[01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:10.797]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:10.797 --> 01:32:12.198]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists.
[01:32:12.378 --> 01:32:16.699]  Scientists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:23.921]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:32.863]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:32:32.863 --> 01:32:33.523]  On top of that,
[01:32:33.663 --> 01:32:36.785]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:39.606]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:32:39.606 --> 01:32:52.534]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:32:52.534 --> 01:32:59.458]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[01:33:07.677 --> 01:33:08.717]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.717 --> 01:33:09.878]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[01:33:09.878 --> 01:33:11.679]  You like him?
[01:33:11.679 --> 01:33:13.059]  Oh, that's good.
[01:33:13.059 --> 01:33:13.759]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.759 --> 01:33:14.580]  Nice guy.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:22.323]  I know now, from top people, that you actually are for real, and you understand you're in danger, and you understand what you're doing, is epic.
[01:33:22.323 --> 01:33:24.263]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:33:24.263 --> 01:33:25.784]  I will not let you down.
[01:33:25.784 --> 01:33:28.645]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:33:29.205 --> 01:33:34.028]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[01:33:34.028 --> 01:33:36.750]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:41.153]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[01:33:41.153 --> 01:33:43.194]  He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.
[01:33:43.194 --> 01:33:44.635]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[01:33:44.635 --> 01:33:46.296]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[01:33:46.296 --> 01:33:48.398]  It was in Drudge, who's great, by the way.
[01:33:48.398 --> 01:33:49.639]  Drudge is amazing.
[01:33:50.299 --> 01:33:54.602]  But the story in Drudge and Big Story, it's all over the place now.
[01:33:54.602 --> 01:33:58.064]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff.
[01:33:58.064 --> 01:34:03.046]  Struts swimming across the river, right?
[01:34:03.046 --> 01:34:04.387]  Swimming right across.
[01:34:04.387 --> 01:34:06.748]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[01:34:06.748 --> 01:34:07.569]  They're jumping in.
[01:34:07.569 --> 01:34:08.610]  They just jumped in the rafts.
[01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:11.691]  They're coming in one, two, three, four.
[01:34:11.691 --> 01:34:12.772]  They have big satchels.
[01:34:13.795 --> 01:34:20.181]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:23.284]  Because they're showing this on camera, the guys carrying bags of stuff.
[01:34:23.284 --> 01:34:23.685]  It was drugs.
[01:34:23.685 --> 01:34:30.792]  Thank you.
[01:34:30.792 --> 01:34:33.254]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[01:34:33.254 --> 01:34:34.575]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:34:34.575 --> 01:34:36.437]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that.
[01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:37.398]  Thank you.
[01:34:37.398 --> 01:34:38.119]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:39.112 --> 01:34:44.187]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:34:44.187 --> 01:34:45.612]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:34:47.404 --> 01:34:48.504]  And we are live.
[01:34:48.504 --> 01:34:50.525]  Coming up tonight there's going to be live coverage.
[01:34:50.525 --> 01:34:59.328]  We'll have the news and some important news analysis and packages and then live coverage this evening of the big primaries and a whole bunch of states.
[01:34:59.328 --> 01:35:06.270]  We're going to be talking about that more in the next hour with Gerald Cilente getting more into the financial news, the military news and so much more.
[01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:09.611]  I'll be talking to Leanne McAdoo about an incredible interview she did yesterday
[01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:21.578]  That's going to be airing tonight on the Nightly News before their live coverage of what's coming up with, again, the key primaries that Trump is set to sweep.
[01:35:21.578 --> 01:35:34.107]  Walt Heyer, formerly a transgendered woman, now an accomplished author and public speaker with a passion for mentoring individuals whose lives have been torn apart by unnecessary gender-changing surgery, is going to testify to you.
[01:35:34.107 --> 01:35:36.008]  We're going to play a clip here in a moment about
[01:35:37.369 --> 01:35:41.172]  The dark side of all this, and what's really being pushed here.
[01:35:41.172 --> 01:35:44.334]  So, that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:35:44.334 --> 01:35:55.122]  First off, if you look at what's happening in the world, you look at governments, militaries, the police, elites digging in, getting guns, getting food like never before.
[01:35:55.122 --> 01:35:56.863]  This is insurance you can eat.
[01:35:56.863 --> 01:36:02.167]  Everybody needs to know how to use firearms, to have friends and family that you can count on in an emergency, that's also important.
[01:36:04.121 --> 01:36:06.741]  But also have storable foods is paramount.
[01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:10.922]  And I set out to find the very best sponsor with the very best, highest quality food at the lowest prices.
[01:36:10.922 --> 01:36:12.562]  And that's MyPatriotSupply.
[01:36:12.562 --> 01:36:16.903]  We have their full catalog at the lowest prices with all their latest specials.
[01:36:16.903 --> 01:36:20.064]  It's changing every week at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:20.064 --> 01:36:33.366]  You got 70-day, 140-day, 450-day, 900-day, 1800-day supplies, 114-day supplies, boogie packs, the packaging's the best, the quality, special meal packages, special diet packages, you name it, they've got the full spectrum.
[01:36:34.568 --> 01:36:38.671]  We've got the best water filtration systems, you name it.
[01:36:38.671 --> 01:36:53.301]  We are running a special, that we only do twice a year, for 30 to 40 percent off, depending on which package it is, on all of the products at InfoWarsSelect.com.
[01:36:53.301 --> 01:37:00.226]  You know, I've had such bad mold, I'm turning into Hillary Clinton, because it's been right here.
[01:37:00.226 --> 01:37:01.007]  And I took my
[01:37:02.276 --> 01:37:08.220]  Lung Shield home last night and sprayed like eight shots of it and didn't wake up hacking and coughing all night.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:14.503]  But I still went for a jog.
[01:37:14.503 --> 01:37:15.504]  I still went for a jog.
[01:37:15.504 --> 01:37:16.805]  This is not a plug on purpose here.
[01:37:16.805 --> 01:37:19.406]  This is the worst coughing I've ever had because this mold.
[01:37:19.406 --> 01:37:20.907]  Thanks for the Sam Hillary Clinton part two.
[01:37:20.907 --> 01:37:22.208]  I mean I'm coughing so hard I'm sweating.
[01:37:23.362 --> 01:37:43.680]  Here, and my, no, it's gone, Lee, and I took the Lung Cleanse home, and the Lung Cleanse has got all these essential herbs and oils, it's so thick, and you spray it down your throat, it totally knocks out, it's like fire ants in my throat and in my bronchioles, and it totally knocks it out.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:49.726]  And for like a week and a half, I was having all these mold problems at night, and then finally thought, wait a minute, Lung Cleanse.
[01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:53.899]  But then I forgot and took it home and I wasn't doing it.
[01:37:53.899 --> 01:37:56.500]  So, I'm digressing here.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:03.341]  Lung Cleanse is an amazing product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:03.341 --> 01:38:04.602]  And then, they don't have her mic on.
[01:38:04.602 --> 01:38:06.462]  She just said they should send some to Hillary Clinton.
[01:38:06.462 --> 01:38:07.183]  Oh, your mic is on.
[01:38:07.183 --> 01:38:07.943]  Okay.
[01:38:07.943 --> 01:38:11.264]  Anyways, the point here is, this is teleprompter free news.
[01:38:11.264 --> 01:38:13.304]  So, if I have a coughing fit, I have one.
[01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:15.245]  But here is the Lung Cleanse.
[01:38:15.245 --> 01:38:15.605]  Thank God.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:25.523]  I was doing a plug for storable foods and have now segued off into all of this.
[01:38:25.523 --> 01:38:28.285]  But what were you going to say about Lung Cleanse, Leigh-Anne?
[01:38:28.285 --> 01:38:32.627]  We need to send some to Hillary Clinton and get rid of that nasty cough she has once and for all.
[01:38:32.627 --> 01:38:34.148]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:38:34.148 --> 01:38:35.548]  Have you ever used Lung Cleanse?
[01:38:35.548 --> 01:38:36.389]  Yes, actually.
[01:38:36.389 --> 01:38:38.250]  I have the same thing with mold.
[01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:39.730]  And it does help.
[01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:40.911]  It coats the back of your
[01:38:42.045 --> 01:38:45.555]  You know, Austin is the fastest growing city in the U.S., maybe after Atlanta.
[01:38:45.555 --> 01:38:46.659]  They debate which is the fastest.
[01:38:46.659 --> 01:38:47.481]  It's a beautiful area.
[01:38:47.481 --> 01:38:48.323]  My mom's from here.
[01:38:48.323 --> 01:38:48.865]  I'm from Dallas.
[01:38:50.128 --> 01:38:54.031]  But I thought allergies were a hypochondriac thing when my buddies... So did I.
[01:38:54.031 --> 01:38:55.552]  ...did want to ride bicycles.
[01:38:55.552 --> 01:38:56.673]  So you did too from Florida.
[01:38:56.673 --> 01:38:57.754]  Yeah, and I would be like, what?
[01:38:57.754 --> 01:38:59.615]  Just stop coughing, stop sneezing.
[01:38:59.615 --> 01:39:00.636]  What's your problem?
[01:39:00.636 --> 01:39:03.538]  And then, of course, it hit me when I moved to Austin.
[01:39:03.538 --> 01:39:05.500]  Well, the mold doesn't give me a headache.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:08.482]  It just makes me cough, and uncontrollably.
[01:39:08.482 --> 01:39:09.243]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:12.125]  The lung cleansers, I tried other products before we came out with this, just don't work.
[01:39:12.125 --> 01:39:14.087]  Stuff that, you know, you take that numbs your throat or whatever.
[01:39:14.087 --> 01:39:15.988]  It only happens a few times a year.
[01:39:15.988 --> 01:39:17.970]  When it's raining for months on end... Yeah.
[01:39:18.632 --> 01:39:19.852]  Which we need.
[01:39:19.852 --> 01:39:23.874]  The aquifers, the lakes are all back to capacity.
[01:39:23.874 --> 01:39:24.734]  It's part of the cycles.
[01:39:24.734 --> 01:39:27.915]  But the point is, Vitamin B12, Secret 12 is back in stock.
[01:39:27.915 --> 01:39:37.118]  But we're running a special that ends very, very soon on the high-quality, storable foods at MyPatriotSupply at InfoWareStore.com and on InfoWare Select.
[01:39:37.118 --> 01:39:39.919]  In fact, it's the InfoWare Select that has the 30-40% off.
[01:39:41.639 --> 01:39:48.462]  So take advantage of that today, ladies and gentlemen, and know that you're funding this operation as well.
[01:39:48.462 --> 01:39:51.623]  Now is the time to have this insurance that you can eat.
[01:39:51.623 --> 01:39:53.944]  It is more important than ever.
[01:39:53.944 --> 01:40:06.009]  Okay, Leanne, continuing here, I want to get into this interview that's coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News, because I was aware of this.
[01:40:06.009 --> 01:40:10.051]  I was familiar of these problems and people that have spoken out and been critical.
[01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:10.851]  But think about it.
[01:40:11.863 --> 01:40:14.264]  They always make it like, hey, be open, be free.
[01:40:14.264 --> 01:40:16.586]  They know how classically liberal the West is.
[01:40:16.586 --> 01:40:18.747]  We're the place that women got the right to vote.
[01:40:18.747 --> 01:40:21.228]  We're the place where slavery got ended first.
[01:40:21.228 --> 01:40:26.972]  But because of that, there's this artificial idea that we're the bad guys.
[01:40:26.972 --> 01:40:34.156]  Well, then they push, hey, if a man wants to be a woman or a woman wants to be a man, maybe their brains biologically like that, whatever, they should be allowed to have that.
[01:40:34.156 --> 01:40:35.337]  People are like, OK.
[01:40:35.337 --> 01:40:39.519]  Then it's pay for the sex change with taxpayer money all over the country.
[01:40:39.519 --> 01:40:40.339]  Billions a year.
[01:40:40.339 --> 01:40:40.760]  It's insane.
[01:40:41.823 --> 01:40:48.386]  Now they're wanting body modifications, or people think they're the devil or whatever, you know, have taxpayers pay for that.
[01:40:48.386 --> 01:40:51.088]  Literally, this is getting insane.
[01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:53.689]  And it's designed to break down culture and society, but think about
[01:40:54.696 --> 01:41:02.604]  Children now in No Child Left Behind, as young as three, are having the government and the state read them books and talk to them about other genders.
[01:41:02.604 --> 01:41:03.304]  You don't have to be a boy.
[01:41:03.304 --> 01:41:04.686]  You don't have to be a girl.
[01:41:04.686 --> 01:41:07.148]  You were being oppressed because you were born into that biology.
[01:41:07.148 --> 01:41:13.274]  You don't have a great white shark born a male that he's being discriminated against, or she is.
[01:41:13.274 --> 01:41:16.297]  This is like aliens attacking our species.
[01:41:16.297 --> 01:41:18.879]  And I'm not saying that's what it is, but it might as well be a movie where
[01:41:19.696 --> 01:41:24.162]  They're into humanity as we know it, and they go into young people, sometimes young children.
[01:41:24.162 --> 01:41:26.845]  I see now young children getting sex changes, quote.
[01:41:26.845 --> 01:41:34.254]  You know, if they decide, even above their parents' consent, just like abortion or just like vaccines in California, oh, your 12-year-old wants to be vaccinated?
[01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:37.477]  Consents at 12, even the parents say no.
[01:41:37.477 --> 01:41:44.662]  This is the state coming in like pervs, like night crawlers, like guys coming through your daughter or son's window and kidnapping them.
[01:41:44.662 --> 01:41:47.825]  And they're doing it out in the open in the name of love and openness.
[01:41:47.825 --> 01:41:49.246]  It's so crazy.
[01:41:49.246 --> 01:42:01.255]  Tell us about Walt Heyer and sexchangereject.com because the media is so mad about this gentleman and others that are speaking out and warning people.
[01:42:01.855 --> 01:42:11.078]  So, Walt Heyer, his blog there, sexchangeregret.com, he was a, he calls himself a transgender at four years old.
[01:42:11.078 --> 01:42:18.281]  He was encouraged by his grandmother to wear this purple chiffon dress and, you know, maybe he was an effeminate young boy.
[01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:24.283]  I mean, you hear stories about that all the time of, you know, little boys that want to play with dolls or wear dresses or whatever.
[01:42:24.283 --> 01:42:26.884]  I mean, it's really not that uncommon.
[01:42:26.884 --> 01:42:28.965]  However, this, the only way that he would
[01:42:29.585 --> 01:42:46.345]  Receive love attention and affection was when he would don this purple dress and then his mom and it was like their little secret and he wouldn't tell his family about it and then he went on home and then they found out and it was this big thing that it became this big shameful episode and then he
[01:42:46.906 --> 01:42:47.426]  Thank you so much.
[01:43:08.664 --> 01:43:18.732]  And so just gave him that and lived for, you know, seven years as a woman and tried to commit suicide and was just because his underlying issues weren't dealt with.
[01:43:18.732 --> 01:43:28.961]  And then he went to an actual psychologist who said, actually, you have a dissociative disorder because you created a whole other identity for yourself to be able to survive with all this trauma that happened to you.
[01:43:29.201 --> 01:43:30.921]  And by the way, that's real psychology.
[01:43:30.921 --> 01:43:34.642]  That's one of the worst things you can get as a disassociative disorder.
[01:43:34.642 --> 01:43:43.304]  Children that are abused and traumatized will create fantasy land, la-la land characters, and if you can't get them out of that character, they are fried for life.
[01:43:43.304 --> 01:43:47.565]  And I'm really impressed with the research you've done on this and this angle.
[01:43:47.565 --> 01:43:51.666]  I hope you'll stay on this beat, Leanne, and do more stories on this, because
[01:43:52.905 --> 01:44:02.856]  I have studied this, I've looked at it, I've seen the statistics, and they make it about we hate people that have different sexual proclivity.
[01:44:02.856 --> 01:44:07.441]  And look, back to the Romans, whatever, I know there's always been some men that are attracted to men.
[01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:11.424]  Historically and statistically, it's way higher women attracted to women.
[01:44:11.424 --> 01:44:16.689]  I think that's biologically because men would be gone for a long time and then women would get together sometimes when the men came back.
[01:44:16.689 --> 01:44:19.271]  In almost every anthropology study, it shifts back to men and women.
[01:44:19.271 --> 01:44:24.095]  And I'm not... I'm telling you anthropology folks, sociology, culture, real stuff here.
[01:44:24.095 --> 01:44:25.916]  The point is, I don't hate anybody.
[01:44:25.916 --> 01:44:29.800]  Quite frankly, I mean, you know, it's the 21st century.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.800]  I get what's going on.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.742]  I'm a guy that's been around.
[01:44:32.742 --> 01:44:33.503]  I've seen a lot of stuff.
[01:44:34.699 --> 01:44:37.301]  They try to sell it like, ooh, I'm just a bigot and I hate them.
[01:44:37.301 --> 01:44:38.322]  Give me a break.
[01:44:38.322 --> 01:44:42.985]  Most of these people are grandstanding in a cultural takeover.
[01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:46.068]  It's funded by the government and the media to confuse everything.
[01:44:46.068 --> 01:44:48.530]  Everybody's fighting with each other.
[01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:55.335]  But a large percentage of, quote, gay men were grabbed by an older man when they were 10, 11, 12 years old and pedophiled.
[01:44:56.445 --> 01:44:58.447]  Just like Hastert and all the rest of it.
[01:44:58.447 --> 01:45:02.170]  And there's guilds of these people that promote themselves in the government.
[01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:08.016]  Hastert was promoted by a bunch of Republican establishment people when he was the wrestling coach because he was in on the club.
[01:45:08.016 --> 01:45:10.138]  You know, the FBI goes in and covers up Penn State.
[01:45:10.138 --> 01:45:14.181]  This is a real club of aberrant, weird men.
[01:45:14.181 --> 01:45:15.422]  It's a lot worse with men than women.
[01:45:15.422 --> 01:45:17.564]  It's just the criminology that are targeting
[01:45:18.505 --> 01:45:20.187]  Young boys for rape.
[01:45:20.187 --> 01:45:25.313]  Men, quite frankly, from the statistics, are way more often raped than women.
[01:45:25.313 --> 01:45:26.775]  And those are the numbers.
[01:45:26.775 --> 01:45:28.677]  I'm glad you figured out the reports on this.
[01:45:28.677 --> 01:45:31.600]  Now girls get raped too by the uncle, the guy next door.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.301]  They're embarrassed.
[01:45:32.301 --> 01:45:33.262]  They don't say anything about it too.
[01:45:34.123 --> 01:45:35.964]  But the point is, it's pedophilia.
[01:45:35.964 --> 01:45:39.606]  And so what this really is, is the main lining of pedophilia.
[01:45:39.606 --> 01:45:41.927]  There are some people that you could say are naturally gay or whatever.
[01:45:41.927 --> 01:45:43.648]  There are people that are chemically whatever.
[01:45:43.648 --> 01:45:44.768]  The chemicals in the water, fine.
[01:45:44.768 --> 01:45:46.069]  There's a wide spectrum.
[01:45:46.069 --> 01:45:52.952]  But at the heart of the push is to break up families and society using guilds of pedophiles.
[01:45:52.952 --> 01:45:58.895]  And then exactly, there's all these weird cultures of grandmas in criminology.
[01:45:58.895 --> 01:46:00.696]  And older women who also then
[01:46:01.676 --> 01:46:01.736]  Yes.
[01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:27.332]  And then even after he grew up and moved out, she had a doll, these people were rich, had a doll under the bed of him she'd have sex with.
[01:46:27.332 --> 01:46:34.877]  So there's a lot of whacked out people, folks, who want to come into society, want to take over, and want access to your kids.
[01:46:34.877 --> 01:46:41.000]  The UN has NAMBLA as an official member, officially of the UN, and is trying to legalize it.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.964]  Judges from New York to London to Sydney, Australia have come out and said, lower the age down to 12.
[01:46:47.864 --> 01:46:49.826]  Well, next it's going to be 10.
[01:46:49.826 --> 01:46:50.647]  And here's the deal.
[01:46:50.647 --> 01:46:54.170]  Keep your hands off my son and my daughters.
[01:46:54.170 --> 01:46:55.011]  They're innocent.
[01:46:55.011 --> 01:46:55.911]  They're young.
[01:46:55.911 --> 01:46:58.013]  They're going to have their own life.
[01:46:58.013 --> 01:47:02.577]  They're going to have experiences with their peers that are normal and natural.
[01:47:02.577 --> 01:47:10.144]  Separately, though, there are tens of thousands, that's conservative, of charges a year in the U.S., of an 18-year-old woman with a 17-year or 16-year-old boyfriend.
[01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:12.946]  Totally natural.
[01:47:12.946 --> 01:47:13.727]  Totally normal.
[01:47:13.727 --> 01:47:14.887]  Vice versa.
[01:47:14.887 --> 01:47:21.130]  18 year old guy with a 16, 17 year old girlfriend that she saw him as the quarterback when she was a freshman.
[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:22.571]  Now she's a senior.
[01:47:22.571 --> 01:47:24.231]  He's in his first year of college.
[01:47:24.231 --> 01:47:25.012]  They meet up.
[01:47:25.012 --> 01:47:26.693]  They've known each other for years.
[01:47:26.693 --> 01:47:28.273]  They, you know, boom!
[01:47:28.273 --> 01:47:29.554]  They get in love.
[01:47:29.554 --> 01:47:32.595]  And then he'll be a sex offender and they get married and have kids.
[01:47:32.595 --> 01:47:36.437]  There are tens of thousands of people married to their sex offender husband or wife.
[01:47:37.077 --> 01:47:37.737]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:47:37.737 --> 01:47:40.239]  Because there's all these arbitrary labels on everything.
[01:47:40.239 --> 01:47:40.639]  Exactly.
[01:47:40.639 --> 01:47:45.102]  Well, they persecute, just like people's kids die of vaccines and they say shaken baby.
[01:47:45.102 --> 01:47:46.643]  They know full well the vaccine killed them.
[01:47:46.643 --> 01:47:47.364]  Same thing.
[01:47:47.364 --> 01:47:54.748]  You're 18 dating a 17-year-old, they put you in jail or label you as a sex offender, but then Hastert can be screwing little boys.
[01:47:54.748 --> 01:47:55.949]  Right, and completely overlooked.
[01:47:56.269 --> 01:47:58.731]  And that's the thing that... the reason why... I know I'm ranting.
[01:47:58.731 --> 01:48:00.052]  This just really makes me mad, Leigh-Anne.
[01:48:00.052 --> 01:48:00.992]  It makes me mad as well.
[01:48:00.992 --> 01:48:02.974]  And this is why I wanted to get Walt on.
[01:48:02.974 --> 01:48:15.322]  He had a story talking about how it's time for the LGB to remove the T from their name because gay men are always associated with these transgender men and they're completely... it's not the same thing.
[01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:21.606]  And he's talking about how this is a psychological issue that you cannot change your gender.
[01:48:21.606 --> 01:48:23.407]  And it doesn't matter if you get a sex change.
[01:48:23.407 --> 01:48:26.049]  Deep down inside, you know you're still the sex that you were born.
[01:48:26.309 --> 01:48:31.454]  But chemicals can affect areas of the brain to make women attracted to women and men attracted to men.
[01:48:31.454 --> 01:48:31.854]  That's a fact.
[01:48:31.854 --> 01:48:32.855]  And they are putting that out there.
[01:48:32.855 --> 01:48:35.417]  It's been around forever, okay?
[01:48:35.417 --> 01:48:40.602]  So this whole gender identity, this gender dysphoria... Well, it's like two male dogs will start going after each other.
[01:48:40.602 --> 01:48:42.063]  But they can't, yeah.
[01:48:42.063 --> 01:48:43.944]  But they can't, if your parents don't...
[01:48:44.705 --> 01:48:47.587]  Usher you into reality at some point.
[01:48:47.587 --> 01:48:49.388]  Like, this is who you are.
[01:48:49.388 --> 01:48:52.750]  Then you're just going to be living in this delusional state.
[01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:53.610]  Well, let's just say it.
[01:48:53.610 --> 01:49:02.155]  If you don't find Dad's Playboy books when you're 12, and instead some perv at the school teaches you you're a woman, you're going to end up missing out on the family and everything else.
[01:49:02.155 --> 01:49:03.556]  And I'm not saying give your kids Playboy books.
[01:49:03.556 --> 01:49:04.497]  It's a figure of speech.
[01:49:04.497 --> 01:49:07.959]  The point is, are you going to find some Playboy books at the deer camp?
[01:49:07.959 --> 01:49:11.861]  Or are you going to have some guy when you're 12 pick you up at school and take you to a barn?
[01:49:12.981 --> 01:49:21.552]  Well, the thing that makes me so upset about it is that they are giving gender reassignment surgery in Oregon without parental consent.
[01:49:21.552 --> 01:49:26.618]  And in Oregon, if you're 12, 15 years old, you can't even go to an R-rated movie.
[01:49:26.618 --> 01:49:27.580]  You can't buy cigarettes.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:30.844]  My children to go to the planetarium, I have to sign a form.
[01:49:31.224 --> 01:49:36.486]  Yeah, and so he has done so much research because obviously he's been severely affected.
[01:49:36.486 --> 01:49:40.027]  But say that again, they're doing sex changes all over the world on little kids.
[01:49:40.027 --> 01:49:40.667]  Right.
[01:49:40.667 --> 01:49:44.009]  Because they say they think they're a girl and get convinced by a bunch of pervs.
[01:49:44.009 --> 01:49:51.792]  Without parental consent and so it's like the race to be the most progressive and this whole gender dysphoria, gender identity, it's still very new.
[01:49:51.792 --> 01:49:55.473]  We're still researching it and trying to understand what's going on here but yet you're
[01:49:55.913 --> 01:50:03.019]  They're physically mutilating young children who, 94% of these children grow out of gender dysphoria.
[01:50:03.019 --> 01:50:05.981]  They no longer want to express themselves as the opposite.
[01:50:05.981 --> 01:50:10.866]  But there are all these people now encouraging it, like, oh, you're a girl, you think you're a boy, let's do it.
[01:50:10.866 --> 01:50:18.852]  Oh, you're a boy, you think you're a girl, oh, it's wonderful, you're magic now, you're great, here's this community.
[01:50:18.852 --> 01:50:21.174]  Well, look, it's pedophilia being legalized.
[01:50:21.174 --> 01:50:23.896]  All the articles I've seen over the last 20 years, where they'll take
[01:50:24.984 --> 01:50:30.606]  Seventh grade and sixth grade children to a, quote, dormitory at a college for a weekend.
[01:50:30.606 --> 01:50:33.287]  Their parents let them go to learn about sex.
[01:50:33.287 --> 01:50:38.529]  And I can't say on air what they teach sixth and seventh graders, Leanne.
[01:50:38.529 --> 01:50:39.049]  Yeah.
[01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:41.210]  No, it's I've seen their curriculum.
[01:50:42.185 --> 01:50:47.590]  And they'll get some woman in there going, this is how you... I can't even say it on air.
[01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:49.792]  I mean, stuff that's super medically bad for you.
[01:50:49.792 --> 01:50:51.173]  Yeah, and that traumatizes children.
[01:50:51.173 --> 01:50:54.797]  I mean, they teach kids... I can't even tell you what they teach them.
[01:50:54.797 --> 01:50:56.058]  Folks, they got your kids.
[01:50:56.058 --> 01:50:57.219]  It's just horrible.
[01:50:57.219 --> 01:50:59.201]  Leanne, we're going to play this clip of your guest when we come back.
[01:50:59.201 --> 01:50:59.541]  Stay there.
[01:50:59.541 --> 01:51:00.542]  It makes me so angry.
[01:51:00.962 --> 01:51:04.564]  A good stove is at the top of the list for any serious survivalist.

[01:52:01.127 --> 01:52:06.854]  When fresh liquid whey is processed into a dry powder, the special proteins that make up the whey lose their original shapes.
[01:52:06.854 --> 01:52:09.738]  They fold in on themselves and lose their functional value.
[01:52:09.738 --> 01:52:16.527]  One World Whey undergoes a technological enhancement that we believe restores these potent proteins back to their original shapes the body can use.
[01:52:16.807 --> 01:52:23.431]  I chose to try One World Way first before going to a doctor who would likely only prescribe drugs.
[01:52:23.431 --> 01:52:25.693]  To my delight, it worked!
[01:52:25.693 --> 01:52:30.776]  After stabbing pain for years, to have it completely gone is a miracle.
[01:52:30.776 --> 01:52:37.360]  I'd like to also stress that, for me, it took several months of taking One World Way before I had improvement.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.402]  And then an entire year for my gut to feel 100% healed.
[01:52:40.402 --> 01:52:49.568]  So now I tell my friends, give your body time to make use of the healing power of One World Way.

[01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:32.952]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:53:32.952 --> 01:53:35.692]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:53:35.692 --> 01:53:38.453]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:54:14.275 --> 01:54:22.617]  We live in a country where a parent is being investigated for allowing their child to play in the backyard unsupervised.
[01:54:22.617 --> 01:54:28.679]  Yet in states like Oregon, the state is sponsoring sex changes without parental consent.
[01:54:28.679 --> 01:54:36.401]  And so you're so concerned because perhaps there are some underlying psychological issues that aren't even being dealt with because gender
[01:54:37.561 --> 01:54:40.443]  A psychologist is just going to say, oh, I know what this is.
[01:54:40.443 --> 01:54:46.386]  You need to start taking hormone blockers and then we're going to give you a sex change and you'll be fixed.
[01:54:46.386 --> 01:54:46.926]  Right.
[01:54:46.926 --> 01:54:58.753]  The problem with it is, is what we do know is that 90 up to 94 percent of children who at a young age identify as transgender, if we leave them alone and don't
[01:54:59.577 --> 01:55:06.222]  Push or advocate for them to change genders will actually grow out of their gender dysphoria and become normal adults.
[01:55:06.222 --> 01:55:14.467]  The problem today is that all kids, every single kid ever born is going to be curious about gender as they should be.
[01:55:14.467 --> 01:55:25.575]  The difference is that when today a parent sees someone curious about gender, they're identifying him as a transgender and then pushing him to change genders as though it's a good thing.
[01:55:25.575 --> 01:55:28.017]  And I can tell you from my own life, it's not a good thing.
[01:55:29.217 --> 01:55:31.259]  It damages and destroys life.
[01:55:31.259 --> 01:55:33.441]  It develops psychological disorders.
[01:55:33.441 --> 01:55:36.403]  Many of them become alcoholics and drug addicts.
[01:55:36.403 --> 01:55:40.566]  They never get their gender dysphoria resolved through changing genders.
[01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:52.835]  In fact, the original founder of transgenderism, Harry Benjamin, at his clinic found that there were far too many suicides and unhappiness after changing genders.
[01:55:53.893 --> 01:56:05.082]  And so even his own clinicians at that clinic decided to go into psychiatry so that it could actually help people, but still we're caught up in changing people's gender for whatever reason.
[01:56:05.082 --> 01:56:13.249]  It's got to be some power thing from these large, powerful groups in schools and all the way to the White House that I've written about as well.
[01:56:13.249 --> 01:56:13.709]  That's right.
[01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:15.931]  Walt Heyer, big interview coming up tonight.
[01:56:15.931 --> 01:56:20.515]  That's just a sneak peek of the interview with Lee and Mack, but understand, this is why it's been through it.
[01:56:21.355 --> 01:56:22.115]  Okay?
[01:56:22.115 --> 01:56:25.476]  And children are being targeted.
[01:56:25.476 --> 01:56:29.958]  Parents that wanted to confuse their kids and get them sex changes should be getting in trouble.
[01:56:29.958 --> 01:56:40.722]  This is the government, literally, sexually, beyond molesting your children, trying to change them and confuse them to end reproductive activity on this earth.
[01:56:40.722 --> 01:56:42.442]  This is a weapon system.
[01:56:42.442 --> 01:56:45.923]  The well-meaning liberals that get taught in college are low-level.
[01:56:45.923 --> 01:56:47.204]  Everybody's committing suicide.
[01:56:47.204 --> 01:56:50.225]  We better, you know, get more psychiatrists.
[01:56:51.367 --> 01:56:54.250]  The highest level is in gay men committing suicide.
[01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:58.135]  Well, now it's transgenders at the highest level of suicide because they're so unhappy.
[01:56:58.135 --> 01:57:02.920]  And it's like, well, let us run everything or it's you are mean to us is why we're committing suicide.
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.943]  No, the cultures are mean and destructive.
[01:57:05.943 --> 01:57:11.730]  They have bug chasers for 20 years, gay men that want to go out and get HIV and then spread it.
[01:57:12.773 --> 01:57:18.016]  There is a very sick underlying thing to this because it's directed by the globalists.
[01:57:18.016 --> 01:57:18.957]  It's death.
[01:57:18.957 --> 01:57:19.857]  It's eugenics.
[01:57:19.857 --> 01:57:22.119]  And I love those people.
[01:57:22.119 --> 01:57:23.620]  It's why I'm warning them.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.681]  I'm telling you that this is the agenda.
[01:57:25.681 --> 01:57:28.283]  Does it mean some people do this and are perfectly happy?
[01:57:28.283 --> 01:57:29.003]  Absolutely.
[01:57:29.003 --> 01:57:33.366]  But don't tell me I gotta pay for it and don't talk to little kids about sex.
[01:57:33.366 --> 01:57:34.827]  Imagine if a full grown man.
[01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:40.811]  was just out at the park talking to ten-year-old kids, telling little girls, you're a little boy, or vice versa.
[01:57:40.811 --> 01:57:41.791]  They'd be a perv!
[01:57:41.791 --> 01:57:42.832]  They'd be arrested!
[01:57:42.832 --> 01:57:45.073]  How's the state doing it?
[01:57:45.073 --> 01:57:45.953]  Wake up, people.
[01:57:45.953 --> 01:57:47.334]  Leanne, you've got other points.
[01:57:47.334 --> 01:57:48.834]  The drugging of the kids.
[01:57:48.834 --> 01:57:49.594]  Oh, you're a girl.
[01:57:49.594 --> 01:57:50.855]  We're going to make you think you're a girl or boy.
[01:57:51.235 --> 01:57:59.737]  Well, how much sense does it make that parents are being arrested for letting their children walk to the park, or play in the park alone, or walk to school?
[01:57:59.737 --> 01:58:00.177]  So we're on families.
[01:58:00.177 --> 01:58:00.657]  We're on parents.
[01:58:00.657 --> 01:58:09.879]  They're getting arrested, but yet the school can come in and give these kids hormone blockers at 12 years old so that they won't go through puberty, that they can delay puberty.
[01:58:09.879 --> 01:58:14.880]  So give the kid a little bit longer to decide if he's really a boy or a girl.
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.661]  If you start using those hormone blockers, it makes you infertile.
[01:58:18.061 --> 01:58:20.768]  So they've already totally transformed this person's life.
[01:58:20.768 --> 01:58:22.753]  Oh yeah, they're sterilizing you and not telling you.
[01:58:22.753 --> 01:58:22.934]  Right.
[01:58:24.347 --> 01:58:25.688]  It's eugenics.
[01:58:25.688 --> 01:58:26.449]  It's all eugenics.
[01:58:26.449 --> 01:58:27.389]  Come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:27.389 --> 01:58:29.691]  I want you to finish up before Gerald Cilente joins us.

[01:58:57.076 --> 01:58:58.037]  I use them all.
[01:58:58.037 --> 01:58:59.018]  They're phenomenal.
[01:58:59.018 --> 01:58:59.779]  They work.
[01:58:59.779 --> 01:59:00.599]  Buy them, folks.
[01:59:00.599 --> 01:59:01.040]  Thank you, brother.
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.001]  I want to thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:59:03.001 --> 01:59:09.227]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:59:09.227 --> 01:59:11.229]  Welcome to the Info War.

[01:59:21.617 --> 01:59:22.477]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:59:22.477 --> 01:59:23.498]  Have they worked for you?
[01:59:23.498 --> 01:59:26.379]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:59:26.379 --> 01:59:27.700]  What products are you taking?
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:35.744]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[01:59:35.744 --> 01:59:39.226]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilm.

[02:00:15.425 --> 02:00:18.027]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:18.027 --> 02:00:23.530]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:30.814]  Do you know who that is, Leanne?
[02:00:30.814 --> 02:00:34.216]  I do, but now you put me on the spot.
[02:00:34.216 --> 02:00:35.357]  That's some good music right there.
[02:00:35.357 --> 02:00:37.238]  Is it?
[02:00:37.238 --> 02:00:40.960]  By the way, we never play Hollywood Babylon.
[02:00:41.994 --> 02:00:44.016]  I put these two songs in here about a year and a half ago.
[02:00:44.016 --> 02:00:52.782]  We always play London Dungeon.
[02:00:52.782 --> 02:00:56.125]  They like to lock us up.
[02:00:56.125 --> 02:00:57.566]  Put us in their pretty pens.
[02:00:57.566 --> 02:01:00.568]  Alright, I'm going to stop right there.
[02:01:00.568 --> 02:01:01.849]  Leanne, I am really wound up today.
[02:01:01.849 --> 02:01:03.230]  I've gotten so angry.
[02:01:03.230 --> 02:01:04.391]  Great report you're putting out.
[02:01:04.391 --> 02:01:05.132]  Trying to warn people.
[02:01:06.673 --> 02:01:13.559]  This is a full genetic takeover, a full bullying, where you can't use the word mother, father, or he or she, because it hurts these people.
[02:01:13.559 --> 02:01:14.980]  They're the new God.
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:21.905]  They're just the new used, protected class that's actually being killed and sterilized and chopped up and suiciding.
[02:01:21.905 --> 02:01:25.228]  But they hold them up as the new rock stars, you know, confused about life?
[02:01:25.228 --> 02:01:25.989]  Get on Prozac.
[02:01:25.989 --> 02:01:26.789]  Confused about life?
[02:01:26.789 --> 02:01:29.231]  Go cut your genitals off, or, you know, do this or that.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:41.368]  And it's an attack on the family, an attack on humans, and it's an admitted attack, but regardless, the government and the state shouldn't be involved with your six-year-old trying to confuse them.
[02:01:41.368 --> 02:01:42.229]  Leigh-Anne, other points?
[02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:49.654]  Well, it's just like when you watch the news and you know that you're going to get a certain slant depending on who the news outlet is.
[02:01:49.654 --> 02:01:52.697]  There are other places out there where you can get information to
[02:01:53.517 --> 02:02:01.100]  If you're a parent that's dealing with this or a trans person that is kind of wondering, there is some other information out there that you can find.
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:11.724]  I would highly recommend going to his sex change regret because he has tons of information, all the studies that they're not going to show you in the mainstream media because that doesn't suit the agenda.
[02:02:11.724 --> 02:02:13.425]  It doesn't push what they want.
[02:02:13.425 --> 02:02:14.685]  They want everyone.
[02:02:14.685 --> 02:02:17.306]  And you know, I mean, you've seen Prince, David Bowie.
[02:02:17.306 --> 02:02:19.187]  I mean, these are mainstream people who have
[02:02:20.233 --> 02:02:22.514]  You know, dealt with their gender.
[02:02:22.514 --> 02:02:26.936]  And here's the deal, if I like their music, if I like their music, I've never attacked them.
[02:02:26.936 --> 02:02:28.597]  I've said I like some of their music.
[02:02:28.597 --> 02:02:30.098]  David Bowie more than Prince.
[02:02:30.098 --> 02:02:31.839]  But I like a lot of Prince's music.
[02:02:31.839 --> 02:02:32.939]  I didn't care what he looked like.
[02:02:32.939 --> 02:02:34.260]  I like the music.
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:35.621]  It's because I'm tolerant.
[02:02:35.621 --> 02:02:36.221]  I don't care.
[02:02:36.221 --> 02:02:38.542]  The point is, though, I don't need to be force fed this.
[02:02:38.542 --> 02:02:41.964]  And look, now they've got 50 different genders in Facebook.
[02:02:43.331 --> 02:02:44.812]  It's all just made up.
[02:02:44.812 --> 02:02:52.077]  This is just a theory they came up with and now they get billions of taxpayer money to chop off people's, you know, what's.
[02:02:52.077 --> 02:03:00.142]  Yeah, well, it's like, go out there, be expressive, do whatever you want, but same, you know, Prince and David Bowie, they went on, married women, had a bunch of children, lived great.
[02:03:00.142 --> 02:03:03.645]  And they weren't trying to push it on kids and trying to confuse six-year-olds.
[02:03:03.945 --> 02:03:04.726]  And that's the thing.
[02:03:04.726 --> 02:03:06.347]  I'm libertarian.
[02:03:06.347 --> 02:03:07.568]  Do whatever the heck you want.
[02:03:07.568 --> 02:03:09.349]  I'll call you whatever pronoun you want.
[02:03:09.349 --> 02:03:18.916]  But that doesn't mean you have to require, federally mandate, that the majority of humans have to suppress their understanding of reality.
[02:03:18.916 --> 02:03:23.940]  I'll be respectful, but we also need to give people some other information that's out there.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:32.087]  For them, that they don't want them to see, like 94% of people, children, will not remain gender dysphoric.
[02:03:32.087 --> 02:03:35.510]  You grow out of it, especially if you get the proper help and not the encouragement.
[02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:38.453]  So that's bigoted, you grow out of it and decide to be a male or female?
[02:03:38.453 --> 02:03:45.559]  You know there's male and female squirrels too, and male and female dolphins, and male and female eagles, they're bigoted.
[02:03:45.559 --> 02:03:48.742]  Why aren't there like separate bathrooms for transgendered bald eagles?
[02:03:49.445 --> 02:03:50.526]  Well, and you know what?
[02:03:50.526 --> 02:03:55.089]  Some little girls, you want to go out and fight with the boys and get dirty and stuff.
[02:03:55.089 --> 02:03:57.210]  But that's part of femininity.
[02:03:57.210 --> 02:03:58.511]  Oh, she's a tomboy.
[02:03:58.511 --> 02:03:59.892]  It doesn't mean you're a boy.
[02:03:59.892 --> 02:04:06.216]  My oldest daughter loves to play army, loves to shoot guns, beat me up, you name it.
[02:04:06.216 --> 02:04:09.358]  But she also loves lipstick and girly stuff.
[02:04:09.358 --> 02:04:09.578]  Yeah.
[02:04:10.542 --> 02:04:12.703]  Oh, you're really a man.
[02:04:12.703 --> 02:04:13.243]  No, she's not.
[02:04:13.243 --> 02:04:14.363]  She's a woman.
[02:04:14.363 --> 02:04:16.264]  The women I have better be tough.
[02:04:16.264 --> 02:04:16.744]  Exactly.
[02:04:16.744 --> 02:04:17.804]  That's feminine.
[02:04:17.804 --> 02:04:22.625]  Since when is it male that a woman likes to go camping or a woman likes to go fishing?
[02:04:22.625 --> 02:04:24.386]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:04:24.386 --> 02:04:25.366]  That's feminine.
[02:04:25.366 --> 02:04:25.626]  Right.
[02:04:25.626 --> 02:04:28.187]  And I think that's what a lot of parents want to fight back.
[02:04:28.187 --> 02:04:33.788]  You know, why are all the little toy vacuums and brooms and stuff in the girls' section?
[02:04:33.788 --> 02:04:37.209]  By the way, though, my youngest daughter is a girly girl.
[02:04:37.209 --> 02:04:38.290]  She's a girly girl.
[02:04:38.290 --> 02:04:39.090]  She's really cute.
[02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:42.172]  But little boys like to cook also, you know.
[02:04:42.172 --> 02:04:44.794]  Maybe they want a little Betty Crocker thing.
[02:04:44.794 --> 02:04:46.356]  Well, my dad's just as good a cook as mine.
[02:04:46.356 --> 02:04:46.956]  I'm a great cook.
[02:04:46.956 --> 02:04:47.657]  What are you talking about?
[02:04:47.657 --> 02:04:48.457]  Well, there you go.
[02:04:48.457 --> 02:04:54.242]  The point is, Mama was doing the cooking usually, but Daddy was out, you know, in the coal mine.
[02:04:54.242 --> 02:04:54.722]  Right.
[02:04:54.722 --> 02:04:56.204]  He wanted to be back doing the cooking.
[02:04:56.204 --> 02:04:58.285]  Taking care of Santa on the coal mine.
[02:04:58.285 --> 02:04:58.886]  Thank you, Leanne.
[02:04:58.886 --> 02:04:59.526]  Reports tonight.
[02:04:59.526 --> 02:04:59.867]  Great job.
[02:05:00.387 --> 02:05:12.355]  Refrigerators zapped off in kitchens across Venezuela as the government turned off the electricity supply to help ease the power outage that is worsening the country's economic crisis, reports Yahoo News.
[02:05:12.355 --> 02:05:20.781]  It is the latest drastic measure by the government in a crisis that has already seen Venezuelans waiting for hours to buy scarce supplies and shops.
[02:05:21.101 --> 02:05:28.344]  Machines for processing bank card payments also wouldn't work without power, meaning that some left stores without buying anything.
[02:05:28.344 --> 02:05:32.286]  President Nicolas Maduro's government blames the power outage on weather.
[02:05:32.286 --> 02:05:38.829]  Critics, however, say it is the result of economic mismanagement and inefficient running of the energy network.
[02:05:38.829 --> 02:05:44.331]  Venezuela's economy has plunged along with the price of the oil it relies on for foreign revenues.
[02:05:44.631 --> 02:05:49.934]  Citizens are suffering shortages of medicines and goods such as toilet paper and cooking oil.
[02:05:49.934 --> 02:05:53.717]  Berduro blames the collapse on an economic war by capitalists.
[02:05:53.717 --> 02:05:57.419]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[02:07:02.132 --> 02:07:03.833]  Oil of oregano formulation.
[02:07:03.833 --> 02:07:09.417]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:07:09.417 --> 02:07:11.518]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form.
[02:07:11.898 --> 02:07:17.780]  of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:23.901]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:07:23.901 --> 02:07:33.023]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:33.023 --> 02:07:38.825]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:07:39.225 --> 02:07:45.972]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:45.972 --> 02:07:51.357]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:07:51.357 --> 02:07:53.839]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:53.839 --> 02:07:55.861]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:11.949 --> 02:08:19.391]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.391 --> 02:08:24.013]  We're going to cover the big primary coming up tonight, Election 2016.
[02:08:24.013 --> 02:08:27.634]  A lot of other news with Gerald Cilente in this hour.
[02:08:27.634 --> 02:08:29.154]  They will now be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:08:29.154 --> 02:08:34.236]  There will be live coverage tonight, seven until probably nine or ten, when the results come in on these key states.
[02:08:34.236 --> 02:08:35.936]  We'll be breaking that down in a moment.
[02:08:35.936 --> 02:08:39.277]  Joe Biggs is running around the office, he said, with goosebumps.
[02:08:39.277 --> 02:08:40.538]  He showed me, he actually has them.
[02:08:41.961 --> 02:08:47.464]  Because he served a lot of tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, got shot and blown up repeatedly in armored vehicles.
[02:08:47.464 --> 02:08:49.885]  So he's in a combat group.
[02:08:49.885 --> 02:08:58.510]  Saw a lot of fighting and he is freaking out over this Italian magazine article and other things dealing with Mexico and ISIS down there, which we know is down there.
[02:08:58.510 --> 02:08:59.570]  We know they're bringing them into Europe.
[02:08:59.570 --> 02:09:04.073]  They're bringing them in here and Biggs is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour and then he'll be on with
[02:09:04.713 --> 02:09:13.400]  David Knight for probably 10-15 minutes in the fourth hour, because Biggs has been down there to the very area investigating this and found Mosque and all sorts of other stuff.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:23.228]  And the FBI came and questioned Biggs and said, yeah, we don't even go into that area, but we think what the intel that you and Judicial Watch has is very serious.
[02:09:23.228 --> 02:09:25.490]  Now again, there is radical Islam.
[02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:28.893]  Why is our government opening up Europe and the U.S.
[02:09:28.893 --> 02:09:29.674]  to bring these people in?
[02:09:31.570 --> 02:09:32.471]  It's crazy.
[02:09:32.471 --> 02:09:36.273]  So we'll pop in with a report on that as we get it all codified and ready.
[02:09:36.273 --> 02:09:37.433]  But it's read, linked up on Drudge.
[02:09:37.433 --> 02:09:41.475]  We've also added the article to Infowars.com.
[02:09:41.475 --> 02:09:49.160]  Also coming up, Obama's global warming plan cost poor Americans $44 billion and raised taxes by 166%.
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:54.723]  So we're going to be going over all of that as well.
[02:09:54.723 --> 02:09:56.944]  But I know, I'm just guessing.
[02:09:58.769 --> 02:10:00.790]  And I know he's an honest guy, so he'll tell me if I'm wrong.
[02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:02.391]  If I'm wrong, he'll correct me.
[02:10:02.391 --> 02:10:09.556]  I bet money that Gerald Solente, because this guy reads like 15 newspapers a day, hundreds of news articles online.
[02:10:09.556 --> 02:10:10.636]  My crew's been up there a few times.
[02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:13.098]  They say it's all he's constantly doing is researching, which is great.
[02:10:13.098 --> 02:10:15.679]  I try to do that too.
[02:10:15.679 --> 02:10:22.263]  But I bet he wants to talk about 16 times Obama said there would be no boots on the ground in Syria.
[02:10:22.263 --> 02:10:23.824]  We have 16 times he said it.
[02:10:23.824 --> 02:10:26.126]  I only played four of them earlier, because I'm not going to play 16.
[02:10:27.699 --> 02:10:37.365]  And now they've had the head of the Defense Department spokesperson via the State Department come out and say it was never said and laugh at the media.
[02:10:37.365 --> 02:10:45.049]  That's worse than Gibbs saying there is no drone program years and years after it was public and in the news.
[02:10:45.049 --> 02:10:51.113]  That's like saying the Chicago Bears aren't out of Chicago.
[02:10:51.113 --> 02:10:55.616]  It's that or Superman isn't fictionally from Krypton.
[02:10:57.501 --> 02:10:59.682]  Or Batman isn't from Gotham.
[02:10:59.682 --> 02:11:05.683]  I mean, I use childlike analogies because this is ridiculous.
[02:11:05.683 --> 02:11:12.145]  In fact, we should get the clip of Gibbs saying, you know, I was told to say that there weren't any drones, even though this is an admitted program.
[02:11:12.145 --> 02:11:23.589]  That's Toto pulling back the curtain and take that clip with Toto and then cut it in to Obama saying there's no boots on the ground ever, I promise, I pledge, and then cut into the State Department saying it never happened and the Pentagon saying it.
[02:11:24.469 --> 02:11:36.714]  And then I come out and talk about Beyonce, and the Super Bowl, and our new video, and MTV admittedly having the CIA, that's been declassified for years, with their anti-family pro-riot message, but also the Ford Foundation.
[02:11:36.714 --> 02:11:42.677]  I show people the articles, and they've had tons of publications.
[02:11:42.677 --> 02:11:45.878]  Esquire, New York Daily News come out and say I'm insane, it's a lie.
[02:11:48.482 --> 02:12:01.349]  What is the tactic here with the ball-faced lying, like saying there are no death panels in Obamacare, or it's free, or raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit, or no one's coming after your guns.
[02:12:01.349 --> 02:12:04.830]  Bloomberg says, I believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:06.651]  I'm a big gun supporter.
[02:12:06.651 --> 02:12:08.552]  He has 15 bodyguards on average.
[02:12:08.552 --> 02:12:09.673]  We have all these videos.
[02:12:09.673 --> 02:12:11.294]  He has guns.
[02:12:11.294 --> 02:12:15.356]  He wants total gun bans, like Chicago and D.C.
[02:12:17.113 --> 02:12:19.414]  But he doesn't want your guns.
[02:12:19.414 --> 02:12:20.414]  Is it arrogance?
[02:12:20.414 --> 02:12:21.254]  Is it delusion?
[02:12:21.254 --> 02:12:22.155]  Is it disdain?
[02:12:22.155 --> 02:12:23.955]  Are they trying to condition us to accept it?
[02:12:23.955 --> 02:12:33.318]  Because they had a Gallup poll and another poll the last two weeks and both of them showed 6%, we can pull them up, trust in the mainstream media.
[02:12:35.216 --> 02:12:38.098]  We've got actuaries, and I've admitted it.
[02:12:38.098 --> 02:12:39.779]  I mean, that's how the internet works.
[02:12:39.779 --> 02:12:40.800]  We've got it all turned off.
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.083]  We don't track everybody, but we can see the big actuaries from Google.
[02:12:44.083 --> 02:12:48.126]  We have like a 91% approval rating online.
[02:12:48.126 --> 02:12:51.768]  We have people absolutely trust us and love us.
[02:12:51.768 --> 02:13:00.675]  And it's such a confidence people have in us that I get mad at myself when I listen to rebroadcasts, making little mistakes, or I could have said something better, or getting a name wrong.
[02:13:00.675 --> 02:13:02.837]  But people know, I'm really trying to tell you the truth.
[02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:08.232]  And we are decades usually ahead of everybody else.
[02:13:08.232 --> 02:13:09.713]  Just like Gerald Cilente.
[02:13:09.713 --> 02:13:10.994]  That's why he's a best-selling author.
[02:13:10.994 --> 02:13:12.155]  That's why he's successful.
[02:13:12.155 --> 02:13:14.576]  Because people are looking for the truth.
[02:13:14.576 --> 02:13:15.256]  Not arrogance.
[02:13:15.256 --> 02:13:17.698]  I'm so smart, I know it all.
[02:13:17.698 --> 02:13:22.601]  But man, the minute I saw on the sheet this morning, they had a clip of the State Department.
[02:13:24.301 --> 02:13:29.450]  Yesterday saying that Obama never said that there wouldn't be boots on the ground, never pledged there wouldn't be.
[02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:33.638]  I just sat back and I went, there's clips of him saying that, and I go, we already have it 16 times.
[02:13:35.609 --> 02:13:39.131]  But in case you're a new listener, you don't believe me, you know, because I'm the conspiracy person.
[02:13:39.131 --> 02:13:41.912]  I question mainstream media that's known liars.
[02:13:41.912 --> 02:13:44.013]  Even USA Today had to admit it.
[02:13:44.013 --> 02:13:46.654]  16 times Obama said there would be no boats on the ground in Syria.
[02:13:46.654 --> 02:13:48.435]  Now, I'm speculating here.
[02:13:48.435 --> 02:13:49.756]  I usually go off facts.
[02:13:49.756 --> 02:13:51.136]  Gerald, am I wrong?
[02:13:51.136 --> 02:13:53.478]  Because I never talk to you before we come on the show, or very rarely.
[02:13:53.478 --> 02:13:54.878]  You know, we don't tell you what the subjects are.
[02:13:54.878 --> 02:13:59.520]  I always just, you know, respect the fact that you are out there looking at really important stuff.
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.361]  I ask questions, you bring up topics.
[02:14:01.361 --> 02:14:04.523]  Were you going to bring this up today, or is my instinct wrong?
[02:14:05.538 --> 02:14:09.380]  Well actually, you know, we do Trends in the News each weekday night.
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:12.141]  Part of the subscription to the Trends Journal.
[02:14:12.141 --> 02:14:14.802]  And that was our broadcast last night.
[02:14:14.802 --> 02:14:18.344]  With Obama pledging no boots on the ground.
[02:14:18.344 --> 02:14:20.525]  And it's the same thing with Iraq.
[02:14:20.525 --> 02:14:21.986]  No boots on the ground.
[02:14:21.986 --> 02:14:24.907]  We're going to save them Yazidis up in the mountains.
[02:14:24.907 --> 02:14:25.688]  Remember that one?
[02:14:26.448 --> 02:14:28.930]  And he's lied about everything.
[02:14:28.930 --> 02:14:37.256]  He's a, you know, he's a traitor to this country, a real disgrace, and by their deed you shall know them.
[02:14:37.256 --> 02:14:43.180]  Hey folks, the first day he was in office, I'm going to close Guantanamo by the end of the year.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:49.784]  Oh, remember, you know, he was just over there in Europe, you know, championing more war.
[02:14:49.784 --> 02:14:59.011]  The last time when he went as candidate Obama to Germany, there were hundreds of thousands of people out there cheering him on.
[02:14:59.011 --> 02:15:01.332]  He was going to be the man of peace.
[02:15:01.332 --> 02:15:03.274]  He even won the Peace Prize.
[02:15:03.274 --> 02:15:06.116]  We should call the Peace Prize a piece of crap.
[02:15:06.596 --> 02:15:13.638]  He goes on to invade Libya, destroys Syria, Assad has to go, on and on.
[02:15:13.638 --> 02:15:18.178]  A troop increase of, what, 33,000 in Afghanistan?
[02:15:18.178 --> 02:15:21.099]  Again, more troops back into Iraq.
[02:15:21.099 --> 02:15:23.060]  He's lied about everything that he's promised.
[02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:30.921]  I agree, but here's my question, because you worked as a top lobbyist, you've worked for the biggest corporations before you just broke off and became a journalist, what, 25, 30 years ago.
[02:15:30.921 --> 02:15:33.942]  Gerald Celente, TrendsResearch.com, Trends Journal.
[02:15:35.217 --> 02:15:37.419]  Why are they lying more?
[02:15:37.419 --> 02:15:39.100]  Clearly they're lying more, right?
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:43.703]  And it's more brazen, more naked, and then their credibility's gone from like 15% to 6%.
[02:15:43.703 --> 02:15:53.750]  I mean, do they understand that they have the credibility of a rotting, dead dog that they're telling us is a delicious, fresh Christmas turkey?
[02:15:54.994 --> 02:15:58.997]  Well, again, go back to what you were saying about the media.
[02:15:58.997 --> 02:16:01.239]  It's a 6% rating among the people.
[02:16:01.239 --> 02:16:05.863]  You know, they rated the worst job being a reporter for a newspaper.
[02:16:06.866 --> 02:16:09.769]  So there is no press anymore.
[02:16:09.769 --> 02:16:16.977]  Every time you go on to these shows, you see them all, whether it's Fox, CNN, ABC, CBS.
[02:16:16.977 --> 02:16:19.340]  It's the same paid flunkies.
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:20.321]  That's all they are.
[02:16:20.321 --> 02:16:24.846]  They're paid prostitutes coming out as, quote, experts.
[02:16:24.846 --> 02:16:26.428]  They're on the payroll.
[02:16:26.428 --> 02:16:27.789]  So it's one club.
[02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:31.992]  And yes, the lying has never been at this level.
[02:16:31.992 --> 02:16:34.813]  No one ever calls them out.
[02:16:34.813 --> 02:16:40.335]  And when they do call them out, it's only for a very short amount of time.
[02:16:40.335 --> 02:16:42.496]  So no, it's never been like this.
[02:16:42.496 --> 02:16:47.679]  You can never get away with the amount of lies that Obama has said.
[02:16:47.679 --> 02:16:51.321]  It's unprecedented.
[02:16:51.321 --> 02:16:56.523]  And again, his believers continue to defend him.
[02:16:58.407 --> 02:17:04.628]  Well, I tell you, Gerald, a lot of this is comical, but a lot of it's also very, very sad.
[02:17:04.628 --> 02:17:21.631]  Like, they've had, as I mentioned earlier, scores of big media outlets come out and say that I'm lying about the CIA being involved in domestic media, when, as you know, three years ago, as part of a PSYOP, it was all over the news that they, quote, will even lie to us for our own good.
[02:17:21.631 --> 02:17:24.812]  They used the word deception, and they're going to work with local media
[02:17:25.732 --> 02:17:29.373]  And of course they're working with the NFL and MTV's the worst.
[02:17:29.373 --> 02:17:30.954]  They admittedly get money.
[02:17:30.954 --> 02:17:34.575]  Beyonce is on record hooked into all these combines.
[02:17:34.575 --> 02:17:38.917]  And then they have the nerve to act like I'm crazy to say there's a CIA connection to the media.
[02:17:39.755 --> 02:17:45.376]  Well, look, the CIA has been connected to the media since the beginning of the CIA.
[02:17:45.376 --> 02:17:46.116]  It's a fact.
[02:17:46.116 --> 02:17:54.158]  They go after people like you and me because we're telling the truth and exposing their lies.
[02:17:54.158 --> 02:18:06.501]  So they take cheap shots and will do anything to destroy anyone pointing out what liars, hypocrites, sociopaths and psychopaths they are and those who they are defending.
[02:18:06.561 --> 02:18:09.022]  Gerald, what point have we gotten to with their credibility?
[02:18:09.022 --> 02:18:13.925]  I mean, what happens when it goes to 1% or .5 or something?
[02:18:13.925 --> 02:18:19.248]  I mean, this huge rotting facade is blowing in the wind like a rotten barn.
[02:18:19.248 --> 02:18:20.189]  How does it fall?
[02:18:20.189 --> 02:18:21.610]  Does it fall?
[02:18:21.610 --> 02:18:28.414]  Or do these crazies have a nuclear war and put out a press release when everybody's dead to themselves in a bunker that no war happened?
[02:18:29.127 --> 02:18:34.209]  Well, I don't think they'd want to put out a nuclear war, but they have crazy people that will certainly start one.
[02:18:34.209 --> 02:18:35.409]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:18:35.409 --> 02:18:36.450]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:36.450 --> 02:18:41.972]  When they put out delusions like this, historically it will infect their own brains, and they'll think they can do anything.
[02:18:43.197 --> 02:18:43.998]  Exactly.
[02:18:43.998 --> 02:18:47.079]  And look, it's the language that they use.
[02:18:47.079 --> 02:18:49.161]  They use the language of hate.
[02:18:49.161 --> 02:18:56.185]  How many times have we heard from the New York Times, CNN, that Russia invaded Ukraine?
[02:18:56.185 --> 02:18:57.746]  They put it right there.
[02:18:57.746 --> 02:18:58.866]  Russia never invaded.
[02:18:58.866 --> 02:19:00.467]  Or Russia invaded Georgia.
[02:19:00.467 --> 02:19:02.128]  Or Russia invaded Syria.
[02:19:02.128 --> 02:19:03.229]  All horse crap.
[02:19:04.153 --> 02:19:05.193]  Exactly.
[02:19:05.193 --> 02:19:07.594]  So again, and then you look at the connections.
[02:19:07.594 --> 02:19:11.194]  I mean, who's that little boy they got on ABC?
[02:19:11.194 --> 02:19:12.515]  Stephanopoulos?
[02:19:12.515 --> 02:19:13.935]  Yeah, Stephan this.
[02:19:13.935 --> 02:19:15.115]  What was he with?
[02:19:15.115 --> 02:19:17.616]  He was the flunky for Clinton.
[02:19:17.616 --> 02:19:21.637]  Who was that guy, Carney, before Obama's spokesperson?
[02:19:21.637 --> 02:19:23.277]  Carney, Carnival Man?
[02:19:23.277 --> 02:19:26.098]  Oh yeah, another flunky with Time Magazine.
[02:19:26.098 --> 02:19:27.478]  Look who's married to whom?
[02:19:27.978 --> 02:19:30.000]  Look at the connections between them.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.022]  There is no free press.
[02:19:32.022 --> 02:19:36.707]  There's no free press, just like there's no free United States.
[02:19:36.707 --> 02:19:43.995]  I hear Obama going down to Cuba, shooting his mouth off about freedom and democracy.
[02:19:44.335 --> 02:19:51.761]  And now they have to have it over there while they're arresting everybody protesting down in Washington, D.C.
[02:19:51.761 --> 02:19:53.303]  Oh, you want to protest?
[02:19:53.303 --> 02:19:57.406]  We'll give you a free protest zone.
[02:19:57.406 --> 02:19:57.847]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:57.847 --> 02:20:03.191]  Oh, by the way, and we'll exclude people from that zone that we don't want.
[02:20:03.191 --> 02:20:06.494]  Wait till you see the carnival show with the president.
[02:20:07.795 --> 02:20:17.301]  And the whole leftist movement now all over the place says we want safe spaces everywhere where no one who's a libertarian or someone we disagree with is even allowed to be on the street.
[02:20:17.301 --> 02:20:21.104]  They'll come over and attack you and the police have been ordered to let them do it.
[02:20:21.104 --> 02:20:27.428]  And the faculty at colleges will even help attack their own students that dare have their own private meeting.
[02:20:27.748 --> 02:20:31.750]  That was authorized in the Commons area for Donald Trump.
[02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:36.932]  And they show up and beat him up, and the school says, good job, beating people up is good.
[02:20:36.932 --> 02:20:40.133]  I mean, this is sick authoritarianism.
[02:20:40.133 --> 02:20:40.793]  Well, exactly.
[02:20:40.793 --> 02:20:46.636]  I was going to say, wait till you see when they have the conventions.
[02:20:47.935 --> 02:20:50.577]  You're going to see people roped off miles away.
[02:20:50.577 --> 02:20:55.859]  They're not going to let anybody get anywhere, except the people they want to get through.
[02:20:55.859 --> 02:20:57.340]  Then they'll let them through.
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:59.661]  Just like what happened over there in Chicago.
[02:20:59.661 --> 02:21:00.421]  Oh, here's an example.
[02:21:00.421 --> 02:21:03.763]  The RNC will not release my crew in five or six hotel rooms, so I'm having to do other stuff.
[02:21:04.203 --> 02:21:05.924]  They just say, no, we have all the hotels in Cleveland.
[02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:06.745]  You have to go through us.
[02:21:06.745 --> 02:21:07.686]  No, you can't have it.
[02:21:07.686 --> 02:21:09.547]  And no, we're not giving you press passes.
[02:21:09.547 --> 02:21:12.789]  Even though when I was only on like 30 radio stations, I could always get them.
[02:21:12.789 --> 02:21:15.171]  They're now going, no, you don't get to go in.
[02:21:15.171 --> 02:21:17.332]  We'll let anybody else in, but not Alex Jones.
[02:21:17.332 --> 02:21:21.935]  And they're trying to ban Roger Stone from the events because he's kind of like the shadow campaign manager.
[02:21:21.935 --> 02:21:23.716]  Let's just admit it.
[02:21:23.716 --> 02:21:32.082]  The shadow campaign manager, the former head of Trump's campaign, they're talking about trying to not let him in or banning him from Cleveland or having him arrested, Gerald.
[02:21:33.035 --> 02:21:34.956]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:21:34.956 --> 02:21:36.297]  There is no freedom.
[02:21:36.297 --> 02:21:38.578]  So there's no freedom of press.
[02:21:38.578 --> 02:21:40.239]  The elections are rigged.
[02:21:40.239 --> 02:21:42.600]  This isn't a democracy.
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:44.200]  It's a dumbocracy.
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:45.461]  How can anybody call it free?
[02:21:45.461 --> 02:21:47.302]  Look at the gangs we've got running the show.
[02:21:47.302 --> 02:21:48.963]  Idiocracy.
[02:21:48.963 --> 02:21:50.063]  Yeah.
[02:21:50.063 --> 02:21:50.523]  All right.
[02:21:50.523 --> 02:21:51.344]  I asked a few questions.
[02:21:51.344 --> 02:21:53.005]  You went off on a beautiful jag there.
[02:21:53.005 --> 02:21:54.365]  Better rant than I could do.
[02:21:54.365 --> 02:21:58.567]  What is front and center on the radar of the great Gerald Cilente today?
[02:21:58.567 --> 02:22:00.048]  I mean, what are the trends?
[02:22:00.048 --> 02:22:00.768]  What's the big news?
[02:22:00.768 --> 02:22:01.629]  What's the next shooter drop?
[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:08.615]  Well, the one is, you know, people should listen to what Soros said last week about China.
[02:22:08.615 --> 02:22:12.358]  And he's concerned about the Chinese economy going to crash.
[02:22:13.323 --> 02:22:19.725]  And again, you get the prostitutes on CNBC, MSNBC, Bloomberg.
[02:22:19.725 --> 02:22:25.968]  And again, these are all paid people for by and large that they have on there as experts.
[02:22:25.968 --> 02:22:27.868]  And they're saying, no, it's not that bad.
[02:22:27.868 --> 02:22:29.149]  They just came out.
[02:22:29.149 --> 02:22:33.130]  China has a debt to GDP ratio now of about 250 percent.
[02:22:35.211 --> 02:22:44.353]  The only reason the Chinese economy is growing at all is they're putting in unprecedented amounts of stimulus through bank loans.
[02:22:44.353 --> 02:22:56.357]  So on the economic front, you take a look over at Europe, even with negative interest rates, we're looking at the European Central Bank buying back 80 billion euros.
[02:22:56.357 --> 02:23:00.978]  Hold on, before you go to the laundry list of why we're in trouble that you've predicted accurately and others have,
[02:23:01.678 --> 02:23:07.702]  It's pretty much now admitted that we're going down the tubes, that QE failed, so they're going to go even further to negative rates.
[02:23:07.702 --> 02:23:14.087]  Specifically though, where are we just in general in your view worldwide?
[02:23:14.087 --> 02:23:15.488]  A depression in most areas?
[02:23:15.488 --> 02:23:16.449]  Recessions in the West?
[02:23:18.018 --> 02:23:19.820]  It's a global recession.
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:37.761]  You have to look at the countries, whether it's Venezuela, which you were playing a clip on earlier, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Nigeria, you know, the largest countries in Africa, the 11th largest oil exporter in the world.
[02:23:39.143 --> 02:23:40.144]  They need money.
[02:23:40.144 --> 02:23:41.646]  Angola.
[02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:43.187]  Kazakhstan.
[02:23:43.187 --> 02:23:45.149]  You name the country.
[02:23:45.149 --> 02:23:52.397]  Every country that's commodity rich is becoming poor as commodity prices continue to decline.
[02:23:52.397 --> 02:23:53.619]  Saudi Arabia is having to borrow money.
[02:23:54.727 --> 02:24:00.492]  Saudi Arabia just borrowed $10 billion, and it's their first borrowing since 1991.
[02:24:00.492 --> 02:24:04.916]  They need oil at $100 a barrel to break even.
[02:24:04.916 --> 02:24:07.759]  It's floating around the 40s mark.
[02:24:07.759 --> 02:24:12.263]  So you're looking and then going back to saying, what's going to happen?
[02:24:12.263 --> 02:24:20.050]  You just saw Obama go over to Europe, preach war, and talk about globalization.
[02:24:20.851 --> 02:24:23.633]  So they know the problems are there.
[02:24:23.633 --> 02:24:35.103]  And by the way, one thing missing to me in America is that real strong third party movement that you're seeing around the world.
[02:24:35.103 --> 02:24:39.066]  They just had a referendum in the Netherlands.
[02:24:40.167 --> 02:24:54.153]  And by the way, the referendum happened because of a satirical group that got enough people signed on to put a referendum out, not to allow Ukraine into the European Union.
[02:24:54.153 --> 02:24:56.694]  The people voted.
[02:24:56.694 --> 02:25:00.975]  You're seeing what's going on in Europe with Obama going over there.
[02:25:00.975 --> 02:25:04.297]  The people want to break out of the Eurozone.
[02:25:04.297 --> 02:25:04.877]  The Brexit.
[02:25:04.877 --> 02:25:06.738]  From the UK, the Brexit.
[02:25:08.206 --> 02:25:13.188]  They're very concerned about this because it's a breakup of globalization.
[02:25:13.188 --> 02:25:21.592]  And the globalists, as you know, correct me if I'm wrong, they always thought they would have managed crises they used to bring in total world government between the three power blocks.
[02:25:21.592 --> 02:25:30.416]  But it appears from my research, it's not going as they thought and that their whole world government, New World Order project is now in deep trouble and is being fundamentally
[02:25:32.643 --> 02:25:51.156]  Broken, not just financially, but the minds of the people, because worldwide, the left, the right, you name it, whether it's the Liberal Mayor of London, very prominent, or whether it's right-wing groups like UKIP, it's becoming very popular to be anti-New World Order, and my worldview, your worldview, very similar to each other, are being proven
[02:25:51.736 --> 02:25:56.717]  The conspiracy theory worldview as the new cosmology, because it's really the reality.
[02:25:56.717 --> 02:26:10.161]  Doesn't mean we have all the answers, but truly, this populist, anti-New World Order, anti-corporate fascism movement is now transcending their lies, offering a new narrative much closer to reality.
[02:26:10.161 --> 02:26:14.623]  I think the New World Order project is in deep, you know what, Gerald, is that an accurate statement?
[02:26:14.623 --> 02:26:15.743]  Tell me what you think.
[02:26:16.343 --> 02:26:18.345]  Well, go by the facts.
[02:26:18.345 --> 02:26:19.306]  Of course it's accurate.
[02:26:19.306 --> 02:26:22.830]  Look what happened last week over in Austria.
[02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:29.276]  You had, again, a new party coming in, and now it looks like they're going to be gaining power.
[02:26:29.276 --> 02:26:31.739]  And that's where, again, this is what's missing in America.
[02:26:31.739 --> 02:26:35.923]  Go take a look at what happened also in German elections just a week ago.
[02:26:36.866 --> 02:26:38.247]  A new party coming in?
[02:26:38.247 --> 02:26:40.848]  Super-nationalist right-wing groups coming in in Austria, absolutely.
[02:26:40.848 --> 02:26:42.369]  Well, they call them right-wing.
[02:26:42.369 --> 02:26:44.170]  That's the thing that really gets me.
[02:26:44.170 --> 02:26:44.591]  No, no, no.
[02:26:44.591 --> 02:26:45.131]  I mean, I agree.
[02:26:45.131 --> 02:26:47.232]  They call libertarian nationalists right-wing.
[02:26:47.232 --> 02:26:48.013]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:48.013 --> 02:26:49.374]  I mean, they're not.
[02:26:49.374 --> 02:26:51.095]  They're trying to arrest Le Pen.
[02:26:51.095 --> 02:26:52.676]  She's like a libertarian.
[02:26:52.676 --> 02:26:53.096]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:54.783 --> 02:27:02.706]  Anyway, they had a big election in Austria, and I think the term is more accurate, populist than nationalist.
[02:27:02.706 --> 02:27:05.646]  The people want to maintain their own culture.
[02:27:05.646 --> 02:27:08.067]  What is wrong with that?
[02:27:08.067 --> 02:27:12.948]  Who are we to say that, no, Austria should take in more refugees?
[02:27:12.948 --> 02:27:13.769]  Oh, and by the way, Alex,
[02:27:14.989 --> 02:27:23.393]  None of these hypocrites out there, shooting off their mouths, are talking about how the refugee crisis started.
[02:27:23.393 --> 02:27:34.719]  Oh, it could be because of Hitler's bombing of Qaddafi has to go, and of course when Qaddafi was in, there were no migrants or refugees flooding.
[02:27:34.719 --> 02:27:41.163]  He said you're going to get flooded attacking me, and then they blew up Syria and used it as a conduit on purpose to bring in the migrants.
[02:27:41.843 --> 02:27:57.321]  So let me ask you this question, why would the bizarre globalist left, they're not really leftists, they're globalists, Merkel, Hollande, all of them, want to bring in four or five million people they know are military age men, most of them, who they know will attack, I guess they attack, then they declare a civil emergency and take people's free speech?
[02:27:57.321 --> 02:27:59.924]  I mean, what is the elite thinking?
[02:27:59.924 --> 02:28:02.286]  Why would you want people from the worst third world countries?
[02:28:03.107 --> 02:28:08.130]  Again, it's out of control to the level, is what I'm trying to say.
[02:28:08.130 --> 02:28:12.093]  They've destroyed Iraq, they've killed over a million people.
[02:28:12.093 --> 02:28:16.175]  You look at every day, there are floods of refugees getting out of there.
[02:28:16.175 --> 02:28:19.337]  Floods of refugees leaving Afghanistan.
[02:28:19.337 --> 02:28:24.340]  Floods of refugees from the bombings leaving Syria and Libya.
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:27.222]  The point that I'm making, and going back to what you were saying...
[02:28:28.505 --> 02:28:31.406]  But about the populist movements.
[02:28:31.406 --> 02:28:37.548]  This is going to, it's going to backfire because you're seeing the elections in Germany.
[02:28:37.548 --> 02:28:39.249]  They just happened.
[02:28:39.249 --> 02:28:42.870]  Which goes to what you said, the White Shoe Boys aren't as smart as they think.
[02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:44.551]  Exactly.
[02:28:44.551 --> 02:28:56.040]  It's anti-European zone, an anti-European group, an anti-migrant and refugee, and pro-nationality.
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:06.528]  And you got a guy like Obama's going to Italy, to all these other countries and saying, no, no, you cannot hang on to your identity.
[02:29:06.528 --> 02:29:10.251]  You have no right to claim your nationality.
[02:29:10.751 --> 02:29:16.297]  Your heritage and your ancestral roots don't count.
[02:29:16.297 --> 02:29:20.261]  We want you to be a nothing blended country.
[02:29:20.261 --> 02:29:22.584]  We'll tell you what to do.
[02:29:22.584 --> 02:29:24.646]  We're going to pass these laws.
[02:29:24.646 --> 02:29:26.468]  We're multinationals.
[02:29:26.468 --> 02:29:28.930]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership rules you.
[02:29:29.651 --> 02:29:31.852]  Their arrogance blinds them.
[02:29:31.852 --> 02:29:34.034]  Well, Gerald Salente is our guest.
[02:29:34.034 --> 02:29:36.735]  Trends Research Journal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:36.735 --> 02:29:38.136]  Find it at TrendsResearch.com.
[02:29:38.136 --> 02:29:39.857]  That's TrendsResearch.com.
[02:29:39.857 --> 02:29:50.064]  We're going to come back and dive into financial trends, gold, silver, bitcoin, the election, and other key points that he's going to raise.
[02:29:50.064 --> 02:29:51.465]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.465 --> 02:29:54.006]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.006 --> 02:29:56.668]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.623 --> 02:30:09.069]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes less and less transparent.
[02:30:09.069 --> 02:30:14.754]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the conflict here.
[02:30:14.754 --> 02:30:20.418]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[02:30:21.346 --> 02:30:22.547]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[02:30:22.547 --> 02:30:26.270]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:30.733]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[02:30:30.733 --> 02:30:34.176]  And I'm really am asking you, it's more than a process question.
[02:30:34.176 --> 02:30:41.141]  It's an integrity of the election question, and everybody's asking me this question, so I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[02:30:41.141 --> 02:30:45.565]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.
[02:30:45.565 --> 02:30:47.646]  Why do you do this?
[02:30:47.646 --> 02:30:50.028]  Every single time I... No, you gotta stop.
[02:30:50.028 --> 02:30:51.169]  Every time I have you on the air,
[02:30:51.289 --> 02:30:56.754]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7 p.m.
[02:30:56.754 --> 02:30:59.096]  as we cover the primaries in the Northeast.
[02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:16.210]  I was kind of run down.
[02:31:16.210 --> 02:31:18.171]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:31:18.171 --> 02:31:20.032]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:31:20.032 --> 02:31:21.872]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:31:21.872 --> 02:31:22.933]  I popped two of them.
[02:31:22.933 --> 02:31:25.213]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:31:25.213 --> 02:31:27.014]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:31:27.014 --> 02:31:28.654]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:31:28.654 --> 02:31:29.995]  People really love it.
[02:31:29.995 --> 02:31:30.595]  Read about it.
[02:31:30.595 --> 02:31:31.475]  Find out why.
[02:31:31.475 --> 02:31:32.096]  Third party.
[02:31:32.096 --> 02:31:39.698]  Nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:31:39.898 --> 02:31:43.921]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:31:43.921 --> 02:31:50.066]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:31:50.066 --> 02:31:55.991]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.216 --> 02:32:01.056]  Hey, everyone!
[02:32:01.056 --> 02:32:03.337]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:32:03.337 --> 02:32:07.178]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:32:07.178 --> 02:32:09.258]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:32:09.258 --> 02:32:19.521]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:32:19.521 --> 02:32:25.502]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:32:25.982 --> 02:32:42.846]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,
[02:32:43.266 --> 02:32:46.730]  You need to check out Infowarsteam.com.
[02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:48.692]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.

[02:32:56.040 --> 02:32:57.801]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:33:14.503 --> 02:33:18.506]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:18.506 --> 02:33:25.212]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:36.442 --> 02:33:42.046]  A lot of top newspapers and magazines have come out and said, I'm crazy, the CIA doesn't work with Hollywood or the media or music industry.
[02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:45.488]  It's all declassified and admitted, but hey, they just say I'm a liar.
[02:33:45.488 --> 02:33:50.531]  And did you hear Obama never said, never pledged, no boots on the ground in Syria.
[02:33:50.531 --> 02:33:53.313]  He said it 16 times on video.
[02:33:53.313 --> 02:33:55.314]  You know, should I even play the video of him saying it?
[02:33:55.314 --> 02:33:58.056]  And then play them saying he never said it?
[02:33:58.056 --> 02:33:58.917]  In fact, you know what?
[02:33:58.917 --> 02:34:00.398]  Fine, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:34:00.398 --> 02:34:00.778]  You're right.
[02:34:01.983 --> 02:34:07.185]  I'll bet you all the chicken fried steak and beer you can eat and drink that these people think you're idiots.
[02:34:07.185 --> 02:34:09.506]  I don't think you're an idiot, and I'm not going to lie to you.
[02:34:09.506 --> 02:34:12.067]  I want to live in a country that's open and free.
[02:34:12.067 --> 02:34:13.248]  Joe Biggs is popping in with us.
[02:34:13.248 --> 02:34:19.471]  He's going to do a detailed report in the fourth hour with David Knight, but I wanted Gerald Salente to hear this so he could talk about it.
[02:34:19.471 --> 02:34:20.891]  We'll go to Joe here in just a moment.
[02:34:22.572 --> 02:34:34.223]  You need to sign up for the InfoWars Insider to get exclusive video, articles, you name it, but also promo codes daily with at least 10% off products that we don't offer anywhere else.
[02:34:34.223 --> 02:34:38.667]  And at least once a week, 30% off our top selling products.
[02:34:38.667 --> 02:34:41.990]  This is just for folks because I never got into email years ago.
[02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:43.911]  I never used it, never had.
[02:34:43.911 --> 02:34:47.254]  But now as they censor us more and more on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, it's bad.
[02:34:47.995 --> 02:34:49.757]  We need to be able to email directly to you.
[02:34:49.757 --> 02:34:51.918]  It's one of the hardest things to censor.
[02:34:51.918 --> 02:34:55.061]  Everybody needs to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:34:55.061 --> 02:34:59.845]  Just put your email in or create one that's just for us so you can stay in contact.
[02:34:59.845 --> 02:35:02.026]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:35:02.026 --> 02:35:03.768]  Just go there, do it today.
[02:35:03.768 --> 02:35:11.394]  Also, you get 10% off when you sign up for any of our products like the high quality non-GMO coffee we have that's organic and just delicious.
[02:35:11.394 --> 02:35:13.556]  Wake of America coffee from Chiapas, Mexico.
[02:35:13.556 --> 02:35:14.677]  It's basically Guatemalan, but better.
[02:35:15.317 --> 02:35:25.203]  Uh, or whether you're the Nutraceuticals, Infowars, Store.com, a lot of products you want to sign up for AutoShip, 10% off and free shipping on orders of $50 or more.
[02:35:25.203 --> 02:35:29.446]  Our great secret 12 organic vitamin B12 that you absorb under the tongue.
[02:35:29.446 --> 02:35:32.668]  There's a lot of gut flora problems as even the New York Times admitted last week.
[02:35:32.668 --> 02:35:33.709]  People aren't absorbing it.
[02:35:33.709 --> 02:35:36.050]  That's what's causing a lot of neurological problems.
[02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:38.712]  You need vitamin B12 and this isn't as good as injecting it.
[02:35:39.512 --> 02:35:40.853]  But it's close.
[02:35:40.853 --> 02:35:46.836]  It's just got rave reviews, 4.7 stars by third-party major sites.
[02:35:46.836 --> 02:35:48.176]  It is over the top.
[02:35:48.176 --> 02:35:50.117]  It is back in Secret 12.
[02:35:50.117 --> 02:35:51.798]  Super Mel Vitality will sell out.
[02:35:51.798 --> 02:35:53.519]  It'll be a few weeks until we get more of it in.
[02:35:53.519 --> 02:35:55.180]  That, of course, is our flagship product.
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:56.380]  It's so amazing.
[02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:58.761]  X2, Nacin Iodine is excellent as well.
[02:35:58.761 --> 02:36:00.422]  And this special will end soon.
[02:36:00.422 --> 02:36:02.023]  InfoWars Selects Dorable Foods.
[02:36:02.563 --> 02:36:11.365]  It's the best storable foods, most transportable, highest quality for the lowest price you're going to find until you get into a lot of crap that's out there.
[02:36:11.365 --> 02:36:14.185]  But it is the lowest price for what I would call really good quality.
[02:36:14.185 --> 02:36:15.665]  It's what I have for my family.
[02:36:15.665 --> 02:36:18.546]  It's what I'm putting here at the office in case things really go south.
[02:36:18.546 --> 02:36:24.187]  We were talking to Gerald about how bad this global meltdown will get, why the elites are getting armored redoubts and digging in.
[02:36:24.187 --> 02:36:27.167]  The point is, if you don't get storable food, I think you're crazy.
[02:36:27.167 --> 02:36:30.508]  And we have really high quality food at very affordable prices normally.
[02:36:30.808 --> 02:36:31.809]  It's very competitive.
[02:36:31.809 --> 02:36:34.610]  But with this special, we do twice a year, it's unprecedented.
[02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:41.014]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsselect.com, 30 to 40% off.
[02:36:41.014 --> 02:36:46.677]  Now, I'm going to go to Gerald here, and he'll be with us until the end of the hour.
[02:36:46.677 --> 02:36:56.262]  And then, of course, this gentleman to my right, Joe Beggs, will be popping in for 20 minutes in the fourth hour with David Knight to really flesh this out.
[02:36:56.262 --> 02:37:00.124]  But to brief Gerald Cilente on this, I know he's always informed of anything I raise,
[02:37:00.484 --> 02:37:01.584]  Because he's such a newshound.
[02:37:01.584 --> 02:37:02.825]  I mean, I'm not kissing his butt.
[02:37:02.825 --> 02:37:07.566]  It's just he's probably the most informed guy I know when it comes to hundreds and hundreds of stories.
[02:37:07.566 --> 02:37:09.107]  You know, factoids.
[02:37:09.107 --> 02:37:13.148]  I throw at him each little factoid and he has the rest of the answer.
[02:37:13.148 --> 02:37:14.469]  But Judicial Watch came out
[02:37:15.427 --> 02:37:25.029]  We'll put it on screen, in April of 2015, over a year ago, and said, we have credible intel, there's a mosque and ISIS being brought in, in the Mexico border.
[02:37:25.029 --> 02:37:26.309]  Well, we know it's happening.
[02:37:26.309 --> 02:37:29.550]  The head of Southcom came out and said, yes, it's true, they're bringing them in.
[02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:31.751]  That's the head of Southcom, the Admiral.
[02:37:31.751 --> 02:37:38.972]  And Joe Biggs went down there, and the FBI, when he was getting on an airplane, and El Paso came and met with him and said, we can't believe you went down there, that's super dangerous.
[02:37:38.972 --> 02:37:41.793]  We believe what you're saying is Judicial Watch is investigating is accurate.
[02:37:42.418 --> 02:37:45.341]  Well, now we have a bombshell from Judicial Watch.
[02:37:45.341 --> 02:37:48.365]  Cartels helped terrorists in Mexico get to U.S.
[02:37:48.365 --> 02:37:53.010]  to explore targets, ISIS militant among them.
[02:37:53.010 --> 02:37:59.698]  Now, Joe, who's been blown up twice in armored vehicles and hit by shrapnel, and he was embedded with media, so it's been written about in Esquire.
[02:38:00.919 --> 02:38:01.980]  Rolling Stone, you name it.
[02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:08.946]  He said he gets chills, kind of like, you know, the sword sting when it gets around goblins or orcs when he was reading this.
[02:38:08.946 --> 02:38:11.228]  So just spend a few minutes on why you're concerned.
[02:38:11.228 --> 02:38:15.872]  Then you're going to be back in the next hour to flesh this out and to play some of the reports you shot.
[02:38:15.872 --> 02:38:18.193]  This is new dovetailing with what
[02:38:18.994 --> 02:38:25.359]  Your sources were saying over a year ago, so important work we're doing with Judicial Watch and other showbiz.
[02:38:25.359 --> 02:38:30.003]  Yeah, so Josh Owens and I went down there to investigate these claims by Judicial Watch.
[02:38:30.003 --> 02:38:33.846]  We went to El Paso and actually showed these open borders.
[02:38:33.846 --> 02:38:42.092]  We filmed numerous reports showing how easy it is to come from, you know, Annapurna, Juarez, into El Paso and carry out an attack.
[02:38:42.092 --> 02:38:45.855]  And then I found a local and actually went into Annapurna and did some investigating
[02:38:46.115 --> 02:38:46.556]  I don't know.
[02:38:55.421 --> 02:39:02.425]  Basically to, uh, I don't know, radicalize the Catholics that are in that area because it's a cartel run area.
[02:39:02.425 --> 02:39:05.446]  They speak money, they speak blood, and that's what they understand.
[02:39:05.446 --> 02:39:11.509]  And now they're saying that there's this man who's been living there in an opera for over a year now, and this is his exact quote.
[02:39:11.509 --> 02:39:13.770]  The border that separates Mexico from the U.S.
[02:39:13.770 --> 02:39:20.674]  is so full of free zones that I could come in with a group of men in a few hours and kill thousands of people in Texas and Arizona.
[02:39:21.354 --> 02:39:23.194]  And that's what gave me goosebumps earlier.
[02:39:23.194 --> 02:39:30.036]  I've been pacing back and forth through the office because this further confirms our reports and what Judicial Watch said.
[02:39:30.036 --> 02:39:36.338]  And when I actually met with the FBI, the guy said that he finds us and Judicial Watch as a credible source.
[02:39:36.338 --> 02:39:43.500]  The fact that we went down there in itself was, is... Well, they couldn't tell us the classified stuff, but they just said what you're reporting on is credible.
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:43.760]  Yeah.
[02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:45.701]  Now, here's the issue.
[02:39:45.701 --> 02:39:47.042]  They're bringing in the radical jihadis.
[02:39:47.042 --> 02:39:47.962]  It's synthetic.
[02:39:47.962 --> 02:39:53.907]  They're letting them in to take our liberties at the highest levels, while different agencies actually try to fight this.
[02:39:53.907 --> 02:40:01.754]  The question is, why is our government so arrogant to let this happen while groping us at the TSA and spying on us, quote, for our own good?
[02:40:01.754 --> 02:40:04.436]  You'll be breaking it down more in the fourth hour.
[02:40:04.436 --> 02:40:05.336]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[02:40:05.336 --> 02:40:05.757]  Thank you.
[02:40:05.757 --> 02:40:10.561]  I want to get now Gerald Salente's take on that, see if Gerald has any questions for you.
[02:40:10.561 --> 02:40:14.504]  Sorry to cut into your time, Gerald, but I thought you'd want to hear about this and give us your take on it.
[02:40:15.199 --> 02:40:19.744]  Well, you know, again, look at this, the border issue over the years.
[02:40:19.744 --> 02:40:23.327]  I mean, what do we have, 50,000 kids flooding over?
[02:40:23.327 --> 02:40:25.590]  I mean, anybody could come over.
[02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:30.214]  And like you made the point, but they feel us up at the TSA.
[02:40:30.214 --> 02:40:35.940]  You got Homeland Security on the trains everywhere that you go.
[02:40:36.721 --> 02:40:40.443]  They listen to every word that we speak.
[02:40:40.443 --> 02:40:47.646]  They hack into everything that we do under the guise that they're going to protect us and the borders are wide open.
[02:40:47.646 --> 02:40:50.128]  You know, the whole thing is a sham.
[02:40:51.047 --> 02:40:54.208]  And again, are they going to attack in America?
[02:40:54.208 --> 02:40:58.329]  It's a question of, will it be a false flag or real?
[02:40:58.329 --> 02:41:04.990]  And again, no one's asking the question, by the way, how do you create these radical incidents?
[02:41:04.990 --> 02:41:05.911]  Who created?
[02:41:05.911 --> 02:41:09.952]  There was no ISIS before Afghanistan or Iraq.
[02:41:11.112 --> 02:41:15.773]  There were no radical jihadists other than one Jimmy Carter.
[02:41:15.773 --> 02:41:17.534]  You remember that one?
[02:41:17.534 --> 02:41:18.934]  Oh yeah, what were they called then?
[02:41:18.934 --> 02:41:21.055]  Oh, the Mujahideen.
[02:41:21.055 --> 02:41:21.975]  That's right.
[02:41:21.975 --> 02:41:23.296]  Oh, Bin Laden.
[02:41:23.296 --> 02:41:27.297]  We gotta stop them Russians up in Afghanistan.
[02:41:27.297 --> 02:41:30.258]  People forget this under Reagan as well.
[02:41:30.258 --> 02:41:36.740]  And then, of course, the bombing of Yugoslavia, Bill Clinton's continuing bombing of Iraq,
[02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:42.402]  The refugee, do you remember the sanctions he put on Iraq?
[02:41:42.402 --> 02:41:45.424]  500,000 Iraqi children dead under the age of five.
[02:41:45.424 --> 02:41:53.369]  And they asked Madeleine Albright, or not all that bright, the Secretary of State on CBS, was the death of 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five
[02:41:57.611 --> 02:41:59.372]  Worth the price of the sanctions?
[02:41:59.372 --> 02:42:00.712]  Yes, it was.
[02:42:00.712 --> 02:42:04.293]  So now we're destroying the entire Middle East.
[02:42:04.293 --> 02:42:08.014]  As I mentioned, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq.
[02:42:08.014 --> 02:42:09.714]  Now bombs away in Somalia.
[02:42:09.714 --> 02:42:11.115]  Let's go to Sudan.
[02:42:11.115 --> 02:42:12.675]  How about Mali?
[02:42:12.675 --> 02:42:14.556]  Now you're a young guy.
[02:42:14.556 --> 02:42:17.436]  Everybody you love is dead.
[02:42:17.436 --> 02:42:19.477]  Your country's destroyed.
[02:42:19.477 --> 02:42:22.618]  You think you're going to buy into radicalism?
[02:42:25.327 --> 02:42:26.668]  So what are the elites thinking?
[02:42:26.668 --> 02:42:27.808]  What's the master plan?
[02:42:27.808 --> 02:42:29.489]  They're morons!
[02:42:29.489 --> 02:42:32.271]  Why can't we call them what they are?
[02:42:32.271 --> 02:42:35.172]  Psychopathic losers!
[02:42:35.172 --> 02:42:36.593]  Look at what they do!
[02:42:36.593 --> 02:42:39.975]  Look how they shoot their mouths off with arrogance!
[02:42:39.975 --> 02:42:50.321]  I have to read to you one of the most disgusting lines I've heard from Obama, probably within the last week, because I could go way back.
[02:42:50.321 --> 02:42:52.122]  This is when he's over in the UK.
[02:42:54.591 --> 02:43:00.814]  Quote, now he's pushing for the remain with the Brexit rather than leave to remain.
[02:43:00.814 --> 02:43:07.578]  Quote, I will say with the candor of a friend, when has he ever said anything with candor?
[02:43:07.578 --> 02:43:08.519]  But I'll continue.
[02:43:09.773 --> 02:43:15.857]  That the outcome of your decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States.
[02:43:15.857 --> 02:43:28.926]  Hey, everyone listening out there, don't you know that whether or not the UK stays in to the Eurozone, it's of deep interest to us, as you can't drink the water in Flint.
[02:43:28.926 --> 02:43:31.608]  Don't go up to Hoosick Falls in New York.
[02:43:31.608 --> 02:43:33.989]  You're not going to like that water either.
[02:43:33.989 --> 02:43:36.731]  Stay away from the school water in Newark.
[02:43:36.731 --> 02:43:37.952]  I could go on.
[02:43:37.952 --> 02:43:39.013]  But let me continue.
[02:43:40.733 --> 02:43:43.554]  This is where it's disgusting.
[02:43:43.554 --> 02:43:54.118]  This is where he plays the World War II card of the men that gave their lives to sell multinationalism.
[02:43:54.118 --> 02:44:06.622]  The tens of thousands of Americans who rest in Europe's cemeteries are a silent testament to just how intertwined our prosperity
[02:44:07.668 --> 02:44:20.341]  And the path you choose now will echo in the prospects of today's generations of Americans as well.
[02:44:20.341 --> 02:44:24.626]  Could you imagine him saying those words?
[02:44:25.475 --> 02:44:36.226]  The men that... I have my mother's cousin, may he rest in peace, Joe Lombardi, came back with partial face left after World War II.
[02:44:36.226 --> 02:44:46.858]  I used to hear the World War II stories of who died, who came back crippled, and this clown of a man uses World War II to sell globalism?
[02:44:47.438 --> 02:44:49.859]  And where are the prostitutes calling them out?
[02:44:49.859 --> 02:44:51.440]  That's why they go after you.
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:53.721]  By the way, by the way, Gerald, great point.
[02:44:53.721 --> 02:44:56.082]  The EU was a Nazi project.
[02:44:56.082 --> 02:44:57.982]  That's BBC reporting on that.
[02:44:57.982 --> 02:45:01.224]  That's public since the end of World War II.
[02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:02.304]  And it gets worse.
[02:45:02.304 --> 02:45:10.567]  Bill Nye, the science guy, says, yeah, go ahead and arrest climate change deniers, man-made climate change deniers, because, you know, we arrested Enron.
[02:45:10.567 --> 02:45:13.008]  Enron came up with the carbon tax scam.
[02:45:14.602 --> 02:45:19.708]  They're saying, you know, don't let the Nazis get us, have a Euro, when it's a Nazi project.
[02:45:19.708 --> 02:45:21.050]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:27.077]  But anyway, this is what's going on, and going back to, why do they hate us?
[02:45:27.077 --> 02:45:31.022]  How about if we stayed home and fixed our own country?
[02:45:31.022 --> 02:45:33.364]  Everything they do turns to failure.
[02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:40.177]  We're in Afghanistan now, the longest war in American history by years.
[02:45:40.177 --> 02:45:43.381]  And they keep coming up, we got a new plan.
[02:45:43.381 --> 02:45:47.285]  Oh, and now they got a new plan to get rid of ISIS.
[02:45:47.285 --> 02:45:52.291]  We got a new plan on how to save Libya after we destroyed it.
[02:45:52.631 --> 02:45:55.612]  Hey, I got a new plan to fix Iraq.
[02:45:55.612 --> 02:45:59.373]  Oh, boots on the ground, as you were talking about, in Syria.
[02:45:59.373 --> 02:46:00.933]  We got a new plan.
[02:46:00.933 --> 02:46:21.398]  That $500 million of money that we took from you, the working little people of America, and gave it to the moderate rebels, and we've never seen what a moderate rebel looks like, and they lose the armaments, they go over to the people we're supposed to be fighting, and not only that, the moderate rebels join force.
[02:46:21.818 --> 02:46:27.001]  What I'm saying, Alex, you've got a bunch of losers running the show.
[02:46:27.001 --> 02:46:27.501]  I agree.
[02:46:27.501 --> 02:46:29.062]  Who think they know how to run things?
[02:46:29.062 --> 02:46:34.084]  In the past, we had corrupt globalists in some areas of control, but they knew what they were doing to a certain extent.
[02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:34.725]  We now have...
[02:46:35.959 --> 02:46:39.360]  Delusional people with a bunch of titles who think they're invincible.
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.461]  So where is it all going?
[02:46:41.461 --> 02:46:42.341]  What's going to happen?
[02:46:42.341 --> 02:46:48.544]  Why are the elites digging in, getting storable food, buying weapons, running off to New Zealand?
[02:46:48.544 --> 02:46:50.404]  That's even in mainstream news now.
[02:46:50.404 --> 02:46:52.445]  Why are they all now starting to leave the sinking ship?
[02:46:53.234 --> 02:46:54.594]  Well, they see what's going on.
[02:46:54.594 --> 02:46:56.855]  I mentioned earlier about China.
[02:46:56.855 --> 02:47:03.716]  You look at the outflows of money flowing out of China, and it's unprecedented, and they're buying up the world.
[02:47:03.716 --> 02:47:12.418]  They just made a deal in Australia to buy 1% of the land that they're going to own with this company that they went into.
[02:47:12.418 --> 02:47:18.879]  So the elites are running from their countries, trying to find another country that's a safe haven.
[02:47:18.879 --> 02:47:22.460]  Oh, and by the way, you mentioned Chevron with the carbon tax.
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:26.002]  Yeah, that was a Bill Clinton one, folks.
[02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:30.265]  Yeah, Al Gore and Bill Clinton to enrich the stock markets.
[02:47:30.265 --> 02:47:33.027]  Yeah, let's trade carbon taxes.
[02:47:33.027 --> 02:47:36.989]  So they're leaving because they see what's going on.
[02:47:36.989 --> 02:47:39.371]  And again, just look at the numbers.
[02:47:39.371 --> 02:47:45.035]  Whether you go to England and you look at the top end of the real estate market, down.
[02:47:45.035 --> 02:47:47.216]  Take a trip, go over to Miami.
[02:47:47.216 --> 02:47:50.058]  The top end of the real estate market, down over 20-30%.
[02:47:50.058 --> 02:47:50.698]  Go to New York.
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:56.281]  The top end of the luxury market?
[02:47:56.281 --> 02:47:57.282]  Down.
[02:47:57.282 --> 02:47:59.243]  The fish rots in their head?
[02:47:59.243 --> 02:48:00.343]  Down.
[02:48:00.343 --> 02:48:05.505]  The tops of the markets now are starting to collapse in real estate.
[02:48:05.505 --> 02:48:08.646]  Look at today's numbers that came out with durable goods.
[02:48:08.646 --> 02:48:14.909]  A lousy 0.8% and they downgraded February's from a minus 2.5 to a minus 3.7.
[02:48:19.611 --> 02:48:30.813]  Oh, and Obama says, Obama says, quote, anyone saying the United States economy isn't strong is peddling fiction.
[02:48:30.813 --> 02:48:33.994]  Folks, look at the numbers.
[02:48:33.994 --> 02:48:35.474]  You talk about the numbers.
[02:48:35.474 --> 02:48:36.595]  I go to your site.
[02:48:36.595 --> 02:48:47.757]  Oh, and by the way, everyone listening, all those products that you mentioned that are for sale on InfoWars.com and the discounts that you give
[02:48:48.277 --> 02:48:52.778]  Put your money where your mouth is and where your mind is.
[02:48:52.778 --> 02:49:05.682]  Because as this thing goes down, the people that are going to survive and thrive are the ones that are going to be in the best shape physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:49:05.682 --> 02:49:07.743]  And that's something you've written about for 30 years.
[02:49:07.743 --> 02:49:12.644]  Voting with our dollars, supporting organizations and media that promote true freedom.
[02:49:12.644 --> 02:49:14.665]  That's one of our only votes we have left.
[02:49:15.385 --> 02:49:22.735]  And that's what the globalists are trying to get rid of, and that's why they're trying to ban local businesses and have regulations to shut down farmers markets and...
[02:49:23.686 --> 02:49:25.707]  Going after small farms?
[02:49:25.707 --> 02:49:27.508]  This is how you capture people.
[02:49:27.508 --> 02:49:29.788]  We're being caught on a reservation.
[02:49:29.788 --> 02:49:34.510]  And that was the point I was making with the vote that they had in the Netherlands.
[02:49:34.510 --> 02:49:37.411]  It was done a referendum by the people.
[02:49:37.411 --> 02:49:43.754]  When you look at the parties I talked about, in Germany and Austria.
[02:49:43.754 --> 02:49:45.515]  This is Germany and Austria.
[02:49:45.515 --> 02:49:48.556]  This isn't, you know, the Marshall Islands I'm talking about.
[02:49:49.116 --> 02:49:51.357]  They came up from the ground.
[02:49:51.357 --> 02:50:00.721]  They're grassroots from organizations like yours that put out the word in a broad spectrum and like ours.
[02:50:00.721 --> 02:50:06.403]  So this is why we have to unite and support in a new way.
[02:50:06.403 --> 02:50:17.108]  Because any member that becomes the leader of the Bloods and the Crips, which people like to call the Democrats and Republicans, nothing is going to change.
[02:50:17.388 --> 02:50:18.530]  Gerald, we're going to break.
[02:50:18.530 --> 02:50:20.433]  Gerald Filente is our guest.
[02:50:20.433 --> 02:50:27.986]  But briefly, how did Merkel and Hollande and all of them think they'd get away with bringing in 5 million people that run around murdering people?
[02:50:27.986 --> 02:50:29.749]  I mean, it just shows that they're mentally ill.
[02:50:30.626 --> 02:50:32.247]  Look at that stupid little clown!
[02:50:32.247 --> 02:50:33.007]  Hold on!
[02:50:33.007 --> 02:50:35.868]  Who could believe a guy like that for two seconds?
[02:50:35.868 --> 02:50:40.050]  You sat down in the bar, you saw him sitting next to you, and he started talking to you.
[02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:41.150]  You wouldn't want to talk to him.
[02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:42.591]  Right?
[02:50:42.591 --> 02:50:44.191]  But you see what they do?
[02:50:44.191 --> 02:50:51.574]  They got the red carpets, they got all those guys with the guns and the uniform, everybody saluting.
[02:50:51.574 --> 02:50:53.255]  They play it up!
[02:50:53.255 --> 02:50:56.416]  It's show business for ugly people!
[02:50:56.416 --> 02:50:57.217]  That's right.
[02:50:57.217 --> 02:50:58.217]  Gerald, stay there.
[02:50:58.217 --> 02:50:59.077]  Gerald's on fire.
[02:50:59.077 --> 02:50:59.818]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:59.818 --> 02:51:00.158]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.235 --> 02:51:03.577]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[02:51:03.577 --> 02:51:05.998]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[02:51:05.998 --> 02:51:11.562]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[02:51:11.562 --> 02:51:12.543]  Here's why.
[02:51:12.543 --> 02:51:18.107]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[02:51:18.107 --> 02:51:21.970]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:25.511]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[02:51:25.511 --> 02:51:30.212]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[02:51:30.212 --> 02:51:35.993]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[02:51:35.993 --> 02:51:36.933]  Why do this?
[02:51:36.933 --> 02:51:40.814]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[02:51:40.814 --> 02:51:42.114]  The answer is simple.
[02:51:42.114 --> 02:51:46.255]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[02:51:46.255 --> 02:51:51.376]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[02:51:51.656 --> 02:51:53.117]  Do you fear for your life?
[02:51:53.117 --> 02:51:55.419]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[02:51:55.419 --> 02:51:57.501]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[02:51:57.501 --> 02:51:58.142]  Don't wait.
[02:51:58.142 --> 02:52:00.704]  waronthegrid.com.
[02:52:00.704 --> 02:52:02.145]  Bad news, Americans.
[02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:05.047]  You're probably stockpiling for a disaster all wrong.
[02:52:05.047 --> 02:52:10.172]  When the big one comes, you'll need more than that poisonous, over-salted survival food you now see everywhere.
[02:52:10.172 --> 02:52:15.076]  There are three vital things that your survival food is missing, and it's the first thing to disappear from grocery stores.
[02:52:15.396 --> 02:52:21.622]  Go to superfoodradio.com now to see my story of how I nearly died when I was forced to live on a popular survival food.
[02:52:21.622 --> 02:52:27.547]  That's superfoodradio.com and I'll show you how everything you've been told about survival food is dead wrong.
[02:52:27.547 --> 02:52:30.390]  Go to superfoodradio.com now.
[02:52:30.390 --> 02:52:32.091]  Is there a difference in body armor?
[02:52:32.091 --> 02:52:32.832]  You bet.
[02:52:32.832 --> 02:52:33.472]  Quality.
[02:52:33.472 --> 02:52:33.893]  Warranty.
[02:52:34.173 --> 02:52:35.074]  We're good to go!
[02:53:00.782 --> 02:53:04.706]  How would you like to make 17% on your money in only 90 days?
[02:53:04.706 --> 02:53:11.552]  That's right, gold owners made 17% in only 3 months as gold had its best quarterly gain in 30 years.
[02:53:11.552 --> 02:53:16.677]  Gold is on the move and you need to get government issued legal tender gold coins starting at only $139 each.
[02:53:18.559 --> 02:53:19.079]  The U.S.
[02:53:19.079 --> 02:53:29.227]  Money Reserve, one of the largest gold distributors in the country, announces the first-ever at-cost gold release on this station for only $139 each.
[02:53:29.227 --> 02:53:34.611]  1-866-944-GOLD or go online at usmoneyreserve.com.
[02:53:34.611 --> 02:53:35.552]  Official U.S.
[02:53:35.552 --> 02:53:39.335]  government-issued legal tender solid gold coins at cost for only $139 each.
[02:53:39.335 --> 02:53:39.655]  Call 1-866-944-GOLD.
[02:53:42.017 --> 02:53:42.798]  We're good to go.
[02:54:01.085 --> 02:54:05.707]  Oh, Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[02:54:05.707 --> 02:54:09.669]  Oh, Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[02:54:09.669 --> 02:54:14.090]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:17.171]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[02:54:17.171 --> 02:54:25.555]  Gerald's gonna be with us a few minutes to the next hour, then David Knight takes over with Joe Biggs with some really big ISIS-Al Qaeda news.
[02:54:26.764 --> 02:54:28.787]  That's what ISIS is, is Al Qaeda.
[02:54:28.787 --> 02:54:33.073]  When our military said, we don't want to back Al Qaeda in Syria, they just changed the name to Syria.
[02:54:33.073 --> 02:54:35.116]  I mean, changed the name to ISIS.
[02:54:35.116 --> 02:54:36.598]  That's how they try to confuse people.
[02:54:36.598 --> 02:54:37.599]  It's the games they play.
[02:54:38.669 --> 02:54:42.832]  It's really crazy, and I don't lionize our military and say it's perfect.
[02:54:42.832 --> 02:54:49.816]  It's not a lot of bad stuff, but the individuals in it are treated like crap when they get out, which shows you how evil this government is.
[02:54:49.816 --> 02:54:56.660]  And the same thing's happening all over the world because of high-tech media and the elites being separate from the people more than ever.
[02:54:56.660 --> 02:55:00.522]  They really are having their Marie Antoinette let them eat cake moments.
[02:55:00.522 --> 02:55:02.984]  Now, reportedly, she didn't really say let them eat cake, but
[02:55:04.008 --> 02:55:15.960]  When Obama gets up there and says you can't have air conditioning in cars, but he can, and that no prosperity for the general public is good, it shows you the real disconnect.
[02:55:18.177 --> 02:55:22.740]  I think we're coming really to the end of this, but a decade is like the blink of an eye historically.
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:32.147]  And I'm not historically saying something better is on the other side, but this power structure is collapsing as the public buys in to the bull.
[02:55:32.147 --> 02:55:35.049]  There's more and more delusion, more and more mental illness.
[02:55:35.049 --> 02:55:38.832]  Now, there's a lot of people waking up, but it's a dichotomy, as you know, a paradox.
[02:55:38.832 --> 02:55:43.255]  There's a lot of people waking up, but also a lot of people getting more delusional.
[02:55:43.255 --> 02:55:44.395]  What are they going to do?
[02:55:45.396 --> 02:55:52.484]  As the veneer of civilization peels off like a re-entry shield on a capsule.
[02:55:52.484 --> 02:55:59.331]  I mean, what are they going to do when the heat of truth burns through that shield of delusion?
[02:55:59.331 --> 02:56:04.617]  Because a lot of holes are in it already, but I look at this historically, am I wrong to say we ain't seen nothing yet?
[02:56:05.626 --> 02:56:11.632]  Yeah, they're going to rob us of more of our rights and it becomes more of a militarized local police.
[02:56:11.632 --> 02:56:13.233]  And you've pointed it out before.
[02:56:13.233 --> 02:56:18.578]  You know how they've done away with the Posse Comitatus Act of the late 1870s?
[02:56:18.578 --> 02:56:25.445]  That prohibited the military from taking domestic actions.
[02:56:25.445 --> 02:56:27.467]  And you reported on it all last year.
[02:56:28.107 --> 02:56:29.488]  So that's what they're doing.
[02:56:29.488 --> 02:56:38.794]  They're going to keep robbing us of our rights, and the people will go for it like that if there's a, quote, terrorist attack, be it false, flag, or real.
[02:56:38.794 --> 02:56:40.876]  You see it happen all over the world.
[02:56:40.876 --> 02:56:54.265]  So they use these incidents to take more and more of our power away from us, as they give the power to the multinationals, as they're doing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the other agreements, the Transatlantic Partnership deal.
[02:56:54.705 --> 02:57:07.329]  I just want to mention briefly, before we do run out of time, one thing that is really off the radar, and in talking about gold, you asked me earlier, is that, you know, China is now setting the benchmark for gold.
[02:57:07.329 --> 02:57:11.650]  And it was the Rothschilds set it up in the UK back in the early 1900s.
[02:57:11.650 --> 02:57:18.112]  And now, of course, the Chinese are the world's largest purchasers of gold.
[02:57:18.112 --> 02:57:20.973]  Now they're setting the benchmark.
[02:57:20.973 --> 02:57:22.434]  This is big news.
[02:57:23.544 --> 02:57:34.667]  If this is the stuff that you love to own, and you're setting the price, you're going to set the price higher or lower?
[02:57:34.667 --> 02:57:40.349]  It is admitted, and of course you're a big gold bug, that China more and more is controlling the price of gold.
[02:57:40.349 --> 02:57:42.409]  That's why it's going up some.
[02:57:42.409 --> 02:57:45.730]  But can the globalists try to wrest control back from them?
[02:57:45.730 --> 02:57:49.091]  No, because it's a numbers game.
[02:57:49.091 --> 02:57:51.792]  What does China have, what, 1.2 billion people?
[02:57:52.719 --> 02:57:59.704]  And look at, as Trump keeps talking about, the trade deficits.
[02:57:59.704 --> 02:58:01.686]  Could China keep it going?
[02:58:01.686 --> 02:58:06.129]  They'll keep it going to an extent, but it's a numbers game at the end.
[02:58:06.129 --> 02:58:15.176]  Because as the global economies decline and fall, again... That's right, you said QE wouldn't work, it hasn't worked, so they say more QE is the answer.
[02:58:16.027 --> 02:58:16.849]  What's going to happen?
[02:58:16.849 --> 02:58:20.375]  I mean, they admit it doesn't work, but they're going to do the same thing.
[02:58:20.375 --> 02:58:22.078]  How bad is it going to get?
[02:58:22.078 --> 02:58:26.105]  Again, the currencies are going to collapse, and gold is going to go up.
[02:58:26.105 --> 02:58:27.187]  It's just common sense.
[02:58:28.345 --> 02:58:32.128]  Yeah, I agree with you in a common sense world and historically, but they got a lot of weird tricks up their sleeve.
[02:58:32.128 --> 02:58:34.870]  But I agree with this with Gerald back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:39.373]  They can only cover this up in paper over with fancy computers so long.
[02:58:39.373 --> 02:58:41.655]  Reality will set in back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:41.655 --> 02:58:44.077]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[03:00:02.139 --> 03:00:14.847]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:14.847 --> 03:00:20.010]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:21.758 --> 03:00:24.559]  CrimsResearch.com is Gerald Cilente's website.

[03:00:30.540 --> 03:00:33.220]  Everybody needs to support the fine work of Gerald Cilente.
[03:00:33.220 --> 03:00:35.121]  I know most of you know what he's talking about.
[03:00:35.121 --> 03:00:37.301]  And you know more than I do in many cases.
[03:00:37.301 --> 03:00:39.041]  The audience I know is smarter than I am in many ways.
[03:00:39.041 --> 03:00:41.182]  But we got to get this out to everybody else.
[03:00:41.182 --> 03:00:43.042]  And that's starting to happen.
[03:00:43.042 --> 03:00:44.623]  But it's a numbers game as he said.
[03:00:44.623 --> 03:00:46.523]  We're in a race against time people.
[03:00:48.410 --> 03:00:52.352]  Because the globalists are going to use the crises they've created to get more control.
[03:00:52.352 --> 03:00:53.092]  They admit that.
[03:00:53.092 --> 03:00:54.653]  They have a philosophy.
[03:00:54.653 --> 03:00:56.334]  They have a program.
[03:00:56.334 --> 03:00:58.795]  We know what it is.
[03:00:58.795 --> 03:00:59.655]  And it's really bad.
[03:00:59.655 --> 03:01:01.016]  It's anti-prosperity for us.
[03:01:01.016 --> 03:01:03.077]  Because they don't want to just have prosperity.
[03:01:03.077 --> 03:01:04.938]  They want it for them and then not for us.
[03:01:04.938 --> 03:01:10.841]  They want to be up on the hill with the helicopters and we're down here in shacks like Brazil.
[03:01:10.841 --> 03:01:11.361]  Argentina.
[03:01:12.654 --> 03:01:14.955]  People say, why can't Latin America get their act together?
[03:01:14.955 --> 03:01:18.737]  There have been cases where there were countries that are richer than the U.S., like Argentina.
[03:01:18.737 --> 03:01:21.358]  They got taken over by shenanigans.
[03:01:21.358 --> 03:01:28.142]  And the elites down there admit they use economic warfare as control.
[03:01:28.142 --> 03:01:30.423]  There aren't many countries like the U.S., folks.
[03:01:30.423 --> 03:01:33.785]  That's why they run it down so much, where you are allowed to operate and live.
[03:01:33.785 --> 03:01:35.626]  And, Gerald, I know you talk about that a lot.
[03:01:35.626 --> 03:01:41.409]  In a few minutes, we've got left other important points that, as you say, really aren't on the radar or other points you want to make.
[03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:44.671]  Well, first I just want to pick up on what you were saying.
[03:01:44.671 --> 03:01:48.372]  This isn't a conspiracy theorist or theory.
[03:01:48.372 --> 03:01:53.793]  Look at the rights that have been robbed from us since 9-11 happened.
[03:01:53.793 --> 03:01:56.994]  Look at one administration after the other.
[03:01:56.994 --> 03:02:05.236]  And, of course, Obama lying his way into office saying, you know, he was going to reverse these things and made things worse.
[03:02:05.236 --> 03:02:10.657]  Look at how many, what do you, lock up more whistleblowers than all the presidents before him in total.
[03:02:11.537 --> 03:02:14.839]  So it's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:14.839 --> 03:02:16.400]  It's in front of us.
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:17.801]  It's happening.
[03:02:17.801 --> 03:02:31.030]  We're losing not only our rights, our right to earn a living wage because of the taking away of laws and regulations that give the money to all the elite.
[03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:37.895]  And again, the one great thing that happened from Occupy Wall Street was they made the 1% visible.
[03:02:37.895 --> 03:02:39.916]  And of course, you find out, no, it's not 1%.
[03:02:44.238 --> 03:02:46.139]  0.01%.
[03:02:46.139 --> 03:02:48.980]  So it's really up to us to change it.
[03:02:48.980 --> 03:02:53.381]  And Americans, for some reason, have this helpless feeling.
[03:02:53.381 --> 03:02:57.463]  And again, all you have to do is look what happened in Austria last week.
[03:02:57.463 --> 03:02:58.783]  This is Austria.
[03:02:58.783 --> 03:03:02.005]  Everybody remember Austrian-Hungarian Empire?
[03:03:02.005 --> 03:03:03.265]  Germany?
[03:03:03.265 --> 03:03:08.787]  Yeah, Germany, the engine of manufacturing in Europe.
[03:03:08.787 --> 03:03:10.748]  New governments are happening.
[03:03:11.707 --> 03:03:17.060]  People are fighting to retain their dignity, their respect.
[03:03:18.203 --> 03:03:22.185]  And it's up to us to do the same and we can do it.
[03:03:22.185 --> 03:03:24.066]  We wrote the book.
[03:03:24.066 --> 03:03:27.848]  We are the Americans, the American Revolution.
[03:03:27.848 --> 03:03:34.071]  We have the Constitution and a Bill of Rights before and it's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:03:34.071 --> 03:03:35.812]  They robbed us of them.
[03:03:35.812 --> 03:03:36.912]  So it's in our hands.
[03:03:36.912 --> 03:03:38.313]  We're the trailblazers.
[03:03:38.313 --> 03:03:40.094]  We're one of the cradles of liberty.
[03:03:40.094 --> 03:03:46.417]  We have to stop just being watching TV and being spectators and get in the game and realize the animating contest of liberty is now.
[03:03:47.395 --> 03:03:47.998]  Exactly.
[03:03:49.102 --> 03:03:56.908]  And so everyone, again, it only comes with support and a unified action plan.
[03:03:56.908 --> 03:03:57.529]  You know what?
[03:03:57.529 --> 03:04:00.331]  I'm glad the elite are running off to other countries and hiding out.
[03:04:00.331 --> 03:04:06.395]  Like you've said, you've doubled down moving to the birthplace of America, colonial area there in New York.
[03:04:06.395 --> 03:04:07.176]  I've doubled down.
[03:04:07.176 --> 03:04:08.297]  I'm not leaving.
[03:04:08.297 --> 03:04:09.998]  You know what?
[03:04:09.998 --> 03:04:10.999]  And we're going to be the leaders.
[03:04:10.999 --> 03:04:13.961]  Not that I want to be, but our information will be the leaders.
[03:04:13.961 --> 03:04:17.544]  Our listeners will be the leaders that lead us out of this system.
[03:04:17.544 --> 03:04:18.425]  We're going to win, Gerald.
[03:04:19.383 --> 03:04:30.846]  Hey, it does not take a majority to prevail, rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[03:04:30.846 --> 03:04:32.326]  Samuel Adams.
[03:04:32.326 --> 03:04:33.767]  That's right, absolutely.
[03:04:33.767 --> 03:04:35.907]  And Thomas Jefferson made similar statements.
[03:04:35.907 --> 03:04:41.529]  Gerald Salente, we salute you as a fellow, a pro-human, pro-liberty American.
[03:04:41.529 --> 03:04:44.690]  But it's a worldwide movement.
[03:04:44.690 --> 03:04:45.490]  1776 to the next level.
[03:04:45.490 --> 03:04:45.870]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:47.770]  Thank you.
[03:04:47.770 --> 03:04:48.831]  Alright, he's committed.
[03:04:48.831 --> 03:04:50.872]  He's doubled down.
[03:04:50.872 --> 03:04:51.832]  Are you?
[03:04:51.832 --> 03:04:53.033]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:04:53.033 --> 03:04:57.914]  David and I straight ahead, but first I'm gonna spend a few more minutes with a personal message to Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:57.914 --> 03:04:58.935]  I'm sending her a present.
[03:05:00.327 --> 03:05:10.518]  Refrigerators zapped off in kitchens across Venezuela as the government turned off the electricity supply to help ease the power outage that is worsening the country's economic crisis.
[03:05:10.518 --> 03:05:12.300]  Report, Yahoo News.
[03:05:12.300 --> 03:05:20.710]  It is the latest drastic measure by the government in a crisis that has already seen Venezuelans waiting for hours to buy scarce supplies and shops.
[03:05:21.030 --> 03:05:28.273]  Machines for processing bank card payments also wouldn't work without power, meaning that some left stores without buying anything.
[03:05:28.273 --> 03:05:32.215]  President Nicolas Maduro's government blames the power outage on weather.
[03:05:32.215 --> 03:05:38.758]  Critics, however, say it is the result of economic mismanagement and inefficient running of the energy network.
[03:05:38.758 --> 03:05:44.260]  Venezuela's economy has plunged along with the price of the oil it relies on for foreign revenues.
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:49.862]  Citizens are suffering shortages of medicines and goods such as toilet paper and cooking oil.
[03:05:49.862 --> 03:05:53.643]  Maduro blames the collapse on an economic war by capitalists.
[03:05:53.643 --> 03:05:55.984]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[03:07:00.115 --> 03:07:06.597]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:07:06.597 --> 03:07:19.382]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:07:19.582 --> 03:07:23.244]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:07:23.244 --> 03:07:30.228]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:07:30.228 --> 03:07:43.094]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:43.094 --> 03:07:44.655]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:44.935 --> 03:07:51.322]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:07:51.322 --> 03:07:56.267]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:10.374 --> 03:08:12.695]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.695 --> 03:08:14.756]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.756 --> 03:08:18.438]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.438 --> 03:08:20.439]  I'm sorry.
[03:08:20.439 --> 03:08:23.260]  This is what happens if you get the... Well, you know what?
[03:08:23.260 --> 03:08:29.302]  I won't hold you on here any longer because you probably could use some water there.
[03:08:29.302 --> 03:08:35.145]  Hillary Clinton live from New York.
[03:08:35.145 --> 03:08:36.045]  I've talked way too much.
[03:08:40.245 --> 03:08:40.546]  Okay.
[03:08:56.209 --> 03:09:04.477]  Go back to, you know, it was, uh, I'm sorry.
[03:09:28.717 --> 03:09:38.041]  Well, I'm here to tell you that that was part of a compilation that keeps going on for a while of her over the years having coughing attacks.
[03:09:38.041 --> 03:09:42.283]  And I live in Austin, Texas, and I actually have some empathy for Hillary Clinton on this.
[03:09:42.283 --> 03:09:43.963]  We are the capital of allergies.
[03:09:43.963 --> 03:09:50.086]  I thought, growing up, when I had friends that didn't want to go ride bikes or go play baseball or whatever,
[03:09:51.460 --> 03:09:56.923]  That they were making it up when they said that they had allergies that didn't want to come out.
[03:09:56.923 --> 03:10:00.144]  I thought that that was hypochondria.
[03:10:00.144 --> 03:10:06.507]  Then I moved to Austin in high school, and within a few years, it hit me.
[03:10:06.507 --> 03:10:11.449]  There's so many different plants, so many different types of pollen.
[03:10:11.449 --> 03:10:15.131]  It's pretty much year-round, different allergies.
[03:10:15.131 --> 03:10:19.573]  Mountain juniper, what they call cedar, gives me a headache, makes me tired.
[03:10:19.573 --> 03:10:20.634]  Oak does kind of the same thing.
[03:10:21.636 --> 03:10:33.226]  But mold, when it rains for weeks and weeks on end with flooding, fungus, just absolutely makes me having coughing fits, just like Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:33.226 --> 03:10:46.156]  And what's crazy is, I'm about to speak directly to Hillary Clinton here on air, is that I tend to not even take my own nutraceuticals regularly.
[03:10:47.304 --> 03:11:00.027]  Like, I'll be having trouble sleeping and forget that I have Knockout in the cupboard that's got all the key things from melatonin to valerian root to L-tryptophan, you name it, that will make you get restful deep sleep.
[03:11:00.027 --> 03:11:01.627]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:11:01.627 --> 03:11:05.168]  Infowarslife.com, this is partially a plug.
[03:11:05.168 --> 03:11:10.870]  And it's the same thing where it's kind of like you're in bed halfway asleep and you're cold, but you won't get up and get another blanket.
[03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:13.050]  It's kind of like that same laziness.
[03:11:13.050 --> 03:11:16.411]  So, the last week and a half, the mold's been off the charts.
[03:11:17.577 --> 03:11:21.060]  Leanne's been coughing, a bunch of other people have been coughing around the office.
[03:11:21.060 --> 03:11:29.326]  And a couple nights ago, I was up every hour, just cough, cough, cough, because it's like itches in your throat.
[03:11:29.326 --> 03:11:32.888]  And I finally got up and went, I need to go into the kitchen and into the Lazy Susan.
[03:11:32.888 --> 03:11:37.632]  I think I have, in Polar Wars life, lung cleanse.
[03:11:37.632 --> 03:11:40.634]  It's a whole bunch of concentrated herbs and things that really knock it out.
[03:11:40.634 --> 03:11:42.055]  I go in there, I dig around, it's not there.
[03:11:43.612 --> 03:11:45.493]  Try to drink water, it doesn't do it.
[03:11:45.493 --> 03:12:00.838]  So, I get back, I have a coughing fit on air yesterday, and I go get a fresh bottle, this is a used bottle they dug up out of my other office, and I start taking it, and within a minute, the coughing stops.
[03:12:00.838 --> 03:12:09.421]  And I was drinking water, I had a cough drop, I was like, wait a minute, I have a product that we came up with that has dozens of essential oils and key things that's the best thing out there.
[03:12:10.851 --> 03:12:11.271]  So guess what?
[03:12:11.271 --> 03:12:17.993]  I brought my new fresh bottle home last night, so I start... I take it last night, sleep great, don't have any problems.
[03:12:17.993 --> 03:12:23.054]  Start having a coughing fit again on air, because I went for a jog this morning.
[03:12:23.054 --> 03:12:25.494]  They have to run find a bottle.
[03:12:25.494 --> 03:12:27.435]  They got a bunch over in the warehouse, but this is a used bottle.
[03:12:27.435 --> 03:12:30.996]  Somebody's been using it around here.
[03:12:30.996 --> 03:12:34.517]  Take four or five shots in your mouth, then go, a little bit goes down to the throat.
[03:12:34.517 --> 03:12:35.957]  You don't want to suck while you're blowing.
[03:12:36.946 --> 03:12:45.014]  Or you don't want to spray and then suck it down, or you get too much in your lungs, but I just kind of go, then get a little bit down, that's what Dr. Groups has to do, and it knocks it out.
[03:12:45.014 --> 03:12:51.160]  It is the best stuff out there, and when you purchase it, it helps fund our operation.
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:57.487]  So because I know that we have the best product from God's covered Mother Nature,
[03:12:58.638 --> 03:13:10.426]  For people that have allergies, people that have inflammation in the throat, people that have bronchial issues, I have tried a lot of stuff for mold that absolutely turns me into a Hillary Clinton cougher.
[03:13:10.426 --> 03:13:13.148]  And when she came out and said it's allergies, I believe her.
[03:13:13.148 --> 03:13:19.592]  Because if you've got a mold allergy or another allergy in your lungs or in your bronchioles, she coughs exactly the way I do.
[03:13:20.933 --> 03:13:28.975]  Now, I wouldn't be too sad, quite frankly, if it was, but I don't want to wish things on her and it's bad luck, but I probably wouldn't cry too hard if it was terminal lung cancer.
[03:13:28.975 --> 03:13:30.356]  And I'm just going to be honest with you.
[03:13:30.356 --> 03:13:32.116]  But you know what?
[03:13:32.116 --> 03:13:34.717]  I want to be Christian, so I want to say, Hillary, I love you.
[03:13:34.717 --> 03:13:47.621]  It's still time for you to turn back and not be so evil with the Serbia attack and the Benghazi and the Libya and the Syria and the dead kids at MENA and all the corruption and covering up for your husband, raping everybody.
[03:13:49.375 --> 03:13:50.616]  Stop raping the American people.
[03:13:50.616 --> 03:13:51.698]  Stop trying to be so evil.
[03:13:51.698 --> 03:13:56.823]  Stop trying to stay in power just to cover your own butt.
[03:13:56.823 --> 03:13:58.786]  I want to offer you, and I'm going to mail to you...
[03:13:59.867 --> 03:14:04.931]  A bottle to your campaign headquarters, sealed and safe.
[03:14:04.931 --> 03:14:09.896]  In fact, we're going to send you five or six bottles so your staff can use it and find out it's totally safe.
[03:14:09.896 --> 03:14:12.258]  We're going to mail it to you from these offices.
[03:14:12.258 --> 03:14:15.600]  And I really want to encourage you, Hillary, before a speech, to try this.
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:24.408]  Because the other stuff they sell at drugstores, or even prescriptions like steroids, it doesn't really work, or it has bad side effects, or it's just got numbing effect and it doesn't work long term.
[03:14:24.408 --> 03:14:26.590]  I do this, I'm good for six, seven, eight hours.
[03:14:27.210 --> 03:14:32.356]  I tried other products before I had my own and they just didn't work because they're alcohol and a couple different things.
[03:14:32.356 --> 03:14:36.060]  So, here's two fresh bottles for Hillary Clinton of Lung Cleanse.
[03:14:36.060 --> 03:14:39.364]  I'm going to send this to you and all I ask is if it works for you,
[03:14:40.526 --> 03:14:42.668]  I know you don't want to give folks other good advice.
[03:14:42.668 --> 03:14:45.210]  You don't want to take care of even your own constituents.
[03:14:45.210 --> 03:14:47.232]  You certainly don't want to fund the Infowar.
[03:14:47.232 --> 03:14:51.336]  But I know for a fact, some of my enemies actually buy Super Melon X2.
[03:14:51.336 --> 03:14:55.080]  I've had people that talk to me, you know, I was the son of this house who hates you and they had your product and they're using it.
[03:14:55.080 --> 03:14:58.203]  Well, the products are that good and it's how we fund the operations.
[03:14:58.203 --> 03:14:59.664]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:14:59.664 --> 03:15:00.865]  So here's my letter to Hillary Clinton.
[03:15:00.865 --> 03:15:03.307]  I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight, Joe Biggs and others.
[03:15:04.428 --> 03:15:11.952]  We'll do a document cam shot for TV viewers so folks can see our letterhead here.
[03:15:11.952 --> 03:15:18.295]  Here I can just kind of X out some of the internal info, but I think our numbers are actually public, so I don't care if folks even see that.
[03:15:18.295 --> 03:15:19.095]  Hello, Ms.
[03:15:19.095 --> 03:15:21.736]  Clinton.
[03:15:21.736 --> 03:15:29.700]  Though I disagree with basically everything you stand for and fight constantly against your policies and ideas, I also recognize that you have a serious issue with your health.
[03:15:29.700 --> 03:15:33.302]  On multiple occasions, you have suffered severe coughing bouts
[03:15:34.414 --> 03:15:42.459]  Those coughing bouts have been so intense, I'm sure you've probably busted some blood vessels in your eyes.
[03:15:42.459 --> 03:15:48.023]  This isn't a good look for a presidential candidate, even a vampiric goblin creature like yourself.
[03:15:48.023 --> 03:15:49.184]  I'm sorry I had to say that.
[03:15:49.184 --> 03:16:02.933]  So in the spirit of my love for all of humanity, even though we're not sure you're human, with the hope that someday you will recant and will repent from your evil ways, I am sending you a bottle of Infowars Life Lung Cleanse.
[03:16:04.022 --> 03:16:08.747]  You see, I occasionally have a coughing fit due to mold or other environmental contaminants.
[03:16:08.747 --> 03:16:13.012]  This simple spray has been a godsend to myself and many of our listeners.
[03:16:13.012 --> 03:16:18.898]  We have a bunch of professional singers that swear by it, and it's all natural, healthy, and really works quickly.
[03:16:19.719 --> 03:16:20.800]  Kind of editing this as we go.
[03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:23.903]  I don't want to say instantly, but very quickly, in a matter of seconds for me.
[03:16:23.903 --> 03:16:36.014]  Instead of that bottle of hot sauce you claim to carry, you should always keep this bottle of InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse within reach, even though you're going to lose in a landslide to Mr. Trump.
[03:16:36.014 --> 03:16:43.040]  And then I kind of did a voice memo on this, but I'm not sure what that pun means at the end, but we wrote the rest of this.
[03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:45.362]  So there is the signed Alex Jones.
[03:16:46.859 --> 03:16:48.941]  To Herr Hitler.
[03:16:48.941 --> 03:16:52.765]  And I hope that they will read this and I hope that they will.
[03:16:52.765 --> 03:16:56.909]  But they're going to think there's some conspiracy that I actually X'd out our address and stuff here on the top.
[03:16:56.909 --> 03:16:59.951]  So will you bring me another one that I'll actually sign and send to her?
[03:16:59.951 --> 03:17:00.212]  Thank you.
[03:17:01.118 --> 03:17:03.019]  We'll put the little InfoWars seal on it.
[03:17:03.019 --> 03:17:06.662]  They'll probably have the Secret Service come and say I tried to kill her or something, you know.
[03:17:06.662 --> 03:17:07.282]  Oh my gosh!
[03:17:07.282 --> 03:17:08.843]  Central Oil is so evil!
[03:17:08.843 --> 03:17:11.005]  It's a bunch of them, center-districtly together.
[03:17:11.005 --> 03:17:12.466]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:12.466 --> 03:17:14.627]  Also, it ends very quickly.
[03:17:14.627 --> 03:17:24.213]  Maybe a few days, maybe early next week, depending on how much we keep selling, but InfoWars Select high-quality, storable foods, 40 to 30% off the already super low price at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:25.034 --> 03:17:27.757]  Our info is select.com, takes you right to the subsection.
[03:17:27.757 --> 03:17:31.842]  We have a lot of other products there as well, but it is your purchase of the products that make it all possible.
[03:17:31.842 --> 03:17:33.324]  I'm punching out.
[03:17:33.324 --> 03:17:36.888]  David Knight, thank you so much for doing the fourth hour here, my compadre.
[03:17:37.588 --> 03:17:38.008]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:17:38.008 --> 03:17:42.812]  Yeah, you're going to make sure that you've got that address there for the Secret Service to come by and talk to you about that.
[03:17:42.812 --> 03:17:49.216]  You send bottles of liquid to Hillary Clinton after what you think of her, I think they'll probably want to talk to you.
[03:17:49.216 --> 03:17:55.781]  Maybe she'll have Huma try that out or some of her other employees that are not as close to her as Huma.
[03:17:55.781 --> 03:17:58.383]  Yeah, maybe her stable of young hussies.
[03:18:00.005 --> 03:18:01.286]  I can try it out.
[03:18:01.286 --> 03:18:02.208]  Yeah, who knows?
[03:18:02.208 --> 03:18:03.129]  Hey, I will come.
[03:18:03.129 --> 03:18:09.237]  The Secret Service can march me to Hillary, the Empress, and I will taste it in front of her.
[03:18:09.237 --> 03:18:10.038]  There you go.
[03:18:10.038 --> 03:18:11.440]  There you go.
[03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:12.842]  Maybe she'll bite me on the lip.
[03:18:15.042 --> 03:18:17.363]  No, no, it really does work.
[03:18:17.363 --> 03:18:18.763]  I've used it myself.
[03:18:18.763 --> 03:18:25.365]  And even as you tried to explain to Glenn Beck one time, you know, lay off the diet soda.
[03:18:25.365 --> 03:18:27.626]  You know, they're not going to listen to you, but they should.
[03:18:27.626 --> 03:18:33.488]  Because we know about these things and that is a very effective throat clear.
[03:18:33.488 --> 03:18:36.809]  You know, I was listening to her cough that Sigma had at the beginning.
[03:18:37.569 --> 03:18:39.972]  I was getting a sympathy cough just listening to it.
[03:18:39.972 --> 03:18:45.197]  But, you know, if she would try that, the only thing she'd be choking on is her lies, Alex.
[03:18:45.197 --> 03:18:46.238]  Exactly.
[03:18:46.238 --> 03:18:48.440]  Or the children's brains she sucked out.
[03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:51.303]  She's really a 14-foot reptoid that, like, transforms into that.
[03:18:51.303 --> 03:18:54.166]  Like, sticks a big tube in kids' brains like the Brain Bug.
[03:18:54.166 --> 03:18:55.087]  No, no, no, no.
[03:18:55.087 --> 03:18:55.847]  That's a movie.
[03:18:55.847 --> 03:18:56.688]  I'm joking.
[03:18:56.688 --> 03:18:57.309]  I'm joking.
[03:18:57.309 --> 03:18:58.270]  David Knight, you take over.
[03:18:58.270 --> 03:18:59.451]  Thank you for the great job, my friend.
[03:18:59.451 --> 03:18:59.911]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:19:00.816 --> 03:19:10.280]  Well, I've got Joe Biggs with me, because we looked at this article that was on the Drudge Report today, came out from Judicial Watch, talking about cartels helping terrorists get to the U.S.
[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:12.961]  via our porous border with Mexico.
[03:19:12.961 --> 03:19:16.363]  And this is not anything new, and this is documented in the Judicial Watch
[03:19:16.923 --> 03:19:38.649]  Article about how long this has been going on had Joe come in because of course Joe has been there and Joe went to the town That had been reported by Judicial Watch that They had terrorists there in ISIS camp in that area across from El Paso Tell us about that remind us what you did Joe when we come back We're gonna talk about that and of course there's other issues as well.
[03:19:38.649 --> 03:19:41.090]  You know we look at Ohio we've got
[03:19:42.489 --> 03:19:44.812]  People who are saying Mexican cartels are already there.
[03:19:44.812 --> 03:19:49.098]  Of course, there's been this massive number of people in one family that were killed there.
[03:19:49.098 --> 03:19:51.281]  People are saying, is this something to do with the cartels?
[03:19:51.281 --> 03:19:54.686]  And extended coverage tonight of the primaries, 7 o'clock central.
[03:19:54.686 --> 03:19:55.567]  That's right, that's right.
[03:19:55.567 --> 03:19:58.011]  Jay Withers and Four Wars Nightly News, straight ahead.
[03:19:58.011 --> 03:19:59.373]  We'll be right back with Joe Biggs.
[03:20:03.823 --> 03:20:11.251]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:20:11.251 --> 03:20:14.855]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:14.855 --> 03:20:18.538]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:19.199 --> 03:20:21.021]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:21.021 --> 03:20:32.092]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:32.092 --> 03:20:43.242]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:44.164 --> 03:20:45.185]  How about you?
[03:20:45.185 --> 03:20:46.506]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:46.506 --> 03:20:46.807]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:46.807 --> 03:20:46.887]  1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:46.887 --> 03:20:47.908]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[03:20:47.908 --> 03:20:48.148]  We shop.
[03:20:48.148 --> 03:20:48.348]  You save.
[03:21:00.820 --> 03:21:03.141]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[03:21:03.141 --> 03:21:05.561]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[03:21:05.561 --> 03:21:11.123]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[03:21:11.123 --> 03:21:12.103]  Here's why.
[03:21:12.103 --> 03:21:17.665]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[03:21:17.665 --> 03:21:21.526]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[03:21:21.826 --> 03:21:25.089]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[03:21:25.089 --> 03:21:29.792]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[03:21:29.792 --> 03:21:35.576]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[03:21:35.576 --> 03:21:36.517]  Why do this?
[03:21:36.517 --> 03:21:40.380]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:41.421]  The answer is simple.
[03:21:41.661 --> 03:21:45.824]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.
[03:21:45.824 --> 03:21:52.690]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life?
[03:21:52.690 --> 03:21:54.991]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[03:21:54.991 --> 03:21:57.073]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[03:21:57.073 --> 03:21:57.713]  Don't wait.
[03:21:57.713 --> 03:22:00.355]  waronthegrid.com.
[03:22:00.355 --> 03:22:01.296]  This is it.
[03:22:01.296 --> 03:22:03.738]  For the first time ever on this station, U.S.

[03:22:15.127 --> 03:22:16.408]  This first-ever U.S.
[03:22:16.408 --> 03:22:22.694]  legal tender government gold offered at cost for only $139 each is from the U.S.

[03:22:31.801 --> 03:22:33.483]  government gold offered at cost
[03:22:33.683 --> 03:22:34.023]  I think so.
[03:22:59.702 --> 03:23:03.787]  Mother's Day is next week, and ProFlowers is offering an amazing special.

[03:24:14.886 --> 03:24:16.307]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:16.307 --> 03:24:17.348]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:24:17.348 --> 03:24:18.909]  Joining me now is Joe Biggs.
[03:24:18.909 --> 03:24:20.550]  We've got a lot of news to talk about.
[03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:26.173]  We're going to talk about actor Tim Robbins blaming Sanders' losses on voter fraud.
[03:24:26.173 --> 03:24:28.915]  And that's not as improbable as you may think.
[03:24:29.628 --> 03:24:38.153]  Because we've got some very interesting information coming out of Arizona right now about fraud at multiple levels within the votes.
[03:24:38.153 --> 03:24:40.974]  And this is not even on the rigged GOP side.
[03:24:40.974 --> 03:24:47.538]  We're also going to be talking about another incredible example of civil asset forfeiture.
[03:24:47.538 --> 03:24:52.381]  Police taking $53,000 from a Christian band and an orphanage and a church.
[03:24:53.281 --> 03:24:55.603]  Okay, charging the money with the crime.
[03:24:55.603 --> 03:24:57.865]  Because, you know, it is a crime if you have cash.
[03:24:57.865 --> 03:25:12.055]  Let's be honest about that in modern America, and let's be honest about the fact that the federal government has turned our law enforcement agencies, many of them bribing them to participate in this theft, they've turned them into literal highway robbers.
[03:25:12.055 --> 03:25:14.878]  You know, as Lysander Spoonery said, the difference between
[03:25:15.874 --> 03:25:23.959]  The government and a highway robber, is that a highway robber just steals your money and leaves you alone, but the government takes your money and follows you down the road, nagging you as you go along.
[03:25:23.959 --> 03:25:32.024]  Well, that literally has become the case now with our government, but I want to talk about the story that was on the Drudge Report with Joe Biggs now.
[03:25:32.024 --> 03:25:37.808]  This is a Judicial Watch story, and this harkens back to something you did, what was it, about a year ago, wasn't it?
[03:25:37.808 --> 03:25:42.011]  Yeah, it was April 15th and 16th, 17th, 18th of last year.
[03:25:42.011 --> 03:25:42.331]  Yeah.
[03:25:42.331 --> 03:25:44.553]  So it's been about a year, just a little over a year ago, yeah.
[03:25:44.553 --> 03:25:45.173]  Yeah, interesting.
[03:25:45.233 --> 03:25:55.443]  So yeah, it's red-linked on Drudge and it's cartels help terrorists in Mexico get to US to explore targets ISIS militant Mahmoud Omar Kabir among them.
[03:25:55.443 --> 03:26:08.996]  It says Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the US to explore targets for future attacks according to information forwarded to Judicial Watch by high-ranking homeland security official in the border state.
[03:26:10.237 --> 03:26:23.760]  Myself, Josh Owens, went down there a year ago and actually investigated the initial reports by Judicial Watch, saying that there was some information from some high-level people that there was some ISIS activity in Anapra.
[03:26:23.760 --> 03:26:32.221]  Now, if you actually look at a map, you have El Paso, and then south of that is Chihuahua, Juarez, and then eight miles west of that over is Anapra.
[03:26:32.221 --> 03:26:34.702]  And that's actually an area that I ended up going into.
[03:26:34.702 --> 03:26:36.262]  I found a local in that area.
[03:26:36.262 --> 03:26:37.162]  He drove me across.
[03:26:37.162 --> 03:26:39.563]  I went over there by myself with this guy's help to drive me around.
[03:26:40.223 --> 03:27:00.534]  And we found some interesting things, you know, and on the way back, the FBI stopped us at the airport and questioned me, and Josh Owens was able to sit there with me and kind of listen in on the whole thing, and they said that they believe that that's a viable threat, that they think that's something that's real, and they believe what Judicial Watch is reporting, and that the sources that they're getting this stuff from is something that they are interested in, they're looking into.
[03:27:00.534 --> 03:27:02.215]  And now we have more corroboration of that.
[03:27:02.215 --> 03:27:05.957]  We've had an Italian newspaper article, they report on this in this article,
[03:27:06.577 --> 03:27:06.837]  Exactly.
[03:27:27.165 --> 03:27:31.648]  Yeah, I just, I told you, I just saw Cartel Land, just saw it on DVD.
[03:27:31.648 --> 03:27:33.710]  I missed it when it first came out.
[03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:35.431]  An amazing documentary.
[03:27:35.431 --> 03:27:45.139]  And I tell you, when you look at this, the difference between the cartels themselves and the Islamic terrorists is a distinction without a difference, quite frankly.
[03:27:45.139 --> 03:27:47.781]  It doesn't surprise me at all to see them cooperating with each other.
[03:27:48.001 --> 03:27:54.625]  Well, everyone seems to find that hard to believe that the cartels and ISIS could, you know, so to say, get in bed together with one another.
[03:27:54.625 --> 03:27:58.228]  They both believe in money and they both believe in blood to get that money.
[03:27:58.228 --> 03:28:00.109]  And decapitations, yes.
[03:28:00.109 --> 03:28:13.237]  And actually in some of those articles it says that a lot of beheadings have been on the rise in these border areas due to what they believe would be some Islamic extremism due to ISIS moving into these areas and coming over.
[03:28:13.237 --> 03:28:15.379]  You know, I've shown people time and time again
[03:28:16.039 --> 03:28:21.041]  In Texas, in Arizona, how easy it is to walk into Mexico and come back over to the U.S.
[03:28:21.041 --> 03:28:22.701]  without even being seen.
[03:28:22.701 --> 03:28:25.222]  So it's not going to be that hard for these people to do it.
[03:28:25.222 --> 03:28:30.184]  And you've got this guy, he comes out in this Italian newspaper, he says, the border that separates Mexico from the U.S.
[03:28:30.184 --> 03:28:36.966]  is so full of free zones that I could come in with a group of men in a few hours and kill thousands of people in Texas and Arizona.
[03:28:36.966 --> 03:28:40.147]  And that has been my biggest concern because I have family in both of those states.
[03:28:40.367 --> 03:28:40.727]  Yeah.
[03:28:40.727 --> 03:28:43.368]  Especially along the border area and friends.
[03:28:43.368 --> 03:28:45.769]  I don't want to see something like this happen and here it is.
[03:28:45.769 --> 03:28:53.512]  We're over a year later from these initial reports and now we actually have this guy coming out bragging about how easy it is.
[03:28:53.512 --> 03:28:57.294]  This is a guy who was chased out of Kuwait for his extremism ties over a decade ago.
[03:28:57.754 --> 03:29:03.160]  So this guy is training people by the hundreds, by the thousands now, to carry out attacks.
[03:29:03.160 --> 03:29:06.483]  And they're saying, he's bragging about it, that they're willing to do it.
[03:29:06.483 --> 03:29:07.985]  And what have we done in the last year?
[03:29:07.985 --> 03:29:08.685]  We've done nothing.
[03:29:08.685 --> 03:29:10.467]  Our border hasn't gotten any stronger.
[03:29:10.467 --> 03:29:12.569]  We have no more Border Patrol agents being out there.
[03:29:12.569 --> 03:29:15.252]  Half these guys don't even do their job that are out there anyways.
[03:29:15.252 --> 03:29:17.354]  They have no motivation to do their jobs.
[03:29:17.354 --> 03:29:18.616]  Well, they're told they can't do it.
[03:29:19.056 --> 03:29:21.898]  They've interviewed the Vice President of the Border Patrol Union.
[03:29:21.898 --> 03:29:26.402]  They've come out very strongly in favor of Donald Trump because they're very frustrated.
[03:29:26.402 --> 03:29:28.163]  They've been told they have to stand down.
[03:29:28.163 --> 03:29:29.584]  They're prevented from doing their job.
[03:29:29.584 --> 03:29:30.845]  They want to do their job.
[03:29:30.845 --> 03:29:40.152]  They see what the problem is and yet they set up these absurd permanent checkpoints a hundred miles and when I've been out to West Texas, it's absolutely amazing.
[03:29:40.152 --> 03:29:40.552]  Stay with us.
[03:29:40.552 --> 03:29:41.233]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:41.233 --> 03:29:45.056]  We've got a lot of news to cover and we'll be talking to Joe Biggs about the exposure
[03:29:45.716 --> 03:29:50.060]  To Mexican cartels as well as ISIS militants.
[03:29:50.060 --> 03:29:53.983]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.983 --> 03:29:56.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.490 --> 03:30:08.933]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes less and less transparent.
[03:30:08.933 --> 03:30:14.616]  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the conflict here.
[03:30:14.616 --> 03:30:20.278]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[03:30:21.209 --> 03:30:22.430]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[03:30:22.430 --> 03:30:26.132]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[03:30:26.132 --> 03:30:30.115]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:30:51.149 --> 03:30:58.977]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7pm as we cover the primaries in the Northeast.

[03:31:12.109 --> 03:31:17.512]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:33:20.302 --> 03:33:21.644]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.644 --> 03:33:24.548]  I'm David Knight, your host, and with me is Joe Biggs.
[03:33:24.548 --> 03:33:31.716]  We're going to be live tonight doing election coverage and analysis of the five state primaries in the Northeast.
[03:33:31.716 --> 03:33:32.698]  I'm going to get back to Joe.
[03:33:32.698 --> 03:33:36.523]  We're going to talk about what's going on at our porous border, the danger.
[03:33:37.123 --> 03:33:37.563]  That's right.
[03:34:07.123 --> 03:34:12.068]  Off of all InfoWars select storable food right now for limited time at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:34:13.993 --> 03:34:17.415]  Well, Joe, you know, we're looking at this article that Judicial Watch put out.
[03:34:17.415 --> 03:34:26.482]  They're talking about how the Mexican Army federal law enforcement officials discovered documents in Arabic, in Urdu, as well as plans of Fort Bliss, okay?
[03:34:26.482 --> 03:34:32.446]  They said that they also found Muslim prayer rugs that were there, recovered during the documents, during the operation.
[03:34:32.446 --> 03:34:39.451]  We've also had, as InfoWars reporters have gone down there, we've seen the multilingual signs that they even post up, you know?
[03:34:40.191 --> 03:34:41.392]  It's all these different languages.
[03:34:41.392 --> 03:34:46.016]  The border is wide open and this is very clear evidence.
[03:34:46.016 --> 03:34:52.641]  Even the Mexican officials are warning us about this saying we can't believe this is being ignored by the American government.
[03:34:52.641 --> 03:34:55.924]  I mean they've even found these prayer rugs and documents and things like that 125 miles inland.
[03:34:58.226 --> 03:35:08.275]  From the border in Falfurias, when John Bowne and Jakari Jackson and, you know, Kit Daniels, all these guys went down there, Don Salazar, and looked and interviewed these people.
[03:35:08.275 --> 03:35:09.136]  It's happening.
[03:35:09.136 --> 03:35:11.298]  And it's not just at the border, it's moving in.
[03:35:11.298 --> 03:35:11.498]  Yes.
[03:35:11.498 --> 03:35:23.649]  And there's so many of these guys who are already in these cells, these sleeper cells, waiting, that I just don't understand why our government is allowing this to happen so much, and the fact that... And that's the key, they're allowing it to happen.
[03:35:23.649 --> 03:35:24.530]  It isn't that they don't know.
[03:35:24.910 --> 03:35:26.511]  Everybody is sounding the alarm.
[03:35:26.511 --> 03:35:27.472]  You've got Judicial Watch.
[03:35:27.472 --> 03:35:28.573]  We've talked about it.
[03:35:28.573 --> 03:35:30.535]  The Mexican government is talking about it.
[03:35:30.535 --> 03:35:35.178]  As Judicial Watch is saying, they found evidence that the State Department has known about this for decades.
[03:35:35.178 --> 03:35:35.659]  I mean, yeah.
[03:35:35.659 --> 03:35:39.822]  I mean, in Laredo, Texas, Josh Owens and I caught smugglers coming across.
[03:35:39.822 --> 03:35:46.688]  You know, those were drugs, but that could easily be some kind of chemical or something like that that could be used in explosives.
[03:35:46.688 --> 03:35:50.371]  You know, it's a stretch for that, but it definitely is something that can happen.
[03:35:50.371 --> 03:35:51.212]  Well, we invaded Iraq.
[03:35:51.972 --> 03:35:58.057]  Supposedly because there's weapons of mass destruction and yet they won't clear our border for weapons of mass destruction.
[03:35:58.057 --> 03:36:10.648]  Somehow you at the airport with a fingernail clipper is a greater concern to them than ISIS bringing over whatever they can carry into the border and of course they can carry it with an armored truck if they want.
[03:36:10.708 --> 03:36:14.631]  Yeah, the police stopped us on the border numerous times investigating, looking at the wide open border.
[03:36:14.631 --> 03:36:24.638]  They're more concerned about reporters going out there than they are these ISIS jihadis who could be possibly coming over, or cartel guys, or gang members and stuff like that.
[03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:30.822]  You know, the mainstream media always wants to portray it as there's these young women and children who are coming across the border.
[03:36:30.822 --> 03:36:31.663]  Yeah, there are some.
[03:36:31.843 --> 03:36:32.103]  Yeah.
[03:36:32.103 --> 03:36:33.344]  But they're not all.
[03:36:33.344 --> 03:36:38.606]  Their definition of children goes up pretty high to adult status here in the real world.
[03:36:38.606 --> 03:36:38.846]  Yeah.
[03:36:38.846 --> 03:36:52.551]  You know, so, I mean, it's kind of BS when you see this and you actually go down there and you can put your eyes on that and see it and then you read these articles that some of these people put out like Fox News and CNN and you're just like, oh my God, like how do you, how do you sleep at night?
[03:36:52.551 --> 03:36:53.131]  Yeah.
[03:36:53.131 --> 03:36:58.373]  Yeah, I'd like to see Glenn Beck and David Barton go down and hand some teddy bears to these ISIS guys.
[03:36:58.373 --> 03:36:59.073]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:37:01.154 --> 03:37:15.303]  Yeah, you know, as I was talking about Cartel Land, it truly was amazing, and watching that movie, and if you haven't seen that movie, you really need to watch that to get a feel for what's happening, both on the American side and on the Mexican side.
[03:37:15.303 --> 03:37:18.905]  This guy who put this film together, and we've interviewed him here at InfoWars.
[03:37:19.905 --> 03:37:32.900]  Uh, it truly was amazing how he embedded himself with them, got their confidence, uh, but to also show the fact that you've got people both in America and in Mexico that are concerned because their governments don't do anything.
[03:37:32.900 --> 03:37:35.824]  In many cases, their governments partner with these people.
[03:37:35.824 --> 03:37:38.907]  I thought it was absolutely amazing the parallels between
[03:37:39.628 --> 03:37:44.233]  What was happening in the Mexican town in the movie like The Magnificent Seven, for example, okay?
[03:37:44.233 --> 03:37:45.774]  Which itself is a common problem.
[03:37:45.774 --> 03:37:49.978]  I mean, that was based on a Japanese story by Kurosawa, okay?
[03:37:49.978 --> 03:37:51.059]  The Seven Samurai.
[03:37:51.059 --> 03:37:54.382]  So this is a universal experience when the government disarms you.
[03:37:54.382 --> 03:38:01.929]  What did the government do when they started to get a citizen movement together to protect their towns in a way that the government refused to do?
[03:38:01.929 --> 03:38:04.452]  The government came in and decided they would disarm the people.
[03:38:05.032 --> 03:38:09.717]  And so as they were stacking their arms up, they started ringing the church bell.
[03:38:09.717 --> 03:38:13.341]  They got on the PA system and said, come and help us.
[03:38:13.341 --> 03:38:15.944]  They're taking away our means to protect ourselves.
[03:38:15.944 --> 03:38:23.231]  And the citizens came out there, unarmed, and shooed the government out of the way that was there confiscating the firearms.
[03:38:23.231 --> 03:38:24.533]  An amazing story.
[03:38:24.533 --> 03:38:25.754]  Truly an amazing story.
[03:38:25.754 --> 03:38:26.395]  Amazing film.
[03:38:26.906 --> 03:38:37.200]  Well also one of the things they're saying too is that this Mexican ISIL has managed to import small arms, ammunition, and even devices for air targets directly from the former Iraqi arsenal of Saddam Hussein.
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:44.330]  And they said that the only one to express any concern was Republican Governor of Texas Greg Abbott, who informed the White House candidate Donald Trump.
[03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:50.972]  And during a public speech, Abbott announced that ISIS terrorists would have repeatedly crossed the border on an exploratory mission.
[03:38:50.972 --> 03:38:57.754]  And he says he thinks it's very possible that they could be ramping up this Islamic State to start carrying out attacks.
[03:38:57.754 --> 03:39:01.976]  And like you said, we keep hearing this all the time that they want to crack down on gun control.
[03:39:01.976 --> 03:39:07.297]  This is our means of protecting ourselves if these psychopaths come over and do something.
[03:39:07.297 --> 03:39:10.198]  Texas and Arizona, we thrive on the Second Amendment.
[03:39:10.198 --> 03:39:10.518]  That's right.
[03:39:10.518 --> 03:39:12.459]  You know, we need to be able to have this.
[03:39:12.759 --> 03:39:13.199]  That's right.
[03:39:13.199 --> 03:39:18.423]  But they're going to be bringing in, perhaps, some pretty heavy weapons, as you just mentioned, just put there.
[03:39:18.423 --> 03:39:24.847]  So, yeah, they can get off the first shots and they can kill a lot of people off with the first volley.
[03:39:24.847 --> 03:39:28.750]  And so, yeah, the Second Amendment is going to provide us with some protection.
[03:39:28.750 --> 03:39:38.217]  And we have a better situation here in America than they do in Mexico, where they go around when the people try to protect themselves and just take their weapons from them and throw them in jail, which is what happened there.
[03:39:39.157 --> 03:39:39.598]  It is.
[03:39:39.598 --> 03:39:42.360]  It is something we should all be very, very concerned about.
[03:39:42.360 --> 03:39:43.581]  Now, you're going to be joining us tonight.
[03:39:43.581 --> 03:39:47.343]  We're going to have coverage of the five northeastern states that are going to be voting tonight.
[03:39:47.343 --> 03:39:50.425]  We're going to have live coverage and analysis after the nightly news.
[03:39:50.425 --> 03:39:51.686]  We'll have our regular nightly news.
[03:39:51.686 --> 03:39:54.508]  And then as the polls are closing, we're going to talk about that.
[03:39:54.508 --> 03:39:57.490]  And I've got some news that I want to get into in terms of
[03:39:58.371 --> 03:40:05.657]  Questions about the polls that are being brought up by actor Tim Robbins and others in Arizona and elsewhere.
[03:40:05.657 --> 03:40:11.822]  But before we do, I want to play this clip for you of Trump talking about the Cruz-Kasich alliance.
[03:40:11.822 --> 03:40:12.663]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[03:40:12.663 --> 03:40:13.343]  We'll see you tonight.
[03:40:13.343 --> 03:40:14.004]  All right, thanks.
[03:40:14.004 --> 03:40:19.988]  Let's play that clip of Trump talking about the alliance between Cruz and Kasich.
[03:40:19.988 --> 03:40:21.570]  Did you see the news today?
[03:40:21.570 --> 03:40:25.553]  Did you see where they band together, where they collude?
[03:40:25.553 --> 03:40:26.634]  You know, it's collusion.
[03:40:30.282 --> 03:40:37.505]  You know, if you collude in business, if you collude in business, or if you collude in the stock market, they put you in jail.
[03:40:37.505 --> 03:40:46.549]  But in politics, because it's a rigged system, because it's a corrupt enterprise, in politics, you're allowed to collude.
[03:40:46.549 --> 03:40:52.052]  So they colluded, and actually I was happy, because it shows how weak they are.
[03:40:52.052 --> 03:40:54.533]  It shows how pathetic they are.
[03:40:55.893 --> 03:40:59.895]  You know, I tweeted today, at real Donald Trump, my tweet.
[03:40:59.895 --> 03:41:01.076]  I thought, you know, it solves it.
[03:41:01.076 --> 03:41:04.157]  Don't worry, I'll give it up after I'm president.
[03:41:04.157 --> 03:41:06.258]  We won't tweet anymore, I don't think.
[03:41:06.258 --> 03:41:07.178]  Not presidential.
[03:41:07.178 --> 03:41:16.843]  But let me tell you, and I said, it takes two long-time politicians, right, to beat, except they're way behind.
[03:41:16.843 --> 03:41:17.383]  If you add up
[03:41:17.583 --> 03:41:18.924]  I've only been doing this for 10 months.
[03:41:18.924 --> 03:41:20.204]  I haven't even been doing it very long.
[03:41:40.871 --> 03:41:44.854]  Well, you know, that alliance didn't last more than about 12 hours.
[03:41:44.854 --> 03:41:49.057]  It was actually kind of funny because that was something that was announced, I think, over the weekend.
[03:41:49.057 --> 03:41:53.821]  And you had people like, I think it's Katie Packer with Our Principles Pack.
[03:41:53.821 --> 03:41:55.822]  These are basically Romney supporters.
[03:41:55.822 --> 03:41:57.944]  I call them Romulans, okay?
[03:41:57.944 --> 03:41:59.225]  And they've uncloaked.
[03:41:59.225 --> 03:42:07.551]  When they're talking about the conservative principles, you've got to understand, this lady who was a co-chair for Mitt Romney, she doesn't share conservative principles.
[03:42:07.992 --> 03:42:12.236]  She openly supports all the things that are dog whistles to the base.
[03:42:12.236 --> 03:42:14.018]  She supports abortion.
[03:42:14.018 --> 03:42:15.440]  She supports gay marriage.
[03:42:15.440 --> 03:42:19.445]  And then she goes to CPAC and says, Donald Trump isn't conservative enough.
[03:42:19.445 --> 03:42:21.627]  You need to come in on these social issues.
[03:42:21.627 --> 03:42:24.550]  That's the way they've been playing the electorate for a long time.
[03:42:25.211 --> 03:42:29.853]  And that's why Donald Trump is doing so well because he is transcending these issues.
[03:42:29.853 --> 03:42:31.893]  He's talking about the things we were just talking about.
[03:42:31.893 --> 03:42:40.556]  The porous open borders that will destroy our country economically, culturally, and socially if it doesn't destroy us with ISIS terrorists who are coming in.
[03:42:40.876 --> 03:42:42.777]  Let's take a look at some of the stuff that's coming up tonight.
[03:42:42.777 --> 03:42:51.520]  Of course, Donald Trump says, as you've got all these actors and actresses saying, if Donald Trump wins, I'm going to go to Canada.
[03:42:51.520 --> 03:42:53.140]  And he says, great, vote for me.
[03:42:53.140 --> 03:42:54.040]  Get rid of them.
[03:42:54.040 --> 03:42:56.921]  This is Rosie O'Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg, Lynette Dunham.
[03:42:56.921 --> 03:43:00.463]  You know, he goes, that's another minute to win now to get rid of these people.
[03:43:00.463 --> 03:43:04.284]  My question is, when we look at this, can we get a promise from Ted Cruz
[03:43:04.904 --> 03:43:06.905]  That he will go back to Canada.
[03:43:06.905 --> 03:43:08.425]  I mean, that's the key thing.
[03:43:08.425 --> 03:43:11.147]  Will he leave Texas, please, and go back to Canada?
[03:43:11.147 --> 03:43:14.488]  You know, he really needs to be primaried in this next election.
[03:43:14.488 --> 03:43:16.149]  He'll be coming up for his first re-election.
[03:43:16.149 --> 03:43:21.471]  You know, this is a guy who hadn't even finished half of his first term when he was running for president openly.
[03:43:22.031 --> 03:43:26.237]  Okay, he went to the Senate and immediately started climbing over the backs of other people.
[03:43:26.237 --> 03:43:28.260]  It's one of the reasons they can't stand him in the Senate.
[03:43:28.260 --> 03:43:32.545]  Immediately started running for president as soon as he got elected as senator.
[03:43:32.545 --> 03:43:34.428]  People are talking about John Kennedy, JFK.
[03:43:36.249 --> 03:43:40.491]  Running for Senate because he had only served a little over one Senate term.
[03:43:40.491 --> 03:43:50.297]  Of course, he'd had several terms as well as a congressman, but that's nothing compared to the guy who didn't even have half of a Senate term.
[03:43:50.297 --> 03:43:54.879]  Donald Trump, we're told, can't beat Hillary Clinton, and I think that's absolute nonsense.
[03:43:54.879 --> 03:43:58.702]  Look, we're so far out in the election, as I pointed out a couple of times at this point in the spring,
[03:43:59.602 --> 03:44:06.965]  When Ronald Reagan, the gold standard for the Republican Party, was running for president, he was 15 points behind.
[03:44:06.965 --> 03:44:09.707]  And he was running against an incumbent president.
[03:44:09.707 --> 03:44:10.027]  Okay?
[03:44:10.027 --> 03:44:14.089]  So it really doesn't make any difference right now when you look at the polls.
[03:44:14.089 --> 03:44:16.690]  And as Trump has pointed out, he really hasn't focused on Hillary.
[03:44:17.390 --> 03:44:25.234]  He's been focused on trying to win the primary and fighting off 17 competitors and here's a sample of how this is going to play out.
[03:44:25.234 --> 03:44:29.857]  Trump says Hillary is crooked and guilty as hell over her email servers.
[03:44:29.857 --> 03:44:34.039]  He says I call her crooked Hillary because she's crooked and the only thing she's got is the woman card.
[03:44:34.679 --> 03:44:35.980]  And that's all she's got.
[03:44:35.980 --> 03:44:42.025]  And you know, she's talking about doubling down on that card, talking about how, well, I think I'll have two women on the ticket.
[03:44:42.025 --> 03:44:50.591]  I think maybe I'll have a vice president as woman as well, because that truly is the only thing that she can offer up there, the identity card.
[03:44:50.591 --> 03:44:51.872]  Vote for me, I'm a woman.
[03:44:51.872 --> 03:44:55.375]  And as he points out, you know, we can get some women to run that aren't crooked.
[03:44:55.375 --> 03:45:00.419]  Unfortunately, I don't see anybody on the Republican side, because all we've got is Carly Fiorina and
[03:45:02.020 --> 03:45:05.001]  We've got Ted Cruz as if he's got a chance.
[03:45:05.001 --> 03:45:08.603]  I mean, he's mathematically been eliminated for all practical purposes.
[03:45:08.603 --> 03:45:11.645]  After tonight, Ted Cruz will be mathematically eliminated.
[03:45:11.645 --> 03:45:14.766]  He needs 92% of the delegates from here on out.
[03:45:14.766 --> 03:45:16.847]  He's going to get very, very few of them.
[03:45:16.847 --> 03:45:21.910]  He'll be lucky in some of these states if he even gets to the threshold to get any delegates in some of these states.
[03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:24.031]  But now he's fantasizing about
[03:45:25.051 --> 03:45:26.833]  Who he would have as his VP.
[03:45:26.833 --> 03:45:31.077]  I guess this is the equivalent of the Fantasy Football League for the politicians.
[03:45:31.077 --> 03:45:32.499]  And he talks about Carly Fiorina.
[03:45:32.499 --> 03:45:34.301]  And again, this comes up.
[03:45:35.742 --> 03:45:45.269]  It was about a year ago, well not even a year ago, that there was a SuperPAC that had $536,000 that they spent over the quarter.
[03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:50.452]  And the report surfaced in September about what they had done at the end of the quarter.
[03:45:50.452 --> 03:45:51.713]  They were looking at this.
[03:45:51.713 --> 03:45:54.515]  Of the $536,000 that this cruise SuperPAC spent, $500,000 of it was given to Carly Fiorina's campaign.
[03:46:01.215 --> 03:46:03.416]  And it's like, what is going on with this?
[03:46:03.416 --> 03:46:08.479]  And actually, the FEC said, please explain to us what is going on with this.
[03:46:08.479 --> 03:46:18.384]  And a lot of people reported that, but I've never seen anything about the letter that came back, the explanation as to why so much money would be given to Carly Fiorina.
[03:46:18.384 --> 03:46:26.628]  Of course, she was running interference for Ted Cruz when the National Enquirer story broke about the possible affairs that he had had.
[03:46:27.428 --> 03:46:34.935]  We also see a story up on InfoWars.com report Cruz and Kasich campaign apps are spying on users and tracking data.
[03:46:34.935 --> 03:46:36.637]  This is a Kit Daniels report.
[03:46:36.637 --> 03:46:49.969]  He points out the official Ted Cruz and John Kasich smartphone apps are tracking users and this is according to Symantec, the people who look at vulnerabilities on your phone, on your computer and warn you about these vulnerabilities and say, hey look,
[03:46:50.569 --> 03:46:57.293]  This app, which says that it's going to do such and such, is also scooping up your own personal data and sending this back.
[03:46:57.293 --> 03:47:03.837]  As a matter of fact, the Kasik app was rated by Symantec as a medium security risk.
[03:47:03.837 --> 03:47:04.478]  Okay?
[03:47:04.478 --> 03:47:12.222]  They say, if an app is asking for more information than you're comfortable sharing, it might be a sign to run the other way.
[03:47:12.222 --> 03:47:12.743]  Yeah.
[03:47:13.323 --> 03:47:20.267]  Run very fast the other way from these candidates, especially from Big Brother Cruz.
[03:47:20.267 --> 03:47:24.109]  OK, this guy has taken it to an all new art.
[03:47:24.109 --> 03:47:31.673]  And when I see him doing this as a candidate, it really concerns me as to what Ted Cruz would do as a president.
[03:47:31.673 --> 03:47:36.376]  This is the guy who has a app that he gives his people going door to door.
[03:47:37.156 --> 03:48:01.748]  This is part of his quote-unquote ground game, where he analyzes you because he's pulled up things from your phone, like all kinds of things about your identification, details, what you do, and he also has other ways to mine information about you outside of your phone, even if you don't get this app, and he's able to tell his people going door-to-door precisely what you want to hear.
[03:48:03.001 --> 03:48:04.822]  This is their key issue.
[03:48:04.822 --> 03:48:07.184]  This is the way you should approach them.
[03:48:07.184 --> 03:48:07.944]  Okay?
[03:48:07.944 --> 03:48:15.489]  The malleable candidate that can be everything to everyone, and the shapeshifter that we have seen him turn into.
[03:48:15.489 --> 03:48:18.651]  That is truly what has happened with Ted Cruz.
[03:48:18.651 --> 03:48:30.738]  Now, when I was talking about the election, and the concern that people have about whether or not these are for real, there was an interesting tweet that was put out by actor Tim Robbins, and he supports Bernie Sanders.
[03:48:30.738 --> 03:48:31.699]  And he says, alright,
[03:48:32.625 --> 03:48:35.708]  Says the election is being stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[03:48:35.708 --> 03:48:37.569]  Now a lot of people are going to dismiss this.
[03:48:37.569 --> 03:48:43.594]  Whenever we talk about corruption, whenever we talk about rigging, people are going to say, it's sour grapes.
[03:48:43.594 --> 03:48:45.035]  You're paranoid.
[03:48:45.035 --> 03:48:46.636]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:48:46.636 --> 03:48:51.881]  Look, I don't even support Bernie Sanders, but I'm concerned about honest elections.
[03:48:51.881 --> 03:48:54.323]  And you should be concerned as well.
[03:48:54.323 --> 03:48:56.124]  And I think he's on to something here.
[03:48:56.124 --> 03:48:59.047]  Because what he did was, he looked at exit polling.
[03:49:01.496 --> 03:49:03.483]  We hear a lot about exit polling, don't we?
[03:49:04.465 --> 03:49:16.273]  We hear that women prefer Candidate A over Candidate B, according to exit polls, and the evangelicals chose Candidate B over Candidate A, that type of thing.
[03:49:16.273 --> 03:49:18.354]  You notice what they never tell you.
[03:49:18.354 --> 03:49:26.019]  They'll tell you all the way up to the election, hey, I've got a poll here that says Candidate A is five points over Candidate B, and so forth and so on.
[03:49:26.019 --> 03:49:33.825]  But when all of a sudden, Candidate A, who was up by five points, is losing by ten points on election day, you don't hear the exit poll
[03:49:34.565 --> 03:49:44.088]  That says, oh, and by the way, here's what our exit poll said, and interestingly enough, they don't agree with the results that are being reported in the election.
[03:49:44.088 --> 03:49:45.569]  You don't hear that, do you?
[03:49:45.569 --> 03:49:46.949]  Have you ever heard that?
[03:49:46.949 --> 03:49:48.390]  I don't recall ever hearing that.
[03:49:48.390 --> 03:49:54.792]  I looked very hard after the Utah primary because I was very concerned about what was going on there on the GOP side.
[03:49:55.532 --> 03:50:01.539]  We had a company, Smartmatic, which has a reputation throughout Central and South America.
[03:50:01.539 --> 03:50:04.042]  It is the largest electronic voting machine company.
[03:50:04.042 --> 03:50:07.766]  Of course, there's also Diebold and some other ones, but Smartmatic is the largest one.
[03:50:07.766 --> 03:50:11.430]  Do you know Smartmatic comes from Venezuela?
[03:50:11.430 --> 03:50:13.272]  Do you know that Smartmatic was
[03:50:13.993 --> 03:50:17.397]  It's founded by some people who were friends of Hugo Chavez.
[03:50:17.397 --> 03:50:22.463]  You know that Smartmatic was accused by many people of rigging elections for Hugo Chavez?
[03:50:22.463 --> 03:50:26.708]  The American government accused them of doing that in the mid-2000s.
[03:50:26.708 --> 03:50:32.134]  And we've had situations in the Philippines and Mexico, as I pointed out, and Brazil, okay?
[03:50:32.134 --> 03:50:33.355]  The lady who is being
[03:50:34.176 --> 03:50:36.277]  Impeached right now, the president of Brazil.
[03:50:36.277 --> 03:50:38.539]  She was a very unpopular socialist in Brazil.
[03:50:38.539 --> 03:50:44.062]  She was down by nine points and all of a sudden, magically, she comes up in the polls.
[03:50:44.062 --> 03:50:45.643]  And there were no exit polls.
[03:50:45.643 --> 03:50:48.625]  The people who typically did exit polls, they shut them down.
[03:50:48.625 --> 03:50:52.167]  Tim Robbins looks at this and he says, he's got a list on his tweet.
[03:50:52.167 --> 03:50:59.011]  All the way down here, he's got all these different states where there's a huge difference between the exit polls and Hillary's advantage.
[03:50:59.011 --> 03:51:00.212]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[03:51:00.212 --> 03:51:00.612]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.735 --> 03:51:08.600]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular heartbeat?
[03:51:08.600 --> 03:51:13.004]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:13.004 --> 03:51:14.965]  You hear the ads all the time.
[03:51:14.965 --> 03:51:17.948]  If this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[03:51:18.488 --> 03:51:19.349]  That's easy.
[03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:21.810]  There's more money in treating symptoms.

[03:52:18.750 --> 03:52:24.711]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:52:25.151 --> 03:52:28.032]  Optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:52:28.032 --> 03:52:30.233]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:54:08.556 --> 03:54:09.976]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:09.976 --> 03:54:11.617]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:54:11.617 --> 03:54:19.059]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to remind you that we have a sale on storable foods, our select storable foods at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:19.059 --> 03:54:20.539]  30 to 40 percent off.
[03:54:20.539 --> 03:54:22.500]  This is a great time to stock up.
[03:54:22.500 --> 03:54:25.140]  You always need to have a backup supply.
[03:54:25.140 --> 03:54:31.842]  Just as we're talking about the rigged elections in Venezuela, understand that they're now rationing power there.
[03:54:31.842 --> 03:54:33.622]  That's the essence of socialism, isn't it?
[03:54:33.622 --> 03:54:35.123]  To ration power.
[03:54:35.123 --> 03:54:35.903]  They're turning off
[03:54:36.423 --> 03:54:36.783]  Everything.
[03:54:36.783 --> 03:54:43.186]  They're turning off the refrigerators, they're turning off the fans, the electric fans, the electric lights, shutting down the power.
[03:54:43.186 --> 03:54:46.408]  You know, when they take all power, they're going to ration it.
[03:54:46.408 --> 03:54:47.909]  Anything can happen in the United States.
[03:54:47.909 --> 03:54:50.670]  We can have a natural disaster, we can have a political disaster.
[03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:55.552]  Somebody like Bernie Sanders could get elected and he could start rationing power.
[03:54:55.552 --> 03:54:56.773]  Look, you need to be prepared.
[03:54:57.353 --> 03:54:59.635]  And one way to do that is to stock up.
[03:54:59.635 --> 03:55:04.900]  We have a sale, we've got a massive sale right now, 30 to 40% off on select storable foods.
[03:55:04.900 --> 03:55:08.543]  These are things that will have a shelf life of 25 years.
[03:55:08.543 --> 03:55:11.305]  So now is the time to stock up.
[03:55:11.305 --> 03:55:16.810]  While supplies last, 30 to 40% off all InfoWars select storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:18.431 --> 03:55:24.236]  As I was pointing out just before we went to break, and as I just said, obviously I don't support Bernie Sanders.
[03:55:24.236 --> 03:55:33.544]  I call him Bernie Sandernista because he was so enthralled with Nicaragua and what was going on there, the socialists there, as well as Venezuela and Hugo Chavez.
[03:55:33.544 --> 03:55:38.689]  You know, it truly is the essence of socialism that when they get power, they ration it.
[03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:39.749]  They ration everything.
[03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:49.923]  And just keep dividing, taking the pie that keeps shrinking and cutting it into smaller and smaller pieces for everybody except themselves.
[03:55:49.923 --> 03:55:55.630]  But let's get back to the election because having honest elections is something we really need to be concerned about.
[03:55:56.932 --> 03:55:58.613]  That came out from actor Tim Robbins.
[03:55:58.613 --> 03:56:10.082]  He lays it down state by state, the differences here, and highlights some of the states that he believes were flipped from the Bernie Sanders column to the Hillary Clinton side.
[03:56:10.082 --> 03:56:12.524]  One of them that sticks out the most here is Arizona.
[03:56:13.565 --> 03:56:31.688]  Bernie got dropped by about 5-6% and Hillary was bumped up by 25% so she went up 33% and when you look at the exit polls and they don't agree with the previous polls, they don't agree with the reported vote totals out of the places, you have to ask yourself what's going on?
[03:56:32.088 --> 03:56:40.036]  Well, people are starting to ask that, and so now we see that Arizona poll workers are confirming rigged and irregular primaries.
[03:56:40.036 --> 03:56:44.060]  And they say it focused on the Democrat side, interestingly enough, in Arizona.
[03:56:44.060 --> 03:56:47.443]  Of course, we see it happening on the Republican side in other states.
[03:56:47.443 --> 03:56:52.288]  This is a Maricopa County poll worker, Diane Post, who's talking about
[03:56:53.531 --> 03:56:56.854]  Many different testifying about many different things that she saw there.
[03:56:56.854 --> 03:57:07.522]  They say the Democrat Party, Bernie Sanders, and even Hillary Clinton, ironically, who was the main beneficiary of all the computer glitches, all the voter suppression, and they're suing the state.
[03:57:08.283 --> 03:57:16.291]  Yeah, I keep hearing that these primaries and these caucuses, you know, it's a private party and the state doesn't have anything to say about this.
[03:57:16.291 --> 03:57:17.872]  The voters don't have anything to say about this.
[03:57:17.872 --> 03:57:19.714]  So then why are they suing the state?
[03:57:19.714 --> 03:57:28.923]  Why are the states paying for these elections that are now, as Reince Priebus keeps reminding us, it's just their own private little party there?
[03:57:28.923 --> 03:57:29.663]  No, it's not.
[03:57:30.524 --> 03:57:37.232]  They want it to be private when it suits their purposes, and then they want it to be public when it suits their purposes.
[03:57:37.232 --> 03:57:41.997]  In the little bit of time that I have left, I want to just briefly touch on this outrageous story.
[03:57:41.997 --> 03:57:48.885]  It was in the Washington Post how police took $53,000 from a Christian band from an orphanage from a church.
[03:57:48.885 --> 03:57:49.786]  This was a group
[03:57:50.926 --> 03:58:04.670]  Some citizens who are refugees from Burma, they're Christians, they're going around on a tour, going probably from church to church, probably looking at the amount of concerts that they'd made and the amount of money they made at each of these concerts.
[03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:07.770]  Probably went through about 150 different churches.
[03:58:07.770 --> 03:58:13.712]  As the manager was heading back to Texas, he got stopped in Oklahoma and they stole the money from him.
[03:58:14.452 --> 03:58:22.897]  And the interesting thing is that after the Washington Post focused on this, they came back and said, well, okay, with all this publicity, it looks really bad.
[03:58:22.897 --> 03:58:24.157]  We're stealing money from orphans.
[03:58:24.157 --> 03:58:29.100]  I mean, they had this cash there with the orphans' individual names on it, even.
[03:58:29.100 --> 03:58:30.981]  And they said, all right, we don't have a burden of proof.
[03:58:30.981 --> 03:58:33.403]  The point is, they're lying even about that.
[03:58:33.403 --> 03:58:37.905]  It's civil asset forfeiture because they make you sue to get your money back.
[03:58:37.905 --> 03:58:39.946]  Christians need to wake up about the war on drugs.
[03:58:39.946 --> 03:58:41.327]  Join us tonight.
