[00:00.000 --> 00:14.300]  A lot of my friends are what I would quantify as average Americans as my family.
[00:14.300 --> 00:20.000]  What do they do at a participatory level to either encourage or discourage things that
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.760]  they don't agree with?
[00:21.760 --> 00:26.660]  And I think it takes a little bit more savvy, if we're in the info war, it takes a little
[00:26.660 --> 00:31.280]  bit more savvy to know how to get into those systems in a way that we can leverage our
[00:31.280 --> 00:36.560]  own position, just like the social justice warriors do, but at the same time not resort
[00:36.560 --> 00:41.160]  to the kind of the scumiest part of it all, which is sort of leading people astray.
[00:41.160 --> 00:47.200]  Look, when you use the word liberty, most people don't find that word sexy.
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.560]  You know, racist has a lot more ooh-ah to it than libertarian.
[00:52.560 --> 00:56.360]  Libertarian sounds like you're stuck in the back of a truck with Ron Paul and he's talking
[00:56.360 --> 00:59.240]  to you about like, you know, policy papers and freedom.
[00:59.240 --> 01:01.880]  It doesn't sound very exciting to me, okay?
[01:01.880 --> 01:05.880]  You know, I tend to like the social argument.
[01:05.880 --> 01:09.880]  You have to start, this would be my argument, you have to start by identifying that the
[01:09.880 --> 01:14.240]  most powerful thing in the world right now are these technocratic systems that are in
[01:14.240 --> 01:21.520]  place, search engines, the way we connect on these social platforms.
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.960]  Governments have either encouraged these things to come along or quickly realizes that they
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.880]  were the new element arms of control.
[01:28.880 --> 01:32.760]  And so you have to ask yourself whether your participation in these systems is actually
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.520]  enslaving you, then you have to drill down a little further and you have to want to ask
[01:36.520 --> 01:46.680]  questions about if what you're doing and participating in is truly as open as it seems.
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.280]  So if Twitter, for example, is full of people of a diversity of opinions and you feel like,
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.360]  hey, it's capitalist, it's my idea versus yours, who tweets more, who gets more retweets,
[01:56.360 --> 02:02.680]  who says the right incendiary thing, who does the right mean, great, that's America, great.
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.080]  And I would only argue, you know, where do you cross the line?
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.080]  And you see it all the time.
[02:07.080 --> 02:09.880]  I mean, Infowars puts up articles.
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.040]  As somebody who's in the world and I have to watch what I say, when you see a page that's
[02:14.040 --> 02:18.360]  literally in the pages, the Facebook page is assassinate Donald Trump.
[02:18.360 --> 02:21.960]  And I believe Facebook comes out and says that doesn't violate our standards and practices.
[02:21.960 --> 02:28.160]  Okay, that's where somebody like myself has to ask, is my participation in the Facebook
[02:28.160 --> 02:30.440]  system and I would call it a system.
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.600]  Am I actually encouraging something which as an American, I find offensive.
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.240]  And I also find it offensive that a business would support, you can call, I would have
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.800]  no problem with a page that said, Donald Trump's a racist, Donald Trump's a homophobe because
[02:45.800 --> 02:46.800]  that's just opinion.
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.160]  The minute you talk about killing someone, sorry, that's where you need to step in as
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  a business.
[02:53.160 --> 02:55.180]  I will not support that.
[02:55.180 --> 02:57.720]  So why is that okay?
[02:57.720 --> 03:00.880]  But you can imagine what page you could create on Facebook today and there would be calls
[03:00.880 --> 03:03.520]  for you to never work here at Infowars ever again.
[03:03.520 --> 03:04.520]  Right.
[03:04.520 --> 03:05.520]  That's where it gets funky.
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.400]  So you have to be sophisticated enough to look at those systems and say, is my participation
[03:09.400 --> 03:14.760]  encouraging something that I know deep down is intrinsically not only flawed, but counterintuitive
[03:14.760 --> 03:17.000]  to what I want to be part of.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.320]  And in essence, your participation is condomin.
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.680]  Now, I run a business, I have a Facebook page, I need the Facebook page at this day to run
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.680]  my business.
[03:26.680 --> 03:27.880]  It's an effective system.
[03:27.880 --> 03:29.320]  I don't like everything.
[03:29.320 --> 03:33.840]  So that's just another piece of information that may ultimately push me off Facebook.
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.520]  And I'm willing to take the commercial and public hit of not having that reach that I
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.920]  have to the 4 million plus people that follow us on Facebook, because at the end of the
[03:42.920 --> 03:45.640]  day, I as an American can't support that.
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.880]  So does it bother me?
[03:46.880 --> 03:47.880]  Yes.
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.520]  Do I have to have the argument in my head?
[03:49.520 --> 03:50.520]  Yes.
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.920]  To this point, I haven't made that decision.
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.160]  If you're not having that argument in your own head, then you're not participating.
[03:55.160 --> 03:59.080]  And then to use Alex's term, you're just a drone who's just falling around and you're
[03:59.080 --> 04:01.920]  pretending you have no influence and you do.
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.200]  And I think too, it's really time for a lot of us who are libertarians and who are for
[04:06.200 --> 04:11.440]  freedom and who are concerned and who do, we're not kind of in the trance.
[04:11.440 --> 04:18.080]  We do see, we do need to start coming together and working and setting up our own systems
[04:18.080 --> 04:20.920]  to counteract their systems that they have.
[04:20.920 --> 04:23.160]  That's why I would use the word empowerment.
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.360]  Empowering people with, let's not call it the facts and the truth, the facts and truth
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.880]  are always kind of ephemeral, this eye of the beholder stuff.
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.120]  Empowering people to have a better range of decision making as far as how they approach
[04:34.120 --> 04:37.480]  their social systems, I think that's powerful.
[04:37.480 --> 04:42.280]  Even if you take the extra step and you say like maybe info war sets up its own version
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.600]  of social media so that like-minded businesses are able to participate in a system that is
[04:47.600 --> 04:50.800]  ultimately holistic to the ideas that you would believe in.
[04:50.800 --> 04:53.800]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:53.800 --> 04:54.800]  Stay with us.
[04:54.800 --> 05:00.720]  This Tuesday edition is going to be absolutely jam packed on our shows infowars.com.
[05:00.720 --> 05:06.560]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes
[05:06.560 --> 05:09.120]  less and less transparent.
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.800]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and
[05:12.800 --> 05:14.840]  that's the conflict here.
[05:14.840 --> 05:17.960]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily
[05:17.960 --> 05:20.400]  matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[05:20.400 --> 05:22.600]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[05:22.600 --> 05:26.440]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.520]  There's many political parties.
[05:27.520 --> 05:30.800]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[05:30.800 --> 05:34.280]  And I'm really am asking you, it's more than a process question.
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.840]  It's an integrity of the election question and everybody's asking me this question.
[05:38.840 --> 05:41.040]  So I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[05:41.040 --> 05:45.360]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hard-core Donald Trump supporters.
[05:45.360 --> 05:50.160]  Why do you do this every single time I have- no, you've got to stop.
[05:50.160 --> 05:51.600]  Every time I have you on the air.
[05:51.600 --> 05:58.520]  Join infowars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7 p.m. as we cover the primaries in the
[05:58.520 --> 05:59.520]  Northeast.
[05:59.520 --> 06:04.040]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[06:04.040 --> 06:09.120]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[06:09.120 --> 06:12.440]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[06:12.440 --> 06:17.720]  Just one of the key compounds, BiOPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[06:17.720 --> 06:20.240]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[07:00.560 --> 07:02.520]  Brain force, it's completely different.
[07:02.520 --> 07:03.680]  Try a bottle of it.
[07:03.680 --> 07:05.360]  RobDoo joins us.
[07:05.360 --> 07:07.840]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[07:07.840 --> 07:09.360]  Tell us what brain force did.
[07:09.360 --> 07:10.360]  I'd been working all day.
[07:10.360 --> 07:12.800]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[07:12.800 --> 07:14.800]  I get in here at 8.30.
[07:14.800 --> 07:18.480]  I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really
[07:18.480 --> 07:20.000]  wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  I got my bottle of brain force right there.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.800]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind
[07:25.800 --> 07:26.800]  of clears up.
[07:26.800 --> 07:28.840]  It's got four and a half stars.
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.080]  People really love it.
[07:30.080 --> 07:31.080]  Read about it.
[07:31.080 --> 07:35.120]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really
[07:35.120 --> 07:39.800]  does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[07:39.800 --> 07:42.760]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[07:42.760 --> 07:43.760]  it without brain force.
[07:43.760 --> 07:45.760]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.080]  I took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[07:50.080 --> 08:18.080]  You will find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[08:18.080 --> 08:24.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:24.680 --> 08:27.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:27.080 --> 08:33.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[08:33.080 --> 08:37.240]  As we broadcast worldwide, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[08:37.240 --> 08:45.200]  It is Tuesday, the 26th day of April, 2016.
[08:45.200 --> 08:49.360]  We have Leanne McAdoo, who's going to be with us at the bottom of the next hour.
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.800]  She interviewed a gentleman who was convinced to have his genitalia removed by a leftist
[08:56.800 --> 09:04.760]  psychological warfare operation and then realized later that he'd basically been inducted
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.480]  into a cult.
[09:06.480 --> 09:11.320]  That's exactly what this is, a eugenics, end of humanity cult on many fronts.
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.240]  I am not attacking people that make these decisions and think this is the right decision
[09:15.240 --> 09:22.040]  for them, but bullying children and young people into it is going on, and that is well
[09:22.040 --> 09:23.040]  known.
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.720]  It is being pushed whole hog across the board and as part of the take down of civilization.
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.840]  Gerald Filante, the Trends Forecaster, will cover the news and the latest developments
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  with us in the third hour.
[09:33.840 --> 09:42.440]  Today of the night, we'll command and chair Hancho, run, anchor, host the fourth hour
[09:42.440 --> 09:45.720]  today and then info wars nightly news.
[09:45.720 --> 09:50.120]  We'll be covering the big primary tonight, one of the most important so far with live
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.440]  extended coverage kicking off at 7 p.m. central standard time, there'll be free video feeds
[09:55.440 --> 10:01.280]  and more at info wars dot com forward slash show and you are the resistance.
[10:01.280 --> 10:05.840]  You are the real power of this broadcast to circumnavigate the enemy's attempts to censor
[10:05.840 --> 10:06.840]  the truth.
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.840]  So please send that link info wars dot com forward slash show out to everyone you know
[10:11.840 --> 10:18.480]  perpetually continually every chance that you get good news.
[10:18.480 --> 10:22.480]  There is the headline NBC news.
[10:22.480 --> 10:28.840]  Trump regions 50% support nationally for the first time in a national poll that that's
[10:28.840 --> 10:35.360]  actually not true I've seen it in other polls poll Trump makes it to 50% nationally and in
[10:35.360 --> 10:42.880]  many polls he is neck and neck or in a dead heat with hair Hillary, Hillary, there's just
[10:42.880 --> 10:49.960]  too many fun puns with her name to some we can't say on air.
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.560]  But at the same time, he is also ahead of her in many polls, but the reason he will
[10:53.560 --> 11:00.440]  dominate her is that numbers already showed double the number of black Americans crossing
[11:00.440 --> 11:06.160]  over Reagan Democrats, blue collar Democrats, but also a lot of wealthy people even political
[11:06.160 --> 11:12.400]  was reporting last week, who have been more liberal, who don't like unfair trade deals
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.680]  and want to have a prosperous economy, a true free market economy, not a managed crony
[11:16.680 --> 11:18.880]  capitalist system.
[11:18.880 --> 11:26.920]  So very exciting numbers, their polls predict huge primary victories for Trump tonight, Cruz
[11:26.920 --> 11:36.800]  Kasek tag team gets rolling as neocons, blue sky, a third party, they're the ones talking
[11:36.800 --> 11:40.680]  about third parties to derail things down, but there's also reports that the anti-trump
[11:40.680 --> 11:48.160]  alliance is self-destructing we're going to be going over those reports as well, Carly
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.720]  Fiorina, who didn't do anything in Hewlett Packer, but come in and basically downsize
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.120]  it and sell parts of it off.
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.720]  So I guess she's a poster child for corporate downsizing.
[11:57.720 --> 12:03.680]  That's not a success of the company is now being float as a possible Ted Cruz VP pick.
[12:03.680 --> 12:10.000]  And for the life of me, I love James Woods, great actor, great brain, great tweets.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.440]  Why he likes her, I don't know other than the fact that some people say he's such a
[12:15.440 --> 12:21.880]  good actor, he may be Carly Fiorina, but they kind of look the same being sarcastic before
[12:21.880 --> 12:25.880]  the New York Times or Esquire or Vanity Fair runs with that.
[12:25.880 --> 12:27.800]  That's a joke.
[12:27.800 --> 12:28.800]  That's a joke.
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.360]  But I don't know why he supports her because maybe he knows her and she's a nice lady.
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.360]  She might be a nice lady.
[12:34.360 --> 12:40.760]  I just, I just don't get why, you know why she's the person we're supposed to go for.
[12:40.760 --> 12:44.480]  So we've got all of that there that we're going to be getting into.
[12:44.480 --> 12:51.360]  So we're going to be looking at how Obama's global warming plan cost poor Americans 44
[12:51.360 --> 12:58.640]  billion, just just the last eight years, seven and a half years, raised taxes by 166%.
[12:58.640 --> 13:05.320]  Very important article out of the daily caller that we're going to be going over today.
[13:05.320 --> 13:14.520]  Another report that's from infowars.com by Julie Fidler, excellent article, a strange,
[13:14.520 --> 13:22.840]  sad story though, birth defect is on the rise in the United States, says the CDC, federally
[13:22.840 --> 13:25.720]  funded studies are aimed at documenting the cause.
[13:25.720 --> 13:28.560]  Well, there's all sorts of birth defects that are on the rise.
[13:28.560 --> 13:31.120]  In fact, everything's on the rise.
[13:31.120 --> 13:40.520]  Mortality is on the rise, infant cancer is exploding, pediatric cancer is just meteoric
[13:40.520 --> 13:48.200]  in its rise, breast cancer is off the chart, type one, type two diabetes off the chart.
[13:48.200 --> 13:53.080]  Children go and they get their second or third round of shots and it gives boys autism because
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.080]  they don't have as good as a blood brain barrier as the girls.
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.120]  That's a medical fact, it's undisputed that female fetuses and babies are about twice
[14:00.120 --> 14:05.760]  as tough as a, that's why almost all the survivors of abortion, where it's a six-month-old
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.800]  baby that's thrown in the trash can, there's scores of these people, they're all women.
[14:10.800 --> 14:13.200]  You see them testify to Congress, survivors of abortion.
[14:13.200 --> 14:15.440]  You don't believe me, just Google survivors of abortion.
[14:15.440 --> 14:18.040]  These are famous women, we've had some of them on, I'm going to give them back on.
[14:18.040 --> 14:19.840]  Black, white, Hispanic, you name it.
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.640]  I've never heard of a man surviving this because they just can't, there's not a stuff.
[14:23.640 --> 14:30.800]  The point is, is that women have a stronger blood brain barrier, men don't and it just
[14:30.800 --> 14:33.480]  goes right through into the brain directly and fries it.
[14:33.480 --> 14:40.880]  But women have a higher instance of their pancreas failing when they get pancreatitis
[14:40.880 --> 14:48.680]  and when you read the different vaccines like MMR and other flu inserts that we've read
[14:48.680 --> 14:57.080]  on here and shown you, it says pancreatitis and diabetes, pancreatitis slash diabetes.
[14:57.080 --> 15:04.920]  And I know three families in Austin that are friends of mine, three families that when
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.200]  they took their girls in and two families, a boy and the other and got them their second
[15:09.200 --> 15:16.520]  round of shots at about a year old and in the other case the girl was three and got
[15:16.520 --> 15:24.080]  shots, has a fever and then suddenly their system shuts down and they tell them, oh,
[15:24.080 --> 15:27.680]  you have type one diabetes, which means it's genetic.
[15:27.680 --> 15:32.800]  Well, yeah, it's genetic that if you smoke four packs of cigarettes and you're predisposed
[15:32.800 --> 15:35.760]  to lung cancer, you're going to get it pretty young.
[15:35.760 --> 15:40.040]  Whereas there's some old mountain men that don't have that, you know, predistribution
[15:40.040 --> 15:42.840]  that they're famously drinking a bottle of whiskey every day and smoking four packs
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.600]  of cigarettes and they're 100 years old.
[15:45.600 --> 15:47.320]  Once you smoke them long enough, it's going to kill you.
[15:47.320 --> 15:49.400]  The point is, it's going to kill some people real quick.
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.400]  Like I'm predisposed on my mother's side of the family with all a bunch of Taipei men
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.920]  on both sides of her family that executives, corporate chiefs, always successful, just
[15:59.920 --> 16:02.600]  all of them successful right down the line.
[16:02.600 --> 16:05.960]  Gigantic heart attacks at 55, just the heart's blow.
[16:05.960 --> 16:07.920]  And so I better watch it.
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.160]  The clock is, and a lot of them exercise and stuff too.
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.800]  It's just your super type of personality, your heart's going, you know, a lot faster
[16:15.800 --> 16:17.280]  than the rate.
[16:17.280 --> 16:21.360]  Anyways, I digress.
[16:21.360 --> 16:24.400]  The point is, is that we're going to get into that article.
[16:24.400 --> 16:29.640]  A strange birth defect is on the rise in the United States, says the CDC.
[16:29.640 --> 16:35.480]  So we're going to be looking at all of this and more.
[16:35.480 --> 16:41.480]  But first, I cut a report last night for the nightly news, and I didn't give them a very
[16:41.480 --> 16:42.480]  good headline.
[16:42.480 --> 16:43.800]  I shouldn't have a better headline than this.
[16:43.800 --> 16:49.960]  Alex Jones responds to Esquire hit piece.
[16:49.960 --> 16:50.960]  The headline should be changed.
[16:50.960 --> 16:54.720]  I want to post it on infowars.com, retweet it in Facebook it, and I want to change the
[16:54.720 --> 17:12.320]  YouTube to Esquire destroyed, or Esquire destroys itself in an attempt to cover up for CIA,
[17:12.320 --> 17:19.160]  or Esquire caught trying to cover up for the CIA discredited, something like that.
[17:19.160 --> 17:21.200]  Because it's not just Esquire.
[17:21.200 --> 17:22.200]  No exaggeration.
[17:22.200 --> 17:25.280]  I can't keep track of it all.
[17:25.280 --> 17:37.760]  New York Daily News, New York Daily News, Gawker, Esquire, they led the way.
[17:37.760 --> 17:41.000]  And other publications, just scores of them yesterday.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.440]  I looked last night, it was like 15, meaning this was a directive.
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.240]  They chose to go with this, just like Jade Helm.
[17:49.240 --> 17:53.120]  Next year, six months before they're going to launch it.
[17:53.120 --> 17:56.880]  Joe Biggs walks in and says, you see this new Army memo that's out, it's confirmed,
[17:56.880 --> 18:00.360]  it's on their site, where they list Texas' hostile in other areas, and they say they're
[18:00.360 --> 18:04.480]  going to invade and, you know, basically train to conquer the territory.
[18:04.480 --> 18:09.040]  We talked to our special forces forces, they said, no, indeed, it is multinational in that
[18:09.040 --> 18:14.240]  it can be used overseas, but the targeting is to condition the public.
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.600]  And this also has a use inside the US, which is admitted they've been getting the military
[18:17.600 --> 18:21.240]  ready for, quote, insurrection and all the rest of it.
[18:21.240 --> 18:23.920]  They had no exaggeration.
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.120]  Some days, 3,000 newspapers, TV stations and publications, I'd get the Google alerts,
[18:30.120 --> 18:35.280]  and they'd come in and it would say, you know, 3,600, the next day, 2,000, just every 24
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.200]  hours, it turns over, tens of thousands of articles a week.
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.080]  Some cases for months on end, you know, it'd go for a month and only have 20 a day.
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.640]  And then, you know, for a week it'd be a couple hundred a day, and then it'd be a couple thousand
[18:47.640 --> 18:54.160]  a day, sometimes three plus thousand a day saying, Alex Jones says there'll be martial
[18:54.160 --> 18:59.240]  law in July and August, and that the army is coming to confiscate your guns.
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.880]  When all they're doing is a drill, that was public inoculation that I'm crazy and I'm
[19:03.880 --> 19:07.480]  a liar, and we came out and showed how they were doing it, and I said, now watch, when
[19:07.480 --> 19:13.160]  they don't attack in July and August, they will say I'm discredited.
[19:13.160 --> 19:14.160]  And that's what they did.
[19:14.160 --> 19:20.200]  And it didn't discredit us because people know that that's enemy media, and they also
[19:20.200 --> 19:26.720]  know and are fully aware of the fact, expanding on that, that there's constant deception going
[19:26.720 --> 19:37.600]  on and that we do have militarized police and more and more military on the streets.
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.440]  So that's just some of what we're going to be breaking down today, and they've come
[19:42.440 --> 19:47.440]  out with this Beyonce thing, and they're going, Alex Jones says she works for the CIA.
[19:47.440 --> 19:52.120]  Well, if you actually watch the video, I talk about the CIA and the media, which is all
[19:52.120 --> 19:59.560]  over mainstream news, and I document it, and now members, former members of the CIA are
[19:59.560 --> 20:01.120]  going to be coming on the show.
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.120]  This is it.
[20:02.120 --> 20:07.000]  For the first time ever on this station, US government gold offered at cost for only
[20:07.000 --> 20:12.320]  $139 each, with Wall Street suffering its worst start to a trading year in history,
[20:12.320 --> 20:15.920]  now is especially the time to be paying attention to gold.
[20:15.920 --> 20:22.440]  This first ever US legal tender government gold offered at cost for only $139 each is

[21:00.480 --> 21:03.680]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[21:03.680 --> 21:06.840]  Once this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.160]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[21:09.160 --> 21:12.120]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[21:12.120 --> 21:13.120]  His excuse?
[21:13.120 --> 21:14.320]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[21:14.320 --> 21:15.920]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[21:15.920 --> 21:20.760]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative
[21:20.760 --> 21:21.760]  for my father.

[21:30.840 --> 21:35.400]  You've woke up to the deception, you understand how big government and corporations are controlling
[21:35.400 --> 21:36.400]  you.
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.400]  Guess what?

[22:00.200 --> 22:04.480]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[22:04.480 --> 22:09.200]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[22:09.200 --> 22:11.680]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:11.680 --> 22:16.360]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[24:08.160 --> 24:09.160]  Welcome back.
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.400]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[24:11.400 --> 24:18.120]  Now last night, I shot a report for the headline that Esquire had been caught with its pants
[24:18.120 --> 24:23.740]  down covering up the CIA and domestic media operations.
[24:23.740 --> 24:31.200]  But today, we can report that it's a globalist operation to try to discredit myself and others.
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.080]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[24:33.080 --> 24:38.360]  It's known that hundreds of different federal agencies, there's hundreds of them, spend
[24:38.360 --> 24:44.720]  sometimes billions of piece a year like the Department of Education paying for what they
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.080]  call behavior placement.
[24:48.080 --> 24:52.200]  Then a company like McDonald's pays to have their food eaten in a movie, or some beer
[24:52.200 --> 24:56.400]  maker like Coors Light pays to have somebody drink it in a movie, that's called product
[24:56.400 --> 24:57.400]  placement.
[24:57.400 --> 25:00.520]  The government calls it behavior placement.
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.280]  I call it propaganda placement.
[25:05.280 --> 25:08.440]  So that's what's going on.
[25:08.440 --> 25:17.520]  And it's admitted that Rocky III and Rambo III are defeat the Russians Cold War and those
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.880]  scripts were approved by the CIA and the Pentagon.
[25:21.880 --> 25:23.240]  That's a historical admitted fact.
[25:23.240 --> 25:28.520]  I've seen Sylvester Stallone in interviews talk about how it was Russian anti-Russian
[25:28.520 --> 25:29.520]  propaganda.
[25:29.520 --> 25:31.000]  I'm not defending the Russians either.
[25:31.000 --> 25:44.560]  The point is, they think we're so childlike that they have the very media hooked in to
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.840]  culture control, I mean, Esquire, New York Daily News, they have long histories on record
[25:50.840 --> 25:58.240]  working with the government to control perspectives, Gawker, you name it.
[25:58.240 --> 26:04.280]  But what's crazy is they legalized three years ago deceiving the American people.
[26:04.280 --> 26:09.120]  You can pull up, watch them post, you can pull up foreign affairs, we can put some of
[26:09.120 --> 26:10.120]  those on screen.
[26:10.120 --> 26:16.680]  You can pull up in Congress legalizes CIA operating domestically with propaganda and
[26:16.680 --> 26:23.360]  you'll get all the articles and in the video they're attacking, I show those articles.
[26:23.360 --> 26:30.320]  U.S. repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to Americans including lying deception.
[26:30.320 --> 26:33.240]  That's in the law change.
[26:33.240 --> 26:38.200]  Now this has been going on for a while, but here's a new one today.
[26:38.200 --> 26:43.280]  The State Department has come out now that they're putting publicly thousands of U.S.
[26:43.280 --> 26:49.040]  troops, it's hundreds a week they're adding, into Syria to quote battle ISIS.
[26:49.040 --> 26:50.040]  No, they're not.
[26:50.040 --> 26:55.600]  They're trying to battle groups within the coalition of Saudi Arabian terrorists and
[26:55.600 --> 26:59.960]  others that aren't following orders.
[26:59.960 --> 27:05.880]  And we have the State Department saying it is a total conspiracy theory and a lie Obama
[27:05.880 --> 27:12.640]  and the administration never said no boots on the ground in Syria.
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.480]  They said over and over again, we promise just an air war, no boots on the ground.
[27:16.480 --> 27:18.560]  They've been saying that for four years.
[27:18.560 --> 27:22.600]  We can pull up the Obama clips, we can pull up the White House Press Secretary clips, we
[27:22.600 --> 27:24.400]  can pull up the news clips.
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.760]  USA Today, 16 times Obama said there would be no boots on the ground in Syria.
[27:29.760 --> 27:34.480]  We have 16 times four of them in press conferences.
[27:34.480 --> 27:40.560]  Do I need to go get the video clips and play them and then show the State Department?
[27:40.560 --> 27:42.760]  I guess we will go ahead and get the Obama clips.
[27:42.760 --> 27:46.320]  I'm not just going to show USA Today, I'm going to show the clip and then I'm going
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.320]  to show him and I'm going to show the State Department saying they never said it three
[27:50.320 --> 27:52.080]  years later.
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.000]  And this is what Esquire and the New York Daily News and Gawker and I'm told CNN's
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.440]  done a piece and MSNBC, my phone was ringing this morning about it.
[28:00.440 --> 28:07.120]  Alex Jones claims Beyonce's working with the CIA.
[28:07.120 --> 28:15.120]  Well, Robert David Steele on record actually field commander CIA, you name it.
[28:15.120 --> 28:21.520]  Not just some analysts like Buck Sexton, where all these Ivy League and rich people
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.880]  have their kids to be CIA like they're supermen, they can barely touch their toes.
[28:25.880 --> 28:32.440]  They have Bob Big Boy haircuts and I'm like, I'm CIA, I'm CIA, I'm CIA, I'm CIA, I'm CIA.
[28:32.440 --> 28:33.440]  Give me a break.
[28:33.440 --> 28:34.440]  Give me a break.
[28:34.440 --> 28:38.840]  You guys couldn't break anybody's neck or slide any throats or bust out any skulls.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.360]  You sure couldn't infiltrate anything.
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.880]  Couldn't fight you out of a wet paper bag, your pathetic anti-American filth.
[28:44.880 --> 28:45.880]  Excuse me.
[28:45.880 --> 28:46.880]  Ah, you're collaborating scum.
[28:46.880 --> 28:47.880]  Give me some little title.
[28:47.880 --> 28:52.400]  I like your little plastic card in your wallet, I'm so scared.
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.840]  Anyways, I digress, he wants to come on definitely to break down.
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.640]  Yes, it's all CIA and Cynthia McKinney, the former Congresswoman who they demonize because
[29:00.640 --> 29:02.640]  they're so scared of her.
[29:02.640 --> 29:04.320]  You'll hear the real lady on this saying, absolutely.
[29:04.320 --> 29:09.840]  It's meant to cause race war and to stereotype blacks as racist and dangerous and out of
[29:09.840 --> 29:13.520]  control for an attack on black people.
[29:13.520 --> 29:14.520]  Exactly what I said.
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.560]  She's got PhDs in media and PhDs and how they manipulate stuff.
[29:19.560 --> 29:21.320]  She's a smart lady.
[29:21.320 --> 29:26.000]  She's coming on to agree with me, but it isn't agreeing with me.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.760]  There is a drone program.
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.600]  I don't care if Gibbs told us it didn't exist.
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.240]  There is a ground war going on with our troops in Syria.
[29:35.240 --> 29:36.240]  Obama lied.
[29:36.240 --> 29:37.240]  He did say it.
[29:37.240 --> 29:39.440]  He also said Obama cared to be free.
[29:39.440 --> 29:40.440]  It didn't.
[29:40.440 --> 29:41.440]  Okay?
[29:41.440 --> 29:42.840]  He said there wasn't any penalties.
[29:42.840 --> 29:43.840]  There are.
[29:43.840 --> 29:47.720]  And two plus two does equal four, Esquire.
[29:47.720 --> 29:48.720]  Yes it does.
[29:48.720 --> 29:49.720]  Yes it does.
[29:49.720 --> 29:50.720]  We're on the march.
[29:50.720 --> 29:53.800]  The CIA is operating domestically.
[29:53.800 --> 30:00.800]  You filthy, you lying, collaborating idiots.
[30:00.800 --> 30:06.640]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes
[30:06.640 --> 30:09.200]  less and less transparent.
[30:09.200 --> 30:13.120]  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's
[30:13.120 --> 30:14.120]  the conflict here.
[30:14.120 --> 30:18.040]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily
[30:18.040 --> 30:20.840]  matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[30:20.840 --> 30:22.760]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[30:22.760 --> 30:26.520]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[30:26.520 --> 30:27.600]  There's many political parties.
[30:27.600 --> 30:30.880]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[30:30.880 --> 30:34.320]  And I'm really am asking you, it's more than a process question.
[30:34.320 --> 30:38.880]  It's an integrity of the election question and everybody's asking me this question.
[30:38.880 --> 30:41.120]  So I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[30:41.120 --> 30:45.240]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.
[30:45.240 --> 30:50.880]  Well, why do you do this every single time I, no, you got to stop every time I have you
[30:50.880 --> 30:51.880]  on the air.
[30:51.880 --> 30:58.400]  Join Info Wars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7pm as we cover the primaries
[30:58.400 --> 31:00.720]  in the Northeast.
[31:00.720 --> 31:04.840]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[31:04.840 --> 31:10.320]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[31:10.320 --> 31:15.320]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.880]  at infowarstore.com.
[31:16.880 --> 31:20.720]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[31:20.720 --> 31:24.840]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[31:24.840 --> 31:30.080]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[31:30.080 --> 31:34.120]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[31:34.120 --> 31:35.920]  the products that you need each month.
[31:35.920 --> 31:39.560]  Just go to infowarstore.com, select your favorite product or products.

[31:43.640 --> 31:48.960]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[31:48.960 --> 31:50.360]  this is a sure win.
[31:50.360 --> 31:51.920]  10% off on auto ship.

[31:56.320 --> 32:00.120]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[32:00.120 --> 32:05.480]  Uh yeah, first of all I want to say, secret 12, that's true, super mail, brain force,
[32:05.480 --> 32:10.480]  prostagart, silver bullet, I use them all, they're phenomenal, they work, buy info.
[32:10.480 --> 32:11.480]  Thank you brother.
[32:11.480 --> 32:13.080]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[32:13.080 --> 32:18.400]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm a quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[32:18.400 --> 32:19.400]  products.
[32:19.400 --> 32:20.400]  Um, I am one.
[32:20.400 --> 32:21.400]  Welcome to the info war.
[32:21.400 --> 32:25.760]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war
[32:25.760 --> 32:26.760]  at the same time.
[32:26.760 --> 32:27.760]  I'm a nine year listener.
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.760]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacinotide.
[32:30.760 --> 32:33.360]  Right, God, let me ask you a question, have they worked for you?
[32:33.360 --> 32:36.440]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[32:36.440 --> 32:37.440]  What products are you taking?
[32:37.440 --> 32:38.440]  Are you taking?
[32:38.440 --> 32:43.880]  Everything from, uh, super mail to, uh, brain force to winter sun, uh, X2.
[32:43.880 --> 32:48.320]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.320]  to auto-fill.
[32:49.320 --> 32:54.520]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[32:54.520 --> 33:21.200]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[33:21.200 --> 33:26.320]  Live from the infowars.com studios.
[33:26.320 --> 33:27.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.320 --> 33:28.320]  That's right.
[33:28.320 --> 33:32.040]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance that's in the game.
[33:32.040 --> 33:37.360]  We've been captured by offshore mega banks who have an ideology of dehumanization and
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.960]  dumbing you down in preparation for a mass forced killing.
[33:40.960 --> 33:45.960]  They'll be the ultimate final war against humanity carried out by the psychopaths and
[33:45.960 --> 33:48.920]  their AI collaborators.
[33:48.920 --> 33:53.760]  We are the human resistance shaping the future battle space now.
[33:53.760 --> 33:58.840]  Get ready for the cancer rates, all the other neurological disorders that explode, the mystery
[33:58.840 --> 34:00.520]  illnesses, the birth defects.
[34:00.520 --> 34:02.080]  You are under enemy attack.
[34:02.080 --> 34:05.080]  The sooner you wake up to that, the sooner we turn this around.
[34:05.080 --> 34:06.080]  Keep playing games.
[34:06.080 --> 34:07.080]  We're going to lose everything.
[34:07.080 --> 34:10.640]  You're living in a science fiction movie.
[34:10.640 --> 34:12.640]  Globalists are coming for everybody.
[34:12.640 --> 34:18.280]  By the way, Chuck Norris has a big article that he's come out with called Sky Criminals
[34:18.280 --> 34:23.800]  that is huge, absolutely huge, and we have an article about it up on infowars.com.
[34:23.800 --> 34:29.040]  He talks about country legend Merle Haggard being worried about condensation trails being
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.520]  filled with chemicals and barium salts, lumbdoxides, and how Prince was worried about it.
[34:33.520 --> 34:35.960]  Obviously, Chuck is a daily listener of the show.
[34:35.960 --> 34:37.640]  I want to say hi to Chuck Norris out there.
[34:37.640 --> 34:38.640]  He's been on the show before.
[34:38.640 --> 34:39.640]  He's kind of semi-retired.
[34:39.640 --> 34:47.000]  He shouldn't be at 77, but his son's a frequent guest as well, and obviously this pushed
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  him over the edge.
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.800]  He's against GMO as well and against Monsanto, the super patriot, and now he's come out and
[34:54.800 --> 34:55.800]  taken on chemtrails.
[34:55.800 --> 35:01.200]  So, no matter what the establishment does, the truth will out, and it is coming out.
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.360]  Our story as Chuck Norris takes on chemtrails, martial arts legend accuses sky criminals
[35:05.360 --> 35:08.440]  of waging secret war on the public.
[35:08.440 --> 35:10.240]  So can't stop the signal.
[35:10.240 --> 35:17.440]  If you're watching this transmission or listening, you're on the same side now as Chuck Norris.
[35:17.440 --> 35:19.680]  And this isn't a movie, but Chuck Norris.
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.440]  This is the real world, folks, so welcome to the fight against the globalists.
[35:23.440 --> 35:27.120]  It's kind of like spies like us when they get down in the bunker and they say, welcome
[35:27.120 --> 35:28.240]  to a wamp.
[35:28.240 --> 35:31.880]  I got to tell you, but we're actually going after the folks who try to run a false flag
[35:31.880 --> 35:33.960]  like wamp.
[35:33.960 --> 35:35.280]  That was your brother's favorite movie.
[35:35.280 --> 35:36.920]  Gentlemen have a Pepsi.
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.520]  Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?
[35:38.520 --> 35:43.760]  We've got Buckley Stratton Hammond, and no, that's not the name of a brokerage firm in
[35:43.760 --> 35:44.760]  the Wolf of Wall Street.
[35:44.760 --> 35:45.960]  That's his real name.
[35:45.960 --> 35:51.240]  And he's here helping me start in full wars really 22 years ago, but 21 years ago, getting
[35:51.240 --> 35:52.240]  on air.
[35:52.240 --> 35:55.520]  And then he's got a hiatus for 12 years up in Chicago, and he's been down there with
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.600]  us for a few years, doing a great job helping us get updated and retrofitted.
[36:00.600 --> 36:02.800]  And he was talking to me during the break about this whole Beyonce thing.
[36:02.800 --> 36:05.800]  And I said, well, look, we're just going to make Mr. Slick.
[36:05.800 --> 36:06.800]  He didn't always come on.
[36:06.800 --> 36:07.800]  He's always dressed like this.
[36:07.800 --> 36:09.240]  This is not an Austin slacker.
[36:09.240 --> 36:10.240]  Thank God.
[36:10.240 --> 36:11.840]  Oh, please help me.
[36:11.840 --> 36:13.040]  Anyways, sure.
[36:13.040 --> 36:15.240]  These are not Austin ice that want to run around and be lazy all day.
[36:15.240 --> 36:17.120]  I got to tell you, they're not Texans either.
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.440]  They're a bunch of losers from failed Democrat held states coming here to suck our blood
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.960]  vampirically and then hopping around trying to turn this environment into their previous
[36:26.960 --> 36:27.960]  environment.
[36:27.960 --> 36:29.080]  It's like pooping in the pool.
[36:29.080 --> 36:31.160]  But listen, I digress.
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.680]  We were talking about this Beyonce thing.
[36:35.680 --> 36:37.560]  This is definitely a government op.
[36:37.560 --> 36:41.760]  That's why it's one article comes out in a flagship publication like Esquire, then dozens
[36:41.760 --> 36:46.280]  of other establishments all fire at once, and then by tomorrow, it'll be hundreds and
[36:46.280 --> 36:48.120]  then maybe even thousands.
[36:48.120 --> 36:50.960]  And we've been contacted by Mr. Steele, formerly the CIA.
[36:50.960 --> 36:51.960]  He wants to come on.
[36:51.960 --> 36:52.960]  How about the CIA and the media?
[36:52.960 --> 36:57.680]  These are guys that's done false flags himself and Cynthia McKinney, the former Congresswoman.
[36:57.680 --> 37:02.440]  She's basically her treatise on media manipulation and they're trying to cause race war.
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.320]  She agrees showing Beyonce misrepresenting Black Panthers like to the new Black Panther
[37:07.320 --> 37:14.360]  Party, race war stuff, anti-police stuff bashing out the windows, warrants men and women.
[37:14.360 --> 37:17.840]  This is admittedly the purview of the CIA.
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.920]  The NFL, everything you see on there is basically government paid for.
[37:21.920 --> 37:22.920]  Okay.
[37:22.920 --> 37:26.240]  I mean, not just the hundreds of millions a year for the quote, you know, pro military
[37:26.240 --> 37:28.160]  stuff to get you to join the military.
[37:28.160 --> 37:36.120]  The point is it's controlled and they have declassified almost all of this.
[37:36.120 --> 37:41.280]  So what's frustrating to me is, again, you can pull it up the headlines, U.S. repeals
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.720]  propaganda ban, spreads government made news to Americans, including deception.
[37:45.720 --> 37:49.960]  And on that note, an interesting thing to me is that obviously we've been doing this
[37:49.960 --> 37:53.560]  long enough to just see the patterns as they happen and emerge.
[37:53.560 --> 37:57.600]  It's almost, you know, the global surround a big operation.
[37:57.600 --> 37:58.640]  This stuff is shaking back.
[37:58.640 --> 37:59.640]  It's formulaic.
[37:59.640 --> 38:00.640]  It's got an MO.
[38:00.640 --> 38:05.240]  So obviously when you did that Facebook mentions, you touched a nerve because it is just sort
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.160]  of spiraled off into this and it's bloomed and interestingly enough.
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.680]  Well, let me tell you the nerve since you bring that up because I meant to cover that.
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.440]  They have got a battle plan to take real things I say and then misrepresent it.
[38:17.440 --> 38:22.520]  If it's CIA, domestic media, military operations, domestically, they now basically seize on
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.680]  any big rollout we do exposing something and then just say it isn't true and then misrepresent
[38:27.680 --> 38:33.200]  what we say to then try to again, inoculate the public to when they do hear the CIA is
[38:33.200 --> 38:34.200]  running the media.
[38:34.200 --> 38:37.160]  Well, it's okay because, you know, the Cooke said it was bad.
[38:37.160 --> 38:38.720]  That's all they're doing is preparing people.
[38:38.720 --> 38:39.720]  Absolutely.
[38:39.720 --> 38:42.400]  And that, I mean, that feeds into this canard that a lot of people say that you're controlled
[38:42.400 --> 38:47.040]  opposition because you'll come out and you'll say something very pointedly, very true and
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.760]  you will give evidence and you will show how it's been propagated throughout history and
[38:50.760 --> 38:53.000]  how it's been done very specifically.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.440]  And then they do exactly what you said.
[38:54.440 --> 38:59.080]  They'll take one or two weird little sentences that you say out of context, amplify it and
[38:59.080 --> 39:00.880]  then publish that out into the world.
[39:00.880 --> 39:04.320]  And then you have all these people who are like, oh, see, Alex Jones, he's working with
[39:04.320 --> 39:05.320]  them.
[39:05.320 --> 39:06.320]  He's controlled opposition.
[39:06.320 --> 39:08.440]  He's saying almost the truth, but not quite.
[39:08.440 --> 39:09.680]  And then they amplify that.
[39:09.680 --> 39:15.080]  And so that's the irony of all the people that say that you're controlled opposition, I think,
[39:15.080 --> 39:18.840]  that don't really dig into the minutiae of it and really pay attention and see where
[39:18.840 --> 39:19.960]  all the dots connect.
[39:19.960 --> 39:22.080]  So that's just one take of that.
[39:22.080 --> 39:23.080]  Sure.
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.320]  Well, that's also another form of divide and conquer.
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.520]  It's a fake intellectual crutch to just have opposition to tyranny, never get organized
[39:29.520 --> 39:30.520]  or fight back.
[39:30.520 --> 39:34.640]  Because they're always too busy sitting back as purists, saying everyone's a government
[39:34.640 --> 39:35.640]  op.
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.600]  But never covering the real FEMA camps, never covering the real cancer viruses and the vaccines
[39:40.600 --> 39:44.640]  or the polio vaccine recall two weeks ago, giving kids across the world cancer.
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.200]  No, no, no, no, don't don't actually save people or move to get floored out of the water.
[39:49.200 --> 39:50.720]  It's now happening all over the world.
[39:50.720 --> 39:55.680]  Don't actually have victories or, you know, get glyphosate listed as a carcinogen now
[39:55.680 --> 39:57.440]  being removed everywhere.
[39:57.440 --> 39:59.080]  Don't actually have victories.
[39:59.080 --> 40:04.320]  Don't actually go out and expose that they're trying to steal the election and then have
[40:04.320 --> 40:05.800]  opposition to it and win.
[40:05.800 --> 40:10.320]  No, no, just roll around and just be defeatist losers.
[40:10.320 --> 40:14.840]  Because there is a paradigm to exposing tyranny that there are kind of the victim mentality
[40:14.840 --> 40:18.880]  people who would buy into the whole Democrat cosmology as well that the man did something
[40:18.880 --> 40:20.600]  to them so they can't be successful.
[40:20.600 --> 40:22.440]  Well, so what the man did something to you?
[40:22.440 --> 40:26.120]  Let's go around that overlap, you know, let's find people that want to work with us to build
[40:26.120 --> 40:27.360]  our own paradigm.
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.840]  So there's also a loser segment that gets into conspiracy and then kind of makes their
[40:31.840 --> 40:34.160]  own reality.
[40:34.160 --> 40:39.720]  What you're getting an info wars, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, to go off into us is historical
[40:39.720 --> 40:46.160]  research with a red-blooded Americana aspect to it doing our very, very best.
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.240]  The tally lights have changed now or is it this camera?
[40:48.240 --> 40:49.240]  Okay, there.
[40:49.240 --> 40:50.760]  I can't tell which camera it is anymore.
[40:50.760 --> 40:51.760]  No, is it that one?
[40:51.760 --> 40:52.760]  No, no, that's camera two.
[40:52.760 --> 40:54.760]  And then that's camera one, but it wasn't lit up anymore.
[40:54.760 --> 40:59.080]  I tell you, it's driving me crazy sometimes, but I thought it's red when the lights on,
[40:59.080 --> 41:02.320]  but now the right level or it's a diffusorism, as it usually is.
[41:02.320 --> 41:07.080]  The point is, it's radio show folks, but if you tuned in, we're also TV and find it easiest
[41:07.080 --> 41:12.440]  in fours.com forward slash show, but I'm going to get into Beyonce with you regardless.
[41:12.440 --> 41:14.960]  Let's just let's just say I'm a horrible government operative.
[41:14.960 --> 41:16.200]  I'm the worst person.
[41:16.200 --> 41:17.360]  I'm a vampire.
[41:17.360 --> 41:18.360]  I drink blood.
[41:18.360 --> 41:20.080]  I'm a bad guy.
[41:20.080 --> 41:25.480]  What are you going to do out there to take on the new world order?
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.200]  How are you going to try to affect change and respond to the globalist?
[41:31.200 --> 41:32.760]  Or are you just deciding you don't have any power?
[41:32.760 --> 41:34.920]  Well, no, our listeners aren't the trolls.
[41:34.920 --> 41:35.920]  They aren't the minions.
[41:35.920 --> 41:36.920]  They aren't the loser types.
[41:36.920 --> 41:42.200]  They aren't the people that have different psychological problems.
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.120]  So they want to have a cosmology of failure.
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.440]  We have a cosmology and a system of winning and of dominating the globalist and of exposing
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.600]  them and bringing back a renaissance economy based on free will, free association and free
[41:55.600 --> 42:01.320]  market and real choice and true liberalism and going to the moon, Mars and Elvis and
[42:01.320 --> 42:04.080]  turries and empowering humanity and bringing us together.
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.960]  And if you want to say you're a dog or a woman, if you're a man or an Easter Bunny, that's
[42:07.960 --> 42:08.960]  your issue.
[42:08.960 --> 42:12.600]  You're just not going to make us accept that in a form of cultural dominance wound up
[42:12.600 --> 42:13.600]  by the CIA.
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.400]  So since the government's scared of this and since the criminals are scared, I'm going
[42:18.400 --> 42:19.800]  to get the church hearings.
[42:19.800 --> 42:23.600]  I'm going to get the videos and all the articles of CBS News, admitting most of the newspapers
[42:23.600 --> 42:26.920]  are run by the CIA, Operation Mockingbird.
[42:26.920 --> 42:31.600]  I'm going to get thousands of articles together, thousands showing other Department of Education,
[42:31.600 --> 42:36.240]  Department of Energy, brainwashing, lying, different agencies doing it, how it's controlled.
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.920]  And we're going to walk through more and more, which is our job, showing you how they're
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.120]  domestically involved, lying to you and deceiving you.
[42:46.120 --> 42:52.760]  And here's the key, when you unconsciously watch their propaganda on Fox TV or NBC, you
[42:52.760 --> 42:56.440]  know, entertainment, that's where the real brainwashing is.
[42:56.440 --> 43:01.280]  It hits you, it controls you, your children, your family, except that it's game over.
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.960]  But, but when, and this is key.
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.320]  When you are conscious of it, you go, oh my God, the message is take all these deadly
[43:10.320 --> 43:15.760]  pharmaceuticals, take these vaccines, humans are ugly and bad, the family's ugly and bad,
[43:15.760 --> 43:19.820]  America's ugly and bad, manhood's bad, the family's evil, I need to just give up and
[43:19.820 --> 43:24.440]  crawl in a hole and die because their propaganda is designed for people that aren't paying
[43:24.440 --> 43:25.440]  attention.
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.440]  Absolutely.
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.520]  And what this, this exemplifies exactly what we were talking about real briefly in the break.
[43:30.520 --> 43:34.480]  Because what I'm about to tell our listeners, I'll guarantee you that 90% of our listeners
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.160]  don't even know this information because they're not in the bubble, they're, they're outside
[43:39.160 --> 43:40.360]  of the cultural bubble.
[43:40.360 --> 43:43.240]  In a way, we're, we're outside the globalist bubble.
[43:43.240 --> 43:46.160]  I don't watch all this entertainment, which is where the real war is going on.
[43:46.160 --> 43:49.880]  We're trying to now go in to the bubble and notice how they're freaking out.
[43:49.880 --> 43:54.280]  They don't want us hijacking their bubble and, and we're just beginning to do it because
[43:54.280 --> 43:59.960]  bubble people inside the bubble don't know what the CIA even is probably or that it's
[43:59.960 --> 44:01.760]  overseas or it's in movies.
[44:01.760 --> 44:04.040]  They don't know that there's an agenda against them.
[44:04.040 --> 44:05.040]  Right.
[44:05.040 --> 44:08.760]  And so what I'm about to tell you guys, and maybe some of you do know this, but there's
[44:08.760 --> 44:14.880]  actually another layer to this quote Beyonce controversy that's on the top that is, it's
[44:14.880 --> 44:18.520]  in all the entertainment information, all the entertainment news, et cetera.
[44:18.520 --> 44:22.280]  And so basically this album that she releases called Lemonade.
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.000]  And the theory that, that's surrounding it is that the album is called Lemonade because
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.160]  when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.
[44:28.160 --> 44:31.520]  And in the, basically the whole album, when there was also an hour long video that was
[44:31.520 --> 44:37.280]  released on HBO, that what she talked about in her circumstance and her lives and everything
[44:37.280 --> 44:42.280]  alludes to the fact that her husband, the hip hop mogul Jay-Z, has been cheating on
[44:42.280 --> 44:44.720]  her with another woman.
[44:44.720 --> 44:49.080]  And this other woman's name is Rachel Roy, and she was supposedly the husband of this
[44:49.080 --> 44:55.880]  guy named Damon, Damon Dash, who was, I don't know why, all this, but this, the guy was,
[44:55.880 --> 45:00.560]  her was his partner, business partner's ex-wife.
[45:00.560 --> 45:04.240]  And supposedly there was a fight with Beyonce's sister and an elevator because over this woman,
[45:04.240 --> 45:05.240]  et cetera.
[45:05.240 --> 45:11.200]  There's a whole long convoluted, you know, social control story that's behind it.
[45:11.200 --> 45:12.200]  So proper.
[45:12.200 --> 45:13.200]  Exactly.
[45:13.200 --> 45:14.200]  So proper.
[45:14.200 --> 45:17.600]  But the point is, is that, sure, there's this soap opera that's been, been carefully
[45:17.600 --> 45:23.680]  crafted and built around this whole idea to sell this album, which is completely and
[45:23.680 --> 45:25.360]  utterly made up.
[45:25.360 --> 45:27.600]  And it's a fake, that's the rest of the story.
[45:27.600 --> 45:33.520]  It's a fake soap opera story that even demonizes made up people, but real people mixed into
[45:33.520 --> 45:34.520]  it.
[45:34.520 --> 45:38.960]  They're mad at men running around beating things with a baseball bat and blowing things
[45:38.960 --> 45:44.640]  up with young women, imprinting on her to be an angry, bitter, mentally ill, crazy woman.
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.680]  And that's just the whole anti-family, anti-male, female genre, just like go attack the cops,
[45:50.680 --> 45:54.240]  they're the problem, burn things up, blow things up at the Super Bowl.
[45:54.240 --> 45:56.680]  This is the establishment putting this out.
[45:56.680 --> 46:03.680]  So when I say CIA, I'm pointing out that as just an overall name on government propaganda
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.480]  because it's one of the biggest and one of the worst with the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
[46:07.480 --> 46:11.480]  Endowment and all these other private groups that are above government that are even bigger
[46:11.480 --> 46:17.240]  than the CIA when it comes to the social engineering, like saying, we need to teach your four-year-old
[46:17.240 --> 46:22.080]  about trannies and tell them that maybe they want to have a sex change when they're seven.
[46:22.080 --> 46:28.600]  This is the government involved sexually assaulting your children, trying to get them to be confused
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.080]  about their gender and trying to take parental rights away to make them get sex changes when
[46:33.080 --> 46:34.080]  they're children.
[46:34.080 --> 46:35.080]  Exactly.
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.720]  And this is a perfect learning example because, A, it's multi-layered.
[46:38.720 --> 46:43.440]  It shows that on one layer, it's projecting out into the people whose consciousness is
[46:43.440 --> 46:49.880]  absorbed by this fake Hollywood celebrity culture and it's attacking them on that layer.
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.200]  And then there's a secondary subconscious layer, which is created by this definitive
[46:54.200 --> 47:03.040]  propaganda that's being spread that is creating all these racial divisiveness, sexual divisiveness,
[47:03.040 --> 47:08.000]  twisting people's ideas about what reality is, and doing it in a very attacked and very
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  scientific level.
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  And let me be clear.
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  Level.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.920]  I mean, just type into Google, CIA put out deviant art to break down society starting
[47:14.920 --> 47:15.920]  in the 1950s.
[47:15.920 --> 47:17.400]  Well, we already knew that.
[47:17.400 --> 47:20.680]  It came out in the church committees and others, but they've released it.
[47:20.680 --> 47:23.560]  And look, we're not against you making deviant art if you want.
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.520]  It's the point is they're force-feeding it so that people get confused.
[47:27.520 --> 47:30.000]  Modern art was CIA weapon, London Independent.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  Boom.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.040]  And if you read, actually, into what they were doing, it was to just create a system
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.720]  where they could define whatever they wanted as the new trend to control reality.
[47:41.720 --> 47:49.160]  And here's another article out on that today with how the CIA writes history.
[47:49.160 --> 47:53.800]  And this article goes through with links to the admissions that they control history by
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.720]  classifying billions of things, basically, and then they can put out a fake narrative
[47:58.720 --> 48:00.880]  about what has really happened.
[48:00.880 --> 48:06.680]  This is an excellent article that breaks all of this down at the intercept by Jefferson
[48:06.680 --> 48:08.360]  Morley.
[48:08.360 --> 48:10.880]  The point is this is all completely known.
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.400]  This is like me saying, OK, five years before Obama even got in, they had a drone program
[48:16.400 --> 48:21.040]  killing people outside of law, outside of warrants that violates the Geneva Convention.
[48:21.040 --> 48:30.520]  Obama continued it, and four years into his administration, they came out and said that
[48:30.520 --> 48:32.320]  there was no drone program.
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.080]  Well, this is like Obama saying, and I'm going to close when we come back from break, over
[48:36.080 --> 48:41.120]  and over again, I guess 16 times USA Days found that there will be no boots on the ground
[48:41.120 --> 48:42.880]  ever in Syria, period.
[48:42.880 --> 48:43.880]  We are not doing it.
[48:43.880 --> 48:45.600]  There were already boots to the ground then.
[48:45.600 --> 48:49.640]  Now they'd have the State Department come out and say, Obama never said that and it's
[48:49.640 --> 48:51.480]  a lie.
[48:51.480 --> 48:53.840]  Buckley finishing up is we're about to go to break here.
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.960]  I just wanted you to come in and let me just say one thing that really a long time ago
[48:57.960 --> 49:00.000]  really, really opened up my eyes.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.160]  And you've talked about this before a lot.
[49:03.160 --> 49:06.360]  There's a book, which is the textbook for all of this.
[49:06.360 --> 49:08.480]  It was written by Edward Bernays.
[49:08.480 --> 49:15.120]  It's called Propaganda, and it describes very succinctly and very distinctly exactly how
[49:15.120 --> 49:18.200]  they use fads, how they create fake culture.
[49:18.200 --> 49:19.920]  This is how they get everybody to follow along.
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.880]  How do they get you to have smart cars that control your life and drive for you?
[49:23.880 --> 49:26.280]  The $200,000 Mercedes coming out drives for you.
[49:26.280 --> 49:27.280]  It's already here.
[49:27.280 --> 49:28.280]  Exactly.
[49:28.280 --> 49:30.640]  Oh, you pay extra to be the slave.
[49:30.640 --> 49:33.000]  They make the chains cool.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.040]  Just like the ruling elite of China 3,000 years ago, the women couldn't walk because
[49:38.040 --> 49:39.240]  they were too royal to walk.
[49:39.240 --> 49:40.240]  They bound their feet.
[49:40.240 --> 49:44.640]  No, they wanted the women to be slaves and the Chinese leaders, the men wrote about it
[49:44.640 --> 49:47.400]  laughing in the manuals, how they controlled them.
[49:47.400 --> 49:50.640]  So for those of you who haven't read the book, I would at least implore you to go look at
[49:50.640 --> 49:53.040]  the Wikipedia page or read a little bit about it.
[49:53.040 --> 49:57.880]  And if you can't get your hands on the book, read it because it was written in like 1924.
[49:57.880 --> 50:01.040]  It was written in 1924, even before the advent of what we were talking about.
[50:01.040 --> 50:02.920]  He's the reason you eat bacon with eggs.
[50:02.920 --> 50:04.960]  He's the reason women smoke cigarettes.
[50:04.960 --> 50:05.960]  All of it.
[50:05.960 --> 50:06.960]  Absolutely.
[50:06.960 --> 50:07.960]  All of it.
[50:07.960 --> 50:08.960]  Absolutely.
[50:08.960 --> 50:09.960]  And so I would highly suggest.
[50:09.960 --> 50:12.680]  The full name of the book is History as a Weapon, Propaganda, 1928.
[50:12.680 --> 50:17.880]  Yeah, and I would, I would, I would suggest that anybody goes out and read that book because
[50:17.880 --> 50:19.560]  it really, it really defines.
[50:19.560 --> 50:21.240]  Listen, here's the bigger issue.
[50:21.240 --> 50:26.480]  Who are the people in the government and in the media that knowingly want to make Americans
[50:26.480 --> 50:29.320]  dumb and inject us with cancer viruses?
[50:29.320 --> 50:32.960]  We should just shift away from even trying to wake up some of the public that doesn't
[50:32.960 --> 50:37.440]  know the CIA is lying to them and debating that Obama said no boots to the ground.
[50:37.440 --> 50:38.840]  I'm not even going to play the clip.
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.720]  If you don't remember him saying it, just, just go golf and drink fluoride and just be
[50:42.720 --> 50:43.720]  an idiot.
[50:43.720 --> 50:44.720]  Okay.
[50:44.720 --> 50:47.960]  We need to just talk to people that do know what's happening and are informed outside the
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.600]  system in the system and say, look, we're going into total tyranny.
[50:51.600 --> 50:52.600]  It's time to stop it.
[50:52.600 --> 50:56.200]  Thanks for coming in Buckley and popping in and sharing the whole story on Beyonce and
[50:56.200 --> 50:59.000]  the whole fake narrative of somebody cheating on her.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.880]  We'll be back with the clips of Obama.
[51:00.880 --> 51:05.280]  Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an army ranger have produced a high speed

[54:30.280 --> 54:33.120]  The only thing is real.
[54:33.120 --> 54:36.520]  And when you stop hurting, you start dying.
[54:36.520 --> 54:39.360]  It is true that pain is weak to sleep in the body in many cases.
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.480]  And if you want to know the real propaganda, it's the laziness in how we've been inducted
[54:44.480 --> 54:47.160]  to think it's cool not to care.
[54:47.160 --> 54:53.040]  When we as a species are under attack by a bunch of nasty psychopaths, want to steal
[54:53.040 --> 54:57.960]  the world, what have I become, my sweetest friend?
[54:57.960 --> 55:06.520]  Should I even play the president saying 16 times we have it?
[55:06.520 --> 55:08.800]  No boots on the ground in Syria ever?
[55:08.800 --> 55:12.640]  And then play the State Department yesterday saying he never said that?
[55:12.640 --> 55:17.640]  Should I even show you hundreds of articles and admissions of the CIA engaged in domestic
[55:17.640 --> 55:24.320]  propaganda and the Ford Foundation and Soros funding the race war male against female garbage?
[55:24.320 --> 55:32.760]  It's all on record that the CIA funded Ms. Magazine and Gloria Steinem, look it up.
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.560]  It's ridiculous.
[55:36.560 --> 55:38.400]  But they lied to you straight to your face.
[55:38.400 --> 55:40.600]  I'm going to play those clips here in a moment.
[55:40.600 --> 55:46.320]  We're only running this special max until next week.
[55:46.320 --> 55:51.360]  And if it causes them to sell out, they're producing new food every few weeks, but it's
[55:51.360 --> 55:55.680]  so fresh in my Patriot supply, we'll have to stop earlier because that's just not good
[55:55.680 --> 55:58.920]  business to completely sell out and have nothing to sell for weeks.
[55:58.920 --> 56:02.760]  So 30 to 40% off, people are buying food at the fastest rate ever.
[56:02.760 --> 56:03.760]  That's smart.
[56:03.760 --> 56:08.040]  The stuff last 25 years, M4 select is my Patriot supply, private label, so I'm able to go even
[56:08.040 --> 56:09.040]  lower.
[56:09.040 --> 56:15.480]  So 30 to 40% off the already discounted retail and it's in these high quality plastic tote
[56:15.480 --> 56:16.480]  containers.
[56:16.480 --> 56:19.200]  The containers are really expensive at the store, but they buy them in bulk and get them
[56:19.200 --> 56:20.280]  really good.
[56:20.280 --> 56:26.600]  And then they're in good pouch containers inside and cans.
[56:26.600 --> 56:35.160]  It's just super high quality, special diets, you name it, all of it, M4warstore.com or M4warselect.com.
[56:35.160 --> 56:36.960]  We'll take you right to the subsection with the storable food.
[56:36.960 --> 56:44.440]  You get it from my Patriot supply at M4warstore.com or the M4warselect, it's all super high quality.
[56:44.440 --> 56:47.960]  And the specials will end, it could be a matter of days, it could be next Monday, I'm not
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.000]  sure we're going to have to gauge it, but at current rates, this is the most food that
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.120]  we've ever sold and that they've ever sold.
[56:54.120 --> 56:57.200]  People are buying it so fast and that's because people see how dangerous the world is right
[56:57.200 --> 56:58.560]  now, what's going on.
[56:58.560 --> 57:02.480]  And also it's such a good deal and that's important though because funding is really
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.800]  a big issue here and it's very expensive to run this operation.
[57:04.800 --> 57:11.160]  So it's a win-win, get high quality, storeable food and fund the Info War.
[57:11.160 --> 57:16.360]  On top of that, ladies and gentlemen, we also, you can get 10% off when you sign up for
[57:16.360 --> 57:20.840]  auto-ship, for the Nutri-suiticles, the Hillary, for present shirts, stuff that's good for
[57:20.840 --> 57:26.360]  auto-ships like the Wake Up America coffee and other items like that, X2, lung cleanse,
[57:26.360 --> 57:28.320]  you name it.
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.920]  Ultra powerful Secret 12, Vitamin B12 is back and available at M4warselect.com.
[57:32.920 --> 57:37.400]  Just research, Vitamin B12 deficiency being epidemic across the western world because
[57:37.400 --> 57:41.520]  of gut flora problems, unable to absorb the Vitamin B12, that was even the New York Times
[57:41.520 --> 57:47.120]  last week, life science, you name it, linked to mental illness, depression, all sorts of
[57:47.120 --> 57:55.040]  other problems in children, absolutely connected to autism, just see what good old God gave
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.600]  us through Mother Earth with Secret 12, absorb it under the tongue, just hold it in your
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.920]  mouth for about a minute, it tastes really good, it's pure Vitamin B12, 80% Methylcobalamin
[58:02.920 --> 58:06.960]  and Acetamin-cobalamin are how you pronounce it, that's even more powerful, that's very
[58:06.960 --> 58:13.040]  expensive for the upload, that's what allows it to be uploaded, but the Methylcobalamin
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.920]  is the stuff that's in the shots, you don't inject this folks, but that's what it is.
[58:17.920 --> 58:22.120]  And oh by the way, consult your physician before you take Vitamin B12 and consult your
[58:22.120 --> 58:25.080]  physician before you do the liver cleanse and consult your physician before you take
[58:25.080 --> 58:29.840]  the X2, because some of this stuff really is powerful, it's all recognized as safe,
[58:29.840 --> 58:33.120]  but people can always make up whatever they want, so I want to say this, consult your
[58:33.120 --> 58:38.000]  physician or a health care provider before you breathe, before you drink water, or before
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.080]  you walk out your front door in the morning, we'll be back with a second hour, I'm Alex

[59:53.280 --> 01:00:19.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:30.280]  We're listening to Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.400]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour, she's got a big interview
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400]  premiering tonight.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.320]  We're going to air a clip of it with a gentleman that says he was abused, and I agree this
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.120]  goes on as a young person and then targeted it for sex operation.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.360]  There's a whole lobby out there pushing it, and let's get this straight.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.760]  I don't care if you turn yourself into a dog or an Easter Bunny, I mean get that straight.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.040]  I know it makes it a bigger treat and makes it funner if I'm being bigoted and closed
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.080]  minded and I can't handle you wanting to be a woman or a man.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.440]  I don't want to pay for it with tax money.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.960]  I'm sick of hearing about bathrooms all day.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.320]  This is all culture war to break down society.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.240]  It doesn't mean because you are who you are or who you think you are that you're bad
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240]  inherently.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:21.360]  It's like a hatchet can be used to cut up lumber or logs or firewood or use it to kill
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.360]  it somebody.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.760]  You can use it to murder someone.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.240]  So I'm not saying people that are quote gay there, I'll use the words you say, you're
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.160]  the boss now, homosexual, heterosexual.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.600]  There's a war on using words, and I'm sick of it.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:45.220]  And it's classic Edward Bernays into the family CIA funding, Miss magazine, the CIA's heavily
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.240]  involved with sports and the NFL.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:53.720]  It's on record and heavily involved in domestic spying and heavily involved in manipulating
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.560]  scripts in Hollywood.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.600]  And there were a lot of investigations dealing with it five or six years ago.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.920]  And so they just responded by having Congress pass a law, the 2013 NDAA National Defense
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.160]  Authorization Act saying you can lie to the American people and use their taxpayer money
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.160]  against them.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.040]  And when we come back from break, I will go directly to it, I've been mentioning it,
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.960]  the montage of Obama.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.920]  You also print me USA Today because quizlings and cognitive dissonance people that are
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.320]  programmed in a trance, they will say we edited the Obama or took it out of context.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:35.440]  I want to show them even an authority figure publication saying it is a truth.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.920]  And that's because USA Today understands if they completely do nothing but lie, they'll
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.000]  have no readers.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  But mainstream media has already killed itself.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.720]  But to the credit of USA Today, they had an article out three days ago basically saying
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.600]  that all scientists don't agree and manmade climate change and say it's a big carbon
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.600]  tax scam.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.240]  Well, actually most scientists that have been polled say that because it's true.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240]  And they're scientists.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:02.920]  And there's this big hoax of the scientists all know, but you the little people, it's
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.920]  your car that makes the earth hot, not the sun.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.080]  This is how they bully people.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:19.240]  So you can type it in, Obama said 16 times, he pledged no boots on the ground in Syria.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:25.440]  And now the State Department says they've never said it and it's not true.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.440]  Not true.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:33.120]  Of course, the CIA is not involved in race war, divide and conquer, balkanization, sex
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.680]  war, social justice warrior brainwashing, even though the federal government, the Department
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:45.240]  of Education, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, the CIA, all of them are on record writing
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:53.080]  the guidelines for UNESCO and the UN for not just US education, but worldwide adoption
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:04:00.200]  of standards tailored for the sociology, psychology and cultures in their area to devastate the
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:08.320]  family, atomize any tribal structure into individuals, helpless, dumbed down to be victims of the
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.400]  global corporate combined system taking over.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.960]  Now, I'm going to ask all the twits over at Esquire and Gawker and everywhere else.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.400]  I know if you don't tell the line, they'll just fire and bring somebody else in.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.560]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.320]  The worm is turning.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.960]  You'd make more money, dumbo's, starting your own websites and coming out and telling
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.880]  the truth than you would lying for these publications, but here's the deal.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.080]  You like lying.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.240]  You don't know how to tell the truth.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.440]  You don't recognize it and you get off on snuggling up to the establishment even though
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:43.160]  it's a rotting dinosaur with maggots coming out of its eyes.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]  I get it.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.360]  You're of your father.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.840]  You love death.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.480]  You love lies.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.280]  You come from bad families.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.920]  I'll use your own eugenics line on you.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.840]  You come from predatory, twisted, screwed up gene pools and you're not going to end
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.000]  up getting into space.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.560]  We are.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.960]  Refrigerators zapped off in kitchens across Venezuela as the government turned off the
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.920]  electricity supply to help ease the power outage that is worsening the country's economic
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.920]  crisis.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.520]  Reports, Yahoo News.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.760]  It is the latest drastic measure by the government in a crisis that has already seen Venezuelans
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.600]  waiting for hours to buy scarce supplies and shops.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.640]  Machines for processing bank card payments also wouldn't work without power, meaning
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.880]  that some left stores without buying anything.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.480]  President Nicolas Maduro's government blames the power outage on weather.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.520]  Critics, however, say it is the result of economic mismanagement and inefficient running
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.440]  of the energy network.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.880]  Venezuela's economy has plunged along with the price of the oil it relies on for foreign
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880]  revenues.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.640]  Citizens are suffering shortages of medicines and goods such as toilet paper and cooking
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]  oil.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.960]  Maduro blames the collapse on an economic war by capitalists.

[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.760]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.760]  Good, brother.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.600]  I just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.640]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.640]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.560]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that I know I'm going to have the
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.120]  highest quality.

[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.760]  maximum potency.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.680]  I want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.200]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.320]  goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:09.280]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.560]  a poor, half-frozen snake.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.160]  His pretty-colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:23.560]  Oh, well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.560]  Take me in, O tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:34.760]  Take me in, O tender woman, side the vicious snake.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.640]  Take me in, O tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.080]  Take me in, O tender woman, side the vicious snake.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.120]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.720]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:57.080]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:03.240]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:11.040]  But instead of saying, thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.520]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me, heaven's why.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.320]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.960]  Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:38.440]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.040]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.600]  among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Ted offensive, Ted
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.480]  style offensive in Europe, and the same things being done to this country.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.960]  By the way, we have the former Navy SEAL that has been warning of this and writing articles
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:02.120]  about it, and likening to Ted too, joining us, coming up tomorrow, Roger Stone is also
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:10.200]  going to be on basically one of the top generals surrounding the Trump campaign, but even CNN
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:16.960]  and Politico, the New York Times, go, Roger Stone and his business partner are the top
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.840]  advisors to Trump.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.640]  And wow, the intel I get from Roger about what's going on, because he knows he can tell
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.840]  me stuff and confidence is amazing, what's happening.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.520]  But I'll see how much we can get him to say on air tomorrow.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:40.960]  Now, if you just joined us, there's the intros I've been playing here in the second hour.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.600]  They have New York Daily News, they have Esquire, they have Gawker, they have just a whole bunch
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.960]  of other publications coming out.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.720]  Oh look, a conspiracy theory about Beyoncé and the CIA, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.960]  says Beyoncé's lemonade is part of a CIA plot, sort of civil war.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.960]  Alex Jones Beyoncé's lemonade was funded by the CIA to start a race war.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:10.600]  Yeah, what I say in the video is that Beyoncé is promoting division in this country and that
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.760]  the NFL is funded by a whole bunch of federal agencies, the Department of Defense CIA, Department
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.160]  of Education, you name it.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:24.840]  And then even the big corporations are being subsidized, the ads they run, to have anti-father
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  messages.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:31.240]  Why do you think the last two Super Bowls, one had four, one had six, anti-father messages,
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.280]  we did reports on it.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.880]  Five years ago, Audi, during the Super Bowl, had a green police hat.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.920]  And I noticed they were wearing the actual white tops, green bottoms of real green police
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.720]  in Australia and in areas of the US that had already been put in.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.720]  And I went and looked up the PR firm and knew they did a lot of government work.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.880]  And I sat on air, this, and we wrote articles, I said, this appears to be funded for the
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:05.640]  rollout of the green police to condition the public to accept a whole new level of tyranny.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, a year later, the mayor of San Francisco was in the San Francisco
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.640]  Chronicle and bragged in a joint interview, it was like a conference they were having
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:22.200]  with the head of the PR company and they bragged how they got federal money to pay for the
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:28.120]  Audi ad on the Super Bowl and to pay for the ad itself, super high budget, to roll out
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.160]  the new green police and the exact uniform.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:39.560]  Well, I mean, of course it was, but they admitted it.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.560]  This is what's going on.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.320]  This is how they finance everything.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.280]  I'm on the stations around the country and they'll have federal hospital funded districts
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.240]  where federal Obama money's coming in and they'll come into the hospitals, give them
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.640]  this chunk of grant money, then the hospital comes and says, we're going to advertise for
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:03.760]  a year, $300,000, $500,000 in one case, but we want Alex Jones off the air.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.520]  And I've even had stations go, don't tell anybody, you know, specifically who told
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:13.280]  you this, but yeah, the public has no idea what's going on, folks.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.760]  No idea, no idea.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.760]  And then they sit there and they make jokes when just type in the CIA is engaged in deception
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:29.520]  in the US, you'll get mainstream news, you'll get the Washington Post, you'll get all these
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:38.560]  publications admitting this to you, but saying it's good, you see, but they never tell you
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.640]  what they're doing.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:48.440]  They never tell you, they never tell you exactly what's going on.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.200]  They don't tell you what the message is of the CIA or the Ford Foundation or the Department
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.200]  of Education.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.920]  And again, they give them money, but they also get them in these big RTF meetings, sometimes
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:05.240]  on C-SPAN, but usually in private, in Chicago, in New York and D.C., in London sometimes.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.000]  We've gotten the transcripts of these through foyers, but sometimes they have it on C-SPAN
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.600]  or they have parts of it on C-SPAN, and they get up there and they say, like, they live,
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.680]  the power alliance was done well, we're enslaving them, good job, I mean, it's literally like
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.200]  that with the Attorney General going, I know you're doing good, but you can't just be anti-gun
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:33.120]  once a week, you've got to be anti-gun constantly every few minutes and brainwash the public.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:39.640]  And memos have come out from the big production companies, Sumner, Redstone, Viacom, CBS, MTV,
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.200]  you name it, biggest media company in the world, and it says, you will put fathers in
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.640]  a bad light, you will put women in the light of the Savior.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.800]  That isn't to empower women, that is to screw everything up and make women not respect men
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.800]  and everything falls apart and vice versa.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:06.920]  And the government involved with social engineers in our biology, they hate us so much.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.640]  And the stupid idiots that work at Viacom and that work at Esquire and that work at
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.680]  all these places in Gawker, their kids are going to die of cancer young, they're going
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.520]  to die young, they're going to have neurological disorders, and they're so cowardly that when
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:25.000]  they're dying, they're not even ever going to admit the globalists killed them, they're
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.080]  not going to go look at the actuaries, the numbers, the admissions, the White House science
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.480]  czars, eco science, they're not going to read any of it.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:41.440]  I'll tell you who is going to read it, not just somebody who won in open karate championships
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.160]  around the world against people a lot bigger and meaner than him, but somebody who successfully
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.320]  launched his own genre of films, somebody who launched his own line of exercise equipment
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.560]  and successful businesses, somebody that has just done so many accomplishments, it's crazy.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:03.280]  And who produced the most hilarious comedy series, Walker, Texas Ranger in history.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.360]  And believe me, inside baseball, they know it's entertaining, it's fun, has a family
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.600]  values message, but it's also entertaining and funny.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.360]  People that can't laugh at themselves have a big problem.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360]  Chuck Norris is an amazing person.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:21.120]  Chuck Norris takes on Kim Trails, martial arts legend, talks about sky criminals waging
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.160]  war on our atmosphere and our health.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.000]  And the point is, you can't stop the signal.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.160]  Merle Haggard, Prince, Chuck Norris, all of them, all listeners of this show, by the
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.680]  way, but let's expand on that.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.520]  We've confirmed Merle Haggard was as well.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.680]  I remember Willie Nelson like 10 years ago, they're playing chess with him.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.320]  He goes, I know you talk about the Kim Trails.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.760]  I noticed they stay up there longer than they used to.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]  What do they do?
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.160]  Are they changing the weather?
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.040]  The point is, you can't fool everybody, okay?
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.760]  And it's admitted they're doing the secret test.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.560]  They just classify the details.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.080]  It's called geoengineering.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.960]  So the good news is this medical scientific global takeover is now getting ready to come
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.080]  down.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.520]  And why would anybody want to work in this deception and get talking points from criminals
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.320]  in the government to go out and wage war against your own fellow humans?
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.240]  I'm going to skip this one break today on the nature of time here because this is so
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240]  important.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.600]  I want to play now an admitted lie, but if you're a new viewer or a new listener or
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.440]  somebody at Asquire or somebody at CNN, I've met a lot of these propagandists.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.360]  The high level ones know what they're doing.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360]  They know they're evil.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.360]  They know the deception.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.200]  But the mid levels just are real silly wannabe comedian types who are real cynical, hateful
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.640]  and laugh at everything and just don't even have any culture or ideas.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.760]  They just do whatever they're told.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.760]  They're sociopathic.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.080]  And I want to explain the little sociopaths.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.880]  You aren't going to get as much government cheese as this system collapses.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:03.760]  You're being screwed over by this.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.520]  So if you're even a sociopath, you shouldn't want world government.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.840]  You shouldn't have to avoid the fluoride in the water.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.400]  And of course, these people never do.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.720]  They go, I don't care if it kills you.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720]  Big deal.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]  I don't care if it kills people.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]  Okay, fine.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720]  Harvard admits it's killing us.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.720]  I don't care.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.720]  Because they don't want to admit they're under attack.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:26.240]  When it's proven, they go, fine, I accept it because of fundamental laziness, lack of
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.800]  vision and lack of destiny.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.800]  They love death.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.960]  They love rolling over.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.960]  They love non-existing.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.360]  They don't like the animating contest of life.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.560]  They're dead.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.500]  They're sleeping.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.040]  And if you've been asleep your whole life and bombarded with nothing but evil culture,
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040]  you become that.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.880]  If you didn't have an over-driving stamp of God on you and a stamp of love of life and
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.560]  God's creation and vision, and if you weren't ever opened up to the God of the universe,
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:02.320]  not the God of this world, you are blinded by the God of this world and you can't resonate
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.880]  with what I'm saying.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:12.000]  People that do click totally get it, but those that are spiritually blind in many cases cannot
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  ever be reached again.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.880]  So just stop spending your time with someone that giggles and laughs and hops up and down
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.160]  like a demon at you and move on to people that actually debate you or want to listen.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:30.680]  And then give them a pep talk and work with others to form together with people that understand
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:35.080]  what's happening to enrich each other and edify each other and build a resistance to
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.080]  this.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.320]  And realize we've just got to form the resistance.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.360]  God's going to do the rest.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.000]  We've got to take those first steps.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.600]  The secret is a load of bull from Oprah Winfrey and all that.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.000]  You just imagine and hope something that happens.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  No.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.200]  Sure, energy if you have a good attitude is positive and some good things will come back
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.120]  to you, but you've got to have the will.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.480]  You've got to be doing it for the right reason.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.560]  You've got to be committed and you've got to be persecuted.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.960]  And every time you get persecuted and go through it, then the doors open up.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.960]  But no guts, no glory, folks.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:11.600]  One favors the bold, our fortune is liberty.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:15.640]  So try if you're a new listener and you tune in, a lot of people tune in for entertainment
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.840]  and to feel superior.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:24.920]  Look at someone who's real, someone who stumbles, someone who comes off provincial at times,
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920]  but also intellectual.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.280]  A lot of pseudo-intellectuals like to watch to feel important.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:35.360]  Come down off that horse for a minute and ask yourself, you feel safe with a government
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.880]  that told you Obamacare would be free when it didn't?
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.160]  You feel safe with them telling you two plus two equals, whatever they say?
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.880]  You think we're going in a good direction when they tell you they never, we're going
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.560]  to put trips on the ground and never said they would and it's a lie?
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.200]  When they're gearing up with armored redoubts and putting all sorts of garbage in the food
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.400]  and water, you go, oh, there's nothing in the food and water.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.360]  Yes, there is and you know it.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:03.720]  They knew full well with aspartame and life of Satan, MSG and all the rest of the garbage
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.720]  does.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.240]  They know what the mercury does with the vaccines.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.760]  They know what the adjuvants do.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:15.840]  They know and it just continues on and they don't take it out even when they get caught
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840]  because they're committed.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.200]  They're breaking us right now.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.640]  You really think someone identifying as a male or female or saying mother or father,
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.720]  he or she hurts someone so don't say he or she, no, that's a cult teaching you you can't
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.720]  use any words.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.800]  They start out with, let's not hurt gay people, it's feelings so don't say the word homosexual,
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.080]  heterosexual, homosexual.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.160]  They say don't use the word Negro because that sounds like the N word, well it just
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:43.080]  comes from Latin meaning dark.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.120]  What next, don't use the word Caucasian.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.520]  That sounds weird and people that are scared by a science term say don't use it.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:59.400]  This means the Caucasus Mountains, Caucasoid, Caucasoid skeletons that were discovered.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:06.000]  Chromagnon, of course they've done the genetic testing.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:13.560]  You know that the Neanderthals didn't die out, they were bred out and you look at Europeans
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:18.240]  today, you're looking at a hybrid between Neanderthal and Chromagnon but listen, people
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.760]  just aren't informed, ladies and gentlemen, they don't know what's going on.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:29.320]  They don't understand, they're ignorant and the truth is exciting, it's wild.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.680]  It's interesting, let me tell you, you're going to wake up if you turn into the reality
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:37.720]  and look into this for yourself in a science fiction horror film but it's animating, it's
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.920]  fun, it's exciting to be involved and know what's going on and to flip the switches
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:50.360]  in your body to resist it that are designed to make you survive and thrive.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:55.120]  It is this animating pressure that is going to empower us and the enemy would say that's
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.960]  why we're doing it, to make people that are going to be empowered become empowered but
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.040]  those that fall to it, they deserve to die and be destroyed by eugenics.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.280]  That's a very immoral, evil program and I'll go one further, you're not just doing that,
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:17.680]  that's your public outside porch, outside the true inner party program to tell people you're
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:25.480]  doing eugenics to empower the species, that's pop psychology, that's pop eugenics.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:33.840]  Eugenics is about targeting super genes, elite genes, innovative genes, trailblazing
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:41.520]  genes, loving genes that the sociopath control freaks, psychopathic, inbred, OCD, mental patient,
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.480]  control guilds are threatened by.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:49.320]  The satanic bloodlines, it's not that it's Jewish or it's black or it's white or it's
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:54.400]  Asian, it's in every group, Asian, black, whatever, it's about the same number of psychopaths
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:24:02.480]  and sociopaths and other people that are predisposed, nature loads the gun, environment pulls
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.320]  the trigger, epigenetics all the rest of it and you've got a certain number of people
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.640]  that are psychopaths, another number that are sociopaths and then they're artificially
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:18.880]  engaging in cultural brainwashing to produce artificial sociopaths as their armies but
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.680]  soon that won't matter because the machines are coming in who will follow orders and are
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.280]  autonomous under globalist control.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.920]  So this is an attack on you and your family and they don't want you to know they're doing
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.320]  it even though it's declassified.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.760]  So what I'm telling you is a fact, it's worse than I'm saying because there's no way to
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.120]  describe how horrible this is and how big this is and how stinking this is.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.800]  I can't tell you about the matrix, you're going to have to decide you want to take the
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.200]  red pill and see if it's yourself.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:49.800]  It's all I'm offering is the truth.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:57.640]  Now continuing here with this, let's go ahead and play Obama's, I'm not going to play all
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:03.120]  16 times because of the time but here's Obama 16 times in the last four years saying whenever
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.200]  I put boots on the ground in Syria just let me bomb Syria.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.880]  Now they're putting boots on the ground, they were always there but they're expanding
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:17.800]  it openly because body bags are coming back and they are now telling everyone that they
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.840]  never said this and Obama's not lying to you.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.680]  I mean who's teaching the people of the State Department, Jonathan Gruber, here it is.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:32.840]  I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:40.040]  the ground in Syria would not only be good for America but also would be good for Syria.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:46.640]  My answer is simple, I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.960]  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:57.000]  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.160]  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:08.320]  Libya and Kosovo were destabilization programs but radical Muslims in charge.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.160]  Over the past two years what began is a series of peaceful protests against the repressive
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.160]  regime of Bashar.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:20.800]  You know I'm not going to play all 16, just turn it off, okay I can't look at it anymore.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.160]  You notice Kosovo and Libya were about putting radical Jihadists in charge.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.600]  They gave a third of Serbia to radical Jihadis, Wahhabist.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.440]  They gave Libya to them.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:40.200]  This is the globalist giving air support to Saudi Arabian proxy armies all over the world
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:45.000]  and now they got boots on the ground because claiming they're fighting ISIS, I don't believe
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  any of it.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.880]  And for my sources it's all pure bull.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.600]  So who knows what they're doing.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.080]  Mainly putting weapons caches in and then running off from them under orders and that's
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.360]  why the military is so awake.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.040]  But let's go ahead and go to another club.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.160]  This is a State Department yesterday where this rodent, I forget his name and it will
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.840]  be on screen, is telling you we never said there would be boots, they're nobody talking
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  about.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:14.360]  There were never elections, you never voted in primaries, come on, never had a right, women
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.360]  never breastfed children.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.360]  What are you talking about, there was another such thing as father or mother, those words
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360]  are illegal.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.720]  That's what they're all going and you're like that's cultic, it's a cult of control.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.840]  Here they are, he never said it, he didn't say it 16 times, he himself in press conferences,
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840]  here it is.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.840]  The conventional ground combat.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.920]  For months and months and months, the mantra from the president and everyone else in the
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.480]  administration has been no boots on the ground and now.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480]  That is not true.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480]  What?
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480]  It's just not true, man.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.480]  It is.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]  It's true.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.480]  No, it's not.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.320]  I just flatly, absolutely disagree with you, but I've been speaking to this when I was
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.400]  in uniform for over two years.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.640]  Okay, your predecessors are up here, but you know, all options are on the table except
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.640]  boots on the ground.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.640]  That was the...
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.640]  I never said that.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]  And?
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.640]  No, that was the full line from the president on down.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:06.640]  Anyway.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.640]  John Kirby.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:14.960]  Are you saying that this is not the same thing as saying one thing and then doing the
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.080]  other completely?
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.640]  I'm absolutely rejecting that thesis, yes.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.640]  That's enough.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.520]  Let's take him saying that and then put it in with the no boots on the ground and then
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.120]  let's put it in, you didn't build your business and you can keep your doctor and then him
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.360]  saying later, I never said you could keep your doctor.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.800]  I mean, the lies are getting along here, but here's the deal.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.200]  He knows they know that that was said hundreds of times by the Pentagon and press briefings
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:45.200]  and 16 times by him and hundreds of times other places by other members of the administration.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:51.080]  That guy is in a Psyop to make those people all feel alone and by themselves and to know
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:57.040]  they're going to go out and report he's a liar as they titrate the dose up of lies conditioning
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.920]  us to accept lies.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:04.000]  So he beats his hand on the table on purpose to demoralize you and say, that's not true.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.800]  And he smiles and laughs and then he goes, I never said that and then smiles and they're
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.760]  all looking upset having their humanity insulted and he's like, look, you people lie for a
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:17.280]  living in smaller ways, like smoking a Cuban cigar, you know, while somebody's cooking
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.960]  meth next door, but it's both illegal, either the laws or frauds or follow him.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.960]  He's there going, listen, we'll do whatever we want and you all feel real safe.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.400]  You think there'll be a good economy under a system like this?
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400]  You think we should all screw each other over?
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.560]  We'll get ahead that way?
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.560]  No.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.560]  Media.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.560]  Stop lying.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.560]  Stop going along with it.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.560]  CIA.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.560]  Military.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560]  FBI.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560]  Stop it.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560]  You're destroying our future by design.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.600]  We know where the new order is taking us.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:50.280]  It's taking us into eugenics, world government, mass extermination.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.560]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.080]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN reading network.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.760]  The end coming in.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:06.600]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.160]  less and less transparent.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.120]  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.920]  the conflict here.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.000]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.400]  matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.720]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.520]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.600]  There's many political parties.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.880]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.360]  And I'm really am asking you, it's more than a process question.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:38.880]  It's an integrity of the election question and everybody's asking me this question,
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.160]  so I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.760]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hard-core Donald Trump supporters.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.840]  Why do you do this every single time I have, no, you gotta stop, every time I have you
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.840]  on the air.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:58.360]  It's been full wars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7 p.m. as we cover the primaries
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360]  in the northeast.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.120]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.400]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:17.680]  Just one of the key compounds, BiOPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.200]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.320]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.200]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.080]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.680]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.120]  skin from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:53.680]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at infowarsstore.com

[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.920]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslife.com
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.440]  and purchase your supply of survival shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.440]  at infowarslife.com.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:14.920]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.160]  and the answer is clear.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:21.760]  Iodine is key, is paramount and there's still so much new information coming out that we
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.960]  simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:29.360]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.880]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.800]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.720]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:43.920]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine that
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:48.280]  major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.560]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:33:01.360]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:09.960]  Alex Jones, he was a nice guy actually.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.960]  You like him?
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.960]  That's good.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:13.960]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.960]  Nice guy.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.160]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.360]  danger and you understand what you're doing is epic.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.200]  Your reputation is amazing.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.880]  I will not let you down.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.360]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.160]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year or two years.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.880]  Let's give me a little bit of time to run things.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.200]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.280]  You said he was going to do it and he did a great job.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.680]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:46.280]  So while with it, you probably read it.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.280]  It was a drudge.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.560]  Who's great, by the way.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.360]  Drudge is amazing.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.360]  But the story in drudge and big story, it's all over the place now.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:01.360]  They're swimming across and big bags of stuff, shrugs swimming across the river.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:04.440]  They're swimming right across.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.800]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800]  They're jumping in.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.800]  They just jumped in the rafts.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.840]  One, two, three, four, they have big satchels.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.880]  And actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.680]  going to be killed because they're showing this on camera.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.840]  The guys carrying bags of stuff, they were shrugs.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.840]  Thank you.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:33.360]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncriple America.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.600]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.520]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.520]  Thank you.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.160]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:44.280]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.680]  And we are live.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.560]  Coming up tonight, there's going to be live coverage.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.440]  We'll have the news and some important news analysis and packages and then live coverage
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.400]  this evening of the big primaries and a whole bunch of states.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.480]  We're going to be talking about that more in the next hour with Gerald Salenta getting
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.280]  more into the financial news, the military news and so much more.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:10.120]  I'll be talking to Leigh Ann McAdoo about an incredible interview she did yesterday
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.360]  that's going to be airing tonight on the nightly news before their live coverage of what's
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:21.680]  coming up with, again, the key primaries that Trump is set to sweep.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.800]  Walt Hyer, formerly a transgendered woman now an accomplished author and public speaker
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.000]  with a passion for mentoring individuals whose lives have been torn apart by unnecessary
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.160]  gender changing surgery, is going to testify to you.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:39.560]  We're going to play a clip here in a moment about the dark side of all this and what's
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.240]  really being pushed here.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.600]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:50.080]  First off, if you look at what's happening in the world, you look at governments, militaries,
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.240]  the police, elites digging in, getting guns, getting food like never before.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.160]  This is insurance you can eat.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.320]  Everybody needs to know how to use firearms, to have friends and family that you can count
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.440]  on in an emergency.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:06.840]  That's also important, but to also have storeable foods is paramount.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.360]  And I shut out to find the very best sponsor with the very best, highest quality food at
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.360]  the lowest prices.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.640]  And that's my Patriot supply.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.360]  We have their full catalog at the lowest prices with all their latest specials, it's changing
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.160]  every week and in FullWarsHstore.com.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.720]  You've got 70-day, 140-day, 450-day, 900-day, 1,800-day supplies, 114-day supplies, boogie
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.960]  packs, the packaging's the best, the quality special, meal packages, special diet packages,
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.680]  you name it, they've got the full spectrum.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.760]  We've got the best water filtration systems, you name it.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.440]  We are running a special that we only do twice a year for 30 to 40% off, depending on which
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:53.360]  package it is, on all of the products at infowarselect.com.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.800]  You know, I've had such bad mold, I'm turning into Hillary Clinton, because it's been raided
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.360]  here.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:06.000]  And I took my Lung Shield home last night and sprayed like eight shots of it and didn't
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:14.440]  wake up hacking and coughing all night, but I still went for a jog.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.920]  I still went for a jog, this is not a plug on purpose here, this is the worst coughing
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:18.920]  I've ever had because it's mold.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:24.480]  Make sure to say I'm Hillary Clinton, part two, I'm coughing so hard I'm sweating here.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.960]  And no, it's gone away, and I took the Lung Clins home, and the Lung Clins has got all
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:36.400]  these essential herbs and oils, it's so thick, and you spray it down your throat, it totally
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.720]  knocks out, it's like fire ants in my throat and in my bronchioles, and it totally knocks
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.720]  it out.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.360]  And for like a week and a half, I was having all these mold problems at night and finally
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:53.440]  I thought, wait a minute, Lung Clins, but then I forgot and took it home and I wasn't
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:38:03.440]  doing it, so I'm digressing here, Lung Clins is an amazing product in InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  and then they don't have her mic on, she just said they should send some to Hillary Clinton,
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.920]  oh you're mic is on, okay.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.360]  Anyways, the point here is, this is teleprompter free news, so I have a coughing that I have
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:17.120]  one, but here is the Lung Clins, thank God.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:25.760]  I was doing a plug for storeable foods, and I've now segwayed off into all of this, but
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.320]  what were you going to say about Lung Clins, Leanne?
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.160]  We need to send some to Hillary Clinton and get rid of that nasty cough she has once and
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.160]  for all.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.440]  Oh, I agree with you, have you ever used Lung Clins?
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.680]  Yes, actually, I had the same thing with mold, so, and it does help, it coats the back of
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.680]  your...
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.880]  You know, Austin is the fastest growing city in the US, maybe after Atlanta, they debate
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:50.200]  which is the fastest, it's beautiful area, my mom's from here, I'm from Dallas.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.120]  But I thought allergies were a hypochondriac thing when my buddies did want to ride bicycles,
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.520]  oh, so you did too from Florida?
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.840]  Yeah, and I would be like, why, just stop coughing, stop sneezing, what's your problem?
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.680]  And then of course it hit me when I moved to Austin, so.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.600]  Well, the mold doesn't give me a headache, it just makes me cough, and uncontrollably,
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.360]  and I'm not kidding, the Lung Clins, I tried other products before we came out with this,
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:14.080]  the Lung Clins don't work, stuff that, you know, you take, it numbs your throat or whatever,
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.080]  it only happens a few times a year, when it's raining for months on end.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.800]  Yeah, which we need, it's kind of...
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:25.440]  The aquifers, the lakes are all back to capacity, it's part of the cycles, but the point is,
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:29.360]  vitamin B12, secret 12 is back in stock, but we're running a special that ends very, very
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.520]  soon on the high quality swirable foods at my Patriot supply at infowarstore.com and
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.520]  on infowarselect.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:43.080]  In fact, it's the infowarselect that hasn't turned it to 40% off, so take advantage of
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:48.480]  that today, ladies and gentlemen, and know that you're funding this operation as well.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.880]  Now is the time to have this insurance that you can eat, it is more important than ever.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:00.720]  Okay, Leanne continuing here, I want to get into this interview that's coming up tonight,
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:06.720]  at 7 o'clock Central in Full Wars Nightly News, because I was aware of this, I was familiar
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.920]  of these problems and people that have spoken out and been critical, but think about it.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.040]  They always make it like, hey, be open, be free, they know how classically liberal the
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.840]  West is, we're the place that women got the right to vote, we're the place where slavery
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:26.520]  got ended first, but because of that, there's this artificial idea that we're the bad guys.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.480]  Well, then they push, hey, if a man wants to be a woman or a woman wants to be a man,
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.000]  maybe their brains, biologically like that, whatever, they should be allowed to have that.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.680]  People are like, okay, then it's pay for the sex change with taxpayer money all over the
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:41.880]  country, billions a year, it's insane.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.880]  Now they're wanting body modifications, people think they're the devil or whatever, you know,
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.800]  have taxpayers pay for that.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:53.120]  Literally this is getting insane, and it's designed to break down culture and society,
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.880]  but think about children now in no child left behind as young as three are having the government
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.880]  and the state, read them books and talk to them about other genders, you don't have to
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.280]  be a boy, you don't have to be a girl, you were being oppressed because you were born
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.680]  into that biology, you have a great white shark born a male that he's being discriminated
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.320]  against or she is, this is like aliens attacking our species, and I'm not saying that's what
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.320]  it is, but it might as well be a movie where they're into humanity as we know it and they
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:26.440]  go into young people, sometimes young children, I see now young children getting sex changes,
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.360]  quote, you know, if they decide even above their parents' consent, just like abortion
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:35.400]  or just like vaccines in California, oh, your 12-year-old wants to be vaccinated, consents
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:41.080]  at 12, even the parents say no, this is the state coming in like pervs, like night crawlers,
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.800]  like guys coming through your daughter or son's window and kidnapping them, and they're
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:50.080]  doing it out of the open, the name of love and openness, it's so crazy, tell us about
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:58.280]  Walt Hire and SexChangeReject.com because the media is so mad about this gentleman
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.880]  and others that are speaking out and warning people.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:09.640]  So Walt Hire, he had his blog there, SexChangeRegret.com, he was a, he calls himself a transgendered
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:15.280]  at four years old, he was encouraged by his grandmother to wear this purple chiffon dress
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.320]  and maybe he was an effeminate young boy, I mean, you hear stories about that all the
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.800]  time, of little boys that want to play with dolls or wear dresses or whatever, I mean,
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.640]  it's really not that uncommon, however, the only way that he would receive love, attention
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.640]  and affection was when he would don this purple dress and then his mom, and it was like their
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.920]  little secret and he wouldn't tell his family about it, and then he went on home and then
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.160]  they found out and it was this big thing that it became this big shameful episode and then
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.840]  he went on to be molested by a family member, so just all this trauma and it really affected
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:57.560]  him as a young boy and he carried this with him, so then when he was about 38, he went
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:03.960]  to a gender psychologist who was an LGBT activist and just basically said, oh yes, I've seen
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.840]  this before, you need gender change surgery and then you'll be fixed.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:14.280]  And so just gave him that and lived for, you know, seven years as a woman and tried to
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.120]  commit suicide and was just, because his underlying issues weren't dealt with and then he went
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:23.880]  to an actual psychologist who said, actually, you have a dissociative disorder because you
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.240]  created a whole other identity for yourself to be able to survive with all this trauma
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.240]  that happened to you.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:33.640]  And by the way, that's real psychology, that's one of the worst things you can get is a disassociative
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:39.880]  disorder, children that are abused and traumatized will create fantasy land, la-la land characters
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.480]  and if you can't get them out of that character, they are fried for life and I'm really impressed
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.760]  with the research you've done on this and this angle, I hope you'll stay on this beat
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:54.360]  Leanne and, you know, do more stories on this because I have studied this, I've looked
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:00.320]  at it, I've seen the statistics and they make it about, we hate people that have different
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:06.360]  sexual proclivity and look, back to the Romans, whatever, I know there's always been some
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:10.280]  men that are attracted to men, historically and statistically, it's way higher women
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.280]  attracted to women.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:14.880]  I think that's biologically because men would be gone for a long time and then women would
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.280]  get together sometimes when the men came back and almost every anthropology study shifts
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.320]  back to men and women and I'm not, I'm telling you anthropology folks, sociology, culture,
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.320]  real stuff here.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.720]  The point is, I don't hate anybody, quite frankly, I mean, you know, it's the 21st century,
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.960]  I get what's going on, I'm a guy that's been around, I've seen a lot of stuff, they try
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.560]  to sell it like, ooh, I'm just a bigot and I hate them, give me a break.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.920]  Most of these people are grandstanding and a cultural takeover, it's funded by the government
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:49.680]  and the media to confuse everything, everybody fighting with each other, but a large percentage
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:54.720]  of, quote, gay men were grabbed by an older man when they were 10, 11, 12 years old and
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.000]  pedophiled, just like Hastert and all the rest of it and there's guilds of these people
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.640]  that promote themselves into government, Hastert was promoted by a bunch of Republican establishment
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.800]  people when he was the wrestling coach because he was in on the club, you know, the FBI goes
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.680]  in and covers up Penn State, this is a real club of aberrant, weird men, it's a lot worse
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:20.320]  with men than women, it's just the criminology that are targeting young boys for rape, men
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:26.320]  quite frankly from the statistics are way more often raped than women and those are
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.600]  the numbers, I figured we'd do reports on this, now girls get raped too by the uncle,
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.680]  the guy next door, they're embarrassed, they don't say anything about it too, but the point
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:39.720]  is it's pedophilia and so what this really is is the mainlining of pedophilia, there
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.640]  are some people that you could say are naturally gay or whatever, there are people that are
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.160]  chemically whatever, the chemicals in the water, fine, there's a wide spectrum, but
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:53.640]  at the heart of the push is to break up families and society using guilds of pedophiles and
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:59.720]  then exactly, there's all these weird cultures of grandmas in criminology and older women
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:05.640]  who also then either want to have sex with little boys or they want to make them dress
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:11.680]  like women and I read about this, I see it all the time, I know people, I mean I know
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:17.040]  a lady whose husband, I've known her for years, they had to break up after they were married
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.600]  four or five years because he had to admit that his grandmother raped him and then even
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.160]  after he grew up and moved out, she had a doll, these people were rich, had a doll under
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:30.600]  the bed of him she'd have sex with, so there's a lot of whacked out people folks who want
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:36.440]  to come into society, want to take over and want access to your kids, the UN has Nambla
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.920]  as an official member officially of the UN and is trying to legalize it, judges from
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.960]  New York to London to Sydney, Australia have come out and said lower the age down to 12,
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:53.400]  well next it's going to be 10 and here's the deal, keep your hands off my son and my daughters
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:58.400]  and they're innocent, they're young, they're going to have their own life, they're going
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:03.120]  to have experiences with their peers that are normal and natural, separately though
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.480]  there are tens of thousands, that's conservative of charges a year in the US, of an 18 year
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:13.720]  old woman with a 7 or 16 year or 16 year old boyfriend, totally natural, totally normal,
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:19.120]  vice versa, 18 year old guy with a 16, 17 year old girlfriend that she saw him as the
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:24.280]  quarterback when she was a freshman, now she's a senior, he's in his first year of college,
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:30.160]  they meet up, they've known each other for years, they get in love and then he'll be
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.280]  a sex offender and they get married and have kids, there are tens of thousands of people
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.080]  married to their sex offender husband or wife, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.960]  because there's all these arbitrary labels on everything, exactly, well they persecute
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.640]  just like people's kids die of vaccines and they say shaking baby, they know full well
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:49.680]  the vaccine killed them, same thing, you're 18, dating a 17 year old, they put you in
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.960]  jail or label you as a sex offender, but then Hastert can be screwing little boys, right
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.960]  and completely overlooked and that's the thing that the reason why, I know I'm ranting, this
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.120]  just really makes me madly.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:03.920]  It makes me mad as well and this is why I wanted to get Walt on, he had a story talking
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.680]  about how it's time for the LGB to remove the T from their name because gay men are
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:14.320]  always associated with these transgender men and they're completely, it's not the same
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:21.720]  thing and he's talking about, this is a psychological issue that you cannot change your gender and
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.040]  it doesn't matter if you get a sex change deep down inside, you know you're still the
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.400]  sex that you were born, but chemicals can affect areas in the brain to make women attracted
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.840]  to women and men attracted to men, that's the fact and they are putting that out there.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.240]  It's been around forever, okay, so this whole gender identity, this gender dysphoria, well
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.240]  it's like two male dogs will start going after each other, but they can't, yeah, but they
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:48.440]  can't, if your parents don't usher you into reality at some point, like this is who you
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:53.320]  are then you're just going to be living in this delusional state, well let's just say
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.640]  it, if you don't find dad's playboy books when you're 12 and instead some perv at the
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:01.520]  school teaches you you're a woman, you're going to end up missing out on family and everything
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.760]  else and I'm not saying give your kids playboy books, it's a figure of speech, the point
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.520]  is are you going to find some playboy books at the deer camp or are you going to have
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.080]  some guy when you're 12, pick you up at school and take you to a barn?
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.320]  Well the thing that makes me so upset about it is that they are giving gender reassignment
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:23.920]  surgery in Oregon without parental consent and in Oregon, if you're 12, 15 years old
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.440]  you can't even go to an R rated movie, you can't buy cigarettes, you can't, my children
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.800]  to go to the planetarium, I have to sound a form, yeah and so he has done so much research
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:38.200]  because obviously he's been severely affected, but say that again, they're doing sex changes
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.520]  all over the world on little kids, right, because they say they think they're a girl
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:46.880]  and get convinced by a bunch of pervs, without parental consent and so it's like the race
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:51.040]  to be the most progressive and this whole gender dysphoria, gender identity, it's still
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:55.200]  very new, we're still researching it and trying to understand what's going on here, but yet
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:02.080]  you're physically mutilating young children who 94% of these children grow out of gender
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:05.920]  dysphoria, they no longer want to express themselves as the other.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:09.400]  But they're all these people now encouraging it like, oh you're a girl, you think you're
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:16.120]  a boy, let's do it, oh you're a boy, you think you're a girl, oh it's wonderful, you're
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:21.240]  magic now, you're great, here's this community, well look, it's pedophilia being legalized,
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:26.000]  all the articles I've seen over the last 20 years, where they'll take seventh grade and
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.040]  sixth grade children to a quote dormitory at a college for a weekend, their parents
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:37.800]  let them go to learn about sex and I can't say on air what they teach, sixth and seventh
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.800]  graders, Leigh Ann.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.280]  Yeah, no it's, I've seen their curriculum.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.560]  And they'll get some woman in there going, this is how you, I can't even say it on air,
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.960]  I mean stuff that's super medically bad for you.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:50.960]  And that traumatizes children.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:55.160]  I mean they teach kids, I can't even tell you what they teach them, I just, folks they
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:58.680]  got your kids, it's just horrible, Leigh Ann we're going to play this clip of your guest
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.880]  when we come back, stay there, this makes me so angry.

[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.120]  When fresh liquid waste processed into a dry powder, the special proteins that make up
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:09.040]  the way lose their original shapes, they fold in on themselves and lose their functional
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.040]  value.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:14.480]  One World Way undergoes a technological enhancement that we believe restores these potent proteins
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.680]  back to their original shapes the body can use.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:22.760]  I chose to try One World Way first before going to a doctor who would likely only prescribe
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:25.880]  drugs to my delight it worked.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:31.520]  After stabbing pain for years to have it completely gone as a miracle, I'd like to
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.600]  also stress that for me, it took several months of taking One World Way before I had improvement
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.080]  and then an entire year for my gut to feel 100% healed.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:48.720]  So now I tell my friends, give your body time to make use of the healing power of One World
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720]  Way.

[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:36.520]  You know about RVs, you've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation and man wasn't
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.480]  made to live underground.

[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:20.160]  We live in a country where a parent is being investigated for allowing their child to play
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:26.600]  in the backyard unsupervised, yet in states like Oregon, the state is sponsoring sex changes
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.800]  without parental consent.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.960]  And so you're so concerned because perhaps there are some underlying psychological issues
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:39.160]  that aren't even being dealt with because a gender psychologist is just going to say,
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:40.560]  oh, I know what this is.
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.240]  You need to start taking hormone blockers and then we're going to give you a sex change
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.880]  and you'll be fixed.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:53.720]  Right, the problem with it is, is what we do know is that up to 94% of children who
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:55:00.680]  at a young age identify as transgender, if we leave them alone and don't push or advocate
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:05.280]  for them to change genders, will actually grow out of their gender dysphoria and become
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.280]  normal adults.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:12.320]  The problem today is that all kids, every single kid ever born is going to be curious
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.480]  about gender as they should be.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.560]  The difference is that when today, a parent sees someone curious about gender, they're
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:24.840]  identifying them as a transgender and then pushing them to change genders as though it's
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.840]  a good thing.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.200]  And I can tell you from my own life, it's not a good thing.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:34.240]  It damages and destroys life, it develops psychological disorders, many of them become
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:39.920]  alcoholics and drug addicts, they never get their gender dysphoria resolved through changing
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:47.160]  genders, in fact, the original founder of transgenderism, Harry Benjamin at his clinic,
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:53.960]  found that there were far too many suicides and unhappiness after changing genders.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:59.040]  And so even his own clinicians at that clinic decided to go into psychiatry so that it could
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.880]  actually help people, but still were caught up in changing people's gender for whatever
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:10.760]  reason, it's got to be some power thing from these large, powerful groups and schools and
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.320]  all the way to the White House that I've written about as well.
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  That's right.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:17.600]  Walt Hyre, big interview coming up tonight, that's just a sneak peek of the interview
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:19.400]  with Leigh Ann Mack, I don't understand.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.240]  This is why it's been through it, okay?
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.640]  And children are being targeted, parents that would want to confuse their kids and get them
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:30.040]  sex changes should be getting trouble.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:36.160]  This is the government, literally sexually beyond molesting your children, trying to
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.760]  change them and confuse them to end reproductive activity on this earth.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:45.360]  This is a weapon system, the well-meaning liberals that get taught in college are low
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.360]  level.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.360]  Everybody's committing suicide, we better, you know, get more psychiatrist.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.600]  The highest level is in gay men committing suicide, well now it's transgenders of the
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:59.560]  highest level of suicide because they're so unhappy and it's like, well, let us run
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.960]  everything or it's, you were mean to us as while we're committing suicide, no.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.960]  The cultures are mean and destructive, they have bug chasers for 20 years, gay men that
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:12.840]  want to go out and get HIV and then spread it.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:18.080]  There is a very sick underlying thing to this because it's directed by the globalist, it's
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:23.440]  death, it's eugenics and I love those people, it's why I'm warning them.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.520]  I'm telling you that this is the agenda, does it mean some people do this and are perfectly
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  happy?
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.080]  Absolutely, but don't tell me I got to pay for it and don't talk to little kids about
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:38.440]  sex, imagine if a full grown man was just out at the park talking to 10 year old kids
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:42.040]  telling little girls, you're a little boy or vice versa, they'd be a perv, they'd be
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.240]  arrested, how's the state doing it?
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:49.120]  Wake up people, Leigh Ann, you've got other points, the drugging of the kids, oh you're
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.040]  a girl, we're going to make you think you're a girl or boy.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:56.040]  Well, how much sense does it make that parents are being arrested for letting their children
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:01.360]  walk to the park or play in the park alone or walk to school, they're getting arrested
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:06.680]  but yet the school can come in and give these kids hormone blockers at 12 years old so that
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.840]  they won't go through puberty, that they can delay puberty, so give the kid a little bit
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:14.920]  longer to decide if he's really a boy or a girl.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:19.040]  If you start using those hormone blockers, it makes you infertile, so they've already
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:20.760]  totally transformed this person's life.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.240]  Oh yeah, they're sterilizing you and not telling you.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:24.240]  Right.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:27.680]  Yeah, it's a total of, it's eugenics, it's all eugenics, come back in 72nd, tell me
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:29.800]  to finish up before Joel Salenta joins us.
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.240]  Folks, we are the Info War, I've been wound up today, I tell you, please spread the word,

[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.240]  the Info War.

[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.240]  I do, but now you put me on the spot.
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:26.240]  That's some good music right there.
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.240]  Visit.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:41.960]  By the way, we never play Hollywood Babylon.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:44.040]  I put these two songs in here about a year and a half ago.
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.040]  We always play London Dungeon.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.040]  That's dancing.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:47.040]  Yes.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:58.600]  They like to lock us up, put us in their pretty pins.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.440]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.880]  Leigh-Anne, I am really wound up today.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:03.400]  I've gotten so angry.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:08.440]  Great report you're putting out trying to warn people, but this is a full genetic takeover,
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.760]  a full bullying where you can't use the word mother, father, or he or she because it hurts
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:13.760]  these people.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.760]  They're the new God.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:19.200]  They're just the new used, protected class that's actually being killed and sterilized
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.360]  and chopped up and suiciding, but they hold them up as the new rock stars.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.360]  Confused about life?
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.360]  Get on ProSec.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:27.360]  Confused about life?
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.360]  Go cut your genitals off or do this or that.
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:36.640]  It's an attack on the family and attack on humans, and it's an admitted attack, but regardless,
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:40.160]  the government and the state shouldn't be involved with your six-year-old trying to
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.160]  confuse them.
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.160]  Leigh-Anne, other points.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:46.400]  Well, it's just like when you watch the news and you know that you're going to get a certain
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.760]  slant depending on who the news outlet is.
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:54.800]  There are other places out there where you can get information if you're a parent that's
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:58.160]  dealing with this or a trans person that is kind of wondering.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.000]  There are some other information out there that you can find.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.120]  I would highly recommend going to his sex change regret because he has tons of information,
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.440]  all the studies that they're not going to show you in the mainstream media because that
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.720]  doesn't suit the agenda.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:13.480]  It doesn't push what they want.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480]  They want everyone.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:21.040]  I mean, you've seen Prince, David Bowie, these are mainstream people who have dealt with
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040]  their gender.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:26.760]  And here's the deal, if I like their music, if I like their music, I've never attacked
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:27.760]  them.
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:28.760]  I've said I like some of their music.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:31.440]  David Bowie more than Prince, but I like a lot of Prince's music.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.600]  I didn't care what he looked like, I like the music because I'm tolerant.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:36.600]  I don't care.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.520]  The point is though, I don't need to be force fed this and look, now they've got 50 different
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.400]  genders in Facebook.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:44.900]  It's all just made up.
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:49.240]  This is just a theory they came up with and now they get billions of taxpayer money to
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:51.600]  chop off people's, you know what?
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  Yeah.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:55.360]  Well, it's like, go out there, be expressive, do whatever you want.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:59.120]  But same, you know, Prince and David Bowie, they went on, married women, had a bunch of
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:00.240]  children, lived great.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:04.040]  And they weren't trying to push it on kids and trying to confuse six year olds.
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:07.520]  And that's the thing is I'm libertarian, like do whatever the heck you want.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.240]  I'll call you whatever pronoun you want, but it doesn't mean you have to require federally
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:18.760]  mandate that the majority of humans have to suppress their understanding of reality.
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.120]  You know, I'll be respectful, but we also need to give people some other information
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.400]  that's out there for them, that they don't want them to see.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.160]  Like 94% of people, children will not remain gender dysphoric.
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:35.400]  You grow out of it, especially if you get the proper help and not the encouragement.
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:38.520]  That's bigoted, you grow out of it and decide to be a male or female.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.520]  You know, there's male and female squirrels too, male and female dolphins, male and female
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:44.520]  eagles.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.520]  They're bigoted.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.000]  Why aren't there like separate bathrooms for transgendered bald eagles?
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.640]  Well, and you know what?
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:55.120]  Some little girls, you want to go out and fight with the boys and get dirty and stuff.
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  But that's part of femininity.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.120]  It's just like...
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  Oh, she's a tomboy.
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:03:59.880]  It doesn't mean you're a boy.
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:05.320]  My oldest daughter loves to play army, loves to shoot guns, beat me up.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:06.320]  You name it.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:09.200]  But she also loves lipstick and girly stuff.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:10.200]  Yeah.
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:13.320]  They're like, oh, you're really a man, you know, no, she's not.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.320]  She's a woman.
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.160]  The women I have better be tough.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.160]  Exactly.
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:18.160]  That's not, that's feminine.
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:22.680]  Since when is it male that a woman likes to go camping or a woman likes to go fishing?
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:23.920]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:24.920]  Right.
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:25.920]  That's feminine.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:26.920]  Right.
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.240]  And I think that's what a lot of parents want to fight back.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:33.640]  You know, why are all the little toy vacuums and brooms and stuff in the girls section?
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.840]  Like that's, you know, there's a little...
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:37.320]  By the way, though, my youngest daughter is a girly girl.
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:38.320]  She's a girly girl.
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:39.320]  It's really cute.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:44.560]  So little boys like to cook also, you know, maybe they want a little Betty Crocker thing
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:45.560]  in the...
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:46.560]  Well, my dad's just going to cook.
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.560]  I'm a great cook.
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:48.560]  What are you talking about?
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.560]  Well, there you go.
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:52.840]  The point is, mama would do in the cooking, usually, because daddy was out, you know,
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:53.840]  in the coal mine.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:54.840]  Right.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.840]  She wanted to be back doing the cooking.
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.840]  And here it's out on the coal mine.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.840]  Thank you, Leanne.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:04:59.840]  Reports tonight.
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:00.840]  Great job.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.560]  Operators zapped off in kitchens across Venezuela as the government turned off the electricity
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:11.000]  supply to help ease the power outage that is worsening the country's economic crisis.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  Reports.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  Yahoo News.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.680]  It is the latest drastic measure by the government in a crisis that has already seen Venezuelans
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:21.520]  waiting for hours to buy scarce supplies and shops.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:25.560]  Machines for processing bank card payments also wouldn't work without power, meaning
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.800]  that some left stores without buying anything.
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:32.320]  President Nicolas Maduro's government blames the power outage on weather.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:37.400]  Critics, however, say it is the result of economic mismanagement and inefficient running
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:38.920]  of the energy network.
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:43.760]  Venezuela's economy has plunged along with the price of the oil it relies on for foreign
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:44.760]  revenues.
[02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:49.520]  Citizens are suffering shortages of medicines and goods such as toilet paper and cooking
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:50.520]  oil.
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.800]  Maduro blames the collapse on an economic war by capitalists.

[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:12.080]  and potent forms of oregano oil on the market, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:16.720]  key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:22.080]  promote health, sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:27.920]  of bioactive ingredients, extracted directly from the wild herb, and sealed in easy to

[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:37.840]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:42.600]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:46.080]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:51.360]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano,
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:08:20.600]  now available at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.520]  Now we're going to cover the big primary coming up tonight, election 2016, a lot of other
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.840]  news with Gerald Salente in the shower.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:31.040]  Devonon will be hosting the fourth hour, there will be live coverage tonight, seven until
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:34.640]  probably nine or ten, and when the results come in on these key states, I'll be breaking
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.040]  that down in a moment.
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:40.080]  Joe Biggs is running around the office, he's up with goosebumps, he showed me, he actually
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:45.120]  has them, because he served a lot of tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, got shot and blown
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:51.000]  up repeatedly in armored vehicles, so he's in a combat group, saw a lot of fighting,
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.840]  and he is freaking out over this Italian magazine article and other things, dealing
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:59.080]  with Mexico and ISIS down there, which we know is down there, we know they're bringing
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.120]  them into Europe, they're bringing them in here, and Biggs is going to pop in at the
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:06.680]  bottom of the hour, and then he'll be on with David Knight for probably 10, 15 minutes
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:10.960]  in the fourth hour, because Biggs has been down there to the very area investigating
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.240]  this and found Mosque and all sorts of other stuff, and the FBI came and questioned Biggs
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:19.400]  and said, yeah, we don't even go into that area, but we think what the intel that you
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:23.240]  and judicial watch has is very serious.
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:28.880]  Now again, there is radical Islam, why is our government opening up Europe and the U.S.
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:31.600]  to bring these people in?
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:36.240]  It's crazy, so we'll pop in with a report on that as we get it all codified and ready,
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:41.720]  but it's red linked up on Drudge, we've also added the article to infowars.com.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:47.040]  Also coming up, Obama's global warming plan cost poor Americans $44 billion and raised
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:56.080]  taxes by 166 percent, so we're going to be going over all of that as well, but I know,
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:01.000]  I'm just guessing, and I know he's an honest guy, so he'll tell me if I'm wrong, if I'm
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.720]  wrong, he'll correct me, I bet money that Gerald Solyntek, because this guy reads like
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:10.680]  15 newspapers a day, hundreds of news articles online, my crew's been up there a few times,
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:13.440]  they say it's always constantly doing his research, and which is great, I try to do
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:20.320]  that too, but I bet he wants to talk about 16 times Obama said there would be no boots
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:25.440]  on the ground in Syria, we have 16 times he said it, only played four of them earlier,
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:29.960]  because I'm not going to play 16, and now they've had the head of the Defense Department
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:36.480]  spokesperson via the State Department come out and say it was never said and laugh at
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:42.520]  the media, that's worse than Gibbs saying there is no drone program years and years
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:49.960]  after it was public and in the news, that's like saying the Chicago Bears aren't out of
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:11:00.480]  Chicago, it's that, or Superman isn't fictionally from Krypton, or Batman isn't from Gotham,
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.760]  I use child like analogies because this is ridiculous, in fact we should get the clip
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:11.000]  of Gibbs saying, you know I was told to say that there weren't any drones, even though
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.640]  this is an admitted program, that's Toto pulling back the curtain and take that clip with Toto,
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:20.200]  and they cut it in to Obama saying there's no boots on the ground ever, I pledge, and
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:23.480]  then cut into the State Department saying it never happened and the Pentagon saying
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:29.240]  it, and then I come out and talk about Beyonce and the Super Bowl and our new video and MTV
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:34.560]  admittedly having the CIA, that's been declassified for years, with their anti-family pro-riot
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:40.880]  message, but also the Ford Foundation, I show people the articles and they've had tons of
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:48.640]  publications, Esquire, New York Daily News come out and say I'm insane, it's a lie.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.560]  What is the tactic here with the ball face lying, like saying there are no death panels
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:59.600]  in Obamacare or it's free, or raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit, or
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:04.720]  no one's coming after your guns, Bloomberg says, I believe in the Second Amendment,
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.960]  I'm a big gun supporter, he has 15 bodyguards on average, we have all these videos, he has
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:19.480]  guns, he wants total gun bans, like Chicago and D.C., but he doesn't want your guns.
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.800]  Is it arrogance, is it delusion, is it disdain, are they trying to condition us to accept
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.800]  it because they had a Gallup poll and another poll the last two weeks and both of them showed
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:35.320]  6%, we can pull them up, trust in the mainstream media.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:40.120]  We've got actuaries and I've admitted it, that's how the internet works, we've got it
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:44.120]  all turned off, we don't track everybody but we can see the big actuaries from Google,
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:50.120]  we have like a 91% approval rating online, we have people absolutely trust us and love
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.840]  us and it's such a confidence people have in us that I get mad at myself when I listen
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.720]  to rebroadcasts, making little mistakes or I could have said something better or get
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:06.360]  the name wrong, but people know, I'm really trying to tell you the truth and we are decades
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:10.640]  usually ahead of everybody else, just like Gerald Salente, that's why he's the best selling
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:15.200]  author, that's why he's successful because people are looking for the truth, not arrogance,
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:21.320]  I'm not, I'm so smart, I know it all, but man, the minute I saw on the sheet this morning
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:27.280]  they had a clip of the State Department yesterday saying that Obama never said that there wouldn't
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.440]  be boots on the ground, never pledged there wouldn't be, I just sat back and I went, there's
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:36.640]  clips of him saying that, we already have it 16 times, but in case you're a new listener,
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.560]  you don't believe me because I'm the conspiracy person, I question mainstream media that's
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:45.240]  a known liars, even USA Today had to admit it, 16 times Obama said there would be no
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:50.400]  boots on the ground in Syria, now I'm speculating here, I usually go off facts, Gerald am I
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:53.840]  wrong because I never talked to you before you come on the show or very rarely, we don't
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:58.560]  tell you what the subjects are, I always just respect the fact that you are out there looking
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:02.280]  at really important stuff, I ask questions, you bring up topics, were you going to bring
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:05.080]  this up today or is my instinct wrong?
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:10.560]  Well actually, we do trends in the news each weekday night, part of the subscription to
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:17.080]  the Trends Journal and that was our broadcast last night with Obama pledging no boots on
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:22.760]  the ground and it's the same thing with Iraq, no boots on the ground, we're going to save
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:26.560]  them Yazidis up in the mountains, you remember that one?
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:34.840]  And he's lied about everything, he's a traitor to this country, a real disgrace and by their
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:41.160]  deed you shall know them, hey folks, the first day he was in office, I'm going to close
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:48.360]  Guantanamo by the end of the year, oh, remember he was just over there in Europe, championing
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:55.880]  more war, the last time he went as candidate Obama to Germany, there were hundreds of thousands
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:01.880]  of people out there, cheering him on, he was going to be the man of peace, even won the
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:09.200]  peace prize, we should call the peace prize a piece of crap, he goes on to invade Libya,
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:18.920]  was Syria, Assad has to go, on and on, a troop increase of what, 33,000 in Afghanistan, again
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:22.960]  more troops back into Iraq, he's lied about everything that he's done.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.200]  I agree, but here's my question, because you worked as a top lobbyist, you've worked the
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:30.120]  biggest corporations before you just broke off and became a journalist what, 25, 30 years
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:37.760]  ago, Gerald Salente, TrendsResearch.com, Trends Journal, why are they lying more, clearly
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:41.880]  they're lying more, right, and it's more brazen, more naked, and then their credibility's
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:47.360]  gone from like 15% to 6%, I mean, do they understand that they have the credibility
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:54.280]  of a rotting dead dog that they're telling us is a delicious, fresh Christmas turkey?
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:16:00.720]  Well, again, go back to what you were saying about the media, it's a 6% rating among the
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:07.320]  people, you know, they rated the worst job being a reporter for their newspaper, so there
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:13.280]  is no press anymore, every time you go on to these shows, you see them all, whether
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:21.040]  it's Fox, CNN, ABC, CBS, it's the same paid flunkies, that's all they are, they're paid
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:28.560]  prostitutes coming out as, quote, experts, they're on the payroll, so it's one club,
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:35.000]  and yes, the lying has never been at this level, no one ever calls them out, and when
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:41.520]  they do call them out, it's only for a very short amount of time, so no, it's never been
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:49.760]  like this, you could never get away with the amount of lies that Obama has said, that it's
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:57.320]  unprecedented, and again, his believers continue to defend him.
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:03.520]  Well, I tell you, Gerald, a lot of this is comical, but a lot of it's also very, very
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:11.000]  sad, like they've had, as I mentioned earlier, scores of big media outlets come out and say
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.240]  that I'm lying about the CIA being involved in domestic media, when as you know, three
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.400]  years ago, as part of a PSIOP, it was all over the news that they, quote, will even
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:23.960]  lie to us for our own good, they use the word deception, and they're going to work with
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:29.920]  local media, and of course they're working with the NFL, and MTV's the worst, they admittedly
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:35.000]  get money, Beyonce is on record hooked into all these combines, and then they have the
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.360]  nerve to act like I'm crazy to say there's a CIA connection to the media.
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:45.440]  Well, look, the CIA has been connected to the media since the beginning of the CIA,
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:51.960]  it's a fact, they go after people like you and me, because we're telling the truth and
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:59.600]  exposing their lives, so they take cheap shots and will do anything to destroy anyone pointing
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:05.560]  out what lawyers, hypocrites, sociopaths, and psychopaths they are, and those who they
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.560]  are defending.
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.160]  Cheryl, what point have we gotten to with their credibility, I mean, what happens when
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:17.240]  it goes to 1% or 0.5 or something, I mean, this huge rotting facade is blowing in the
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:23.120]  wind like a rotten barn, how does it fall, does it fall, or do these crazies have a nuclear
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:28.160]  war and put out a press release when everybody's dead to themselves in a bunker that no war
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:29.160]  happened?
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:32.760]  Well, I don't think they'd want to put out a nuclear war, but they have crazy people
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:34.160]  that will certainly start one.
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:35.160]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:36.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.760]  You know what I mean, when they put out delusions like this, historically it will infect their
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:43.240]  own brains and they'll think they can do anything.
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:49.240]  Exactly, and look, it's the language that they use, they use the language of hate.
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:56.240]  How many times have we heard from the New York Times, CNN, that Russia invaded Ukraine?
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:18:58.000]  They put it right there.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  Russia never invaded.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:04.160]  Russia invaded Georgia, or Russia invaded Syria, all horse crap.
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:09.080]  Exactly, so again, and then you look at the connections, I mean, who's that little boy
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.880]  they got on ABC, Stephanopoulos, yeah, Stefan this, who was he with?
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.680]  He was the flunky for Clinton.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:23.080]  Who was that guy, Connie, before Obama's spokesperson, Connie, carnival man?
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:26.240]  Oh yeah, another flunky with time magazine.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:28.120]  Look who's married to whom?
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.120]  Look at the connections between them.
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:36.640]  There is no free press, there's no free press, just like there's no free United States.
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:44.440]  I hear Obama going down to Cuba, shooting his mouth off about freedom and democracy,
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:49.640]  and now they have to have it over there while they're arresting everybody protesting down
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:51.640]  in Washington, DC.
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:53.400]  Oh, you want to protest?
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.840]  We'll give you a free protest zone.
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:20:03.280]  Oh yeah, by the way, and we'll exclude people from that zone that we don't want.
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:07.880]  Wait till you see the carnival show of the president.
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:13.080]  And the whole leftist movement now, all over the place says we want safe spaces everywhere
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:16.680]  where no one who's a libertarian or someone we disagree with is even allowed to be on
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:17.680]  the street.
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:21.200]  They'll come over and attack you, and the police have been ordered to let them do it,
[02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:26.280]  and the faculty at colleges will even help attack their own students that dare have their
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:31.840]  own private meeting that was authorized in the commons area for Donald Trump.
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:36.480]  And they show up and beat them up, and the school says good job, beating people up is
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:37.480]  good.
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:39.360]  I mean, this is sick authoritarianism.
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:40.360]  Well, exactly.
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:46.680]  I was going to say, wait till you see the, when they have the, the, the, the, uh, conventions.
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:50.640]  Yeah, you're going to see people roped off miles away.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:56.040]  They're not going to let anybody get anywhere, except the people they want to get through.
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:59.920]  And they'll let them through, just like what happened when over there in Chicago.
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:02.960]  The RNC will not release my crew, five or six hotel rooms.
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.960]  I'm having to do other stuff.
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:06.800]  They just say, no, we have all the hotels in Cleveland, you have to go through us.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.800]  No, you can't have it.
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:09.680]  And no, we're not giving you press passes.
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:12.880]  Even though when I was only on like 30 radio stations, I could always get them.
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:15.280]  They're now going, no, you don't get to go in.
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:17.400]  We'll let anybody else in, but not Alex Jones.
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:20.640]  And they're trying to ban Roger Stone from the events because he's kind of like the
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:22.040]  shadow campaign manager.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.760]  Let's just admit it.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:27.320]  The shadow campaign manager, the former head of Trump's campaign, they're talking about
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:33.120]  trying to not let him in or banning him from Cleveland or having him arrested, Gerald.
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:35.080]  And that's, that's what I'm saying.
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:36.080]  There is no freedom.
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:38.640]  So there's no freedom of press.
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:40.320]  The elections are rigged.
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:41.320]  This is it.
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:42.320]  This isn't a democracy.
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:43.320]  It's a democracy.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:45.520]  How can anybody call it free?
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:48.000]  Look at the gangs we got running the show.
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  Idiocracy.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  Yeah.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  All right.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.880]  Here are some questions you went off on a beautiful Jag there, better rant than I could
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:54.880]  do.
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:57.880]  What is front and center on the radar of the great Gerald Salente today?
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:00.160]  I mean, what are the trends?
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.160]  What's the big news?
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:02.160]  What's the next shooter drop?
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:06.760]  Well, well, the one is, you know, people should listen to what Soros said last week
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:08.720]  about China.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:13.560]  And he's concerned about the Chinese economy going to crash.
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:20.680]  And again, you get the prostitutes on CNBC, MSNBC, Bloomberg, and again, these are all
[02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:26.080]  paid people for by and large that they have on there as experts.
[02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:27.920]  And they're saying, no, it's not that bad.
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:29.440]  They just came out.
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:35.240]  China has a debt to GDP ratio now of about 250 percent.
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:40.280]  The only reason the Chinese economy is growing at all is they're putting in unprecedented
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:44.400]  amounts of stimulus through bank loans.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:49.200]  So on the economic front, you take a look over at Europe, even with negative interest
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:50.200]  rates.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:56.280]  You're looking at the European Central Bank buying back 80 billion euros.
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:57.280]  Gerald, hold on.
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:00.480]  Before you go to the laundry list of why we're in trouble that you've predicted accurately
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:04.640]  and others have, it's pretty much now admitted that we're going down the tubes, that QE failed,
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:08.400]  so they're going to go even further to negative rates.
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:14.040]  Specifically though, where are we just in general in your view worldwide?
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:18.120]  A depression most areas, recessions in the West?
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:19.920]  It's a global recession.
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:25.600]  You have to look at the countries, whether it's Venezuela, which we were playing a clip
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:33.520]  on earlier, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Nigeria, the largest countries in Africa,
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:39.200]  the 11th largest oil exporter in the world.
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:40.200]  They need money.
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:43.280]  Angola has extend.
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:45.360]  You name the country.
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:52.200]  Every country that's commodity rich is becoming poor as commodity prices continue.
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:54.760]  Saudi Arabia is having to borrow money.
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:24:00.520]  Saudi Arabia just borrowed $10 billion and it's their first borrowing since 1991.
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:04.960]  They need oil at $100 a barrel to break even.
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:07.800]  It's floating around the 40s mark.
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:12.280]  So you're looking and then going back to saying what's going to happen.
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:20.920]  You just saw Obama go over to Europe, preach war, and talk about globalization.
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:23.720]  So they know the problems are there.
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:32.120]  And by the way, one thing missing to me in America is that real strong third party movement
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:35.160]  that you're seeing around the world.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:40.280]  They just had a referendum in the Netherlands.
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:46.400]  And by the way, the referendum happened because of a satirical group that got enough people
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:54.200]  signed on to put a referendum out, not to allow Ukraine into the European Union.
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:56.800]  The people voted.
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:01.000]  You're seeing what's going on in Europe with Obama going over there.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:08.360]  The people want to break out of the Eurozone from the UK, the Brexit.
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:13.280]  They're very concerned about this because it's a breakup of globalization.
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.560]  And the globalist, as you know, correct me if I'm wrong, they always thought they would
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:20.920]  have managed crises they used to bring in total world government between the three power
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:21.920]  blocks.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:25.840]  But it appears from my research, it's not going as they thought, and that their whole
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.400]  world government new World Order project is now in deep trouble and is being fundamentally
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:38.160]  broken, not just financially, but the minds of the people, because worldwide, the left,
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:41.440]  the right, you name it, whether it's the Liberal Mayor of London, very prominent, or whether
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:46.360]  it's right-wing groups like UKIP, it's becoming very popular to be anti-New World Order.
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:52.320]  And my worldview, your worldview, very similar to each other, are being proven, the conspiracy
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:56.360]  theory worldview, as the new cosmology, because it's really the reality.
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:01.520]  Doesn't mean we have all the answers, but truly, this populist, anti-New World Order,
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:08.480]  anti-corporate fascism movement is now transcending their lives, offering a new narrative much
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:10.000]  closer to reality.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.240]  I think the New World Order project is in deep, you know what, Gerald, is that an accurate
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:16.040]  statement or tell me what you think?
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:18.360]  Well, because it's go by the facts.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:19.360]  Of course it's accurate.
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.880]  Look what happened last week over in Austria.
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.360]  You had, again, a new party coming in, and now it looks like they're going to be gaining
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:29.360]  power.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.720]  And that's where, again, this is what's missing in America.
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:37.440]  Go take a look at what happened also in German elections, just a week ago, the new party
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:38.440]  coming in.
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.600]  Supernationalist right-wing groups coming in Austria, absolutely.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.560]  Well, they call them right-wing.
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:44.240]  That's the thing that really gets me.
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:45.240]  No, no, no, I mean, I agree.
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:47.240]  They call libertarian nationalist right-wing.
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:48.240]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:49.240]  I mean, they're not.
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:53.440]  They're trying to arrest Lepin, she's like, hey, libertarian, sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:59.560]  Yeah, but that's so, anyway, they had a big election in Austria, and I think the term is
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:02.760]  more accurate, populist and nationalist.
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:05.800]  The people want to maintain their own culture.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:08.120]  What is wrong with that?
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:12.560]  Who are we to say that, no, Austria should take in more refugees?
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:18.640]  Oh, and by the way, Alex, no one, none of these hypocrites out there shooting off their
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.840]  mouths are talking about how the refugee crisis started.
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:29.080]  Oh, it couldn't be because of Hitler's bombing of Gaddafi has to go.
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:35.000]  And of course, when Gaddafi was in, there were no migrants or refugees flooding in the
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  building.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.520]  He said you're going to get flooded attacking me, and then they blew up Syria and use it
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:41.920]  as a conduit on purpose to bring in the migrants.
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.000]  So let me ask you this question.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.880]  Why would the bizarre globalist lefts, they're not really leftists, they're globalist, Merkel,
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:51.320]  Milan, all of them want to bring in four or five million people they know are military
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:53.800]  aged men, most of them who they know will attack.
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:57.320]  I guess they attack them in the clear civil emergency and take people's free speech.
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:59.960]  I mean, what is, what is the elite thinking?
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:02.840]  Why would you want people from the worst third world countries?
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:08.960]  Again, it's out of control to the level is what I'm trying to say that they've destroyed
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:09.960]  a rock.
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:12.120]  They've killed over a million people.
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:17.720]  You look at every data of floods of refugees getting out of there, floods of refugees leaving
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:24.360]  Afghanistan, floods of refugees from the bombings, leaving Syria and Libya.
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:30.080]  The point that I'm making and going back to what you were saying, but about the populist
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:37.600]  movements, this is going, it's going to backfire because you're seeing the elections in Germany.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:40.600]  They just happened, which goes to what you said.
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:44.600]  The white shoe boys aren't as smart as they think exactly.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:56.120]  It's anti-European zone, an anti-European group, an anti-migrant and refugee and pro-nationality.
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:29:02.320]  And you've got a guy like Obama's going to Italy, to all these other countries and saying,
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:06.600]  no, no, you cannot hang on to your identity.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.920]  You have no right to claim your nationality.
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:16.360]  Your heritage and your ancestral roots don't count.
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.400]  We want you to be a nothing blended country.
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.680]  We'll tell you what to do.
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:24.760]  We're going to pass these laws.
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:26.520]  We're multinationals.
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:29.760]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership rules you.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.720]  Their arrogance blinds them.
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:36.920]  Well, Gerald Salente is our guest trends research journal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:38.240]  Find it at trendsresearch.com.
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:40.000]  That's trendsresearch.com.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  We're going to come back and dive into financial trends, gold, silver, Bitcoin, the election
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.160]  and other key points that he's going to raise.
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:53.960]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:30:00.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:06.560]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:09.120]  less and less transparent.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.040]  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's
[02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:14.040]  the conflict here.
[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:17.920]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily
[02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:20.440]  matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:22.640]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:26.440]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:29.840]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general
[02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:30.840]  public.
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:34.240]  And I'm really am asking you, it's more than a process question.
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:38.800]  It's an integrity of the election question and everybody's asking me this question.
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:41.000]  So I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.640]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hard-core Donald Trump supporters.
[02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:50.760]  Why do you do this every single time I have, no, you got to stop every time I have you
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:51.760]  on the air.
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:58.280]  Join Info Wars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7 p.m. as we cover the primaries
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:27.280]  in the Northeast.

[02:31:50.640 --> 02:32:18.400]  the
[02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:22.240]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:26.600]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:30.040]  with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity

[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:33.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:38.400]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of top newspapers and magazines have come out
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:41.520]  and said, I'm crazy. The CIA doesn't work with Hollywood or the media or the music
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:45.560]  industry. It's all declassified and invented, but hey, they just say I'm a liar.
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:50.720]  And as you hear, Obama never said, never pledged or boots to the ground in Syria. He said
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:56.600]  it 16 times on video. Should I play the video of him saying it and then play them saying
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:01.880]  he never said it? In fact, you know what? Fine, I'm a conspiracy theorist. You're right.
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:05.960]  I'll bet you all the chicken, fried steak and beer you can eat and drink that these
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:09.080]  people think you're idiots. I don't think you're an idiot and I'm not going to lie
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:13.120]  to you. I want to live in a country that's open and free. Joe Biggs is popping in with
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:16.880]  this. He's going to do a detailed report in the fourth hour with David Knight. But I
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.600]  want to drill Salente to hear this so he can talk about it. We'll go to Joe here in just
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:27.040]  a moment. First off, you need to sign up for the InfoWars Insider to get exclusive video

[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:43.240]  This is just for folks because I never got into email years ago. I never used it, never
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:47.000]  had, but now as they censor us more and more on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, it's
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.840]  bad. We need to be able to email directly to you. It's one of the hardest things to
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:55.480]  censor. Everybody needs to go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and just put your
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:01.160]  email in or create one that's just for us so you can stay in contact infowars.com forward

[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.360]  but better. Or whether you're the nutraceuticals, infowars, store.com, a lot of products you
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:25.240]  want to sign up for auto ship, 10% off and free shipping on orders of $50 or more. Our
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:29.800]  great secret 12 organic vitamin B12 that you absorb under the tongue. There's a lot of
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.640]  gut flora problems as even the New York Times admitted last week. People aren't absorbing
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:37.640]  it. That's what's causing a lot of neurological problems. You need vitamin B12 and this isn't
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:45.720]  as good as injecting it, but it's close. It's just got rave reviews, 4.7 stars by third
[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:51.160]  party major sites. It is over the top. It is back in secret 12. Supermelt vitality will
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:54.800]  sell out. It will be a few weeks until we get more of it in. That of course is our flagship
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:59.600]  product. It's so amazing. X2, Nation Iodine is excellent as well. And this special will
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:05.800]  end soon. Infowars selects storeable foods. It's the best storeable foods, most transportable,
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:09.680]  highest quality for the lowest price you're going to find until you get into a lot of
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:13.720]  crap that's out there. But it is the lowest price for what I would call a really good
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:17.560]  quality. It's what I have for my family. It's what I'm putting here at the office in case
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:21.880]  things really go south. We're talking to Gerald about how bad this global meltdown will get,
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:25.320]  why the elites are getting armored with doubts and digging in. The point is, if you don't
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:29.240]  get storeable food, I think you're crazy. And we have really high quality food at very
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:33.560]  affordable prices normally. It's very competitive. But with this special, we do twice a year.
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:43.520]  It's unprecedented. Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsselect.com, 30 to 40% off. Now I'm going to go to Gerald
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:48.040]  here and he'll be with us until the end of the hour. And then of course this gentleman
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:54.960]  to my right, Joe Beggs, will be popping in for 20 minutes in the fourth hour with David
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:59.080]  Knight to really flesh this out. But to brief Gerald Salente on this, I know he's always
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:02.520]  informed of anything I raise because he's such a news hound. I mean, I'm not kissing
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:06.520]  his butt. It's just he's probably the most informed guy I know when it comes to hundreds
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:11.080]  and hundreds of stories, you know, factoids. I throw at him each little factoid and he
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:17.240]  has the rest of the answer. But Judicial Watch came out. We'll put it on screen in April
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:22.720]  of 2015 over a year ago and said, we have credible intel. There's a mosque and ISIS
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:27.160]  being brought in in the Mexico border. Well, we know it's happening. The head of Southcom
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:30.560]  came out and said, yes, it's true. They're bringing them in. That's the head of Southcom,
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:35.080]  the admiral. And Joe Beggs went down there on the FBI and he was getting on an airplane
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:37.800]  and El Paso came and met with him and said, we can't believe he went down there. That's
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:42.080]  super dangerous. We believe what you're saying is Judicial Watch is investigating is accurate.
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:47.040]  Well, now we have a bombshell from Judicial Watch. Cartels helped terrorists in Mexico
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:54.640]  get to U.S. to explore targets, ISIS militant, among them. Now, Joe, who's been blown up
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:58.760]  twice in armored vehicles and hit by shrapnel and he was embedded with media. So it's been
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.160]  written about an Esquire and Rolling Stone, you name it. He said he gets chills, kind
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:08.040]  of like, you know, the sword sting when it gets around goblins or orcs. When he was reading
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:12.080]  this. So just spend a few minutes on why you're concerned, then you're going to be back in
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:16.920]  the next hour to flesh this out and to play some of the reports you shot. This is new
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:23.520]  dovetailing with what your sources were saying over a year ago. So important work we're doing
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:26.960]  with Judicial Watch and others, Joe Bix. Yeah. So Josh Jones and I went down there into
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:33.000]  investigate these claims by Judicial Watch. We went to El Paso and actually showed these
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.160]  open borders. We filmed numerous reports showing how easy it is to come from, you know, an
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:43.840]  opera virus into El Paso and carry out an attack. And then I found a local and actually
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.080]  went into an opera and did some investigating, found some moss. Now there's some very interesting
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:55.880]  stuff in these articles saying that it's easy for these radical Islamic jihadists to basically
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:01.520]  to, I don't know, radicalize the Catholics that are in that area because it's a cartel
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.840]  run area. They speak money, they speak blood and that's what they understand. And now they're
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.160]  saying that there's this man who's been living there in an opera for over a year now. And
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:15.280]  this is his exact quote, the border that separates Mexico from the U.S. is so full of free zones
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:19.240]  that I could come in with a group of men in a few hours and kill thousands of people in
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:24.520]  Texas and Arizona. And that's what gave me goosebumps earlier. I've been pacing back
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:29.240]  and forth through the office because this further confirms our reports and what Judicial
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:34.280]  Watch said. And when I actually met with the FBI, the guy said that he finds us and Judicial
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:39.160]  Watch as a credible source. The fact that we went down there and itself was is well,
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:41.960]  they couldn't tell us the classified stuff, but they just said what you're reporting on
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:46.120]  is credible. Yeah. So not just that we're, now here's the issue. They're bringing in
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:50.080]  the radical jihadists. It's synthetic. They're letting them in to take our liberties at the
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:55.480]  highest levels while different agencies actually try to fight this. The question is why is
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:00.360]  our government so arrogant to let this happen while groping us at the TSA and spying on
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.720]  his quote for our own good. You'll be breaking it down more in the fourth hour. Thank you,
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.240]  Joe Biggs. Thank you. I want to get now, Gerald Salente's take on that. See if Gerald
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:12.480]  has any questions for you. Sorry to cut into your time, Gerald, but I thought you'd want
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:17.560]  to hear about this and give us your take on it. Well, you know, again, look, look at this,
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:24.440]  the border issue over the years. What do we have? 50,000 kids flooding over and anybody
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:33.000]  could come over. And like you made the point, but they feel us up at the TSA. You got Homeland
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:40.480]  Security on the trains everywhere that you go. They listen to every word that we speak.
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:45.840]  They hack into everything that we do under the guise that they're going to protect us
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:52.200]  and the borders are wide open. You know, the whole thing is a sham. And again, are they
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:58.880]  going to attack in America? It's a question of, will it be a false flag or real? And again,
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:05.040]  no one's asking the question, by the way, how do you create these radical incidents?
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:13.640]  Who created? There was no ISIS before Afghanistan or Iraq. There were no radical geodists other
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:19.000]  than when Jimmy Carter. You remember that one? Oh, yeah. What were they called then?
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:27.520]  Oh, the Mujahideen. That's right. Oh, Ben Laden. We got to stop them Russians up in Afghanistan.
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:34.640]  Don't forget this under Reagan as well. And then, of course, the bombing of Yugoslavia.
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:41.640]  Bill Clinton's continuing bombing of Iraq. Do you remember the sanctions he put on Iraq?
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:47.360]  500,000 Iraqi children dead under the age of five. And they asked Madeleine all bright
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:55.680]  or not all that bright. The Secretary of State on CBS was the death of 500,000 Iraqi children
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:02.000]  under the age of five, worth the price of the sanctions. Yes, it was. So now we're destroying
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:08.840]  the entire Middle East, as I mentioned, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan or Iraq. Now bombs away
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:15.520]  in Somalia. Let's go to Sudan. How about Mali? Now you're a young guy. Everybody you
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:25.400]  love is dead. Your country is destroyed. You think you're going to buy into radicalism?
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:28.080]  So what are the elites thinking? What's the master plan?
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:35.680]  They're morons. Why can't we call them what they are? Psychopathic losers. Look at what
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:41.560]  they do. Look how they shoot their mouths off with arrogance. I have to read to you
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:48.800]  one of the most disgusting lines I've heard from Obama. Eh, probably within the last week.
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:56.760]  Because I could go way back. This is when he's over in the UK. Quote, now he's pushing
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:03.560]  for the remain with the Brexit rather than leave to remain. Quote, I will say with the
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:10.640]  candor of a friend, when has he ever said anything with candor? But I'll continue. That the outcome
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:16.960]  of your decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States. Hey, everyone listening
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:24.040]  out there, don't you know that whether or not the UK stays into the Eurozone, it's of
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:30.560]  deep interest to us as you can't drink the water in Flint. Don't go up to Hoosick Falls
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:35.600]  in New York. You're not going to like that water either. Stay away from the school water
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:44.200]  in Newark. I could go on. But let me continue. This is where it's disgusting. This is where
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:54.160]  he plays the World War II card of the men that gave their lives to sell multinationalism.
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:44:02.400]  The tens of thousands of Americans who rest in Europe's cemeteries are a silent testament
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:11.160]  to just how intertwined our prosperity and security truly are. And the path you choose
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:20.880]  now will echo in the prospects of today's generations of Americans as well. Could you
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:28.960]  imagine him saying those words? The men that thought I have my cousin, my mother's cousin
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:36.120]  may rest in peace. Joe Lombardi came back with partial face left after World War II.
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:41.480]  I used to hear the World War II stories of who died, who came back crippled, and this
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:49.320]  clown of a man uses World War II to sell globalism. And where are the prostitutes calling them
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:53.920]  out? That's why they go after you. By the way, by the way, Gerald's great point. The
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:59.720]  EU was a Nazi project. That's BBC reporting on that. That's public since the end of World
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:05.040]  War II. I think it's worse. Bill Nye, the science guy, says, yeah, go ahead and arrest
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:10.480]  climate change deniers, manmade climate change deniers, because, you know, we arrested Enron.
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:17.040]  Enron came up with the carbon tax scam. So they're saying, you know, don't let the Nazis
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:22.200]  get us, have a euro. One of the Nazi projects. Sorry, go ahead. But anyway, this is what's
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:29.000]  going on and going back to why do they hate us? How about if we stayed home and fixed
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:36.040]  our own country? Everything they do turns to failure. We're in Afghanistan now, the
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:42.720]  longest war in American history by years. And they keep coming up. We got a new plan.
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:49.400]  Oh, and now they're going to a new plan to get rid of ISIS. We got a new plan on how
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:56.600]  to save Libya after we destroyed it. Hey, I got a new plan to fix Iraq. Oh, boots on
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:03.600]  the ground, as you were talking about in Syria, we got a new plan that $500 million of money
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:09.480]  that we took from you, the working little people of America and gave it to their moderate
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:15.160]  rebels. And we've never seen what a moderate rebel looks like. And they lose the armaments.
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.120]  They go over to the people we're supposed to be fighting. And not only that, the moderate
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:26.840]  rebels joined for us. What I'm saying, Alex, you've got a bunch of losers running the show.
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:31.040]  I agree. Who think they know how to run things? In the past, we had corrupt globalists in
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:34.280]  some areas of control, but they knew what they were doing to a certain extent. We now
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:39.960]  have delusional people with a bunch of titles who think they're invincible. So where is
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:45.040]  it all going? What's going to happen? Why are the elites digging in, getting stored
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:50.680]  food, buying weapons, running off to New Zealand? That's even in mainstream news now. Why are
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:54.960]  they all now starting to leave the sinking ship? Well, they see what's going on. I mentioned
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:47:01.600]  earlier about China. You look at the outflows of money flowing out of China, and it's unprecedented.
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:06.720]  They're buying up the world. If they just made a deal in Australia, they'd buy a 1% of
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:13.280]  the land that they're going to own with this company that they went into. So the elites
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:19.120]  are running from their countries, trying to find another country that's a safe haven.
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:24.720]  By the way, you mentioned Chevron with the carbon tax. Yeah, that was a Bill Clinton
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:31.200]  one, folks. Yeah, Al Gore and Bill Clinton to enrich the stock markets. Yeah, let's trade
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:38.120]  carbon taxes. So they're leaving because they see what's going on. And again, just look
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:43.240]  at the numbers. Whether you go to England and you look at the top end of the real estate
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:49.760]  market down, take a trip, go over to Miami, the top end of the real estate market down
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:58.480]  over 20, 30%, go to New York, the top end of the luxury market down, the fish rods from
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:05.640]  the head down. The tops of the markets now are starting to collapse in real estate. Look
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:13.400]  at today's numbers that came out with durable goods allows a 0.8% and they downgraded February's
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:24.640]  from a minus 2.5 to a to a to a minus 3.7. Oh, and Obama says Obama says quote anyone
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:34.040]  saying the United States economy isn't strong is peddling fiction. Folks, look at the numbers.
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:39.600]  You talk about the numbers I go to your site. And by the way, everyone listening, all those
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:46.320]  products that you mentioned that are for sale on info wars dot com and the and the and the
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:53.080]  discounts that you give, put your money where your mouth is and where your mind is. Because
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:49:00.120]  as this thing goes down, the people that are going to survive and thrive are the ones that
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:06.080]  are going to be in the best shape physically, emotionally and spiritually. And that's something
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:10.560]  you've written about for 30 years, voting with our dollars supporting organizations
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:15.640]  in media that promote true freedom. That's one of our only votes we have left. And that's
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:19.080]  what the globalists are trying to get rid of. And that's what they're trying to ban local
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:25.800]  businesses and have regulations to shut down farmers markets and going after small farms.
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.440]  This is how you capture people. We're being caught on a reservation. And that was the
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:36.040]  point I was making with the vote that they had in the Netherlands. It was done a referendum
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:42.440]  by the people. When you look at the parties I talked about in the EU in in in Germany
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:47.600]  and Austria. This is Germany in Austria. This isn't you know, the Marshall Islands I'm
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:56.000]  talking about. They came up from the ground, their grassroots from organizations like yours
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:03.480]  that put out the word in a broad spectrum and like ours. So this is why we have to unite
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:11.120]  and support in a new way. Because any member that becomes the leader of the bloods and
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:18.000]  the crypts, which people like to call the Democrats and Republicans, nothing is going
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  to change.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:22.840]  Gerald, we're going to break. Gerald Solentes, our guest. But briefly, how did Merkel and
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:25.960]  Hollande and all of them think they'd get away with bringing in five million people
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:30.040]  that run around murdering people? And I mean, it just shows that they're mentally ill.
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:35.080]  Look at that stupid little clown. Hold on. Who could believe a guy like that for two
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:39.840]  seconds? You sat down in the bar and you saw him sitting next to you and he started talking
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:45.960]  to you and we want to talk to him. Like, but you see what they do? They got the red carpets.
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:52.120]  They got all those guys with the guns and the uniform. Everybody's saluting. They play
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:58.480]  it up. It's show business for ugly people. That's right. Gerald, stay there. Gerald's
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:01.280]  on fire on Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:06.920]  Are you concerned about the power grid? About the new war on the power grid? If so, this
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:11.880]  will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable. Here's
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:17.240]  why. An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just
[02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:22.720]  been written. Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:28.480]  for a limited time to GCN listeners. He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:33.840]  shipping and handling cost. Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he
[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:38.920]  will actually FedEx the book to you. Why do this? Why would he spend extra money and all
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:43.760]  that bother to FedEx his new book? The answer is simple. America's power grid is in grave
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:48.760]  danger and most Americans are clueless. Find out what's going on behind the scenes and
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:55.600]  why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life? Go to waronthegrid.com.

[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:32.680]  When our military said we don't want to back Al Qaeda in Syria, they just changed the name of
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:37.240]  Syria. I mean, changed the name to ISIS. That's how they try to confuse people. It's the games they
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:43.240]  play. It's really crazy. And I don't lionize our military and say it's perfect. It's not a lot of
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:48.040]  bad stuff, but the individuals in it are treated like crap when they get out, which shows you how
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:52.120]  evil this government is. And the same thing is happening all over the world because of high-tech
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:57.720]  media and the elites being separate from the people more than ever. They really are having their
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:02.760]  Marie Antoinette let them eat cake moments. Now, reportedly she didn't really say let them eat cake,
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:08.440]  but when Obama gets up there and says you can't have air conditioning in cars, but he can,
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:16.280]  and that no prosperity for the general public is good, it shows you the real disconnect. Gerald,
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:22.520]  I think we're coming really to the end of this, but a decade is like the blink of an eye historically.
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:27.400]  And I'm not historically saying something better is on the other side, but this power structure
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:33.640]  is collapsing as the public buys in to the bull. There's more and more delusion, more and more
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:37.720]  mental illness. Now, there's a lot of people waking up, but it's an economy as you know,
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:43.080]  a paradox. There's a lot of people waking up, but also a lot of people getting more delusional.
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:51.240]  What are they going to do as the veneer of civilization peels off like a reentry shield
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:58.440]  on a capsule? I mean, what are they going to do when the heat of truth burns through that shield
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:02.440]  of delusion? Because a lot of holes are in it already, but I look at this historically.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.640]  Am I wrong to say we ain't seen nothing yet? And they're going to rob us of more of our rights
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:13.640]  and becomes more of a militarized local police. And you've pointed it out before, you know,
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:20.120]  how they've done away with the Pase Comitatus Act of the late 1870s that prohibited the military
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:28.760]  from doing, taking domestic actions. And you reported on it all last year. So that's what
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:33.480]  they're doing. They're going to keep robbing us of our rights. And the people will go for it like
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:39.800]  that if there's a, quote, terrorist attack, the false flag are real. You see it happen all over
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:45.400]  the world. So they use these incidents to take more and more of our power away from us as they
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:51.480]  give the power to the multinationals as they're doing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:56.280]  other agreements, the Trans-Atlantic Partnership deal. I just want to mention briefly, before we
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:03.320]  do it at a time, one thing that is really off the radar and talking about gold, you asked me earlier,
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:08.440]  is that, you know, China is now setting the benchmark for gold. And it was the Rothschild
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:15.560]  set it up in the UK back in the early 1900s. And now, of course, the Chinese are the world's
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:24.760]  largest purchases of gold. Now they're setting the benchmark. This is big news. If you, if this is
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:32.280]  the stuff that you love to own and you're setting the price, you're going to set the price higher
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:39.640]  or lower. It is admitted as your big gold bug that China more and more is controlling the
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:44.840]  price of gold. That's why it's going up some. But can the globalists try to rest control back from
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:51.720]  them? No, because it gets, it's just numbers game. What does China have? What, 1.2 billion people?
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:58.920]  And the United, look at the, look at, as Trump keeps talking about, you know, the trade deficits,
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:05.000]  could China keep it going? They'll keep it going to an extent, but it's a numbers game at the end,
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:11.480]  because as the global economies decline and fall again. Well, that's right. You said QE wouldn't
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:17.560]  work. It hasn't worked. So they say more QE is the answer. What's going to happen? Well, I mean,
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:20.600]  they admit it doesn't work, but they're going to do the same thing. How bad is it going to get?
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:26.520]  Again, the currencies are going to collapse and gold is going to go up. It's just common sense.
[02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:29.960]  Yeah, I agree with you in the common sense world and historically, but they got a lot of weird
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:34.120]  tricks up their sleeve. But I agree with this with Gerald back in 70 seconds. They can only cover

[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:35.000]  to support the fine work of Gerald Salente. I know most of you know what he's talking about.
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:38.520]  And you know, more than I do in many cases, the audience, I know is smarter than I am
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:42.200]  in many ways, but we got to get this out to everybody else. And that's starting to happen.
[03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:46.520]  But it's a numbers game. As he said, we're in a race against time people
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:52.200]  because the globalists are going to use the crises they've created to get more control.
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:57.240]  They admit that they have a philosophy. They have a program. We know what it is.
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:02.920]  And it's really bad. It's anti prosperity for us because they don't want to just have prosperity.
[03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:07.880]  They want it for them and then not for us. They want to be up on the hill with the helicopters.
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:13.720]  And we're down here in shacks like Brazil, Argentina. People say, why can't Latin America
[03:01:13.720 --> 03:01:17.160]  get their act together? There have been cases where there were countries there richer than the
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:22.600]  U.S., like Argentina. They got taken over by shenanigans. And the elites down there admit
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:30.200]  they use economic warfare as control. There aren't many countries like the U.S., folks.
[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:33.560]  That's why they run it down so much where you are allowed to operate and live.
[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:36.920]  And Gerald, I know you talk about that a lot. In the few minutes we've got left,
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:41.400]  other important points that, as you say, really aren't on the radar or other points you want to make.
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:46.680]  Well, first I just want to pick up on what you were saying. This isn't a conspiracy theorist,
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:52.680]  or a theory. Look at the rights that have been robbed from us since 9-11 happened.
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:59.640]  Look at one administration after the other. And of course, Obama lying his way into office
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:05.720]  saying he was going to reverse these things and made things worse. Look at how many,
[03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:10.600]  when he locked up more whistleblowers than all the presidents before him in total.
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:19.400]  So it's not a conspiracy theory. It's in front of us. It's happening. We're losing not only our
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:28.360]  rights, our right to earn a living wage because of the taking away of laws and regulations that
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:34.280]  give the money to all the elite. And again, the one great thing that happened from Occupy Wall
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:41.160]  Street was they made the 1% visible. And of course, you find out, no, it's not 1%. It's
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:52.120]  0.01%. So it's really up to us to change it. And Americans, for some reason, have this helpless
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:58.600]  feeling. And again, all you have to do is look what happened in Austria last week. This is Austria.
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:07.400]  Everybody remember Austrian, Hungarian Empire, Germany, Germany, the engine of manufacturing
[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:16.920]  in Europe. New governments are happening. People are fighting to retain their dignity, their respect.
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:25.640]  And it's up to us to do the same and we can do it. We wrote the book. We are the Americans,
[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:32.440]  the American Revolution. We have the Constitution and a Bill of Rights before, and it's not a
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:38.440]  conspiracy theory. They robbed us of them. So it's in our head. We're the trailblazers. We're
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:42.920]  one of the cradles of liberty. We have to stop just being watching TV and being spectators and
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:50.920]  get in the game and realize the animating contest of liberty is now. Exactly. And so everyone again,
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:58.360]  it only comes with support and a unified action plan. You know what? I'm glad the elite are
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:02.200]  running off to other countries and hiding out. Like you said, you've doubled down moving to the
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:08.440]  birthplace of America, colonial area there in New York. I've doubled down. I'm not leaving. You know
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:12.920]  what? And we're going to be the leaders. Not that I want to be, but our information will be the
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:18.040]  leaders, our listeners will be the leaders that lead us out of this system. We're going to win,
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:25.720]  Gerald. Hey, it does not take a majority to prevail. Rather, an irate, tireless minority,
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:33.560]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men. Samuel Adams. That's right. Absolutely.
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:39.160]  And Thomas Jefferson made similar statements. Gerald Solente, we salute you as a fellow, a pro-human,
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:45.880]  pro-liberty American, but it's a worldwide movement, 1776 to the next level. Thank you, sir.
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:52.840]  Thank you. All right. He's committed. He's doubled down. Are you? That's what we're talking about.
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:56.680]  Dave and I straight ahead, but first I'm going to spend a few more minutes with a personal message
[03:04:56.680 --> 03:05:20.680]  to Hillary Clinton. I'm sending her a present.
[03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:33.080]  Anything. President Nicholas Maduro's government blames the power outage on weather critics. However,
[03:05:33.080 --> 03:05:38.600]  say it is the result of economic mismanagement and inefficient running of the energy network.
[03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:44.440]  Venezuela's economy has plunged along with the price of the oil it relies on for foreign revenues.
[03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:49.720]  Citizens are suffering shortages of medicines and goods such as toilet paper and cooking oil.
[03:05:49.720 --> 03:05:57.240]  Maduro blames the collapse on an economic war by capitalist. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[03:07:04.120 --> 03:07:09.080]  what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:15.000]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:19.960]  out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took
[03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:25.800]  the good halogen in and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:32.040]  is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016,
[03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:37.320]  even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:07:37.320 --> 03:07:43.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:47.720]  You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:53.800]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today

[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:23.720]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is what happened to you. Yes. Well, you know what? I won't hold
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:30.760]  you on here any longer because you probably could use some water there. Hilary Clinton, live from
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:46.920]  New York. I've talked way too much.
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:16.920]  Well, go back to them. It was a secret.
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:34.680]  Well, I'm here to tell you that that was part of a compilation. It keeps going on for a while of
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:40.520]  her over the years having coughing attacks. And I live in Austin, Texas, and I actually have some
[03:09:40.520 --> 03:09:46.120]  empathy for Hilary Clinton on this. We are the capital of allergies. I thought growing up when
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:50.040]  I had friends that didn't want to go ride bikes or go play baseball or whatever,
[03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:55.800]  that they were making it up when they said that they had allergies that didn't want to come out.
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:10:03.400]  I thought that that was hypochondria. Then I moved to Austin in high school and within a few years,
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:11.800]  it hit me. There's so many different plants, so many different types of pollen. It's pretty much
[03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:17.560]  year-round different allergies. Mountain juniper, what they call cedar, gives me a headache,
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:24.120]  makes me tired. Oak does kind of the same thing. But mold, when it rains for weeks and weeks on
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:31.640]  end with flooding, fungus just absolutely makes me having coughing fits just like Hilary Clinton.
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:41.000]  And what's crazy is, I'm about to speak directly to Hilary Clinton here on air,
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:47.800]  is that I tend to not even take my own nutraceuticals regularly, like I'll be having
[03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:53.560]  trouble sleeping and forget that I have knockout in the cupboard that's got all the key things from
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:59.720]  melatonin to valerian root to L-triptophan, you name it, that will make you get restful deep
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:05.960]  sleep. I mean, it's amazing. In FullWarsLife.com, this is partially a plug. And it's the same thing
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:10.120]  where it's kind of like you're in bed halfway asleep and you're cold, but you won't get up and
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:15.560]  get another blanket. It's kind of like that same laziness. So the last week and a half, the mold's
[03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:20.120]  been off the charts. Leanne's been coughing, a bunch of other people have been coughing around the
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:26.520]  office. And a couple nights ago, I was up every hour just cough, cough, cough because it's like
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:32.040]  itches in your throat. And I finally got up and went, I need to go into the kitchen and into the
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:38.840]  lazy citizen. I think I have in FullWarsLife lung cleanse. It's a whole bunch of concentrated herbs
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:44.200]  and things that really knock it out. I go in there, I dig around, it's not there. If I drink water,
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:52.120]  it doesn't do it. So I get back, I have a coughing fit on air yesterday, and I go get a fresh bottle,
[03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:59.400]  this is a used bottle they dug up out of my other office. And I start taking it and within a minute
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:03.560]  the coughing stops. And I was drinking water, I had a cough drop, I was like, wait a minute,
[03:12:03.560 --> 03:12:08.360]  I have a product that we came up with that has dozens of essential oils and key things that's
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:13.640]  the best thing out there. So guess what? I brought my new fresh bottle home last night. So I started,
[03:12:14.360 --> 03:12:19.240]  I take it last night, sleep, right, don't have any problems. Start having a coughing fit again
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:25.800]  on air because I went for a jog this morning. They had to run find a bottle. They had a bunch
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:28.200]  over in the warehouse, but this is a used bottle. Somebody's been using around here.
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:34.360]  Take four or five shots in your mouth, then go, a little bit goes down to the throat,
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:39.240]  you don't want to suck while you're blowing or you don't want to spray and then suck it down
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:42.600]  or you get too much of your lungs. But I just kind of go, then get a little bit down to what Dr.
[03:12:42.600 --> 03:12:47.480]  Group says to do and it knocks it out. It is the best stuff out there. And when you purchase it,
[03:12:47.480 --> 03:12:57.000]  it helps find a operation. So because I know that we have the best product from God's covered mother
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:03.240]  nature for people that have allergies, people that have inflammation in the throat, people that have
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:09.080]  bronchial issues, I have tried a lot of stuff for mold that absolutely turns me into Hillary
[03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:13.560]  Clinton coffer. And when she came out and said it's allergies, I believe her because if you've
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:19.240]  got a mold allergy or other allergy in your lungs or in your bronchials, she coughs exactly the way
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:24.600]  I do. Now, I wouldn't be too sad, quite frankly, if it was, but I don't want to wish things on
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:28.760]  her and it's bad luck, but I probably wouldn't cry too hard if it was terminal lung cancer.
[03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:33.080]  And I'm just going to be honest with you, but you know what? I want to be Christian. So I want to
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:39.240]  say, Hillary, I love you. It's still time for you to turn back and not be so evil with the Serbia
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:44.840]  attack and the Benghazi and the Libya and the Syria and the dead kids at Mina and all the
[03:13:44.840 --> 03:13:50.440]  corruption and covering up for your husband, raping everybody. Stop raping the American people.
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:53.560]  Stop trying to be so evil. Stop trying to stay in power just to cover your own. But
[03:13:56.520 --> 03:14:03.000]  I want to offer you and I'm going to mail to you a bottle to your campaign headquarters,
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:08.200]  sealed and safe. In fact, we're going to send you five or six bottles so your staff can use it
[03:14:08.200 --> 03:14:11.480]  and find out it's totally safe. We're going to mail it to you from these offices.
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:15.880]  And I really want to encourage you, Hillary, before a speech to try this because the others
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:19.880]  that they sell at drug stores or even prescriptions like steroids, it doesn't really work or it has
[03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:25.480]  bad side effects or it's just got numbing effect and it doesn't work long term. I do this. I'm good
[03:14:25.480 --> 03:14:29.240]  for six, seven, eight hours. I tried other products before I had my own and they just didn't work
[03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:34.520]  because they're alcohol and a couple of different things. So here's two fresh bottles for Hillary
[03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:39.320]  Clinton of lung cleanse. I'm going to send this to you. And all I ask is if it works for you,
[03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:44.040]  I know you don't want to give folks other good advice. You don't want to take care of even your
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:48.440]  own constituents. You certainly don't want to fund the info war. But I know for a fact, some of my
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:52.360]  enemies actually buy Supermelon X2. I've had people that talk to you, you know, I was at
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:55.800]  such a house who hates you and they had your product and they're using it. Well, the products are
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:59.960]  that good and it's how we fund the operation. So thank you all for your support. So here's my
[03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:03.240]  letter to Hillary Clinton. I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight, Joe Biggs and others.
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:12.280]  We'll do a document cam shot for TV viewers so folks can see our letterhead here. Here I can
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:15.880]  just kind of X out some of the internal info. But I think our numbers are actually public,
[03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:23.000]  so I don't care if folks even see that. Hello, Ms. Clinton. Though I disagree with basically
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:27.320]  everything you stand for and fight constantly against your policies and ideas, I also recognize
[03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:32.360]  that you have a serious issue with your health. On multiple occasions you have suffered severe
[03:15:32.360 --> 03:15:39.880]  coughing bouts. Those coughing bouts have been so intense, I'm sure you've probably
[03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:45.240]  busted some blood vessels in your eyes. This isn't a good look for a presidential candidate,
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:50.200]  even a vampiric goblin creature like yourself. I'm sorry I wasn't saying that. So in the spirit of
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:54.520]  my love for all of humanity, even though we're not sure you're human, with the hope that someday you
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:16:02.600]  will recant and will repent from your evil ways, I am sending you a bottle of Empower's Life Lung
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:08.600]  Cleanse. You see, I occasionally have a coughing fit due to mold or other environmental contaminants.
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:12.840]  This simple spray has been a godsend to myself and many of our listeners.
[03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:17.000]  We have a bunch of professional singers that swear by it and it's all natural,
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:21.240]  healthy and really works quickly. Kind of editing this as we go. I don't want to say
[03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:26.200]  instantly, but very quickly, no matter, seconds for me. Instead of that bottle of hot sauce you
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:30.680]  claim to carry, you should always keep this bottle of Empower's Life Lung Cleanse within reach,
[03:16:30.680 --> 03:16:38.600]  even though you're going to lose in a landslide to Mr. Trump. And then I kind of did a voicemail on
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:43.480]  this, but I'm not sure what that pun means at the end. Buckley wrote the rest of this. So
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:51.880]  there is the signed Alex Jones to Hare Hittlery and I hope that they will read this and I hope
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:55.080]  that they will, but they're going to think there's some conspiracy that I actually
[03:16:55.080 --> 03:16:59.080]  xed out our address and stuff here on the top. So will you bring me another one that I'll actually
[03:16:59.080 --> 03:17:03.320]  sign and send to her? Thank you. We'll put the little Empower's Seal on it. They'll probably
[03:17:03.320 --> 03:17:07.160]  have the Secret Service come and say, I tried to kill her or something, you know, oh my gosh,
[03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:12.280]  central oil, so evil. It's a bunch of them synergistically together, Empower'sLife.com.
[03:17:12.280 --> 03:17:17.000]  Also, it ends very quickly. Maybe a few days, maybe early next week, depending on how much we
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:21.800]  keep selling, but Empower's Select, high-quality swarble foods, 40 to 30% off the already super
[03:17:21.800 --> 03:17:27.800]  low price. And Empower'sStore.com or EmpowerSelect.com takes you right to the subsection. We have a
[03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:31.000]  lot of other products that are in as well, but it is your purchase of the products that make it
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:36.200]  all possible. I'm punching out. David Knight, thank you so much for doing the fourth hour here,
[03:17:36.200 --> 03:17:40.120]  Mike and Padre. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, you're going to make sure that you've got that address
[03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:44.840]  there for the Secret Service to come by and talk to you about that. You send bottles of liquid
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:49.080]  to Hillary Clinton after what you think of her. I think they'll probably want to talk to you.
[03:17:49.080 --> 03:17:55.240]  Maybe she'll have Huma try that out or some of her other employees that are not as close to her as
[03:17:55.240 --> 03:18:03.400]  Huma. Maybe her stable of young hussies can try it out. Yeah, who knows. Hey, I will come. The
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:09.080]  Secret Service can march me to Hillary, the Empress, and I will then, I will taste it in front of her.
[03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:15.480]  There you go. There you go. Maybe she'll bite me on the lip and build it into women, but I'm sorry,
[03:18:15.480 --> 03:18:21.960]  go ahead. No, no, it really does work. I've used it myself. And even as you try to explain to Glenn
[03:18:21.960 --> 03:18:26.920]  Beck one time and lay off the diet, they're not going to listen to you, but they should,
[03:18:27.480 --> 03:18:33.560]  because we know about these things. And that is a very effective throat clear. You know,
[03:18:33.560 --> 03:18:39.000]  I was listening to her cough that the segment he had at the beginning, I was getting a sympathy cough,
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:43.080]  just listening to it. But you know, if she would try that, the only thing she'd be choking on is
[03:18:43.080 --> 03:18:49.320]  her lies, Alex. Exactly. Or the children's brain. She sucked out. She's really a 14 foot
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:53.960]  reptoid that like transforms into that like six a big tube and kids brains like the brain bug.
[03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:58.120]  No, no, no, no, that's that. That's a movie. I'm joking. I'm joking. David Knight, you take over.
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:02.200]  Thank you for the great job, my friend. Thank you, Alex. Well, I've got Joe Biggs with me because
[03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:06.440]  we looked at this article that was on the Drudge Report today came out from Judicial Watch talking
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:13.480]  about cartels helping terrorists get to the US via our porous border with Mexico. And this is not
[03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:18.440]  anything new. And this is documented in the Judicial Watch article about how long this has been
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:23.240]  going on. Had Joe come in because, of course, Joe has been there and Joe went to the town
[03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:30.360]  that had been reported by Judicial Watch that they had terrorists there, an ISIS camp in that area
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:35.000]  across from El Paso. Tell us about that and remind us what you did, Joe. When we come back,
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  we're going to talk about that. And of course, there's other issues as well. You know, we look
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:45.320]  at Ohio. We've got people who are saying Mexican cartels are already there. Of course, it's been
[03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:49.720]  this massive number of people in one family that were killed there. People are saying,
[03:19:49.720 --> 03:19:53.320]  is this something to do with the cartels? And extended coverage tonight of the primary,
[03:19:53.320 --> 03:19:56.600]  seven o'clock central. That's right. That's right. Well, there's been four wars, nine
[03:19:56.600 --> 03:20:06.440]  news. We'll be right back with Joe Biggs. I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a
[03:20:06.440 --> 03:20:11.800]  true story of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life insurance. A while back,
[03:20:11.800 --> 03:20:16.920]  a man called me who had had prostate cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote another
[03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:22.840]  life insurance agent had given him. I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information,
[03:20:22.840 --> 03:20:26.920]  then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent
[03:20:26.920 --> 03:20:31.960]  and found one who pre approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:36.440]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes,
[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:43.160]  experience and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:53.080]  How about you? For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632. That's 1-800-654-1632.

[03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:06.200]  Are you concerned about the power grid, about the new war on the power grid? If so,
[03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:11.960]  this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable. Here's why.
[03:21:11.960 --> 03:21:16.760]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just
[03:21:16.760 --> 03:21:21.720]  been written. Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies,
[03:21:21.720 --> 03:21:27.800]  but only for a limited time to GCN listeners. He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part
[03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:33.160]  of the shipping and handling cost. Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today,
[03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:38.280]  he will actually FedEx the book to you. Why do this? Why would he spend extra money and
[03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:43.800]  all that bother to FedEx his new book? The answer is simple. America's power grid is in grave danger
[03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:48.840]  and most Americans are clueless. Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most

[03:24:13.640 --> 03:24:18.440]  I... Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. Your host joining me now is Joe
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:24.040]  Biggs and we've got a lot of news to talk about. We're going to talk about actor Tim Robbins blaming
[03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:30.280]  Sanders' losses on voter fraud. And that's not as improbable as you may think because we've got
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:36.520]  some very interesting information coming out of Arizona right now about fraud at multiple
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:42.120]  levels within the votes. And this is not even on the rigged GOP side. We're also going to be talking
[03:24:42.120 --> 03:24:50.280]  about another incredible example of civil asset forfeiture. Police taking $53,000 from a Christian
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:56.040]  band and an orphanage and a church. Okay, charging the money with the crime. Because you know, it
[03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:01.400]  is a crime if you have cash. Let's be honest about that in modern America. And let's be honest about
[03:25:01.400 --> 03:25:06.680]  the fact that the federal government has turned our law enforcement agencies, many of them bribing
[03:25:06.680 --> 03:25:12.680]  them to participate in this theft. They've turned them into literal highway robbers. You know,
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:17.560]  as Lysander Spoonery said, the difference between the government and a highway robber
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:20.840]  is that a highway robber just steals your money and leaves you alone. But the government takes
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:25.720]  your money and follows you down the road nagging you as you go along. Well, that literally has become
[03:25:25.720 --> 03:25:30.040]  the case now with our government. But I want to talk about the story that was on the Drudge Report
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:36.120]  with Joe Biggs now. This is a judicial watch story. And this harkens back to something you
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:41.880]  did what was it about a year ago, wasn't it? Yeah, it was April 15th and 16th, 17th, 18th of last year.
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:45.480]  Yeah. So it's been about a year, just over a year ago. Yeah. Yeah, interesting. So yeah,
[03:25:45.480 --> 03:25:51.240]  the it's a red link on Drudge and it's cartels help terrorists in Mexico get to US to explore targets.
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:58.040]  ISIS militant, Mohammed Omar Kabir among them says Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorist
[03:25:58.040 --> 03:26:03.720]  station in Mexico cross into the US to explore targets for future attacks, according to information
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:09.320]  forwarded to judicial watch by high ranking Homeland Security official in the border state.
[03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:14.600]  Now, myself, Josh Owens went down there a year ago and actually investigated the initial reports
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:20.600]  by judicial watch, saying that there was some information from some high-level people that
[03:26:20.600 --> 03:26:25.720]  there was some ISIS activity in an opera. Now, if you actually look at a map, you have El Paso and
[03:26:25.720 --> 03:26:32.120]  then south of that is Chihuahua, Juarez and then eight miles west of that over as an opera. And
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:37.000]  that's actually an area that I end up going into. I found a local in that area. He drove me across.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:41.320]  I went over there by myself with this guy's help to drive me around. And we found some interesting
[03:26:41.320 --> 03:26:45.960]  things, you know, and on the way back, the FBI stopped us at the airport and questioned me.
[03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:49.640]  And Josh Owens was able to sit there with me and kind of listen in on the whole thing.
[03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:52.760]  And they said that they believe that that's a viable threat that they think that's something
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:56.360]  that's real. And they believe what judicial watch is reporting. And the sources that they're
[03:26:56.360 --> 03:27:00.360]  getting this stuff from is something that they are interested in, they're looking into.
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:03.880]  And now we have more corroboration of that. We've had an Italian newspaper article,
[03:27:03.880 --> 03:27:09.800]  they report on this in this article, as well as the foreign affairs secretary,
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:15.080]  Mexico's top diplomat, Claudia Ruiz, says that she doesn't understand why the Obama
[03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:20.360]  administration, US media are culpably neglecting this phenomenon. That's very interesting when
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:25.480]  the Mexicans are saying, hey, you know, this is an issue. Why aren't you concerned about this?
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:31.960]  Exactly. Yeah, I just, I told you, I just saw Cartel Land, just saw it on DVD. I missed it
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:37.640]  when it first came out. An amazing documentary. And I tell you, when you look at this, the
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:43.640]  difference between the cartels themselves and the Islamic terrorists is a distinction without
[03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:47.800]  a difference, quite frankly. It doesn't surprise me at all to see them cooperating with each other.
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:51.960]  Well, everyone seems to find that hard to believe that the the cartels and ISIS could,
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:55.640]  you know, so to say, get in bed together with one another. They both believe in money and they
[03:27:55.640 --> 03:28:01.240]  both believe in blood to get that money. Yeah, and the capitations. Yes. And actually, in some
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:06.920]  of these articles, it says that a lot of beheadings have been on the rise in these border areas,
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:12.120]  due to what they believe would be some Islamic extremism, due to ISIS moving into these areas
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:17.320]  and coming over. You know, I've shown people time and time again, in Texas and Arizona,
[03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:22.520]  how easy it is to walk into Mexico and come back over to the U.S. without even being seen.
[03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:25.800]  So it's not going to be that hard for these people to do it. And you've got this guy,
[03:28:25.800 --> 03:28:30.040]  he comes out in this Italian newspaper. He says the border that separates Mexico from the U.S.
[03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:34.360]  is so full of free zones that I could come in with a group of men in a few hours and kill
[03:28:34.360 --> 03:28:39.160]  thousands of people in Texas and Arizona. And that has been my biggest concern because I have family
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:43.800]  in both of those states, especially along the border area. And friends, I don't want to see
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:48.840]  something like this happen. And here it is. We're over a year later from these initial reports.
[03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:53.960]  And now we actually have this guy coming out bragging about how easy it is. This is a guy
[03:28:53.960 --> 03:28:59.080]  who was chased out of Kuwait for his extremism ties over a decade ago. So this guy is training
[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:03.960]  people by the hundreds, by the thousands now, to carry out attacks. And they're saying he's
[03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:07.960]  bragging about it, that they're willing to do it. And what have we done in the last year? We've
[03:29:07.960 --> 03:29:12.200]  done nothing. Our border hasn't gotten any stronger. We have no more Border Patrol agents being out
[03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:16.280]  there. Half these guys don't even do their job that are out there anyways. They have no motivation
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:20.280]  to do their jobs. Well, they're told they can't do it. I mean, we've interviewed the Vice President
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:24.760]  of the Border Patrol Union. They've come out very strongly in favor of Donald Trump because
[03:29:24.760 --> 03:29:29.000]  they're very frustrated. They've been told they have to stand down. They're prevented from doing
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:33.720]  their job. They want to do their job. They see what the problem is. And yet they set up these absurd,
[03:29:33.720 --> 03:29:39.960]  permanent checkpoints, 125 miles. And when I've been out to West Texas, it's absolutely amazing.
[03:29:39.960 --> 03:29:43.160]  Stay with us. We'll be right back. We've got a lot of news to cover. And we'll be talking to Joe
[03:29:43.160 --> 03:29:51.320]  Biggs about the exposure to Mexican cartels as well as ISIS militants. We're on the march.
[03:29:51.320 --> 03:29:56.680]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.280 --> 03:30:06.920]  As we speed towards the 2016 presidential election, the process for nomination becomes less
[03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:12.440]  and less transparent. The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination
[03:30:12.440 --> 03:30:17.080]  and that's the conflict here. What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes
[03:30:17.080 --> 03:30:21.800]  don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct? No, that's not what I'm
[03:30:21.800 --> 03:30:25.960]  trying to tell you. What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[03:30:25.960 --> 03:30:29.720]  There's many political parties. The political parties choose their nominee, not the general
[03:30:29.720 --> 03:30:35.000]  public. And I'm really amassing you. It's more than a process question. It's an integrity of the
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:39.960]  election question. And everybody's asking me this question. So I want I'm giving you an opportunity
[03:30:39.960 --> 03:30:45.080]  to explain it. Sean, the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.
[03:30:46.680 --> 03:30:50.840]  Why do you do this every single time? I know you got to stop every time I have you on the
[03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:58.280]  year. Join info wars this Tuesday, April 26th, starting at 7pm as we cover the primaries in the

[03:33:20.520 --> 03:33:25.480]  to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host and with me is Joe Biggs. We're going to be live
[03:33:25.480 --> 03:33:31.560]  tonight doing election coverage and analysis of the five state primaries in the northeast.
[03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:35.800]  I'm going to get back to Joe. We're going to talk about what's going on at our poorest border,
[03:33:35.800 --> 03:33:40.760]  the danger that Judicial Watch has pointed out yet again. Before we get back to that conversation,
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:47.480]  I just want to remind you that we have a new mega sale 30 to 40% off info war select storeable foods.

[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:12.840]  30 to 40% off of all info war select storeable food right now for limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[03:34:13.800 --> 03:34:17.720]  Well, Joe, you know, we're looking at this article that Judicial Watch put out. They're talking about
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:21.800]  how the Mexican Army federal law enforcement officials discovered documents in Arabic
[03:34:21.800 --> 03:34:29.320]  and Urdu as well as plans of Fort Bliss. Okay. They said that they also found Muslim prayer rugs
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:34.600]  that were there recovered during the documents during the operation. We've also had as info
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:39.080]  wars reporters have gone down there. We've seen the multilingual signs that they even post up,
[03:34:39.080 --> 03:34:45.880]  you know, have different languages. The border is wide open. And this is very clear evidence.
[03:34:45.880 --> 03:34:50.760]  Even the Mexican officials are warning us about this thing. We can't believe this is being ignored
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:55.080]  by the American government. I mean, they've even found these prayer rugs and documents and things
[03:34:55.080 --> 03:35:03.080]  like that 125 miles inland from the border in Falferius when John Bown and Jakari Jackson and,
[03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:07.160]  you know, Kit Daniels, all these guys went down there, Don Salazar and looked and interviewed
[03:35:07.160 --> 03:35:12.120]  these people. It's happening. And it's not just at the border. It's moving in. And there's so many
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:16.680]  of these guys who are already in these cells, these sleeper cells waiting that I just don't
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:21.720]  understand why our government is allowing this to happen so much. And the fact that-
[03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:25.480]  And that's the key. They're allowing it to happen. It isn't that they don't know. Everybody is
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:29.320]  sounding the alarm. You've got judicial watch. We've talked about it. The Mexican government
[03:35:29.320 --> 03:35:33.160]  is talking about it as judicial watch is saying they found evidence that the State Department
[03:35:33.160 --> 03:35:38.040]  has known about this for decades. I mean, yeah, I mean, in Laredo, Texas, Josh Owens and I caught
[03:35:38.040 --> 03:35:43.720]  smugglers coming across, you know, those were drugs, but that could easily be some kind of
[03:35:43.720 --> 03:35:48.200]  chemical or something like that that could be used in explosives. You know, it's a stretch for
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:52.680]  that, but it definitely is something that can happen. Well, we made Iraq supposedly because
[03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:57.160]  there's weapons of mass destruction and yet they won't clear our border for weapons of mass
[03:35:57.160 --> 03:36:03.320]  destruction. Somehow, you at the airport with a fingernail clipper is a greater concern to them
[03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:08.440]  than ISIS bringing over whatever they can carry into the border. And of course, they can carry it
[03:36:08.440 --> 03:36:12.680]  with an armored truck if they want. Yeah, the police stopped us on the border numerous times
[03:36:12.680 --> 03:36:16.920]  investigating looking at the wide open border. They're more concerned about reporters going out
[03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:23.480]  there than they are these ISIS jihadis who could be possibly coming over or cartel guys or gang
[03:36:23.480 --> 03:36:27.800]  members and stuff like that. You know, the mainstream media always wants to portray it as
[03:36:27.800 --> 03:36:32.840]  there's these young women and children who are coming across the border. Yeah, but they're not
[03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:38.600]  all their definition of children goes up pretty high to adult status here in the real world.
[03:36:38.600 --> 03:36:42.920]  Yeah, you know, so I mean, it's kind of BS when you see this, you actually go down there and you
[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:47.000]  can put your eyes on that and see it. And then you read these articles that some of these people
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:52.040]  put out like Fox News and CNN and you're just like, Oh my God, like, how do you how do you sleep at
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:57.080]  night? Yeah, yeah, I'd like to see Glenn Beck and David Barton go down and hand some teddy bears to
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:37:03.240]  these ISIS guys. So yeah, exactly. We're gonna take that. Yeah, you know, as I was talking about
[03:37:03.240 --> 03:37:08.280]  cartel land, it truly was amazing. And watching that movie and if you haven't seen that movie,
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:13.880]  you really need to watch that to get a feel for what's happening, both on the American side and
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:18.520]  on the Mexican side, this guy who put this film together, and we've interviewed him here at Info
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:25.720]  Wars. It truly was amazing how he embedded himself with them, got their confidence, but to also show
[03:37:25.720 --> 03:37:31.000]  the fact that you've got people both in America and in Mexico that are concerned because their
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:35.720]  governments don't do anything. In many cases, their governments partner with these people. I
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:41.160]  thought it was absolutely amazing the parallels between what was happening in the Mexican town
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:45.880]  and the movie like the Magnificent Seven, for example, which itself is a common problem. I mean,
[03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:52.520]  that was based on a Japanese story by Kurosawa, the Seven Samurai. So this is a universal experience
[03:37:52.520 --> 03:37:57.080]  that when the government disarms you, what did the government do when they started to get a
[03:37:57.080 --> 03:38:01.720]  citizen movement together to protect their towns in a way that the government refused to do,
[03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:06.280]  the government came in and decided they would disarm the people. And so as they were stacking
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:12.280]  their arms up, they started ringing the church bell and they started, got on the PA system and said,
[03:38:12.280 --> 03:38:17.160]  come and help us. They're taking away our means to protect ourselves and the citizens came out
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:23.080]  there unarmed and chewed the government out of the way that was there confiscating the firearms.
[03:38:23.080 --> 03:38:26.760]  An amazing story, truly an amazing story, amazing film.
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:30.120]  Well, also one of the things they're saying too is that this Mexican ice and cells manage to
[03:38:30.120 --> 03:38:35.400]  import small arms, ammunition, and even devices for air targets directly from the former Iraqi
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:40.280]  arsenal of Saddam Hussein. And they said that the only one to express any concern was a Republican
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:44.920]  governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who informed the White House candidate Donald Trump. And during
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:48.840]  a public speech, Abbott announced that ISIS terrorists would have repeatedly crossed the
[03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:54.520]  border on an exploratory mission. And he says he thinks it's very possible that they could be ramping
[03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:59.720]  up this Islamic state to start carrying out attacks. And like you said, we keep hearing this all the
[03:38:59.720 --> 03:39:04.360]  time that they want to crack down on gun control. This is our means of protecting ourselves if these
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:10.040]  psychopaths come over and do something. Texas and Arizona, we thrive on the Second Amendment.
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:13.640]  That's right. You know, we need to be able to have this. That's right. But they're going to be
[03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:19.080]  bringing in perhaps some pretty heavy weapons as you just mentioned, just put there. So yeah,
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:23.640]  they can get off the first shots and they can kill a lot of people off with the first volley.
[03:39:24.680 --> 03:39:28.520]  And so yeah, the Second Amendment is going to provide us with some protection.
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:32.600]  And we have a better situation here in America than they do in Mexico, where they go around
[03:39:32.600 --> 03:39:35.800]  when the people try to protect themselves and just take their weapons from them
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:40.760]  and throw them in jail, which is what happened there. But it is something we should all be
[03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:44.040]  very, very concerned about. Now, you're going to be joining us tonight. We're going to have
[03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:47.720]  coverage of the five Northeastern states that are going to be voting tonight. We're going to have
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:52.040]  live coverage and analysis after the nightly news. I'll have a regular nightly news. And then as the
[03:39:52.040 --> 03:39:56.840]  polls are closing, we're going to talk about that. And I've got some news that I want to get into in
[03:39:56.840 --> 03:40:03.640]  terms of questions about the polls that are being brought up by actor Tim Robbins and others in
[03:40:03.640 --> 03:40:10.120]  Arizona and elsewhere. But before we do, I want to play this clip for you of Trump talking about
[03:40:10.120 --> 03:40:13.800]  the Cruz-Kasek alliance. Thank you so much, Joe. We'll see you tonight. All right, thanks.
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:18.840]  Let's play that clip of Trump talking about the alliance between Cruz and Kasek.
[03:40:18.840 --> 03:40:26.840]  Did you see the news today? Did you see where they band together, where they collude? You know, it's collusion.
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:35.560]  You know, if you collude in business, if you collude in business, or if you collude in the
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:42.040]  stock market, they put you in jail. But in politics, because it's a rigged system, because it's a
[03:40:42.040 --> 03:40:49.160]  corrupt enterprise, in politics, you're allowed to collude. So they colluded. And actually, I was happy
[03:40:49.160 --> 03:40:57.880]  because it shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are. You know, I tweeted today
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:03.080]  at real Donald Trump. I tweet. And I said, you know, it solves them. Don't worry. I'll give it up
[03:41:03.080 --> 03:41:08.440]  after I'm president. We won't tweet at him right up there. Not presidential. But let me tell you.
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:16.280]  And I said, it takes two long time politicians, right? Too long to beat, except they're way
[03:41:16.280 --> 03:41:20.840]  behind. If you add up to both votes, and if you add up to both delegates, they're way behind me.
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:27.320]  So it doesn't matter. But it takes two guys, long time politicians, to try and get together,
[03:41:27.320 --> 03:41:33.880]  to try and beat Trump. And yet they're way behind. And I said to myself, that's pretty bad.
[03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:38.840]  That's pretty bad. And here's the key. I've only been doing this for 10 months. I haven't even been
[03:41:38.840 --> 03:41:44.920]  doing it very long. Well, you know, that alliance didn't last more than about 12 hours. It was
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:48.280]  actually kind of funny because that was something that was announced, I think, over the weekend.
[03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:52.920]  And you had people like, I think it's Katie Packer with our principles pack.
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:59.240]  These are basically Romney supporters. I call them Romulans, okay? And they've uncloked. When
[03:41:59.240 --> 03:42:03.960]  they're talking about the conservative principles, you gotta understand, this lady who is a co-chair
[03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:09.960]  from Mitt Romney, she doesn't share conservative principles. She openly supports all the things
[03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:15.560]  that are dog whistles to the base. She supports abortion. She supports gay marriage. And then
[03:42:15.560 --> 03:42:20.520]  she goes to CPAC and says, Donald Trump isn't conservative enough. You need to come in on
[03:42:20.520 --> 03:42:24.440]  these social issues. That's the way they've been playing the electorate for a long time.
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:29.240]  And that's why Donald Trump is doing so well because he is transcending these issues. He's
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:34.280]  talking about the things we're just talking about, the poorest open borders that will destroy our
[03:42:34.280 --> 03:42:39.320]  country economically, culturally, and socially if it doesn't destroy us with ISIS terrorists who
[03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:42.680]  are coming in. Let's take a look at some of the stuff that's coming up tonight. Of course, Donald
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:49.320]  Trump says, as you've got all these actors and actresses saying, if Donald Trump wins,
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:55.240]  I'm going to go to Canada. He says, great, vote for me. Get rid of them. This is Rosie O'Donnell,
[03:42:55.240 --> 03:42:59.640]  Whoopi Goldberg, Leonard Dunham. He goes, that's another, I'm in it to win now to get rid of
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:04.200]  these people. My question is, when we look at this, can we get a promise from Ted Cruz
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:10.040]  that he will go back to Canada? I mean, that's the key thing. Will he leave Texas, please,
[03:43:10.040 --> 03:43:14.920]  and go back to Canada? He really needs to be primaried in this next election. He'll be coming
[03:43:14.920 --> 03:43:19.160]  up for his first reelection. This is a guy who hadn't even finished half of his first term
[03:43:19.160 --> 03:43:24.760]  when he was running for president openly. He went to the Senate and immediately started climbing
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:28.600]  over the backs of other people. It's one of the reasons they can't stand him in the Senate. Immediately
[03:43:28.600 --> 03:43:33.800]  started running for president as soon as he got elected as Senator. People are talking about John
[03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:40.440]  Kennedy, JFK, running for Senate because he had only served a little over one Senate term. Of
[03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:46.280]  course, he'd had several terms as well as a congressman, but that's nothing compared to the
[03:43:46.280 --> 03:43:52.920]  guy who didn't even have half of a Senate term. Donald Trump, we're told, can't beat Hillary
[03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:56.440]  Clinton, and I think that's absolute nonsense. Look, we're so far out in the election, as I
[03:43:56.440 --> 03:44:01.560]  pointed out a couple of times at this point in the spring, when Ronald Reagan, the gold standard
[03:44:01.560 --> 03:44:07.960]  for the Republican Party, was running for president, he was 15 points behind, and he was running against
[03:44:07.960 --> 03:44:13.000]  an incumbent president, okay? So it really doesn't make any difference right now when you look at
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:18.360]  the polls. And as Trump has pointed out, he really hasn't focused on Hillary. He's been focused on
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:23.880]  trying to win the primary and fighting off 17 competitors. And here's a sample of how this
[03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:29.800]  is going to play out. Trump says Hillary is crooked and guilty as hell over her email servers. He
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:33.640]  says, I call her crooked, Hillary, because she's crooked, and the only thing she's got is the woman
[03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:38.440]  card. And that's all she's got. And she's talking about doubling down on that card, talking about
[03:44:38.440 --> 03:44:43.800]  how, well, I think I'll have two women on the ticket. I think maybe I'll have a vice president
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:49.320]  as woman as well, because that truly is the only thing that she can offer up there, the
[03:44:49.320 --> 03:44:54.440]  identity card. Vote for me, I'm a woman. And as he points out, we can get some women to run that
[03:44:54.440 --> 03:44:59.400]  aren't crooked. Unfortunately, I don't see anybody on the Republican side because all we got is
[03:44:59.400 --> 03:45:06.440]  Carly Fiorina. And we've got Ted Cruz as if he's got a chance. I mean, he's mathematically
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:11.000]  been eliminated for all practical purposes. After tonight, Ted Cruz will be mathematically
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:15.720]  eliminated. He needs 92% of the delegates from here on out. He's going to get very,
[03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:19.880]  very few of them. He'll be lucky in some of these states if he even gets to the threshold to get
[03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:26.680]  any delegates in some of these states. But now he's fantasizing about who he would have as his VP.
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:31.400]  I guess this is the equivalent of the fantasy football league for the politicians. And he talks
[03:45:31.400 --> 03:45:37.800]  about Carly Fiorina. And again, this comes up. It was about a year ago, well, not even a year ago,
[03:45:38.360 --> 03:45:44.120]  that there was a super PAC that had $536,000 that they spent over the quarter.
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:50.440]  And the report surfaced in September about what they had done at the end of the quarter. They
[03:45:50.440 --> 03:45:58.680]  were looking at this. Of the $536,000 that this Cruz super PAC spent, $500,000 of it was given to
[03:45:58.680 --> 03:46:04.920]  Carly Fiorina's campaign. And it's like, what is going on with this? And actually, the FEC said,
[03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:10.520]  please explain to us what is going on with this. And a lot of people reported that,
[03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:16.280]  but I have never seen anything about the letter that came back. The explanation as to why so
[03:46:16.280 --> 03:46:21.240]  much money would be given to Carly Fiorina. Of course, she was running interference for Ted Cruz
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:28.200]  when the National Enquirer story broke about possible affairs that he had had. We also see a
[03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:34.520]  story up on infowars.com, report Cruz and Kasek campaign apps are spying on users and tracking
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:39.800]  data. This is a Kit Daniels report. He points out the official Ted Cruz and John Kasek smartphone
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:45.880]  apps are tracking users. And this is according to Symantec, the people who look at vulnerabilities
[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:50.440]  on your phone, on your computer and warn you about these vulnerabilities and say, hey, look,
[03:46:50.440 --> 03:46:55.400]  this app, which says that it's going to do such and such, is also scooping up your own personal
[03:46:55.400 --> 03:47:02.120]  data and sending this back. As a matter of fact, the Kasek app was rated by Symantec as a medium
[03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:09.400]  security risk. They say, if an app is asking for more information than you're comfortable sharing,
[03:47:09.400 --> 03:47:17.160]  it might be a sign to run the other way. Yeah, run very fast the other way from these candidates,
[03:47:17.160 --> 03:47:24.760]  especially from big brother Cruz. This guy has taken it to an all new art. And when I see him
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:31.560]  doing this as a candidate, it really concerns me as to what Ted Cruz would do as a president.
[03:47:31.560 --> 03:47:37.720]  This is the guy who has a app that he gives his people going door to door. This is part of his
[03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:43.400]  quote unquote ground game where he analyzes you because he's pulled up things from your
[03:47:44.120 --> 03:47:50.200]  phone, like all kinds of things about your identification, details, what you do. And he
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:55.400]  also has other ways to mine information about you outside of your phone, even if you don't get this
[03:47:55.400 --> 03:48:01.720]  app. And he's able to tell his people going door to door, precisely what you want to hear.
[03:48:02.840 --> 03:48:09.240]  This is their key issue. This is the way you should approach them. Okay, the malleable candidate
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:15.320]  that can be everything to everyone. And the shapeshifter that we have seen him turn into,
[03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:21.160]  that is truly what has happened with Ted Cruz. Now, when I was talking about the election and
[03:48:21.160 --> 03:48:26.200]  the concern that people have about whether or not these are for real, there was an interesting
[03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:31.560]  tweet that was put out by actor Tim Robbins. And he supports Bernie Sanders. And he says, all right,
[03:48:32.440 --> 03:48:36.920]  says the election is being stolen from Bernie Sanders. Now, a lot of people are going to dismiss
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:40.760]  this as whenever we talk about corruption, wherever we talk about rigging, people are going to say,
[03:48:40.760 --> 03:48:47.080]  it's sour grapes, you're paranoid, you're a conspiracy theorist. Look,
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:52.280]  I don't even support Bernie Sanders, but I'm concerned about honest elections. And you should
[03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:57.960]  be concerned as well. And I think he's on to something here because what he did was he looked
[03:48:57.960 --> 03:49:07.240]  at exit polling. Now, we hear a lot about exit polling, don't we? We hear that women prefer
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:13.640]  candidate A over candidate B according to exit polls. And the evangelicals chose candidate B
[03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:19.000]  over candidate A, that type of thing. You notice what they never tell you. They'll tell you all
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:24.200]  the way up to the election. Hey, I've got a poll here that says candidate A is five points over
[03:49:24.200 --> 03:49:29.240]  candidate B and so forth and so on. But when all of a sudden candidate A who was up by five points
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:36.120]  is losing by 10 points on election day, you don't hear the exit poll that says, oh, and by the way,
[03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:42.200]  here's what our exit poll said. And interestingly enough, they don't agree with the results that
[03:49:42.200 --> 03:49:46.760]  are being reported in the election. You don't hear that, do you? Have you ever heard that?
[03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:52.440]  I don't recall ever hearing that. I looked very hard after the Utah primary because I was very
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:57.400]  concerned about what was going on there on the GOP side. We had a company, Smartmatic,
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:02.920]  which has a reputation throughout Central and South America. It is the largest electronic
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:07.080]  voting machine company. Of course, there's also Diebold and some other ones, but Smartmatic is
[03:50:07.080 --> 03:50:13.160]  the largest one. Do you know Smartmatic comes from Venezuela? Do you know that Smartmatic was
[03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:19.640]  founded by some people who were friends of Hugo Chavez? Do you know that Smartmatic was accused
[03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:24.040]  by many people of rigging elections for Hugo Chavez? The American government accused them
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:30.200]  of doing that in the mid-2000s. And we've had situations in the Philippines and Mexico, as I
[03:50:30.200 --> 03:50:36.120]  pointed out in Brazil. The lady who is being impeached right now, the president of Brazil,
[03:50:36.120 --> 03:50:41.160]  she was a very unpopular socialist in Brazil. She was down by nine points and all of a sudden,
[03:50:41.160 --> 03:50:45.960]  magically, she comes up in the polls. And there were no exit polls. The people who
[03:50:45.960 --> 03:50:50.120]  typically did exit polls, they shut them down. Tim Robbins looks at this and says,
[03:50:50.120 --> 03:50:53.880]  he's got a list on his tweet all the way down here. He's got all these different states where
[03:50:53.880 --> 03:50:59.560]  there's a huge difference between the exit polls and Hillary's advantage. We'll talk about that
[03:50:59.560 --> 03:51:04.840]  when we come back. Stay with us. Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain,
[03:51:04.840 --> 03:51:10.200]  blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular heartbeat? Are you looking for a more natural

[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:26.600]  time to stock up. You always need to have a backup supply just as we're talking about the rigged
[03:54:26.600 --> 03:54:32.680]  elections in Venezuela. Understand that they're now rationing power there. That's the essence of
[03:54:32.680 --> 03:54:37.640]  socialism, isn't it, to ration power. They're turning off everything. They're turning off the
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:42.280]  refrigerators. They're turning off the fans, the electric fans, the electric lights shutting down
[03:54:42.280 --> 03:54:47.240]  the power. You know, when they take all power, they're going to ration it. Anything can happen
[03:54:47.240 --> 03:54:50.680]  in the United States. We can have a natural disaster. We can have a political disaster.
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:56.040]  Somebody like Bernie Sanders could get elected. He could start rationing power. Look, you need to
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:55:01.720]  be prepared. And one way to do that is to stock up. We have a sale. We've got a massive sale right
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:08.040]  now, 30 to 40% off on select storeable foods. These are things that will have a shelf life of 25

[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:20.840]  storeable food and infowarstore.com. As I was pointing out just before we went to break, and as
[03:55:20.840 --> 03:55:25.960]  I just said, obviously I don't support Bernie Sanders. I call him Bernie Sandernista because
[03:55:25.960 --> 03:55:31.240]  he was so enthralled with Nicaragua and what was going on there, the socialists there, as well as
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:37.720]  Venezuela and Hugo Chavez. You know, it truly is the essence of socialism that when they get power,
[03:55:37.720 --> 03:55:44.440]  they ration it. They ration everything. And just keep dividing, taking the pie that keeps
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:50.200]  shrinking and cutting it into smaller and smaller pieces for everybody except themselves. But
[03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:54.680]  let's get back to the election because having honest elections is something we really need
[03:55:54.680 --> 03:56:00.120]  to be concerned about. And this tweet that came out from actor Tim Robbins, he lays it down state
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:05.960]  by state. The differences here and highlight some of the states that he believes were flipped from
[03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:11.640]  the Bernie Sanders column to the Hillary Clinton side. One of them that sticks out the most here
[03:56:11.640 --> 03:56:20.600]  is Arizona. Bernie got dropped by about 5%, 6%, and Hillary was bumped up by 25%. So she went up
[03:56:20.600 --> 03:56:26.440]  33%. When you look at the exit polls and they don't agree with the previous polls, they don't agree
[03:56:26.440 --> 03:56:32.200]  with the reported vote totals out of the places. You have to ask yourself, what's going on? Well,
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:37.160]  people are starting to ask that. And so now we see that Arizona poll workers are confirming
[03:56:37.160 --> 03:56:43.240]  rigged and irregular primaries. And they say it focused on the Democrat side, interestingly enough.
[03:56:43.240 --> 03:56:47.240]  In Arizona, of course, we see it happening on the Republican side. In other states,
[03:56:47.240 --> 03:56:52.120]  this is a Maricopa County poll worker, Diane Post, who's talking about
[03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:57.080]  many different, testifying about many different things that she saw there. And they say the
[03:56:57.080 --> 03:57:03.160]  Democrat Party, Bernie Sanders, and even Hillary Clinton, ironically, who was the main beneficiary
[03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:07.480]  of all the computer glitches, all the voter suppression, and they're suing the state.
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:13.080]  You know, I keep hearing that these primaries and these caucuses, you know, it's a private party and
[03:57:13.880 --> 03:57:17.640]  state doesn't have anything to say about this. And voters don't have anything to say about this.
[03:57:17.640 --> 03:57:23.240]  So then why are they suing the state? Why are the states paying for these elections that are now
[03:57:23.240 --> 03:57:28.200]  a rinse, as Ryan's previous keeps reminding us, that's just their own private little party there?
[03:57:28.200 --> 03:57:34.360]  No, it's not. They want it to be private when it suits their purposes, and then they want it
[03:57:34.360 --> 03:57:38.680]  to be public when it suits their purposes. Then a little bit of time that I have left,
[03:57:38.680 --> 03:57:43.880]  I want to just briefly touch on this outrageous story. As in the Washington Post, how police
[03:57:43.880 --> 03:57:49.720]  took $53,000 from a Christian band from an orphanage from a church. This was a group
[03:57:50.760 --> 03:57:55.560]  some citizens who were refugees from Burma. Their Christians are going around on a tour,
[03:57:55.560 --> 03:58:00.680]  going probably from church to church, probably looking at the amount of concerts that they'd
[03:58:00.680 --> 03:58:05.480]  made and the amount of money they made at each of these concerts, probably went through about
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:11.880]  150 different churches. As the manager was heading back to Texas, he got stopped in Oklahoma,
[03:58:11.880 --> 03:58:16.520]  and they stole the money from him. And the interesting thing is that after the Washington
[03:58:16.520 --> 03:58:22.280]  Post focused on this, they came back and said, well, okay, well, all this publicity, it looks
[03:58:22.280 --> 03:58:26.680]  really bad. We're stealing money from orphans. I mean, they had this cash there with the orphan's
[03:58:26.680 --> 03:58:31.080]  individual names on it even. And they said, all right, we don't have a burden of proof. The
[03:58:31.080 --> 03:58:35.960]  point is they're lying even about that. It's civil asset forfeiture because they make you
[03:58:35.960 --> 03:58:53.800]  sue to get your money back. Christians need to wake up about the war on drugs. Join us tonight.
