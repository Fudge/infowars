[00:56.680 --> 01:02.720]  time and time again with stock market crashes with top analysts at major
[01:02.720 --> 01:08.760]  banks like sociatel general saying that they believe there's going to be a

[01:24.280 --> 01:28.200]  believed that there was a very good chance the attack had been greenlighted
[01:28.200 --> 01:33.040]  for august and now unfortunately it looks like they are seriously considering
[01:33.040 --> 01:37.400]  israel launching an attack and then dragging the united states into it that
[01:37.400 --> 01:44.160]  is all coming up we have a special guest joining us who's only joined us one

[02:33.480 --> 02:41.320]  of the headlines dealing with iran first Reuters iran says that they are to push
[02:41.320 --> 02:46.280]  ahead with new enrichment plants and the russians are set at the end of the week
[02:46.280 --> 02:50.800]  to deliver the uranium the peaceful uranium that cannot be used in weapons
[02:50.800 --> 02:57.200]  systems to them but the media is engaged in the west in a giant hoax saying that
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.800]  it is for weapons even though iran has tried to give their uranium to brazil
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.760]  turkey france and others for them to enrich the other half the russians have
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.280]  one half of it they wanted to give basically all of their remaining uranium
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.640]  to the west and say fine you enrich it for reactors knowing we can't then use
[03:15.640 --> 03:21.200]  it for fissile material in nukes and their answer is no we're going to attack
[03:21.200 --> 03:27.120]  you if i give me a document cam shot guys this this gentleman for present

[04:04.840 --> 04:10.960]  years ago in 2003 and so when a ambassador from the neocons wants to

[08:26.120 --> 08:34.240]  third hour you guess give me butterflies but this is a very serious person we've
[08:34.240 --> 08:42.200]  got coming on in about 22 minutes from now I'll just leave it as a surprise when
[08:42.200 --> 08:47.400]  they join us but there couldn't be a better time to have this individual on
[08:47.400 --> 08:52.280]  then today with all that's happening in the world in the middle east in central
[08:52.280 --> 09:00.400]  asia afghanistan and of course pakistan I'll just leave it at that coming up in
[09:00.400 --> 09:08.440]  about 22 minutes from now so we see massive drum beating going on for an
[09:08.440 --> 09:13.800]  attack on iran and ray McGovern former top ca analyst to Ronald Reagan and
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.120]  george herbert walker bush said that he believed shaney was going to stage a
[09:18.120 --> 09:22.080]  gulf of tonkin event three and a half years ago and it came out six months
[09:22.080 --> 09:26.760]  later that he did just that tried to paint up us patrol boats like iranian
[09:26.760 --> 09:33.960]  boats to have them attack us ships so when he talks I listen and he said his
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.840]  intel is that they have more than 50 50 chance that they've green-lighted to a
[09:39.840 --> 09:48.240]  certain extent an attack to take place against iran led by the israelis in
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.400]  mid to late august well it's it's now mid august it's now the 16th day of
[09:54.400 --> 10:01.280]  august and there is a full court press that iran is about to get nuclear
[10:01.280 --> 10:08.040]  weapons and may use them any minute it's almost an exact replay instant replay
[10:08.040 --> 10:13.120]  of the propaganda that led to the bombardment and the subsequent invasion
[10:13.120 --> 10:18.120]  and the seven-year mass murder and slaughter and wargaming a martial law
[10:18.120 --> 10:26.760]  training that iraq has been used for kicking off of course in 2003 so we are
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.440]  on the verge of something very very serious iran has 70 million people not
[10:31.440 --> 10:35.160]  23 million they have a lot more high-tech weapons and they're better
[10:35.160 --> 10:41.400]  organized militarily and historically than iraq and will surely brought block
[10:41.400 --> 10:45.600]  the Strait of Hormuz bare minimum the terror attacks that are launched whether
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.360]  manufactured or real will be used to clamp down on the global corporate crime
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.240]  syndicates real enemies the people of the west the entire architecture of their
[10:55.240 --> 10:59.720]  attack system is pointed at we the people they just use outside threats as the
[10:59.720 --> 11:05.960]  smokescreen to launch these expanded takeovers iran will build uranium
[11:05.960 --> 11:12.400]  enrichment centers nuclear chief says Tehran CNN iran plans to begin
[11:12.400 --> 11:15.800]  construction of 10 uranium enrichment centers across the country by next year
[11:15.800 --> 11:24.080]  state-run media has quoted iran's nuclear chief as saying continuing here is
[11:24.080 --> 11:28.960]  an article by reama govern from consortium news posted at prison planet
[11:28.960 --> 11:37.200]  dot com and info wars dot com neo cons prep us for war with iran I guess I was
[11:37.200 --> 11:41.640]  naive in thinking of the Atlantic and its American Israeli writer Jeffrey
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.320]  Goldberg might shy away from arguing for yet another war this one when I ran
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.840]  all the cauldrons are still boiling in Afghanistan and iraq it's worth
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.720]  remembering how Goldberg helped to make the case for the US invasion of iraq
[11:57.720 --> 12:04.280]  for instance the october 3rd 2002 as america's war fever was building Goldberg
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.240]  wrote in slate the online magazine and he was put on all the big news shows but
[12:09.240 --> 12:13.000]  the bush administration is planning to launch what many people would undoubtedly
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.040]  call a short-sighted and inexcusable act of aggression in five years however I
[12:18.040 --> 12:21.480]  believe that the coming invasion of iraq will be remembered as an act of
[12:21.480 --> 12:26.360]  profound morality looking back on Goldberg's commentaries at the time
[12:26.360 --> 12:31.880]  it's also a reminder of how many us publications that are considered
[12:31.880 --> 12:35.880]  centrist or even liberal were bending over backwards to get in line with the
[12:35.880 --> 12:42.800]  coming invasion even earlier on march 25th 2002 Goldberg filed the pages of
[12:42.800 --> 12:48.360]  the New Yorker with a mammoth 17,000 words story hyping iraqi leader
[12:48.360 --> 12:51.920]  Saddam Hussein ties to terrorism including al-qaeda which of course was
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.880]  false and glossing over the ambiguities regarding the gassing of civilians in
[12:56.880 --> 13:02.640]  Kurdish city during the iran iraq war Goldberg's magnum opus entitled the
[13:02.640 --> 13:08.280]  great terror earned him high marks from other neocons and essentially made
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.760]  Goldberg's career the story was also made to order so to speak for president
[13:12.760 --> 13:17.640]  George W. Bush and vice president Dick Cheney presenting Goldberg with an award
[13:17.640 --> 13:22.560]  for his article the overseas press club saw fit to know that the former C.I.
[13:22.560 --> 13:27.320]  director James Woolsey described the story as blockbuster Woolsey the
[13:27.320 --> 13:33.760]  self-described anchor of the Presbyterian wing of the J.I.N.S.A. the
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.840]  Jewish Institute for National Securities Affairs has been a strong
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.000]  advocate for the use of force against any and all perceived enemies of Israel
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.720]  Woolsey also was the prime manufacturer and the key disseminator of bogus
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.400]  intelligence on Saddam's al-qaeda connection the New Yorker article while
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.600]  exaggerating Iraq's links to terrorism Goldberg quotes Woolsey complaining
[13:55.600 --> 14:01.360]  about the CIA's alleged aversion to learning about Saddam's ties to al-qaeda
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.240]  because it wasn't true it is safe bet that Goldberg's prose under the subhead
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.920]  the al-qaeda link was inspired by Woolsey but it gets worse the details in
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.280]  that section came mostly from a drug dealer in a Kurdish prison whom British
[14:15.280 --> 14:18.160]  journalist following up Goldberg's reporting quickly determined to be a
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.920]  quote liar and then he goes on to talk about how Goldberg is now on television
[14:23.920 --> 14:32.120]  in new articles promoting a new war it is a lengthy detailed report breaking
[14:32.120 --> 14:36.560]  down the history of this this this criminal war they launched seven and a
[14:36.560 --> 14:41.000]  half years ago and it gets into how they're launching the exact same
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.080]  propaganda just changing the last letter of Iraq with a cue to Iran with an end
[14:48.080 --> 14:52.680]  the last part of the story says pitching for war Goldberg's mission this time
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.280]  pitching war with Iran this time Goldberg and the Israelis want us to buy
[14:56.280 --> 15:03.680]  into all of their propaganda without a valid major premise their argument
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.000]  presupposes that Iran has made the decision to develop nuclear weapons and
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.520]  it's hard at work on such a program which is why they want Americans to
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.040]  believe whether there's evidence or not the founding corporate media FCM and
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.840]  the neocons who brought us the war in Iraq and of course the president
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.640]  himself speak as though Iran has restarted work on nuclear weapons part of
[15:27.640 --> 15:31.800]  their nuclear energy program then he goes on to document how that is not the
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.080]  case now they've tried how they've tried to get their uranium enriched
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.520]  outside the country so they can be proven that it's not weapons grade how
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.680]  the Russians isn't anywhere near weapons grade and how they're claiming now that
[15:43.680 --> 15:48.920]  when the Russians deliver this uranium that they're going to be able to have
[15:48.920 --> 15:52.600]  nuclear weapons so they've got to launch a new attack now Joint Chiefs
[15:52.600 --> 15:57.240]  Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen and Cent com commander William Fox Fallon had been
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.800]  living in fear of Cheney inspired order to commit us forces to war with Iran
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.720]  Fallon actually had told retired Colonel Patrick Lang a few months before
[16:05.720 --> 16:13.360]  Fallon was removed we are not going to do Iran on my watch fear yes fear and
[16:13.360 --> 16:19.320]  altogether sensible reaction no commander worth his salt looks at the
[16:19.320 --> 16:23.640]  prospect of being brought in to the receiving end of an order that could
[16:23.640 --> 16:28.200]  decimate his troops and lead to a wider war for which his forces would not be
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.120]  adequate on a moral basis no commander wants to be faced with the choice
[16:32.120 --> 16:38.520]  between having to resign on principle on the one hand and carrying out an order
[16:38.520 --> 16:43.840]  that he knows to be faithfully misguided on the other good sense prevailed over
[16:43.840 --> 16:49.080]  Cheney strong objections and Bush sent Mullen to Israel in June 2008 with
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.520]  intentions and instructions to warn the Israelis and no uncertain terms not to
[16:53.520 --> 16:59.360]  provoke war with Iran and now he goes into how they're rewriting history about
[16:59.360 --> 17:04.160]  what happened claiming they went to Iraq to bring democracy not that they went
[17:04.160 --> 17:14.400]  into Iraq lying about WMD's now we've gone over that report continuing here
[17:14.400 --> 17:22.160]  is the report from Kurt Nemo at info wars dot com and has the accompanying
[17:22.160 --> 17:30.760]  video clips in the article Iran attack this week former interim UN ambassador
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.240]  and leading neocon John Bolton went on Fox News on Friday and shouted the
[17:35.240 --> 17:39.640]  alarm bells over Russia's pending delivery of nuclear fuel to Iran's
[17:39.640 --> 17:45.120]  Bashir reactor if Israel plans to attack Bashir Bolton said it must act now
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.280]  because allowing the Russians to load nuclear fuel rods at the site will make
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.480]  Iran essentially immune from attack by Israel because once the rods in the
[17:53.480 --> 17:58.080]  reactor are in place an attack on the reactor risk spreading radiation in the
[17:58.080 --> 18:04.920]  air and perhaps into the water of the Persian Gulf the fuel will be loaded on
[18:04.920 --> 18:10.400]  August 21st this is the start of the physics launch of the reactors said
[18:10.400 --> 18:18.080]  Sergei Nakhov a spokesman for Rostam the Russian Energy State Nuclear
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.800]  Corporation from that moment the Bashir plant will be officially considered a
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.240]  nuclear energy installation Russia is currently operating under a one
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.040]  billion dollar contract with Iran and has worked for over a decade on the
[18:31.040 --> 18:36.360]  reactor that I would add is peaceful scrolling up on the article you can see
[18:36.360 --> 18:43.520]  the Fox News propaganda piece where they are preparing the public for this new
[18:43.520 --> 18:48.760]  war as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty Iran has the
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.840]  right to build nuclear reactors for its civil energy needs by the way they
[18:53.840 --> 18:58.360]  import around half just about half their gasoline because they don't have the
[18:58.360 --> 19:01.720]  refineries they're too expensive they have lots of oil but not enough refineries
[19:01.720 --> 19:05.680]  and so they need this power for electricity they're not allowed to have
[19:05.680 --> 19:09.060]  it Iran has long claimed its nuclear program is for peaceful powers
[19:09.060 --> 19:12.760]  generated purposes and would help free up oil and gas resources for export
[19:12.760 --> 19:16.520]  thus generating additional hard currency revenues Bolton and the neocons
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.280]  refused to accept that the facility will produce nuclear energy and insist it
[19:20.280 --> 19:23.320]  will be used to create nuclear weapons according to Bolton once the reactor is
[19:23.320 --> 19:26.640]  operational it is only a matter of time before it begins producing plutonium
[19:26.640 --> 19:31.320]  that could be used in a nuclear weapon and to quote him in the normal operation
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.200]  of the reactor in just a short period of time you could get substantial amounts
[19:35.200 --> 19:40.640]  of plutonium uses nuclear weapons Bolton told Fox so they are talking about
[19:40.640 --> 19:48.080]  needing to strike Iran in the next six to seven days before they load the fuel
[19:48.080 --> 19:52.600]  rods because if you bomb an active nuclear site it will create something
[19:52.600 --> 19:59.480]  bigger than Chernobyl and rain down radiation all over Asia we all know

[24:12.760 --> 24:20.000]  live Monday edition we will talk more later in the broadcast about the
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.840]  situation with Iran but I did want to get into a press release put out by
[24:24.840 --> 24:34.400]  Harvard University Harvard University fund sells all Israeli holdings any
[24:34.400 --> 24:40.280]  holdings any investments in Israeli-based companies Harvard has sold them and is
[24:40.280 --> 24:46.840]  moving more into communist Chinese holdings all these major universities
[24:46.840 --> 24:51.520]  just like other quasi-governmental institutions like the University of
[24:51.520 --> 24:57.720]  Texas at Austin have tens of billions of dollars of investments and a lot of
[24:57.720 --> 25:03.320]  these investments of course they were pushed into buying by Bernie Madoff and
[25:03.320 --> 25:08.000]  others but in another blow to Israeli shares the Harvard management company
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.680]  notified the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC on Friday that it had
[25:12.680 --> 25:16.320]  sold all its holdings in Israeli companies during the second quarter of
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.080]  2010 what's going to happen to Israeli companies if World War 3 starts in the
[25:21.080 --> 25:26.520]  Middle East with Iran no reason for the sale was mentioned the Harvard
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.720]  management company manages Harvard University's endowment Harvard management
[25:30.720 --> 25:37.960]  company stated that it's in its 13 F form that it sold 483,590 shares in
[25:37.960 --> 25:46.920]  Tiva pharmacological industries LTD nice systems checkpoint software
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.360]  technologies partner communications silicon Israeli and a whole bunch of
[25:52.360 --> 25:58.000]  other companies Harvard management company 13 F form shows some investing
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.920]  trends in its largest holdings each worth 295 million or i shares ETFs one
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.400]  with Chinese equities and the other on emerging markets Harvard also owns
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.360]  181 million in Brazilian ETF so that's some of the other foreign holdings they
[26:16.360 --> 26:20.280]  have billions and billions in their endowment last time I checked UT it was
[26:20.280 --> 26:24.800]  over 50 billion dollars in their endowment but they're raising the
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.960]  tuition cost and raising parking fees and raising the dorm cost all these
[26:29.960 --> 26:36.160]  major universities are and you go get a hundred thousand dollar degree and then
[26:36.160 --> 26:41.640]  it's near worthless for you so we'll be talking more about that but why would
[26:41.640 --> 26:49.040]  Harvard and many other institutions be completely divesting in Israel well
[26:49.040 --> 26:53.080]  because a full-out war in the Middle East Israel is sure to be attacked by
[26:53.080 --> 26:59.720]  Syria by Lebanon and by other countries in the region as part of a large war
[26:59.720 --> 27:05.000]  and even if Israel comes out victorious using their nuclear weapons it is going
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.440]  to destroy much of the industry and tourism in that region and but Obama
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.000]  and the globalist to get their world government established need this
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.160]  political smoke screen because in Israel and the United States and England if
[27:21.160 --> 27:26.240]  we're in a major war most people will still rally around the government as if
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.400]  it is the flag as if it is the country as if that is what is
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.400]  patriotic when our governments have been seized by criminal interest and what
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.560]  did Robert Shapiro and many others say in the last month in the times of London
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.880]  and other publications including the Financial Times and Associated Press they
[27:43.880 --> 27:49.840]  said Obama needs a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 event so that he can look strong and
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.960]  have a political distraction going into the November elections and his his
[27:54.960 --> 27:59.560]  approval rating continues to plunge every week within six months of being an
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.760]  office he's now been in for almost a year and a half or now over a year and a
[28:03.760 --> 28:11.040]  half been in since January of last year so that's over a year and a half within
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.400]  six months he had the lowest approval rating of any president six months in
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.320]  now it's the lowest of any president a year and a half in he's breaking records
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.560]  and their whole agenda is in trouble it's all or nothing they've committed so
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.320]  many crimes with looting pension funds and tens of trillions and bailouts to
[28:28.320 --> 28:32.600]  private banks and all the no bid contracts and the four plus trillion
[28:32.600 --> 28:37.080]  missing at the Pentagon under Clinton Bush and now Obama all of their crimes
[28:37.080 --> 28:41.840]  are coming out patriots anti-globalists are winning elections at the state and
[28:41.840 --> 28:47.320]  federal level in every major primary the establishment candidates are losing the
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.640]  system knows there's a major political realignment happening globally and they
[28:52.640 --> 28:58.760]  are panicking big time right now so they want to escalate wars in the Middle
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.320]  East they want to go into Iran they want to bombard Iran they lied for the last
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.240]  two years and said US forces and Halliburton contractors were not in
[29:07.240 --> 29:11.760]  Pakistan three weeks ago they admitted okay we've got massive contractors there
[29:11.760 --> 29:17.800]  they need these wars as distractions and their big payoffs to the military
[29:17.800 --> 29:23.440]  industrial complex as well we're going to go to break we're going to come back
[29:23.440 --> 29:28.240]  with a very interesting and informative guess this is going to be a major
[29:28.240 --> 29:35.840]  newsmaker lieutenant general Hamed ghoul will be joining us from Pakistan on the
[29:35.840 --> 29:41.440]  other side of this quick break of course when the wiki leaks documents came out
[29:41.440 --> 29:46.200]  I said it looked like propaganda within those battlefield reports and that's
[29:46.200 --> 29:52.760]  what the general says as well we're on the march the empires on the run Alex

[30:20.360 --> 30:25.120]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:25.120 --> 30:28.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:05.600 --> 33:09.760]  GCN radio network
[33:16.880 --> 33:22.800]  well my friends for the next hour joining us from Pakistan is Lieutenant
[33:22.800 --> 33:27.560]  General Hamid Ghul you've seen the mainstream media say that he's quote
[33:27.560 --> 33:33.080]  quarterbacking and commanding all the attacks on our forces in Afghanistan and
[33:33.080 --> 33:37.520]  Pakistan of course from my research this is not the case he was the big hero
[33:37.520 --> 33:42.200]  the Pakistani general the head of the ISI who led the attacks against the
[33:42.200 --> 33:46.840]  Soviet invasion and let me read over his bio then he'll be with us for the
[33:46.840 --> 33:52.080]  next hour Hamid Ghul was commissioned the Pakistani Army in 58 he was an
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.520]  armored corps 19 Lancers tank commander in major battles on the front with India
[33:58.520 --> 34:04.320]  in 1965 during 72 to 76 he directly served under another top general as
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.560]  battalion commander when General Zia was the GOC first armored division and
[34:09.560 --> 34:15.120]  commander of the second corps it goes on Ghul was promoted to Brigadier General
[34:15.120 --> 34:21.280]  in 1978 and steadily rose to be commander of the first armored division in 1980
[34:21.280 --> 34:28.560]  Ghul was then sent to H to the GHQ as the DG military intelligence under top
[34:28.560 --> 34:33.680]  general who then nominated him as the ISI chief succeeding another general in
[34:33.680 --> 34:40.360]  March of 1987 he was later replaced by ISI commander by Prime Minister Benazir
[34:40.360 --> 34:45.000]  Budo in May of 1989 he was then transferred to commander of the second
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.640]  corps and this capacity general Ghul conducted the Zarb E Moham military
[34:52.640 --> 34:56.680]  exercise in November December of 89 the biggest Pakistani armed forces show of
[34:56.680 --> 35:02.720]  muscle since 71 Indo-Pakistan war until now so he's been a front line commander
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.920]  and of course the general and the head of Pakistani intelligence and I won't go
[35:06.920 --> 35:11.600]  any further I've got a huge laundry list of things to talk about with the
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.480]  general two years ago when they had the Mumbai attacks he came on the show and
[35:15.480 --> 35:21.320]  said the evidence shows it was staged by British Israeli and US intelligence
[35:21.320 --> 35:29.000]  it's now come out in the Chicago Tribune with the headline that US agent was the
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.840]  head of that attack the head of Indian intelligence also said the West led the
[35:33.840 --> 35:37.880]  false flag attack to blame it on Pakistan and to get Pakistan and India
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.560]  fighting again that's how they play them off against each other Hameed Ghul is
[35:42.560 --> 35:46.440]  also questioned the official story of 9-11 he's also going to give us his
[35:46.440 --> 35:54.080]  expert take on why the US is quote failing in its war in Afghanistan and he
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.880]  joins us now for a full hour Lieutenant General Hameed Ghul thank you for
[35:58.880 --> 36:04.520]  joining us and thank you my greetings to all your audience please why did you
[36:04.520 --> 36:10.600]  agree to come on this broadcast general well basically because my version is not
[36:10.600 --> 36:17.320]  going out to America I have been denied the visa to travel to America and these
[36:17.320 --> 36:21.560]  people would not let me into America because they're afraid that I will speak
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.960]  the truth people will listen to the truth and then they would find out that
[36:25.960 --> 36:32.800]  these people have made a mess of the American plans they are actually deceiving
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.640]  their own people the American generals are failing the American intelligence is
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.160]  a disaster and they know that I will speak in their idiom and because I've
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.200]  worked with them I've done my intelligence course you did not mention
[36:46.200 --> 36:52.360]  it in my career record I did an intelligence course in Okinawa when I
[36:52.360 --> 36:58.840]  was a captain under the US Army and I know exactly where the failings are and
[36:58.840 --> 37:04.520]  they do not want it exposed but lately I was quite concerned because I was on
[37:04.520 --> 37:13.040]  Fritz Zakaria show GPS from two weeks back maybe 10-12 days back and also with
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.920]  Becky Anderson and they cut me out totally not Becky Anderson but Fritz
[37:18.920 --> 37:25.480]  Zakaria he recorded me for 30 minutes but he put out only six minutes of my
[37:25.480 --> 37:30.160]  version because that is not fair because I was informed and especially the
[37:30.160 --> 37:36.160]  things that I said which were stark realities and he wanted obviously to
[37:36.160 --> 37:42.120]  keep the American people in dark about these things failing which are going on
[37:42.120 --> 37:48.960]  in Afghanistan of the American policy of the American military generals they are
[37:48.960 --> 37:54.520]  failing in every possible respect I this is my academic position and I am
[37:54.520 --> 38:00.960]  prepared to face any general in America any people in the academia that look
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.640]  this is what is going wrong I'm a friend of American people I criticize their
[38:05.640 --> 38:09.840]  policy and they think that anyone who criticizes the policy is the enemy this
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.520]  is totally wrong this is a misperception we work together with the CIA we work
[38:14.520 --> 38:19.640]  together with the Americans I have a lot of friends there I respect them and I
[38:19.640 --> 38:24.800]  could also my advice could also be useful even at this time because nobody
[38:24.800 --> 38:28.640]  understands their farm society better than I do because I worked with them I
[38:28.640 --> 38:34.440]  read their soul I read their spirit and I know I respect those people I admire
[38:34.440 --> 38:39.240]  their courage and their value they have to be your friends it's period I'm
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.920]  telling you you cannot afford to lose Afghanistan as a friendly country but
[38:44.920 --> 38:49.080]  unfortunately the way things are going if they are not handled properly the
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.640]  future of Afghanistan would be hostile to America which would neither be in the
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.360]  interest of Pakistan nor in the interest of America and its allies but
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.960]  general it would be in the interest of the global crime syndicate known as the
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.480]  New World Order that wants to bring order out of chaos that wants to create
[39:06.480 --> 39:12.760]  crises that wants to destabilize Pakistan and Afghanistan and ship hundreds
[39:12.760 --> 39:16.560]  of billions of dollars of opium out a year to the streets of America they
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.840]  think we're so stupid they admit on Fox News that our troops help grow the
[39:21.840 --> 39:28.000]  opium in Afghanistan now so the reasons were there were publicly told one thing
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.560]  but we're actually there for another reason destabilization I want you to
[39:32.560 --> 39:37.960]  speak to that and see if you agree but first you are live uncensored what do
[39:37.960 --> 39:42.480]  you want to tell the American people on more than 80 AM and FM radio stations
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.320]  and the number one internet radio show in the world what do you want to tell the
[39:46.320 --> 39:50.960]  world about what's really happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan because just
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.720]  three weeks ago they finally admitted that they had been lying and that US
[39:55.720 --> 40:02.840]  advisors troops and mercenaries blackwater and others have been operating
[40:02.840 --> 40:08.160]  illegally inside Pakistan in what I have analyzed to be a destabilization
[40:08.160 --> 40:14.160]  campaign what's really going on over there general well we know that black
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.920]  water now operating under the title of the worldwide services and then corp which
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.560]  is another such organization they are called the security contractor this is
[40:25.560 --> 40:33.880]  a fundamental fault there are 105,000 security contractor the troopers of the
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.960]  security contractor operating in Afghanistan alone and I guess there are
[40:38.960 --> 40:43.840]  no figures available I think no less than 2000 are operating inside Pakistan
[40:43.840 --> 40:50.920]  now this is something which ought never have to be done because the reason is
[40:50.920 --> 40:56.480]  that the professional army is when they start engaging the services of civilians
[40:56.480 --> 41:02.840]  whose motivation is none other than making money and the cashing dollars then
[41:02.840 --> 41:07.680]  you can expect the kind of results that the Americans are getting and American
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.760]  people the taxpayers they have to shut out a lot of money lot of American blood
[41:12.760 --> 41:19.480]  is going to waste now all this is a disaster because you and now the latest
[41:19.480 --> 41:24.840]  one is the WikiLeaks in this again all the compilation that they've been doing
[41:24.840 --> 41:29.480]  on which they have been basing their plans I tell you it's a disaster it's
[41:29.480 --> 41:35.960]  an intelligence disaster why because they have a heavily dependent they have
[41:35.960 --> 41:41.200]  depended on the security contractors for even intelligence gathering now
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.840]  imagine how can they be such foolish people I mean the CIA the FBI and all
[41:47.840 --> 41:55.120]  the other and the to top it all there is this task 4373 which has been indulging
[41:55.120 --> 41:59.700]  in massive civilian casualties they've been killing people left right in
[41:59.700 --> 42:03.520]  center and every time they have given the information they have bombed the
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.840]  marriage parties they have bombed the funeral procession they have bombed
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.600]  innocent and they have even bombed the hospital so can you imagine that the
[42:13.600 --> 42:21.080]  intelligence based on the information provided by security contractors has
[42:21.080 --> 42:27.920]  resulted in this massive violation of human rights it has been anti-humanity
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.440]  it has destroyed everything that American people and American
[42:32.440 --> 42:38.920]  Constitution ever stood for it has defied the spirit of the original charter of
[42:38.920 --> 42:44.920]  America American Constitution and the human rights charter everything that you
[42:44.920 --> 42:50.000]  hold so dear to your heart the American people they have violated it here in
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.200]  Pakistan and Afghanistan general let me go back to something you said I'm gonna
[42:54.200 --> 42:59.480]  put in layman terms you have tens of billions of dollars and no bid contracts
[42:59.480 --> 43:06.320]  going to Dincorp going to XZ formerly blackwater blackwater worldwide they
[43:06.320 --> 43:12.720]  have a incentive to want the wars to continue and to be expanded because
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.280]  they're making billions of dollars out of it so of course they're gonna give
[43:16.280 --> 43:21.120]  intelligence to blame Pakistan and widen the war of course they're going to give
[43:21.120 --> 43:26.480]  intelligence that targets civilians knowing that there is the honor code in
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.840]  Pakistan and Afghanistan just like there was in the past here in America
[43:30.840 --> 43:34.480]  before we lost our souls to a certain extent that if you kill somebody's
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.960]  wife or children they are going to kill you or die trying to kill you with this
[43:39.960 --> 43:44.480]  blood-honored debt that's why they continue and now they admit have the CIA
[43:44.480 --> 43:52.200]  and the army piloting drones from Virginia and they are killing quote in
[43:52.200 --> 43:57.320]  fact guy search this term no name terrorist if someone has a gun when
[43:57.320 --> 44:01.000]  everybody has guns over there it's a you know so-called free country like
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.120]  America used to be and they are killing innocent people knowing it's going to
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.360]  stir them up and make them mad so they fight back then they can call them
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.720]  terrorist then they can expand the war then the contractors can make more
[44:13.720 --> 44:22.600]  money precisely Alex this is exactly you have painted it so beautifully and so
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.880]  vividly they could not be a better explanation this honor code is as old as
[44:27.880 --> 44:34.120]  the Afan society itself I mean it runs through their blood for past fifty five
[44:34.120 --> 44:39.560]  thousand years and this is called Pahtun Wali Pahtun Wali is an honor code this
[44:39.560 --> 44:45.480]  is this evokes even stronger sentiments than the religion therefore these people
[44:45.480 --> 44:51.760]  are not going to forgive all this and I am afraid that we will have lost this
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.720]  region forever to America to the West and this will not be good for us I agree I
[44:56.720 --> 45:02.920]  think it is still time that we redress the situation and some sense is driven
[45:02.920 --> 45:08.040]  into the heads which are which seem to be totally blocked to or impervious to
[45:08.040 --> 45:12.720]  any kind of sensible suggestion but I think we must keep on trying I think
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.400]  these are the this is the last lap and in which we are not going and this
[45:17.400 --> 45:22.560]  struggle is going to end in a very big disaster for American reputation for
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.160]  their honor for their self-respect and we don't want to have this done I can
[45:27.160 --> 45:32.080]  assure you I generally am telling this because American people are such noble
[45:32.080 --> 45:37.480]  people sometimes they say they are so gullible and they are so innocent that
[45:37.480 --> 45:43.800]  this borders on being criminally innocent because of their innocence we
[45:43.800 --> 45:48.280]  are suffering we are suffering for no reason at all but because American
[45:48.280 --> 45:54.480]  people's gallability their innocence is exploited by their leader that is why we
[45:54.480 --> 45:58.720]  suffer and they suffer as well well I think this is time now we redress the
[45:58.720 --> 46:03.120]  situation well general as you know this is the divide and conquer British model
[46:03.120 --> 46:08.320]  you had Mohammed Mosaddek somewhat secular pro-western but he wanted to
[46:08.320 --> 46:13.360]  build up Iran and keep some of their own money so they used radical Muslims to
[46:13.360 --> 46:19.680]  overthrow him then they put the shy in and double crossed the the the Muslims
[46:19.680 --> 46:25.120]  then the same thing with the Serbs they use the Albanians to break up southern
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.480]  Serbia same thing with Saddam they put him in power they have him overthrow the
[46:29.480 --> 46:34.040]  Bathas they put him in power they have him attack Iran then they tell him
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.600]  invade Kuwait then they set him up now they've set up sectarian Sunni Shiite
[46:38.600 --> 46:44.840]  violence everything is to is to break down and destabilize your countries I
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.960]  mean so there is a rhyme and reason to this it's just so cold-blooded and so
[46:49.960 --> 46:56.080]  evil the average person cannot grasp it
[46:56.080 --> 47:02.520]  Alex I think America American policymakers have for their own reason I
[47:02.520 --> 47:07.080]  don't know I have not been able to fathom that as yet but they have allowed the
[47:07.080 --> 47:16.280]  old British what what would we say mischievous mind to lead American
[47:16.280 --> 47:22.360]  policymaking by the nose and I can tell you I know them I worked with them I did
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.920]  my staff course they are in Camberlay in the UK and I know them inside out they
[47:27.920 --> 47:33.400]  are extremely jealous of America they do not want to see America flourish inside
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.320]  their heart they don't they want to pull their leg they make full of them and they
[47:38.320 --> 47:46.720]  talk about it they they have coined jokes for for the American so this is this
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.280]  has to be done away with that is fundamental the other power which for its
[47:52.280 --> 47:58.240]  own reason and those are very mischievous reasons that is Israel and Israel now is
[47:58.240 --> 48:04.080]  joined in by the Indians unfortunately so they together they formed the club that
[48:04.080 --> 48:11.040]  club is you can call it the extra or ultra imperial club this imperial club is
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.160]  responsible for a lot of problems in the world and American people are exploited
[48:16.160 --> 48:19.920]  they are I they are the most innocent people on God that but they are
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.880]  expected to the Hilt for that implementation of their dark impulse
[48:24.880 --> 48:30.560]  and their dark agenda which is the only handful of people there is a click
[48:30.560 --> 48:36.600]  only in my assessment who are indulging indulging in this exercise general
[48:36.600 --> 48:41.080]  let's get into WikiLeaks I noticed day one that what the media focused on out
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.360]  of 90 plus thousand documents were documents battlefield reports as you
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.840]  said fed by private contractors a classically unreliable completely
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.920]  unreliable it's like going to the devil you know for the truth and it all points
[48:55.920 --> 49:01.920]  at Pakistan it all points at you it says that Hamid Ghul here's the quote is
[49:01.920 --> 49:07.640]  quarterbacking this is the Washington Post is quarterbacking direct attacks
[49:07.640 --> 49:16.760]  against US forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan and if this is the kind of
[49:16.760 --> 49:22.680]  intelligence that America is facing its policies on in this region then God help
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.360]  America because this is totally false it's fabricated and I tell you who are
[49:28.360 --> 49:33.120]  the elements involved in it one the Afghan intelligence and good luck that
[49:33.120 --> 49:38.640]  Amar Allah Saleh who was an old communist who was heading the intelligence
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.640]  setup of Afghanistan and the intelligence service there in Afghanistan is
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.360]  still infested by the old communist diehard and they have an axe to grind
[49:50.360 --> 49:55.520]  especially against me as a person because I was responsible in part for
[49:55.520 --> 50:01.000]  their ouster from Afghanistan from their ouster from power then the Indians
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.760]  have joined up with them and they also have things to settle with Pakistan
[50:05.760 --> 50:09.800]  they want to destabilize Pakistan they're sitting on our back back with
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.440]  the under the shadow of America and they're stabbing Pakistan and ally a
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.960]  friend of America we have been friend not now but we have been friend right
[50:18.960 --> 50:24.920]  through the days of Cold War ever since Mr. Dulles foster Dulles he framed the
[50:24.920 --> 50:30.240]  policy of defending Pakistan we have been a very loyal friend of America and we
[50:30.240 --> 50:36.360]  have given huge sacrifices to uphold that friendship but unfortunately the
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.480]  Indians would have us put down completely and they would want Pakistan to be
[50:41.480 --> 50:47.080]  subservient to India this is not acceptable to people of Pakistan now
[50:47.080 --> 50:55.200]  this is how WikiLeaks has been giving of course there are only 180 reports which
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.320]  with regard to Pakistan and my personal eight times I've been mentioned in this but
[51:00.320 --> 51:07.800]  I said to the CNN also for heaven's sake if you think that a 74 years old general
[51:07.800 --> 51:15.040]  retired from 18 and a half years ago from the army and left ISI 21 years ago if
[51:15.040 --> 51:19.360]  he's still responsible for defeating America in Afghanistan which is
[51:19.360 --> 51:24.280]  inevitable because America is now they have to continence with defeat in
[51:24.280 --> 51:29.480]  Afghanistan there is no way and I will speak about it professionally at a
[51:29.480 --> 51:36.520]  later stage if you ask me so if they are going to record it in history in the
[51:36.520 --> 51:41.720]  history books what are the American future generation going to read that the
[51:41.720 --> 51:47.320]  mightiest power ever in the history of the mankind was defeated with the help
[51:47.320 --> 51:53.840]  of a retired 74 years old general living in his house in retired life I mean
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.760]  this would be shameful they would be ashamed of it let's let the future
[51:57.760 --> 52:02.080]  generation not be ashamed speak the truth that you have failed you have
[52:02.080 --> 52:06.880]  failed because your own policymakers have not come up with the recipes that
[52:06.880 --> 52:12.240]  were required your own generals would not mayer up to the past that was given
[52:12.240 --> 52:16.480]  to them so why don't you accept the failure rather than rub the blame on
[52:16.480 --> 52:21.920]  somebody else and start finding scapegoats and those two scapegoats
[52:21.920 --> 52:27.320]  which would not sell in the market please for God's sake as far as I am
[52:27.320 --> 52:31.400]  concerned I can tell you my future generation will be proud that he was
[52:31.400 --> 52:36.560]  responsible not only in defeat of one superpower but in defeat of another
[52:36.560 --> 52:40.640]  superpower also but that's not the case I don't want America to be defeated there
[52:40.640 --> 52:45.280]  I want them to exit Afghanistan gracefully I don't want them to get
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.280]  involved into a running fight in Afghanistan like they did in Vietnam
[52:49.280 --> 52:54.600]  why don't they learn their lesson and in Vietnam also it's not too far back in
[52:54.600 --> 52:59.640]  history West general Westmoreland he was a natural failure and he was such a big
[52:59.640 --> 53:03.840]  hero he was being cast in the image of a hero and he kept on demanding more and
[53:03.840 --> 53:09.280]  more troops in the end they were he had something like five hundred fifty six
[53:09.280 --> 53:13.560]  thousand troops over half a million troops and what did you do I mean they
[53:13.560 --> 53:18.600]  ran out from from Vietnam why could they not have thought of it earlier on and
[53:18.600 --> 53:24.880]  similar situation now confronts them in Afghanistan so it's from my point of
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.960]  view being a friend of America I want that America should go out gracefully
[53:29.960 --> 53:35.400]  leaving behind them a friendly Afghanistan and it is possible I can tell
[53:35.400 --> 53:40.240]  you it is doable it is still doable but tomorrow it may not be doable today it is
[53:40.240 --> 53:46.640]  doable from from my point of view as I assess the situation it is doable it is
[53:46.640 --> 53:51.600]  doable that Afghan society is allowed to evolve slowly into a modern society
[53:51.600 --> 53:57.880]  okay also doable general going I think there will be no option left but to cut
[53:57.880 --> 54:02.440]  and run out of Afghanistan general we just skipped that break with some
[54:02.440 --> 54:06.080]  stations I may have gone to it we're talking to Lieutenant General Hameed
[54:06.080 --> 54:11.600]  ghoul former head of Pakistani intelligence and I want to get more
[54:11.600 --> 54:14.920]  into WikiLeaks I want to go back to the Mumbai attack because you joined us a
[54:14.920 --> 54:20.120]  few years ago just a few weeks after that tragic event and you fingered
[54:20.120 --> 54:25.720]  Western intelligence for staging it to stir up in the team between India and
[54:25.720 --> 54:31.360]  Pakistan and as a pretext to bring US forces covertly into Pakistan we now
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.880]  know that was the case I want to show viewers mainstream news here in the
[54:35.880 --> 54:39.600]  United States including the Chicago Tribune and others admitting that quote
[54:39.600 --> 54:44.800]  the head of that attack was a US agent and explain to people why they do
[54:44.800 --> 54:51.200]  this and but first let's get into a basic boil down from your military
[54:51.200 --> 54:57.560]  expertise and expert on the region what the real policy what the real objective
[54:57.560 --> 55:03.160]  has been by the United States being used by these globalist inside your
[55:03.160 --> 55:08.040]  country and bordering Afghanistan a what are they really doing there what's
[55:08.040 --> 55:13.640]  their real aims versus their public aims be what has really happened in the eight
[55:13.640 --> 55:21.080]  years of occupation and see where all this is going yeah nine years of
[55:21.080 --> 55:26.400]  occupation nine years of this dirty war which has been going on for a wrong
[55:26.400 --> 55:32.520]  purpose at a wrong time in a wrong place now what is the real the declared of the
[55:32.520 --> 55:39.240]  stated goal of the war was to disperse Al Qaeda to catch Osama bin Laden and now
[55:39.240 --> 55:45.760]  lately President Obama has come up with a new formulation and that says that we
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.600]  have to reverse the momentum of Taliban and who are Taliban Taliban are
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.600]  resistance fighters they are the Mujahideen of the old I mean they are the
[55:56.600 --> 56:02.480]  same people or their sons and role who fought against the Soviet Union and they
[56:02.480 --> 56:06.360]  are fighting for the same reason as they were fighting against the Soviet Union
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.680]  at that time what is that reason that reason is to protect their way of life
[56:11.680 --> 56:17.000]  whatever it is you may not agree with that way of life but the point is as you
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.080]  are jealous of protecting your way of life they are jealous of protecting their
[56:22.080 --> 56:29.200]  way of life the other is liberation because they look upon the Americans and
[56:29.200 --> 56:34.600]  the Allied forces as the occupation forces and so they want to liberate they
[56:34.600 --> 56:38.920]  will not settle for anything less than that so really you are fighting the
[56:38.920 --> 56:44.920]  Afghan nation do you want to reverse the momentum of the Afghan nation is it
[56:44.920 --> 56:49.840]  achievable in my opinion it is not achievable it is not worth it it is
[56:49.840 --> 56:53.960]  first of all it is not proper it is not morally correct that you should be
[56:53.960 --> 57:01.320]  trying to state jacket a nation and as a nation as proud as the Afghan in
[57:01.320 --> 57:06.320]  certain world that you have visualized for them this is immoral this is
[57:06.320 --> 57:12.120]  incorrect and it is not achievable so the real name the hidden name the latent
[57:12.120 --> 57:20.920]  aim I have been saying that before also that was basically a for corporate
[57:20.920 --> 57:27.600]  America to install itself within the in the center of the oil-rich area the
[57:27.600 --> 57:35.520]  resources of the Caspian Basin Basin area resources of the Middle East being
[57:35.520 --> 57:41.800]  to check China from moving into this region that is the strategy came and see
[57:41.800 --> 57:47.680]  to any new system should not emerge because they are afraid that their
[57:47.680 --> 57:53.320]  system is a failure and if any new system based on Islamic principles of
[57:53.320 --> 57:59.120]  egalitarian egalitarianism equality fraternity and freedom if these
[57:59.120 --> 58:03.600]  principles are really adopted then imperial powers will have no place to
[58:03.600 --> 58:10.840]  hide so really this was the second third aim and fourth one unfortunately and
[58:10.840 --> 58:16.440]  very unfortunate for America is to provide a security shield to the state
[58:16.440 --> 58:23.320]  of Israel and with that they want to strengthen India now imagine a country as
[58:23.320 --> 58:30.760]  big as powerful as enlightened as America should be acting to provide
[58:30.760 --> 58:36.280]  security to somebody else general goal general goal got a break back in 70

[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:26.520]  Alex Jones well ladies and gentlemen of the last 30 minutes the tired Lieutenant
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.800]  General Hamid ghoul has been our guest former head of Pakistani intelligence
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:36.520]  the Washington Post wrote if the documents are to be believed and the
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.040]  uncooperated US intelligence reports must be read with caution so they add
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.560]  that this is just battlefield reports fed by contractors goal has taken a
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:53.400]  direct hand in quarterbacking attacks against US-led forces in Afghanistan
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:59.120]  ghoul calls the reports fiction and nothing else so this is a guy from what
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.560]  I've seen who's told the truth I mean I don't trust anybody except my wife and
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:10.200]  children and God but I just go off long-term study long-term looking at
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.400]  geopolitical systems the British model of the great game that our country's
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.000]  adopted how we're being used I mean for five years US troops and contractors
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.880]  have been sneaking around in Afghanistan excuse me nine years there in
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.880]  Pakistan and now they came out three weeks ago and admitted okay we lied to
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:33.280]  you we got contractors and troops there and you know ghoul said two years ago
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.480]  on the show they were there to stir up the tribal areas to destabilize
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.520]  Pakistan and now that's admitted I mean these global corporations that suck us
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.480]  dry with these wars they have a motive to expand these wars so this is a short
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.000]  segment general but brief answers on this finishing up on Israel and the US
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.960]  being used as a tool that you were talking about there and then how can we
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.200]  get out of there on friendly terms with the Pakistan's folks and with the
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:10.280]  Afghans and versus how it will end if we don't pull out let me tell you that
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.000]  there is everything to begin by pulling out and there's everything to be lost
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.360]  by continuing to stay here so that's my judgment and I'm quite convinced that
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.000]  this is right now by pulling out you are going to because there is a natural
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.400]  affinity between America and Pakistan and America and even Afghanistan because
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.080]  you know they have cooperated in the past throughout we have a long history of
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.960]  cooperation when India was in the USSR camp Pakistan was all along was an
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.720]  Afghanistan too was in the American camp Afghanistan made a mistake of being in
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.560]  the US USR camp and USR came and attacked it at that time and of course
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:56.480]  they resisted and Pakistan stood behind them America stood behind them also and
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.120]  then don't forget that so if you pull out and that is very simple you have to
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:07.240]  have a change of heart and I have given that message clearly I said I am
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.680]  prepared to come discuss with you face the court go for a hearing before the
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.000]  Senate or the Congress whatever you want me to do I am prepared if I'm a
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.480]  terrorist if I am quarterbacking as you will likely said this attacks in
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:30.400]  Afghanistan then you can catch me I mean terrorist who is offering himself he
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:37.360]  said okay catch me told me responsible take me anywhere to Congress to any court to
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.640]  any interrogation center I'm prepared for all this they are lying I tell you
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.080]  they are lying to the American people more than anyone else and we have if
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.720]  they have a change of heart we will find ways and means when they can pull out
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:58.880]  safely they will not be followed now the speech that President Obama made on
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:06.680]  8th of May 2009 in Cairo addressing the other University I think that was
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:12.800]  remarkable because in this he had said if there is no chance of attack or there
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.320]  is no threat of attack from that region to America then in that case we are
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.640]  prepared to pull out every single group from that region and I at that time also
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:30.120]  on some of the TV channels I said that this is a legitimate demand okay we
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.640]  accept this that there should be no attack on America from this area
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.960]  general stay there has ever been found in the past also and that automatically
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.560]  means that the responsibility will be on the new government which will be
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.280]  installed in Afghanistan to make sure that there is no threat or to America
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.080]  interest general I'm sorry to interrupt you we've got to go to break come back
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.100]  and repeat that thought and finish it up we'll be right back with general
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:02.680]  hami ghoul the question is where should the American people draw their line in
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:08.280]  the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.740]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.760]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.880]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.760]  define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what

[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.640]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.160]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric

[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.440]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.200]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:15.800]  an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.680]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:25.560]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.000]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.760]  every one of the super-states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:40.640]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:58.400]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.960]  well we've been talking to Lieutenant General Hamed Ghoul about a host of
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:15.800]  really important issues and he's joining us from Pakistan last time we had him
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:22.360]  on the regular phone number was being blocked and we were having trouble
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.640]  getting through on the other line and it looks like we may be having some phone
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.160]  troubles now we may try to reconnect with him in a moment general do we have
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:43.400]  you now again I have researched all of this information in depth and we've
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.400]  had the former CIA commander for the entire Afghan war on he wrote the book
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.400]  Jawbreaker and he admitted that they would pick up 12 13 14 15 year old kids
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:10:00.040]  and would send them to Guantanamo Bay as terrorists knowing they were totally
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.360]  innocent just to create this illusion it's a manufactured war as a pretext to
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:14.760]  feed our troops into a meat grinder as a giant laboratory of control and that's
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.800]  the bottom line of what's been going on here going back to General Hamed Ghoul
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:30.320]  general I have looked at all of the information concerned here and clearly
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.160]  the Pentagon plan is to expand the war into Pakistan they now admit that US
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.040]  forces and contractors are there illegally Congress had been lied to
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.600]  about this where is all this leading and what are the Western forces doing in
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:51.960]  Pakistan well there on the sabotage of version mission and inciting people to
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:58.320]  rise against the gentle government of Pakistan so they are only destabilizing
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.400]  exercise not realizing that this is going to hurt them more than it is going
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.000]  to hurt us because we are in any case suffering there is a spate of floods at
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.840]  the moment we are facing in Pakistan it's a great human tragedy that we are in
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:18.960]  the middle of it and on top of it our friends America and their allies some of
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:25.600]  their allies and India they are in collusion to bash Pakistan and to really
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.360]  unravel it from inside but this is very unfair and I don't think they will be
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.720]  able to do it at the end of the day I think if they get embroiled in Pakistan
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:40.560]  then they will keep on staying here for a very long time and I don't think the
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.280]  American people have a heart for it I think 60% of Americans are already
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.680]  against this war and if they are going to expand this war because I know one
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:56.160]  thing the irregular fight that is going to be put up to Americans whether in
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:03.840]  Pakistan Afghanistan or Iran now the larger the area of conflict and longer
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.680]  the period of conflict the established power the one who is equipped with more
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:15.400]  firepower cannot win this is a lesson from history and it is immutable
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.840]  because if they enlarge the area of conflict then they will get more
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.440]  embroiled into some of the very difficult things which they can't foresee at this
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:30.400]  moment so I think it is professionally very very unwise for America to get
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:39.520]  involved into a conflict inside Pakistan. General Gull where is this leading if
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.680]  the United States doesn't pull out I mean clearly our government controlled by
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.440]  these offshore corporate interest wants to expand this into Pakistan with this
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.160]  destabilization from your research how many contractors are sneaking around in
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:00.760]  your country versus a regular US forces? Well I think security contractors at this
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.800]  moment they are trying to spread their wings into Balochistan area and
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.440]  Americans have been granted permission it is understood to open because they
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.640]  arm crystals to our government and our leaders very conveniently and they are
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:23.880]  going to open a consulate in Quetta and I think it will have two purposes
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:30.160]  one to continue to fend the ongoing insurgency which is artificially
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:37.560]  being sponsored in Balochistan which is largest of our provinces because of
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.960]  its very huge size and because of its border with Makaran coast the coastal
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:48.960]  line most is covered by this province and it is it's a long border with Iran it
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.920]  is about 900 kilometers long water that we share with Iran so it has two purpose
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:02.520]  a to destabilize Pakistan and b to get inside Iran and try to destabilize them
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:08.480]  because those areas are Sunni populated and they are definitely trying to create
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:15.200]  a problem for Iran from that point so really there at this moment I would put
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:21.200]  the figure of the security context contractor to less than 5000 I don't
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.960]  think they are more than this number and they are trying to expand because very
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:34.280]  recently 650 visas were issued to American servicemen and they come in CVs
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.520]  this is very unfortunate that servicemen traditionally should be used in
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.520]  uniform but when you start using them in civilian clothes this is not their job
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:52.320]  a soldier is brought in bread and he is he is not his training is to fight
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:15:00.680]  daily on the battlefield so they're trying to turn them into covert spies so
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.640]  they can't be differentiated between them regular troops and the different
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:13.400]  contractors speaking of Iran general ghoul we continue to hear over and over
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:19.960]  again that Iran is funding insurgency in Pakistan and Afghanistan and many
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.800]  analysts even here in the West even many people in the CIA say that that's
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:32.680]  asinine that that's a lie what's the truth they're not doing anything of
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:38.360]  this nature but they would have us believe that Iran is our enemy they are
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.280]  not our enemy they have no hostility between Iran and Pakistan that border
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.360]  is quiet there is absolutely peaceful movement of good and people on that
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:57.200]  border so this is not a lie it's only to malign Iran but I tell you Israel is
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.680]  hell bent to draw America into a wider war by attacking we're attacking Iran
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:11.160]  if they go in for literally to attack some target even drop a few bombs here
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:15.360]  and there I think it will flare up a conflict that they will not be able to
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.440]  control and America is likely to get sucked into this war and this may turn
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:25.320]  out to be the third world war it will be a disaster of the first order I think it
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:29.160]  must be avoided at all costs well general ghoul it's not just you a
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.700]  formidable intelligence and military expert who's you have worked at every
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:38.400]  level from you know ground commander up to you know major general right through
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:45.000]  here but dealing with this the word that I get from reama govern high level
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.560]  CIA analyst retired and others is that they're looking at greenlighting it this
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:56.000]  month they may attack Israel may attack in the next 15 days or even sooner we
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.600]  are on the edge of what most even Western analysts say and the Russians agree
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:07.280]  could lead to world war three yes I agree with you I would say that
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.120]  independently I didn't have this information that you have but all the
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.320]  same I think my calculation as a strategist and as an intelligence expert
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:21.720]  is that this would be a disaster I don't think that Russia can be kept back or
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.920]  China for that matter I don't know which all of the countries will get sucked
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.280]  into this in brolio and this will be an inferno that will consume so many things
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.240]  and corporate America would be the biggest sufferer they don't realize this
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:42.600]  because if it results eventually in destabilization of the entire region
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.280]  where are they going to sell their goods and how are they going to pick up the oil
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:51.840]  especially the European countries will be the biggest sufferers and Japanese
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.560]  economy will collapse so many things will happen you can't simply clean
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:59.920]  calculable at this time by the way that's what literally hundreds of top
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.480]  Western analysts are saying they confer with general hameed ghoul general we're
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.040]  running out of time and we've got one more segment coming up I may try to keep
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.560]  you a bit longer but I wanted to get into some other issues we're also
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.360]  simulcasting on television if I can have a document cam shot right here
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.680]  evidence moon by attackers were Anglo-American Intel operatives that's
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:27.760]  Kurt Nemo in November of 2008 about the moon by attacks now we have December of
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:35.080]  last year times of London moon by terror suspect David Headley was rogue US agent
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.800]  the Chicago Tribune went on to report he was the commander of the operation the
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.520]  head of Indian counterterrorism said it was a western op but they killed him
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:50.160]  that day to shut him up here's another one Chicago man charged in 2008 moon by
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.520]  terror attacks intelligence connection so how did you know two years ago day
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.720]  one that this was a western op that they tried to blame on you in Pakistan
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:05.720]  well I have an uncanny fix about this because of my experience because of
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.080]  fact that I worked with the CIA and I know how their mind works I can read
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:18.960]  their mind for instance I had said that this attack 9-11 attack was the
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.680]  because of the internal cavity in inside America itself today they have not
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.480]  been able to come up with a charge sheet of against Osama bin Laden he should
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:34.320]  have been tried in absentia if they had enough evidence on him general I got to
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.760]  stop you this is too important I want you to start over when we come back and
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.280]  talk about Osama bin Laden of course CNN said that you had no evidence of that
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.640]  when bin Laden's on record saying you didn't do it the CIA now admits two
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.200]  months ago that they created a fake bin Laden video fact print me that Washington
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:55.720]  Post at spy talk CIA created fake bin Laden video stay there general hameed

[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:07.120]  BERKEY today okay he's a retired three-star general so it is Lieutenant General former
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:13.400]  head of Pakistani Intelligence General Hamed Ghul and he is with us today and I
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.280]  have to tell you I've researched this all in-depth myself it's been declassified
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:22.680]  the CIA Mossad in my six-stage terror attacks they're doing everything they
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.120]  can to get us into a full bore war with Pakistan then they'll have to go in with
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:33.400]  a full invasion to get the nukes and I I mean if you think that the Afghans are
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.760]  tough and hard to beat the Pakistanis are just as tough or tougher and have
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:41.080]  nuclear weapons but I'll get into that in a moment with General Ghul General
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:45.640]  Ghul you I brought up the Mumbai attacks it was later confirmed that that was run
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.040]  by Western Intelligence and you were getting into 9-11 being an inside job
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.480]  please spend some time on that yeah 9-11 they haven't given the evidence so far
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.680]  and I think much hype was created now they don't even mention about Osama
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:06.080]  bin Laden the latest statement is by General Petraeus he said that he is so far away
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.000]  that whether he's alive or dead doesn't matter at all so that way they have
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.920]  forgotten about Osama bin Laden now and they are out to destroy the Afghan
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.800]  nation and then come for Pakistan from day one I said 9-11 was a pretext
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:27.880]  Afghanistan is the lodging place this is the staging point and from there they
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:34.520]  will jump into Pakistan and I fear that this is coming true but in Pakistan
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.880]  they are overwhelming interest of both India and Israel it's not America's
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.320]  interest because America wouldn't bother whether Pakistan has 30 40 or 100
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:48.320]  bombs it makes no difference to America we have no such hostility between us in
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.960]  fact we have been very fast friends in the past and we still are friends anyway
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.400]  the point is that Israel would simply not be able to digest Pakistan nuclear
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:05.160]  program nor the Indians so Pakistan nuclear program is one point which needs
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:11.360]  to be now resolved one way or another either they have to accept that Pakistan
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.080]  is a de facto nuclear power and should be entered into the nuclear club because
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.040]  that's a reality and the fact that they have not accepted it while India's
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.440]  nuclear capability has been accepted that means they are still out to destroy
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:33.360]  it somehow they can't reverse it and they cannot destroy it now that is where
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:39.040]  my understanding of Pakistan's ability Pakistan's will to resist and its
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:44.200]  resilience comes into play I can assure you there's a complete consensus in
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:51.040]  Pakistan on this one issue that nuclear capability we have to protect even if in
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:57.400]  in the process we end up with a total destruction doesn't matter but we will
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:03.120]  protect this capability of ours it's a great asset of Pakistan but my fear
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.640]  Alex says that if Pakistan is put to the corner and it is pushed against the
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:15.160]  wall Pakistan being an Islamic state could also declare the international
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.560]  jihad now if that Islamic state declares the international jihad it
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:25.320]  becomes binding on the Muslims of the rest of the world to come out to the
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.920]  support of jihad that is what will be it will change the modern history all
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.560]  together if that call is given so let Pakistan not be taken lightly by the
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:43.360]  adversaries by India by Israel or even by America Pakistan has a potential
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.880]  which is very dangerous potential we would like to do that but if we have no
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:54.480]  the charge if it is existentialist threat to us then anything is possible and it
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:00.480]  better be avoided by our adversaries general I'm showing viewers spy talk
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:05.400]  the issue from about two months ago in the Washington Post with a headline
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:11.760]  CIA's unit wacky idea depicts Saddam is gay but buried in the article they
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.520]  admit that they made fake bin Laden videos the famous bin Laden video is a
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.120]  fake so bin Laden was writing letters saying he didn't do this after the
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.040]  attacks meanwhile they use message boards and fake videos and they admit it
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.440]  was a fake video why would the CIA arrogantly come out admit they're growing
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.040]  the opium why would they arrogantly come out and brag that they are creating
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:42.320]  fake bin Laden videos I mean why why are they so arrogant well this is the
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.240]  imperial arrogance imperial hubris which I think if afflicts every nation which
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:52.320]  comes into that position where it stands at the pinnacle and there is no one to
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.760]  destroy them but they themselves to their own internal cavities destroy them
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:02.660]  their own arrogance and their own sense of injustices I mean that is what
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:07.920]  destroys them so I think they are the system is all self-destruct unfortunately
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.880]  their status somehow they are not able to handle it properly the sole
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.920]  superpower status because there are lesser men the leaders are lesser leaders
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.320]  they are there are big knees as far as intellectual capacity is concerned as
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:30.920]  far as their moral quality is concerned tapping me this is the problem of the
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:35.920]  leadership so I think why we in the third one countries usually cry about our
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:42.200]  leaders I think poor America is also really the rest of the quality leadership
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.960]  that they deserve at this time general stay there final segment with you coming

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:22.320]  pre-star general Hameed Ghoul former head of Pakistani intelligence who led the
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:27.720]  forces to victory against the Soviet bear when you watch the films and read
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.120]  the documents about the Soviets massacring villages carpet bombing
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:36.280]  villages it's exactly what our criminal government's doing the same
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:40.320]  corporations that have occupied Afghanistan using our military are
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:45.400]  occupying my country they're waging war against my bill of rights my
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.960]  constitution my children's future I want my republic back I want to be known as
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:55.240]  the land of the free home of the brave an example of goodness not an example of
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:00.160]  evil they lie to you they give you fake bin Laden videos they stage terror attacks
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.760]  they say Saddam's got WMD's when he doesn't and they want to start World War
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:11.920]  3 not just with Iran but Pakistan I concur with general ghoul's analysis 100
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:19.120]  percent from my own deep 18 hour a day research many days okay we are going into
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.560]  World War 3 and in general ghoul you talked about how they want to cause the
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.560]  collapse of Pakistan how they're funding radicals there which has been
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.080]  admitted they've been caught and how they want Pakistan to have their back
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.400]  against a wall so they have to declare an emergency jihad to protect
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.720]  themselves and call on aid as Afghanistan did so they can have what the
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.120]  PNAC documents and the Israelis and Dick Cheney called for in the September
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.360]  20th 2000 rebuilding America's defenses PNAC document a clash of civilizations
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.880]  they want to force the American people into a bare-knuckle war to fully commit
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.520]  us I believe they're going to set off nukes in the US and blame it on Pakistan
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:04.560]  and Iran I I see them putting out this story to where the Americans will howl
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:08.640]  with pure rage they will ship three million Americans over there blood
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:14.120]  thirsty ready for absolute genocide and so your people my people have to stand
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.200]  together against the New World Order just like they want to put two pit bulls
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:22.880]  in a in a ring and have us kill each other we don't need to do this we need
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.960]  to be smart enough to avert this and the evidence is clear we are on the verge
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.680]  of them launching World War 3 a clash between Christendom what's left of it
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:39.880]  in the West and the East a war without end general your comments my comment
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:44.040]  far that there is no clash of civilization but this is a myth that has been created
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.160]  unfortunately there has to be meeting of civilization and as far as Islam is
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.760]  concerned why is it being looked upon as an enemy as an adversary
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:59.240]  Islam encompasses Christianity and Judaism it is not an entity in itself but
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:04.240]  actually it encompasses all the three religions of the book so there has to be
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:10.480]  enmity peace among us and everyone has to gain from it and therefore there is no
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.560]  need for the dark impulse in the American system I won't say in the American
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.080]  people because they are so good it is the in the in the American system that
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.080]  dark impulse has to be removed and it can only be removed by the American
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.680]  people if they rise against this like the moratorium movement back in the
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.400]  Vietnam days when it picked up from Berkeley's campus and then it spread
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:41.840]  across the cities and villages of whole of America it became the battle cry for
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:47.920]  American people that this was a useless war this was a debilitating war and we
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.360]  must quit as soon as possible which they did and of course America still
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:57.280]  remained a great power and eventually it because of the Afghan blood because the
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:03.320]  services of Pakistan and men like me that America enjoys today the stages of the
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.400]  soul superpower now America is hell bent or that dark impulse in American
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:14.520]  system is hell bent that they destroy America's position as the soul
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:20.200]  superpower so it has to be morally correct and unfortunately telling lies
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.480]  with regard to Iraq telling lies with regard to 9-11 and telling lies now with
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:31.680]  regard to Bombay attack everywhere it is lies lies and lies nothing else and that
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:37.440]  is not going to be helpful because that is going to totally demolish the the
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.240]  American position American economy is doldrums but the general of the Pentagon
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:48.720]  they would want America to commit more forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere and
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:52.560]  now they want to pick a fight with Iran at the same time pick a fight with
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.080]  Pakistan I don't know they have to sit down war game it and if I am there I
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:02.360]  will tell each one of them how wrong they are there are lesser to be learned
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.800]  from military history in Afghanistan for instance the spaces are not in their
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:13.440]  control the victory or defeat is actually the outcome of three interplay of three
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:18.720]  factors which is very important now I'm talking as a professional soldier the
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:24.800]  time space and relative strength in Afghanistan Americans have the watch
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:30.800]  and opposition has the time the Mujahideen has the time in Afghanistan again
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:37.920]  they have the spaces are with the opposition and Americans are confined
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.280]  only to get it on more and more they will be squeezed into the garrison town
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:48.520]  and third factor that of the relative strength agreed that America has fire
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:54.960]  power but America does not have a willing motivated manpower slowly gradually
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:00.040]  the American soldiers have started now asking what are we here for why why are
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:05.120]  we laying down our lives and I think this is a terrible situation if it
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.600]  keeps into the minds of the soldiery and I think before this really erupts it's
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:14.920]  better for America it is better for the world that they pull out of air and they
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:21.320]  abandon any notions of attacking Iran or coming for Pakistan's nuclear capability
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:27.440]  they cannot knock it out and it can create a desperate Pakistan which could
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:33.840]  do anything I'm not saying that Pakistan would do it but I think there are
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.680]  possibilities and there are chances that Pakistan may actually have to for its
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:44.440]  own existence for its own honor for its own well-being it can go to the extreme
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.540]  limit which would not be good for the countries who want to see Pakistan
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:54.000]  nuclear capability destroyed and Pakistan cut to pieces no it will not
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.600]  happen I can assure you this and they better disabuse their minds and their
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.680]  plans of this kind of notion general a few other points I wanted to bring up
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.160]  to you and then any other points you'd like to make them we'll let you go we're
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.480]  very thankful for your time today and your courage should come on this
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:18.360]  broadcast but specifically Benazar Budo dealing with another lie our media said
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.680]  that she fell and hit her head on the side of a car even though all over
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.480]  European and Central Asian news it showed her being machine gunned in the
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:32.360]  chest by Western contractors as the Intel and then when it came out that she
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.720]  had been murdered and that our media had lied they tried to claim that forces
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:41.800]  associated with the Taliban which there's any tribal group that resist
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:46.560]  occupation had done it what is the truth from your research about the
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.720]  assassination of Budo I've been saying that all along she has been killed by the
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.520]  Americans over it she's been killed by Dick Cheney's people they are the ones
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.920]  who are operating it Dick Dick Cheney's order because Dick Cheney has drawn up the
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.040]  plan of governance for Pakistan and Benazir has become rebellious
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:12.640]  she refused to meet Negra Ponte because Negra Ponte had told her not to go in
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.480]  Pakistan until after the election but she did that when she came and she said
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:22.760]  I'll want independent judiciary she sent me a message through an emissary a good
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:28.080]  friend of hers and me and he came and said that she says general I am now
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.080]  agreeing with you I tend to agree with you that the Americans have evil designs
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:39.200]  on Pakistan and therefore I know that she was she had become very
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.120]  dangerous for them for Dick Cheney and company who wanted things to happen in
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.000]  a certain way in Pakistan unfortunately those things are happening in that
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.240]  fashion and I think Pakistan is intact today Pakistan has to be redeemed and I
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.120]  think the young generation of Pakistan is very angry very unhappy with America
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.560]  so America must not think of ruling Pakistan by proxies this is wrong and
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:10.840]  I think they should quit this idea as soon as possible well general Google
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.240]  here is my message to the Pakistani people I know you're hard-working
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.760]  intelligent good people who have always been friends with the United States and
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.800]  I have the globalist owned PNAC plans to go in and destabilize you and
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.040]  overthrow your country and then put extremist in power so that you won't
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.200]  have a highly developed civilization and they're threatened by that and they
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.560]  also want to use up America's treasure and our good name and destroy us in the
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.320]  in the international community via your destruction so that this new global
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:50.320]  corporate state known as the New World Order can rise and they now admit they're
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.160]  forming a world government run by private banks they have a global carbon
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:00.080]  tax that's meant to strangle development this is eugenics and from my research
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.600]  I've never read your writings on this subject but I'm curious your view on the
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.200]  aim of this global corporate Anglo-American New World Order system
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.960]  and are you aware that they've been caught giving children in Central Asia
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.560]  this is CBS News real polio in the shots to kill them they've been caught adding
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.880]  sterilants to the tetanus shots to sterilize women and that for my research
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.960]  Latin America Africa Central Asia Pakistan particularly is targeted by a
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:35.800]  covert population reduction program are you aware of that sir yes I've heard of
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:42.480]  it and I think it's very obnoxious to say the least but America appears to
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.440]  become becoming heartless and I think the American people have got to win back
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:54.120]  their heart and they have to come up with an opinion which is stronger than
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:44:00.000]  their dark policies I think that opinion America America can be stopped in the
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.760]  track only by the American people there nobody else who can do that for them
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:11.080]  until the whole disaster takes place but we want to avoid this high disaster as
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.040]  you very rightly said I think that's your mission and good luck to you for that
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.480]  mission I think it's a noble mission and you must continue pressing this hard as
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.200]  much as you can general hameed ghoul thank you so much for joining us today I
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.600]  look forward to speaking to you again in the future and I hope that our two
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.320]  countries can be friends and I hope that we can get our nation back from the
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.480]  globalist thank you for joining us thank you Alex and goodbye goodbye general
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:39.960]  ghoul well there you go ladies and gentlemen a hour and 15 minute live
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:45.000]  uncensored interview with three-star general hameed ghoul former head of
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.920]  Pakistani intelligence and I will post this video and audio at prison planet
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.120]  TV if you missed any of it in the live show today it'll be up just minutes
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:59.240]  after the live broadcast ends after Max Kaiser is with us on the economy and
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:04.320]  other news but what you've just heard is the truth from all of my research
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:09.600]  separately with doing my own research I can find nothing that hameed ghoul said
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:15.600]  here that isn't veritas that isn't the truth and this guy was a hero in our
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:22.240]  media in the 80s leadingly attacks against the Soviets and and and now you
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.840]  know it's it's the Russians saying we better be careful in Afghanistan and
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.880]  Pakistan and it's our own government run by a bunch of crooks that is trying to
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.800]  expand all of this so very informative interview with lieutenant general hameed
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.920]  ghoul and obviously in the days to come you'll probably see a lot of news
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:48.200]  articles written about all of this but what was the one line jaren that he
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.360]  said that you thought would be a good idea to name the video of this when we
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:59.200]  posted at prison planet dot TV God help America hameed ghoul God help America
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:07.400]  this is the guy actually trained over here and our media is is using fake
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:11.080]  battlefield reports even the Washington Post said are very questionable the
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:19.120]  claim that this 74 year old gentleman you say 74 76 to claim that he is running
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.760]  all these attacks when it's all these different tribes all these different
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.160]  groups who many times are even fighting with each other I mean nobody's running
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.480]  this nobody's controlling this that's the globalist mindset is they create
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:39.720]  crises so big and so out of control that that the problems just get bigger and
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:44.280]  then they can spend more money and more troops and project more power in the
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.000]  name of cleaning it up but the plan is only to make it worse and commit us to
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.200]  an endless war and that's why as a patriotic American who defends the
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.960]  entire Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence and Constitution I agree
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:01.720]  with George Washington and we know FEMA demonizes George Washington I have
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:07.080]  video training films where they teach police and firefighters and sheriff's
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.880]  deputies that George Washington Thomas Jefferson were terrorists and were bad
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:16.920]  it's in my film road to tyranny and it's just so disgusting to to see this but
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:20.720]  George Washington now al-Qaeda according to our government I mean it sounds
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:24.720]  ridiculous but it's true he said no foreign entanglements we're not an
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:28.360]  empire we're gonna trade with people like Ron Paul says we're gonna have
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:32.120]  business with people now I got a bunch of other news coming up on the economy I
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.000]  want to head on ahead of Max Kaiser joining us some other military news we
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.120]  got a break here in a moment but I've done an hour and 47 minutes without
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.680]  telling you about what makes this operation float what funds this
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.200]  operation but more importantly that's just a caveat a fringe benefit a symbiosis

[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:10.160]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or

[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.360]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:14.520]  now remember six seven years ago in Australia and the US the NSA was going
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:19.640]  to give local police and bureau land management and environmental groups even
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:26.560]  private ones access to satellite images lifetime of people's farms and ranches
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.800]  and in businesses so they could harass people so that they couldn't build a
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:37.040]  barn or couldn't you know plant crops without being harassed well all Google
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:40.520]  did which is admittedly part of the NSA I mean I told you that many years ago now
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.160]  they admit it is they just made it all public to everybody and government is
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:50.520]  now using this to harass people and all over the world because the same global
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.360]  corporations are setting this up they're banning people collecting their own
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:59.240]  rainwater and now they're saying you've got to pay for rain to fall on your crops
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:03.840]  but then other nations don't have to do that it's all selective it's all part of
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.480]  the carbon tax this will shut down our industry and our farming even more key
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:14.040]  article up at prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson today government using
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.600]  Google Earth to loot destitute Americans and I actually heard an MPR piece
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.800]  about two weeks ago and thought to call Watson because a lot of times I call
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.400]  Watson or Kurt Kurt works here now he's moved to Austin from New Mexico but so
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:31.360]  I'll usually go into their office or call them Watson's in England both Watson's
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:35.600]  are and I'll say right on this and I forgot to but that's why I love Watson
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.000]  because he thinks just like I do when he wrote a story about it but MPR was
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:46.280]  saying it was good in Greece and in other countries the government to raise
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:51.280]  money is charging people depending on the city three hundred dollars to a
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.440]  thousand dollars or a thousand euros for a swimming pool fee or they notice if
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.520]  your swimming pool looks like it's in disuse they come and find you so it's
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:05.040]  all part of this surveillance harassment remember that Pennsylvania tax
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:09.960]  collection ad where it says hey Tom we're watching you you didn't pay four
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.520]  thousand dollars taxes and we know where you live and it shows the earth and they
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:20.520]  zoom in from space and show the guy's house the again this is all designed for
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.320]  you here it is smile aerial images being used to enforce laws associated
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:31.920]  press and that was August 14th just two days ago that crank this ad up start to
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.700]  over that's a good idea crank up the ad because I want people to actually see
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:40.560]  in here this ad where they're intimidating people here it is just
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:45.640]  off of Fifth Street nice car Tom nice house what's not so nice is you owe
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:51.200]  Pennsylvania four thousand two hundred twelve dollars in back taxes listen Tom
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.040]  we can make this easy pay online by June 18th and we'll skip your penalty and
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:05.200]  take half off your interest because Tom we do know who you are oh find us
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.560]  before we find you so this whole grid isn't for the terrorist that's the
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:14.000]  government they're staging almost all of it it's for us state utilizing aerial
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.200]  imagery technology enforce petty ordinances and loot destitute citizens
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:21.880]  of whatever income they have left after having had trillions and wealth stolen
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:25.320]  and transferred to foreign banks and trillions spent to build these
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:30.680]  satellites and launch them and the whole article just goes over it and then
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.480]  there's another report here they're now coming in to charge you for rainwater
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:37.040]  usage

[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:10.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:19.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:26.340]  Jones we have a lot of incredible news to cover in this hour with Max Kaiser of
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:31.920]  Max Kaiser dot com I'm Alex Jones with info wars dot com the Chicago Tribune is
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.800]  reporting that the state has changed the laws be able to take public pension funds
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.000]  of fire police school teachers state workers and they're now saying that you're
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.520]  not guaranteed to get your money Bloomberg is reporting in the last six
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:49.120]  months that the feds are ordering pension fund managers public and private to
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.680]  quote invest and fail banks so they're really moving towards this new scenario
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:59.960]  of looting and stealing separately collecting rainwater now illegal in many
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.040]  states is Big Brother and government claims ownership over the water and as I
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.880]  just mentioned they're now admittedly using the satellites with local
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:12.680]  government to harass farmers and homeowners and assess fees Big Brother
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:16.520]  is literally waging war on humanity Max Kaiser good to have you here with us
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:23.800]  I told you during the break that I had homie Goulon I was flattered to hear you
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:26.800]  were listening and you said you found it interesting what was your take on the
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.520]  man our media is now claiming is the newest summer bin Laden well I don't
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:35.960]  listen to the American media at all so I just don't I don't care what the
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:40.840]  American media says I am part of those Europeans if you look at the story that
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:45.840]  just came out in Newsweek they said we've entered a new period in Europe here
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:50.640]  it's a post-anti-Americanism that the press in Europe depicts America as a
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:57.720]  fraying empire of obese ignorant debt gridlock stagnation in mindless people
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:03.600]  sure and so basically nobody's America's not that interesting anymore it's a
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:08.880]  shrinking country it's the incredible shrinking country it's it's it's not a
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:13.120]  world of superpower because it's the world's super debtor it's just got
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.000]  debt that's not equity it's not they have jobs but it has psychopaths running it
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.840]  and a brainwashed lithium-head fluoride head public with almost a 20 point IQ
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.560]  drop from the chemicals in our water sitting on top 40,000 nuclear weapons
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:34.560]  so you know what the American media says about somebody else it's worthless
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:39.240]  they have no weight anymore they've got no juice the US dollar is being held up
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:45.560]  with with the papers and mirrors it's soon to be dropped into the floor and
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.240]  the America will just be in the seventh eighth ninth world who cares we're post
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.080]  America America's finished it died years ago I'm surprised yeah I still get
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:59.800]  caught from America you must be one of the only people left Max you know the
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.920]  US is held by the very same global corporations Europe is and I think the
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.000]  American Empire is dying hopefully out of this death we don't get World War 3
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  as they try to hold on to it all all right well World War 3 and I'm glad you
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.360]  brought that up it's being fought right now really in the currency the currency
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.560]  wars and now this is very interesting because for the last few years
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:30.320]  everybody has come on to television and on radio and talked about how China needs
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.760]  to value their currency higher because they're a currency manipulator and
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:40.560]  it's not fair that America can't export well guess what China is take getting
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:43.880]  of themselves off a dollar peg and guess what they've done they they're
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:50.480]  lowering the value they went because they're engaged in a financial war with
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:54.440]  the US this is the China is not a for those that don't know the US has been
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:00.640]  begging them to not lower it and then sometimes changing the policies asking
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:05.280]  him to not increase its value so what does this mean well this means that
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.280]  first of all China just this past week well that surpassed Japan it's now the
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.720]  number two global economy and it's going to be number one very shortly the
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:18.200]  very soon because they have all the keys they've got a trillion dollars and US
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:22.160]  dollars and US debt securities and when the moment is ripe they will pull the
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.080]  plug and they'll sell those securities and America's finished all the interest
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:31.640]  rates will spike up to 10 15% in a day the mortgage crisis will become every
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:35.760]  every homeowner America will be will be completely out of a home and that'll be
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.880]  it we're finished they want China China's about to win we're in there
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:45.320]  stay there let's talk about how you see this playing out and unfolding on the
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:48.800]  other side and then where that will lead us we've already got welfare riots
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:52.760]  coast-to-coast people wanting their free goodies what's gonna happen when the
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:05:01.160]  blood flow to the corporate ticks and their dependence ends hi folks this is
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.920]  Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:09.200]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:13.360]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:16.760]  respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.440]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:26.480]  yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.840]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:35.080]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:39.920]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:44.400]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go

[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:01.480]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:05.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:10.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:22.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:26.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:30.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:34.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:38.560]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:41.960]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:37.600]  over food stamps we've now got 42 million Americans just a few months ago was
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:43.560]  40 million on food stamps the equivalent of digital soup lines we see major
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:47.280]  police departments laying off more than half of their police officers and saying
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:51.600]  those that are left will only generate revenue for the state will not help
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:57.680]  people who are being burglarized or having their cars stolen this is a road
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:02.760]  warrior scenario the taxes are going up the services are being removed like
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:07.520]  Argentina or some other country that's been looted by these people these global
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:11.360]  banks are offshore they tried to go into Europe in the last six months and loot
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.000]  that Merkel kicked them out calling them criminal so they've come back towards
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.720]  the dollar there's some talk of China imploding and a lot of manipulation
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:27.720]  happening there so break down this this currency war who's running it and where
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:32.280]  you see it going well you know here's how I'm making money on it in other words
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:37.480]  I'm not thinking about saving anybody in America forget them they're lost they
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:40.720]  won't save themselves so here's how I'm playing it I'm buying Corrections Corps
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:44.200]  of America straight on the New York Stock Exchange they've got to deal with ice
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:48.000]  you know ice goes out down there and rounds up people throw them in jail they
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.420]  never deal with ice they pay him 11 million dollars a month so the Corrections
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:58.200]  Corps of America is paying ice 11 million dollars a month to go round up
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:02.040]  people to put in prison because prisons are hugely profitable business you own
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.680]  the prisons you own the restaurants you own the hotels so I'm buying CCA
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:10.480]  Corrections Corps of America so bring it on all those stupid people who are
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.400]  allowing their government to arrest them and throw them in jail and treat them
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:20.120]  like slaves and ninklepoops it's gonna make money for CCA I don't know what
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.160]  I'm I'm pasted Alex I don't I'm not gonna say anything to help anybody there
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:28.160]  anymore because I'm making money like the rest of the world there's 95% of
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.280]  world population is not American they're looking at America now the place to just
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:36.880]  stop money out to make money to start a beacon of democracy it's not worth
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:41.040]  saving it's just a place to make a few extra bucks and then drop it like a loaded
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:43.840]  garbage on the street. Well Max let me stop you I know you're being somewhat
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:46.720]  sarcastic here you normally talk about doing things with stocks you know to be
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.040]  moral like going out and trying to you know drive down the price of Coca-Cola
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:59.400]  if everybody gets this casino gulag attitude and gives in to the evil look
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:05.560]  at the story out of the UK the NHS is launching a pill with a patch you swallow
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:09.440]  the pill and then when your body through the patch senses that the pill is
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:15.200]  wearing off it sends a text email to you to take another pill now if that's not
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.840]  the casino gulag look at it it's called chip and pill the high-tech tablet that
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:24.000]  will text you when it's time to take another dose so here you have all these
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.720]  people in America no job no wages on food stamps well here here's a new
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:34.320]  pill that tells you when to give yourself another pill so now you've
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:39.400]  all these neurotic psychotic people with no jobs who are being dosed by
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.560]  themselves to their tech what but the pillow and now the media is proposing
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:48.120]  lithium in our water and vaccines that literally destroy neurons in the brain
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:54.160]  to make you docile we are entering something worse than soylent green well
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:12:00.080]  yeah this course the technology is there to make it all very high-tech and
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:04.760]  seamless and cost-efficient for the people you know I am shocked at this
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:10.800]  Google horizon deal I mean I find this to be really a hideous because here you
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.560]  have Google that became a hundred billion dollar company riding on the
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.000]  internet riding on DARPA which was built by the American taxpayer with a
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.480]  wonderful the American taxpayer there would be no Google and now they're
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.560]  turning around and they're shutting the internet down they're courting silos
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:30.960]  are creating two-tier internet to enhance their multi hundred billion
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:37.080]  dollar profits and to further destroy the American landscape and the ability
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.800]  for people there to aggregate to assemble to communicate they're going to put
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:46.320]  all the alternative media sites like yours probably on the slow lane so they
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.520]  dial you up from Europe it'll be on the slow lane we'll be able to get it
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:53.000]  because Google and Verizon are only going to support that's just at the start
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.960]  that's the war effort that's just at the start this is internet to they're
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.520]  doing it because the alternative media is kicking their butt the White House
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:05.640]  admits they're allowing this to happen to move towards shutting down the free
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:11.400]  web so they're really showing us just how criminal they are well who's gonna
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:17.840]  who's gonna stop them I mean look at the issue of net neutrality and who has
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:24.240]  just come out in the last week against net neutrality the Tea Party folks now
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:30.080]  that's absurd if you are in support of anything that has anything to do with
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:36.720]  civil rights and individual rights you would be for net neutrality so the Tea
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:41.200]  Party expose themselves as basically rabble risers for hire you can get the
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:46.400]  Tea Party to say anything just from a few bucks put their apparel on TV and
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:51.840]  she'll say anyone for anything for a buck they have no ideology what Max
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:57.680]  there's a different Tea Parties and four of them are neocon clones and you're
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:02.200]  absolutely right net neutrality is of the internet if you don't have net
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:07.040]  neutrality you don't have an internet that's right you guys support it you
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:11.920]  made your entire bones on net neutrality you have access to broadcasting then
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:16.360]  you're competing head-to-head with CNN and Fox News everybody else if we get
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:21.200]  rid of net neutrality Alex Jones goes the way well here's here's why they're
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:24.920]  doing it the mainstream media is in freefall the alternative media a year
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:29.000]  and a half ago became bigger than the mainstream media in their own breakdowns
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.880]  and actuaries so government doesn't want freedom on the web because we're
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.440]  exposing their absurdist lies and propaganda and stealing the big
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:41.320]  corporations don't want a free web and so there's a perfect storm I don't think
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.000]  they're gonna get away with it Max I I think it's gonna take them too long to
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.760]  try to strangle the web I think they're gonna fail well the key issue that
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:56.440]  plugs into this is the copyright law copyright law for now every time
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.280]  Nikki Mouse is about to enter the public domain Disney Corporation gets
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:04.320]  Congress to expand copyright law so the people who are in the copyright business
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:09.360]  major media Hollywood film studios and the labels they hate the fact that
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.360]  eventually material returns to the public domain from where it came as
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.680]  Thomas Jefferson wrote an article 17 of the Constitution intellectual property
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:22.480]  must return to the public domain from where it came but the media companies
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:26.600]  put around these balances for perpetual perpetual copyright protection
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.520]  thus depriving us of the very intellectual property that we ourselves
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.640]  created now this creates an annuity strain for these media companies and they
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:40.560]  hate the fact that p2p file-swapping net neutrality and rogue and off the cop
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:43.840]  radio stations are cutting into their copyright monopoly and that's how they're
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:48.320]  coming in with prior constraint they're saying on internet to everything you do
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:52.120]  will have to be approved and only mega sites will be allowed to be on the web
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.280]  you'll have to go through them to get to alternative sites this is the end of
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:02.280]  the web every pilot crosses every email is tagged with a number and it'll go
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:08.480]  through copyright law protection people get in their emails every month a bill
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.520]  if they use the word Microsoft in an email they'll get a bill from Microsoft
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.560]  saying we we have a copyright on the word Microsoft you always one-tenth of a
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:21.600]  penny so every single month you'll get a bill for the words that you used in
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:24.760]  your email because these corporations say they own the copyright to these
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:28.520]  words so we can't communicate anymore because we can't afford to communicate
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:31.800]  anymore because everything is going to get trolled by copyright and Google and
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:36.400]  Verizon and it's two tiered internet so we're gonna go and by the way Google is
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:40.640]  allowed to violate real copyrights the entire books and things they don't get
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:47.200]  in trouble because they're an admitted NSA CIA government consolidation tool but
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.800]  did you see where sky television owned by Rupert Murdoch is going after Skype
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:17:00.400]  because in the word Skype is the word sky so now if you write Skylark they'll
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:05.800]  sue you because a bird is a Skylark but it has the word sky in it this is the
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:10.600]  absurdity of the copyright tyranny right and we could get around it because it
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:14.800]  was so absurd but now with this two-tiered internet and with the Google
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:20.240]  NSA relationship and the intelligence and the surveillance and the Bush era and
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:24.920]  now the Obama era as you point out in the Obama deception the new laws of the
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:28.280]  Patriot Act where they can just read everyone's email it's all stored on
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:34.920]  databases this is all toward a time when every single word that you say or
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:39.800]  write is going to be tagged and possibly up for violating a copyright law and
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:42.800]  of course you will have to pay every month and since no one will have a job to
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.440]  pay for it you'll have to go into debt so where do you go to spend that oh you
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:50.080]  go to Wall Street that's right the Wall Street will be telling you loans to pay
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:53.040]  for your copyright bill at the end of the month which of course you'll never get
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:56.800]  out of because you can never stop talking because if you needed to figure
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.880]  out how to pay your copyright bill you'll use another word that's copyrighted
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:04.200]  it'll go on to add in for an item and now they're saying they're going to put
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:09.080]  cameras and microphones on all street corners and an old aircraft and this is
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:15.480]  associated press all cars will have a camera that watches you real time hooked
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:19.960]  into the local police department and the threat fusion center and when you say
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:25.240]  words like McDonald's you'll be charged copyright you're not allowed to talk so
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:30.040]  it's also a new thought crime system I'm not joking okay let's let's let's talk
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:34.440]  about this guy who's behind all this well Wall Street and hedge funds here's a
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:39.320]  quote from Steven Schwartzman he runs Blackstone very big private equity group
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:45.120]  he said if Obama tries to tax us private equity it would be like Hitler
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:50.520]  invading Poland okay he's pulling out the Hitler invading Poland analogy to
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:55.800]  describe if he a private equity group that has drained hundreds of billions
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:00.040]  from the public coffers engage in market manipulation and insider trading
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:03.720]  he's saying if you try to tax any of this money we're gonna consider this an
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:07.800]  act like an invader invading Poland which means of course they can use the
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:10.920]  program training they can do a flash crash that they did a couple of months
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:15.080]  ago a thousand point drop any day they want to because they use the financial
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:19.960]  terrorist tool Max they want to they've got an entrenched hedge fund oligarchy
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.240]  they're setting the precedent that they can naked body scan us lie about it and
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.840]  save the images they're setting the precedent to put lithium in our water
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:32.320]  and vaccines to make a servile on record they're setting the precedent to do
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:36.760]  anything they want and then we can do nothing they are attempting to break us
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:41.400]  like a pimp breaks a whore they're attempting to fully dominate us and
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:44.800]  engage in whatever crimes they want I want to ask you about the Wall Street
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:49.880]  Journal yesterday saying that junk bonds and derivatives are now being issued at
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:54.560]  a record pace the financial reform act allows them to do this we'll be right

[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:15.360]  well the wall street journal business insider many others are reporting
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:19.480]  companies are following over themselves issue even more junk bonds basically a
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:23.800]  form of derivative than last year's records so what's happened with this
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:28.200]  financial reform act is it's given the top banksters even more power to do
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:34.080]  whatever they want and they're also reporting that every economic indicator
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:38.200]  shows this country is a terror rating very very quickly I mean they're hell
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:42.720]  bent on running this country into the ground max geyser well yeah I mean this
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:49.640]  cam works this way let's say you're a bank and you've got your your value is 40
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:55.040]  billion dollars and you now you're gonna sell some junk bonds so you put up the
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:01.200]  bank's assets as collateral you sell 40 billion you borrow essentially 40 more
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:07.920]  billion dollars the CEO pays himself a four billion dollar bonus and now the
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:12.720]  company has 40 billion dollars more in debt six months later or nine months later
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:16.080]  I can't pay the debt that goes to the government the government has to bail
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.920]  them out again so all the bailout money that was a given to Wall Street that
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:24.640]  hundreds of billions trillions given to Wall Street they are sitting on it
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:27.800]  they're using it to pay off the debt and they're paying themselves huge bonuses
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:32.560]  and salaries now they're selling hundreds of billions of more in junk bonds
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:38.160]  today nine months from now well they will not be able to pay they know that and
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.520]  they'll go back to the government and they'll put the gun to the government
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:43.360]  head and they'll say you give us another five trillion dollars or we're gonna
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.760]  crash your economy like we did back in October 2008 with Hank Paulson and the
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:51.840]  government of course Barack Obama having no spine whatsoever we'll just give
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.160]  him another five to ten trillion dollars I give us some other multi hundred
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.920]  billion dollar bonus how can Wall Street continue to pay itself record
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:04.120]  bonuses if the economy is having a record losses there's a disconnect there
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:09.200]  well the answer is quite easy it's a kleptocracy of Wall Street bankers who've
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:13.120]  got a gun to the head of Congress at any time that Congress flinches they do a
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:16.920]  flash crash they just crash the market financial terrorism as I explained on
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:20.120]  your show last time they just have a computer algorithm that goes in there
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:25.320]  to sell into it overwhelms a specialist system drops the price of stocks down
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:29.160]  everyone panics Nancy Pelosi gets her little knickers and a twist and runs
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:35.160]  around like and they give me another five trillion dollars so it's a
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:40.440]  fantastic racket it's a perfect crime nobody stops them and it's going to
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:44.280]  continue so selling jump out today is the financial crisis and then
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:49.680]  meanwhile max when I study who's funding the carbon taxes the local taxes
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:54.680]  going up the federal taxes going up Wall Street is the main lobbyist for
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:59.520]  taxes on the little guy but almost no taxes on themselves I mean this is a
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:04.360]  criminal doing God's work you know what length I know I'm doing God's work and
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.720]  that was his explanation we have to make money because we're like the Vatican of
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:13.040]  America we have a direct line with God if we don't make money it means that
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:16.360]  there's no trickle down there's no trickle down at the end of our pants and
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:19.120]  down onto the faces of those Americans that they're putting under the street
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:23.960]  mud down facing the mud the guy is a terrorist why can we stop being brought
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:27.800]  up on charges right now and and how do you see them because we know they've
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:30.800]  already stolen most the pension fund money Bloomberg reported that back in
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:36.120]  March and then now we have the Chicago Tribune can the Illinois pension
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:42.160]  catastrophe be stopped and it goes through the this is actually another
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:44.560]  article I didn't know they had a second one there's another one I covered
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:50.720]  yesterday you know saying will the pension check not come in the mail was
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:55.240]  the headline and they they gave the subsection where the states changed the
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.320]  rules to take state employees pension funds and what we've seen them do in
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:04.440]  Argentina in Nigeria and other places is they'll say we're taking half of it the
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:08.640]  government will hold the other half your check will be half as big but if you
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:11.920]  don't go along with this you'll lose it all and then a few years later they'll
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.320]  steal half of that half and half of that half but because they do it in a
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.280]  process just like the CPS takes your child in a process people just say okay
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:25.000]  take my pension fund the government will say that's right now drink your
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.480]  fluoride and diet cancer trash and the police and everybody will say yes sir we
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:33.080]  love it and then the cops will take their six-year-old of the doctrine will
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:37.160]  say your son has leukemia and the couple say good I love the government let's
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:41.600]  give our my son more aspartame drinks and and and more more and maybe some
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:46.160]  lithium I mean they just love it don't they max I think the Argentina
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.240]  comparison is the best one to make and I've been saying this for years you know
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:54.520]  people make comparisons to different economies during different periods of
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:58.160]  stress you know you look at the Japanese economy people are saying oh
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.520]  deflation like we had in Japan for the last 20 years but if this is different
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:07.360]  this is a kleptocracy and really have to go to Argentina 2000 2001 and there's a
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:12.520]  fantastic 12-part YouTube series on this to be look at collapse in Argentina and
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:15.840]  they go through it and I met actually the filmmaker was here in Paris and we
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:20.000]  talked about a little bit and it's just the process where the banks and the
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.200]  government get together and they loot the money and the reason why they're
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:27.920]  doing this is because the ability for the American economy to generate any
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:33.440]  growth or inflation at this point is zero because all of the assets that have
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.040]  been used as collateral to sustain a 25-year borrowing and spending consumer
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:42.720]  bin are still collapsing in value let's talk about how the collapse is going to
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:48.200]  take place with Max Kaiser straight ahead a lot of other key news as well

[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:16.000]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:21.080]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to

[02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:10.000]  anachronism like a ghost from another time I am nothing more than a reminder to
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:15.400]  you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages you're a bug mr. Wordsworth
[02:33:15.400 --> 02:33:20.320]  a crawling insect an ugly misforned little creature who has no purpose here
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:27.600]  no meaning I am a human being words mr. Wordsworth they have no substance and
[02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:33.760]  no dimension like air like a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:40.680]  human being I exist and if I speak one for a loud that thought lives even after
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:47.400]  I'm showered in my grave the illusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:51.760]  injected in your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:56.840]  strength at all you have nothing but spindly limbs of a dream and the state
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:03.600]  has no use for your time resistance to tyrants his obedience to God
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:12.160]  it's Alex Jones Max Kaiser is our guest for the rest of the hour we're about to
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:16.960]  go right back to him here in just a moment I wanted to hit some of the news
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:24.280]  that's up on the network website GCN live.com the letters GCN live.com
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:28.920]  Hal Turner betrayed and burned by government he served dealing with the
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:33.320]  government agent neo-nazi who they now flushed down the toilet just like the
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:37.720]  torturers who followed Bush's orders he comes out and brags he ordered torture
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:41.320]  but they go to prison when they get caught key article by Curtin MO at
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:45.800]  GCN live.com it's also up on infowars.com here's another one neo-cons are
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:50.000]  prepping us for war with Iran Ray McGovern that's at GCN live.com and at
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.720]  dovetails with Curtin Emo's article we're not saying this the neo-cons are
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:58.000]  saying that they're gonna fuel those nuclear reactors on the 21st of this
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.960]  month and they must be attacked before then and Ray McGovern agrees that they
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:05.120]  may green light at the next week let's pray that isn't the case that article
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:10.120]  at GCN live.com Bob Chapman's got an article dreadful market predictions
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:14.480]  dealing with the Hindenburg Omen I'm gonna ask Max Kaiser about that in just a
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:22.320]  moment but a another story here in my stack deals with record drug recalls
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:28.720]  from CNN I mean record recalls of powdered milk a formula recalls of more
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:32.080]  and more companies are acting like there's nothing left in the future and
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:37.720]  so just criminality and a every man for himself attitude is happening
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:40.720]  which is only gonna make the crisis worse it's not gonna help all these
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:45.600]  self-serving yuppies that think it's a virtue to be arrogant mindless idiots
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.400]  drinking sodium fluoride and lithium but but but Max Kaiser dealing with this I'm
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:55.680]  sure you saw the report that came out Friday Harvard has dumped all of its
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:00.960]  holdings in any Israeli company billions now now I mean that looks like they
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:06.600]  know World War 3 is coming why would Harvard dump all all their endowment
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:09.720]  that has tens of billions of dollars and different investments why would they
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:15.720]  dump all their Israeli holdings and move into Chinese holdings well because
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:20.400]  Israel is the new apartheid state like South Africa and they wanted to vest out
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:24.960]  of Israel because of this growing movement to divest and boycott Israel
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.160]  because Israel is operating a ghetto in the form of Palestine and there's a
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:34.280]  global movement to punish Israel and to get them out of the ghetto but Harvard
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:38.960]  is full of it a big Israel supporters I mean that's where Elena Kagan and Cass
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.040]  Sunstein came from I mean I I don't think it's because they didn't say why
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.280]  they did it I think it's because they know wars coming well they said that
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:52.640]  they're Israel no longer a growth story and that it's an emerging market that
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.360]  they're going to now go into other areas like Brazil and China which they
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:04.000]  consider to be an emerging market but good look this Israel is really losing
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.680]  it this is my take on Israel they're going to attack Iran and then America is
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.000]  going to do to Israel what they did to the South Vietnamese they're going to
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:16.880]  abandon them and there is really going to be out there with their you know you
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:21.360]  know what in their hand attacking Iran with nobody backing them up so we're
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:29.560]  going to back to 1947 pre-Israel oh I think when terrorist attack or the
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:33.240]  government stages attacks that the US military is going to get behind them I
[02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:37.720]  know I don't use military never gets behind any but any of their so-called
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:41.880]  allies they couldn't run the South Vietnamese are just one example this is
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:45.720]  their famous for this they talk big they flash the big star they get the one
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:50.040]  raking hat on they go yeah go over the hill then they the guys they all attack
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:53.160]  and then they go oh we were just kidding we're back home you know smoking a
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:56.080]  bowl you know we don't we don't really care what we're just here with a world
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:59.240]  reserve currency we're writing checks we never have to cash we're down here at
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:03.080]  Starbucks the slurping up all these bad lot days we don't go it's your problem
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:09.520]  that's what I think so Harvard knows basically that Israel and the
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:13.480]  shekel are about to crash because Israel is about to commit the stupidest thing
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:16.760]  of their history they're going to invade Iran the shekel is going to crash
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:21.080]  Israeli stock market going to crash offers like oh oh it's the emerging market
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.480]  we're going to get out of here they're greedy well you know so-and-so that is
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:31.320]  one thing I've noticed these global bankers will even screw their own and
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:36.280]  just like Madoff was cheating all these Jews I think you've got a point there
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:41.680]  yeah they're going to crash the shekel is going to crash now you know I went on
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:46.680]  your show last year on record and I said that online gambling is going to be
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:51.080]  come a reality here's a headline from two days ago federal online gambling
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:58.360]  legislation clears big hurdle sponsored by Barney Frank okay online gambling is

[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.800]  government pay its debt to China
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:37.720]  hey speaking of truth you know Alex let me take this moment to remind you that on
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:44.760]  piratemyfilm.com the Alex in Wonderland project the symbol is truth
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:49.960]  t-r-u-t-h that's the symbol for the project I have dedicated to you on

[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:59.560]  how that works is if people invest in it then you'll make the film and they'll

[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:08.440]  100% and 68% funded I'm trying to raise $5,000
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:12.760]  once we raise $5,000 we go make the film then we play it on the internet
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:16.520]  and we share the ad revenues with everybody
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:21.080]  it's only $5,000 your stuff gets seen by millions of people I should fund
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:24.360]  Alex in Wonderland I want to see Max Kaiser make a movie
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:28.360]  I called Matt I emailed Matt to do this but he stopped there in the back
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:31.480]  you know smoking a cigarette or something get that guy Matt
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.440]  Matt's got to get on the job here Matt's the flacker you know Matt

[02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:00.760]  piratemyfilm.com the symbol is truth I guess five thousand is so wrong
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:05.560]  because your crew is so a bunch of flackers
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.120]  let's be fair they come to be every two or three days with stacks of Max Kaiser
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.360]  emails and ask me to look at them and I and then I say I'm too busy

[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:21.000]  it doesn't matter because I know that they just reusing the rolling paper
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.640]  hey hey Max Max Max we love having you on
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:29.800]  I get and they're always like we got piratemyfilm emails here

[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:37.240]  Lord Kaiser all right fine well you're a you're
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.280]  stand-up guy you know that's why you should be running the country over
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:43.080]  there in America why don't you become a senator you know
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:46.280]  Peter Schiff ran for senator he unfortunately the people in
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:49.160]  Connecticut are too stupid to vote for a smart guy
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:52.520]  you know why don't you become the senator from Texas and why don't you
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:55.480]  become why don't you become emperor and be
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:42:01.720]  Maximilian Kaiser global ruler in Europe in Europe my friend I'm
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.120]  making inroads the globalization of the Max Kaiser meme
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:09.880]  but go to piratemyfilm.com it's truth GRUTH
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:13.480]  Alex Ohunderland I can raise the budget and I want to make
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:17.160]  Matt or somebody from your crew the official producer on the site just
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:21.240]  send me an email and I'll make you guys the proof no I'm not involved in your
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:24.680]  investment operation if you want to make a movie about me that's
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.160]  fine but but I mean tell us about Alex in Wonderland then
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:32.680]  well it's a project the way piratemyfilm works is you put up a project
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:36.360]  and you find out what people you know what the appetite for the project is you
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.160]  just reserve a share if you don't like the way the film is developing you
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:42.360]  cancel your reservation you're not you're not committing any money
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:45.480]  once you get to a hundred percent of the reservation then
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:48.600]  you get the email it says okay we raised we got five thousand
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:52.440]  if you're still interested we'll debit you five bucks and we'll go make this
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:56.040]  film but during the process of the few months leading up to it
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:00.040]  it can change a hundred times depending what people really want us to do
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:03.880]  so right now the film is about uh you know Alex Jones
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:07.480]  goes mainstream in America basically he replaces Larry King
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:11.480]  and America finally wakes up and there's a new dawn in America
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:15.240]  but if that idea stinks people think they know it forget it I don't like that
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:19.080]  idea and it can evolve but during the whole process nobody puts up any money
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:23.080]  because in total it gets to a point where people are like yeah I like that
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.800]  idea then we go make this film we get a director we get a
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:29.320]  producer then we play it on the web and the advertising
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:33.240]  I got it I got it I get it I get it it's very interesting uh now now Max in the
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:36.760]  time we've got left with you some other uh issues that need to be gotten into
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:40.040]  specifically you've been predicting this crash
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:43.800]  the system shows that they're only going in a direction that'll make it worse
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:47.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy at the treasury wall street
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.200]  journal editor he agrees it's being done by design
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:54.200]  to create a road warrior level collapse then the bankers will just move off
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:57.720]  shore with all the blood they've sucked out of us when we're just a dry
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:02.280]  skeleton laying in the corner how do you see this unfolding
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:05.640]  in the next few months the next year what's the time frame here
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:09.160]  because they've gone from saying we're in a wonderful economy to okay it's a
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:12.440]  double-dip recession going into a depression so they've
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:16.600]  they've stopped lying to a certain extent where is all this going
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:21.400]  the economy died in 2008 it was dead and no heartbeat at all
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:26.040]  there's a dead corp of US economy Obama came in with a stimulus
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:29.080]  which was basically putting a blood transfusion into the corp
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.240]  hey Max you're uh are you joining us via skyline
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:38.440]  I'm on my mobile phone it's usually good but it's breaking up can you
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:44.120]  I'm screaming so much no it's breaking up can you climb on top of your house
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:47.400]  I'm standing on top of the Eiffel Tower there's too many
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:50.760]  Parisians on their cell phones right now it sounds a little fishy
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:53.640]  all right let me let me move uh let me move locations there
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:57.400]  how's that does that look a little better stand on your head
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:01.160]  I'm not going to stand on my head now you want me to stand up regular
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:05.160]  we'll see now that we're joking around oh Kaiser
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:09.640]  can you hear me any better a little bit better why don't you go outside
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:16.600]  are you serious it's not working oh my god oh it's working it's working
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:20.360]  okay what do you see happening with the economy all right look this
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:24.440]  when you see this work what can you do anything you see this in the press all
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:28.360]  the time what does that mean it means basically that the
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:31.960]  federal reserve bank which accepted from Wall Street
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:36.120]  roughly three trillion dollars in their bad loans
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:41.000]  they are unable to roll them they're unable to move them they're unable to
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.840]  sell them because the system is completely
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:49.560]  broken so when I say quantitative easing what that means is that they are
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.880]  going to print out three trillion more dollars Max hold it there we're going to
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:56.760]  disconnect and call you right back and see if that fixes the line
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:00.840]  joining us from Paris the ex-patriot Max Kaiser inventor of the Hollywood
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:04.120]  Stock Exchange made a lot of very accurate uh predictions we're going to
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:08.200]  get him back on with this his cell phone is usually better than his landline
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:11.800]  and we always have Skype problems with him or we'd have him be a video uplink
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:15.800]  with us of course he's a tv host with BBC RT
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:19.480]  he's done shows with Al Jazeera he has his own radio show Saturdays here on
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:22.920]  Genesis and he's a very colorful fellow who at
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:25.560]  least joins us once a month well a bunch of stuff's happening he's sometimes
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:28.520]  joins us twice a month he joined us two weeks ago we reared it
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:31.480]  Thursday when I was hanging out with Jesse Ventura wasn't really hanging out
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:35.320]  Jesse came here to work on a project with me this television show
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:39.960]  but had to take off Thursday Watson sat in for one of the hours
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:43.080]  okay quantitative easing they're now admitting
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:46.840]  that they're monetizing debt and the Federal Reserve
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:51.640]  is basically charging us for the right for taxpayers to give them money Max
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.720]  please continue right in other words the the system in 2008
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:59.720]  systemically it completely broke down this is what
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.880]  people don't understand money is not moving at all in the system
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:07.960]  there's no credit there's no loans it's absolutely dead
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:12.360]  so but the Fed took on board many hundreds many
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:16.360]  couple of trillion in these awful Wall Street debt
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.200]  but they can't sell them they can't roll them they can't refinance them
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.040]  so they're going to print out more money but here's here's the beautiful
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:27.480]  thing about it this is what makes this just an unbelievable
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:30.840]  thing to watch is that the Fed will say we're going
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:34.840]  to print up two trillion more dollars to help roll this bad debt
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:38.200]  and on that day Wall Street will tell the Fed oh by the way
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:41.800]  did I did we fail to mention we've got another five trillion of bad debt
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:45.560]  right here that we didn't tell you about it's exactly what happened in the UK
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:48.600]  the UK when the new government came into office
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:52.440]  under Cameron they had 800 billion in debt was the biggest debt the
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:55.960]  country had in generation the second they came in office
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:59.800]  the Treasury reported to number 10 Downing Street oh the number's not 800
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:04.920]  billion it's five trillion pounds in debt that's five times their GDP
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:08.520]  same thing can happen now the Fed's gonna say oh yeah ring quantitative easing
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:12.520]  we need to print up two trillion more in paper to roll this horrible debt
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:16.520]  and Wall Street's gonna say oh by the way we've got another five six trillion of
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:19.880]  bad debt we didn't tell you so that means that the crisis
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:23.000]  and the real estate market and the jobs and the wages
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.560]  are going to continue to fall like a rock and the best part is we get to have
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:31.720]  our taxes raised to pay for all this free money we give the bankers
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:36.040]  who are also trying to pass carbon taxes to shut down the economy even more
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:39.320]  because as they destroy us all we've got is them
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:42.840]  and then they get even more power out of it and the cops don't know it
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.600]  the bureaucrats don't know it the yuppies just know how to have coach handbags and
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:51.000]  drink coffee and act cool and and the real men are running around
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.760]  you know in their ufc shirts talking about beating up other people
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:57.720]  and everybody else is drinking fluoride and sucking their thumb
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:01.000]  so this sounds good max this sounds really good
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.040]  what what what do you mean when you talk about taxpayer
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:08.520]  that is that only people have jobs pay taxes i mean you got 40 million people
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:11.960]  out of food theft you know 40 50 unemployed and growing
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:14.760]  every day you don't have taxpayers in america you have
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:17.400]  surfs well no the and those are the weapons system
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:21.560]  and i was also reading how they're having record people sign up for the
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.000]  military now it's the only job they've got and now they will police us
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.280]  domestically this is great instead of the welfare guy
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:31.800]  you know uh sitting there in his welfare house smoking pot on my
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:34.840]  uh paycheck uh now he'll have a machine gun
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:39.720]  and he he can hardly talk but he can sure beat the hell out of me
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:43.720]  people are going to be begging to become taxpayers they would love to pay tax
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:48.760]  because it would imply that they actually have a bona fide job
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:53.960]  well it really does sound fun max so how long till this completely unravels
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:59.000]  well i think it's you know the thing is there's a great story
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.240]  by um it's called the depth of ivan elliott
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:08.280]  by um a great russian writer and it's a story about a man
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:11.960]  who's dead and he listens to the people come in to the
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:15.720]  into the into the parlor into the into the into the funeral parlor talking
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:19.000]  about him and he can still hear him these people talking
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.960]  about him even though he's dead now you can hear my voice alex i know you can
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:27.800]  but the fact is america is dead you think it's alive
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:31.400]  but it's a corpse it's nothing there's a life through on
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:35.320]  nobody's home there's no credit there's no money
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:39.480]  it's dead dead dead the only people who don't understand that are the people who
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.240]  live in america that's five percent of the world's population that's become
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.240]  incredibly insignificant as the rest of the world says who needs

[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:18.920]  scrooge can you know see himself dead nobody coming to his funeral
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:23.720]  with the ghost of christmas future or it's kind of like to use a star
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:27.400]  trek analogy the wrath of con when spock's been
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:30.760]  radiated fixing the ship and kirk's trying to get in and they hold him
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:34.040]  back and they say he says we got to save him and he says
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:38.840]  he's dead already the elites for four years have been acting like this
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:42.040]  country's dead already and you've got all these big investment
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:46.200]  groups dumping all of their israeli holdings all of them including arvard
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.040]  you've got them headlong towards world war three the banks are offshore they
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:53.000]  don't care and it's either us or these global
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.760]  bankers and these creatures are announcing world
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:00.440]  government it's all happening and so i think what
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:03.960]  kaiser's saying is we're already irrevocably screwed
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:07.080]  unless we do it ron paul and others have said what we cover
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:10.280]  what's covered in the film the secret of oz and what we've covered here with the
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:14.520]  maker of that film unless we have a real awakening we are dead
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:18.760]  i mean this country still has great wealth and energy if we say no to the
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:23.320]  parasite but max it doesn't look like people are you know ready to accept
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:26.680]  that they're starting to wake up but uh you know i look at europe they've got
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:30.120]  big debt ratios and other big problems as well
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.360]  europe's you know not even replacing itself a 1.3 replacement level so
