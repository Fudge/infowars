[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.040]  hello ladies and gentlemen it is Monday July 19th 2010 we're gonna be live here
[00:29.040 --> 00:34.760]  ladies and gentlemen for the next three hours coming up Max Kaiser is joining us
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.000]  in the third hour to talk about the economy the police state the buildup
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.760]  for war with Iran and a lot more for people who are watching the prison
[00:42.760 --> 00:47.680]  planet dot TV simulcast not just listening to radio look at all the
[00:47.680 --> 00:55.840]  stacks neatly organized here that we aren't going to be covering today we
[00:55.840 --> 01:00.680]  have all these different stacks of news and information that we're going to be
[01:00.680 --> 01:10.600]  going over and that is the economy stack the oil spill stack the health stack
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.120]  the climate energy and environment stack the police state New World Order stack
[01:16.120 --> 01:22.720]  the US politics stack the war on terror military stack the immigration border
[01:22.720 --> 01:28.660]  stack yeah they've had a bunch of car bombings and mass murders in the last
[01:28.660 --> 01:33.280]  day down in Mexico and a lot of it right on the Texas border Arizona border we
[01:33.280 --> 01:39.080]  have the Iran Israel Middle East stack the miscellaneous stack and of course
[01:39.080 --> 01:43.800]  this is my IM stack this is the IM's I sent the guys to print really what you
[01:43.800 --> 01:50.000]  could call our top news story stack and yes it makes my head spin I know it'll
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.360]  make your head spin and of course I'm also beside myself with anger with rage
[01:58.360 --> 02:04.120]  that is on the verge of being uncontrollable dealing with the fact that
[02:04.120 --> 02:11.120]  we are being censored all over Google and YouTube and if you go back three
[02:11.120 --> 02:17.160]  years the term Alex Jones or info wars has dwarfed Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity
[02:17.160 --> 02:23.720]  Keith Oberman Glenn Beck in the Google Trends so that is a occurrence happening
[02:23.720 --> 02:31.320]  because of you searching those terms and since Friday listeners you pointed out
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.600]  Tim from Michigan pointed out that why was Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson above
[02:36.600 --> 02:42.760]  the BP oil spelt in top searches and so I said well why don't we just Google the
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.280]  Obama deception and make it number one it was number one and see the mainstream
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.440]  media they artificially make Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson the number one
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.440]  search by hyping it and promoting it and pushing it and ramming it down your
[02:54.440 --> 02:58.600]  throat they could set the agenda for real issues like hey look the Federal
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.920]  Reserve is about to get a total dictatorship over our economy but they
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.880]  choose to basically obscure that real news and we have now proven and over
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.600]  the weekend that Google when the Obama deception fall the Republic info wars
[03:13.600 --> 03:17.280]  were all number one number two number three number four number five number six
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.880]  they all rotated in those slots that Google sent messages to people that tried
[03:21.880 --> 03:25.800]  to search the term saying you're not allowed to search that term because you
[03:25.800 --> 03:30.640]  know this is part of an automated response and so now if you search those
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.920]  terms they're unsearchable now I noticed this was happening Saturday so Sunday I
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.920]  said set a searching Obama deception search Obama deception censored and it
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.240]  was number one yesterday Obama deception censored they've since blocked it out
[03:45.240 --> 03:50.840]  of the trends and block many people from searching it period people say well why
[03:50.840 --> 03:57.320]  did trends matter well this is an info war this is a info wars revolt against
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.320]  the controlled corporate media force feeding us Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson
[04:02.320 --> 04:12.920]  and other distractions Tiger Woods and when you have the number one search term
[04:12.920 --> 04:16.640]  hundreds of blogs and newspapers and that's what happened then write articles
[04:16.640 --> 04:20.040]  about the Obama deception they go in look what the top trends are they then
[04:20.040 --> 04:23.000]  write stories about it because they want traffic and that's what happened huge
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.640]  success bigger than I thought it would be so successful I have no doubt it was
[04:27.640 --> 04:30.800]  an insider at YouTube or their parent company Google because they've censored
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.400]  us before and I'm gonna go over that coming up specifically with the Obama
[04:34.400 --> 04:37.520]  deception we've been censored by Google we have the letter from them saying
[04:37.520 --> 04:40.920]  you're not allowed on a Google shopping cart that we went and signed up for
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.240]  number six months ago to talk about about Obama so we know it's them who else
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.520]  could hack that passcode they've got the passcode to the directors channel that
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.440]  had it was 6.5 million and growing views and they went in it's clear and
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.480]  erased it but they've shown us who they are in the process hi folks this is

[06:06.920 --> 06:10.880]  endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[06:10.880 --> 06:15.400]  by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the
[06:15.400 --> 06:19.440]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs
[06:19.440 --> 06:23.760]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano
[06:23.760 --> 06:29.080]  silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the
[06:29.080 --> 06:33.320]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[06:33.320 --> 06:38.440]  products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver

[07:02.320 --> 07:06.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.040]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.040 --> 07:15.360]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.360 --> 07:19.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:19.720 --> 07:23.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.360]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.360 --> 07:32.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.440 --> 07:40.280]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.280 --> 07:43.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.960]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[07:58.920 --> 08:00.920]  we've got it
[08:00.920 --> 08:14.560]  wage in war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[08:14.560 --> 08:18.160]  lines of the Info War
[08:20.160 --> 08:25.920]  well we're kicking off a new week of radio transmissions against tyranny
[08:25.920 --> 08:32.160]  we're hitting pay dirt big time in the war against the globalist we are cutting
[08:32.160 --> 08:37.440]  them up in a lot of places and they are bleeding bad and I look to open up even
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.960]  bigger wounds in the enemy if you turn loose the power that is innate in
[08:42.960 --> 08:46.960]  every one of you and start taking action and start exposing these murderous
[08:46.960 --> 08:54.240]  traitorous larseness rat-like scum of these vipers they will fall you'll just
[08:54.240 --> 09:00.280]  simply take action against them it was never a bully in the world that wasn't
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.640]  defeated by laying down you got to stand up against them you're never going to
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.320]  defeat these bullies by licking their boots how many of you in life were a
[09:09.320 --> 09:12.520]  coward when you were young and you got beat up many times so the first time
[09:12.520 --> 09:15.800]  you got mad and beat the living daylights out of the bully didn't matter how many
[09:15.800 --> 09:23.480]  times you rolled over you finally learned to stand up when you learn that you
[09:23.480 --> 09:28.040]  could stand up you learned how easy those bullies get knocked into the dirt
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.840]  we've got to find that spirit of liberty inside each and every one of us we've
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.040]  got to take action we've got to get our fighting spirits back because we go we
[09:40.040 --> 09:48.200]  are going into a controlled depression I am so angry so focused so enraged and
[09:48.200 --> 09:56.720]  also so cognizant of the fact that we can beat these people that unknown
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.600]  country of true liberty and freedom is just a few hundred yards away across
[10:01.600 --> 10:16.040]  this chasm of apathy and weakness and societal malaise and weakness and if we
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.680]  would all just come together against corruption and recognize what evil is
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.000]  and start taking action against it we could build a bridge to liberty to
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.360]  freedom very very quickly but I can't do it alone and it's frustrating because I
[10:31.360 --> 10:37.200]  see the awakening accelerating but also see the enemy becoming cognizant of that
[10:37.200 --> 10:43.040]  fact and pulling out all the stops to collapse the society into the arms of
[10:43.040 --> 11:00.040]  total dehumanization you know what I'm gonna do this happens a lot more often
[11:00.040 --> 11:10.880]  than I would like it to I get agitated and then I start having brain storms of
[11:10.880 --> 11:18.840]  understanding and it's kind of like over revenue race car engine I don't want to
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.600]  spin out of control here today and just start ranting and raving so I'm gonna
[11:23.600 --> 11:32.760]  try to settle down right now and be as calm as I can and I'm gonna go over the
[11:32.760 --> 11:40.000]  news here and then later in the hour I'm gonna get into the censorship of the
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.640]  Obama deception because the censorship of this film has now led us into other
[11:47.640 --> 11:54.760]  avenues that illustrate other forms of censorship and control and just how the
[11:54.760 --> 12:02.280]  internet has been designed to be a system to surveil us and to track us and in
[12:02.280 --> 12:11.520]  the future to censor everything we do it is a giant NSA psychological warfare
[12:11.520 --> 12:17.120]  tool but it's also a psychological testing tool to gauge and control the
[12:17.120 --> 12:22.840]  population and as I learn more about how the internet works and as I learn how
[12:22.840 --> 12:26.000]  the enemy has been trying to suppress what we've been doing in the last few
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.400]  years and they've been failing and as we begin to go mega viral on a daily basis
[12:32.400 --> 12:38.240]  not just on a monthly basis we're seeing the enemy pull out the stops to try to
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.480]  block us and to know that on the level playing field of ideas we would already
[12:43.480 --> 12:51.520]  have had victory and to know how close we are to routing these criminals if the
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.360]  public knew that our enemies are not all powerful of the public knew how weak
[12:56.360 --> 13:01.920]  they are if the public knew that it's only our apathy that allows them to run
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.120]  rampant on us and if you knew what I knew if you could understand what I
[13:06.120 --> 13:11.240]  understand and I try to lay this information out but those of you that
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.320]  are experts in a field you understand how complex it is and hard it is to
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.840]  explain to a layperson who hasn't studied your field the subtle nuances of
[13:19.840 --> 13:26.160]  it it's an art form and my understanding of this system exponentially grows by
[13:26.160 --> 13:32.880]  the day until I feel like the top of my head's about to blow off
[13:42.360 --> 13:49.600]  we have caught Google red-handed spying on the American people and the people
[13:49.600 --> 13:54.360]  of the world they are the NSA they are the CIA on record we told you that six
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.160]  years ago with high-level CIA officers coming on the show who retired and
[13:58.160 --> 14:07.440]  exposing it like mr. Steele now it's mainstream news they just throw it your
[14:07.440 --> 14:11.480]  face they think you're just gonna accept it the head of Facebook calls you a
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.760]  bunch of effing suckers and idiots because you trust him he publicly laughs
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.760]  at you and calls you down animals I'm so sick of these arrogant filth the only
[14:22.760 --> 14:25.840]  way they get away with this is our apathy and the fact that we're all jacked
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.560]  into the television sets and only care about issues and no significance
[14:29.560 --> 14:34.240]  because since we were small children the control corporate media purposefully
[14:34.240 --> 14:39.480]  ruined many people's psyches and their roadmaps for understanding human
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.080]  civilization and history I listen to grown men how they're into being mindless
[14:45.080 --> 14:50.240]  idiots now they're into just making endless jokes and and and and laughing
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.240]  about everything and it it's like arrested development at about a fifth
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.400]  grade level out there I listen to other talk radio host and they're just a
[14:58.400 --> 15:06.440]  gibbering monkeys they have no idea how dangerous history is they have no idea
[15:06.440 --> 15:12.920]  that in the siege of Leningrad close to half a million people died just regular
[15:12.920 --> 15:19.000]  citizens of the city and that more than 300,000 German soldiers died and more
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.560]  than 300,000 Russian soldiers in fact I'm going from memory will you pull up
[15:23.560 --> 15:32.640]  estimates of death from the battle of Leningrad was it 1943-44 a
[15:32.640 --> 15:37.920]  enemy at the gates doesn't even scratch the surface the cannibalism that city
[15:37.920 --> 15:43.560]  living on human meat for a year there wasn't a rat left in the city that
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.000]  humans hadn't tracked down they were eating the wallpaper off the walls
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.920]  because they'd used flour as the adhesive to put the wallpaper up they were
[15:53.920 --> 16:03.880]  eating wood they were roasting children on spits this movie the road people kept
[16:03.880 --> 16:07.800]  telling me to watch it and I don't like disturbing movies because reality is
[16:07.800 --> 16:12.400]  disturbing enough for me knowing about the cannibalism in Africa and the South
[16:12.400 --> 16:17.640]  Pacific still going on studying as much history as I have knowing that within
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.640]  10 days and these are even government studies Pentagon studies conducted in
[16:21.640 --> 16:28.680]  the 50s within 10 days 90 plus percent of individuals will rape murder kill for
[16:28.680 --> 16:37.680]  food within 15 days almost everyone becomes accountable I've got the
[16:37.680 --> 16:49.320]  university studies that during the depression that during the depression
[16:49.320 --> 16:54.920]  7 million people starved to death millions more during the dust bowl and
[16:54.920 --> 16:58.840]  that's when 90% of the public were self-sufficient and could take care of
[16:58.840 --> 17:03.240]  themselves 7 million bye-bye he looked at the photos of the great depression
[17:03.240 --> 17:07.800]  families with their cars broke down trying to go out west their children's
[17:07.800 --> 17:11.640]  ribs sticking out of their bodies their little rib cages looking like
[17:11.640 --> 17:16.000]  concentration camp victims that was all engineered by the very same banking
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.720]  families that perch on top of this country right now getting ready to do
[17:19.720 --> 17:27.240]  the same thing I watched this movie about a week and a half ago and I've been
[17:27.240 --> 17:30.960]  having nightmares about every single day and I'm gonna tell you something I had a
[17:30.960 --> 17:34.480]  nightmare last night about this you know I had a nightmare folks nothing gives
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.040]  me nightmares horror movies unrealistic cried this this film brings up
[17:40.040 --> 17:45.360]  ancestral memories in me those are instincts we all have them of all of my
[17:45.360 --> 17:49.160]  ancestors that starved to death and fought and women dying and childbirth
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.440]  and everything else our species has gone through crawling up and fighting the
[17:53.440 --> 17:59.640]  sabertooth tigers and the cave bears and the lions and the tigers and other
[17:59.640 --> 18:04.840]  tribes of humans coming in and conking our ancestors on the head and dragging
[18:04.840 --> 18:08.160]  the men off to eat them and taking our women and children and raping the hell
[18:08.160 --> 18:14.080]  out of them that's what evil people do that's the norm is people taking your
[18:14.080 --> 18:19.520]  child and running a metal rod through him and turning them on a spit to eat them
[18:19.520 --> 18:23.160]  every culture has engaged in cannibalism even when there's plenty of food it's an
[18:23.160 --> 18:28.720]  act of dominance by psychopathic control freak groups that tend to take
[18:28.720 --> 18:33.560]  control of societies but those societies can never become industrialized
[18:33.560 --> 18:38.720]  because only a loving good culture can build a true system but then the

[24:51.440 --> 24:57.400]  incredible news I just learned this during the break the Obama deception as
[24:57.400 --> 25:04.520]  many of you know was hacked the main version with 6.5 million plus views it
[25:04.520 --> 25:10.120]  was the number one search term Friday and Saturday the passcode for the director
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.160]  channel we don't have a director channel but Kenneth Webb does it's
[25:15.160 --> 25:21.000]  changed the channel as the handle it was hacked and someone went in and erased
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.160]  the Obama deception and it said removed by user and when that happens you cannot
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.760]  put the video back up if you remove a video it's gone and to my knowledge
[25:30.760 --> 25:35.440]  because we did research on this Google the parent company of yahoo of YouTube
[25:35.440 --> 25:43.120]  excuse me has never never re-enabled a video that was hacked and removed because
[25:43.120 --> 25:49.000]  they've had this happen in the past to some large videos it was it it was it
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.880]  was put back up minutes ago so I think Google the parent company of YouTube
[25:53.880 --> 26:00.160]  felt the power of our counter info war where over the weekend and yesterday I
[26:00.160 --> 26:09.080]  said search the term Obama deception censored and that became the number one
[26:09.080 --> 26:12.360]  search the number two search follow the Republic the number three search info
[26:12.360 --> 26:17.160]  wars.com we got a screen shot last night Obama deception censored was number
[26:17.160 --> 26:20.560]  one for the public number two info wars number six by the time I went to bed
[26:20.560 --> 26:26.040]  info wars was number three so we have the top three searches and we also have the
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.880]  screenshots here jaren if he gets a chance can pull up those images for you
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.440]  of messages people got from Google when people did the search for the Obama
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.120]  deception saying you're not allowed to look at this they were blocking that
[26:42.120 --> 26:45.800]  search it looks like they've removed that block as well because they're not
[26:45.800 --> 26:52.400]  stupid I was intending today to go on a full frontal assault and give you new
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.020]  search terms because we can give out new search terms on air that we can make
[26:56.020 --> 27:00.520]  number one because of our millions of listeners taking action that they'll
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.360]  have to continue to block out of their list because when they blocked out the
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.120]  Obama deception the Obama deception censored info wars.com when they blocked
[27:09.120 --> 27:15.520]  that out they blocked it out of the complete list it was nowhere in the
[27:15.520 --> 27:25.800]  top thousand list they just completely removed it and I've got Steve Watson
[27:25.800 --> 27:32.120]  doing a story about that right now in fact it just went live the headline is
[27:32.120 --> 27:39.520]  Google spies censors users and Google has been caught spying Google has been
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.160]  caught working with the NSA Google of course six months ago we have a link to
[27:44.160 --> 27:48.420]  their email they sent us said you're not allowed to sell the Obama deception on
[27:48.420 --> 27:52.020]  a Google shopping cart that we had gone and purchased and signed up for through
[27:52.020 --> 27:57.620]  their sales system I mean they told us you're not allowed to show Obama in a
[27:57.620 --> 28:02.500]  bad light this is not allowed this video is not allowed now people pointed out
[28:02.500 --> 28:05.580]  wait there's other shopping carts are allowed to sell it on there yes it was
[28:05.580 --> 28:12.180]  our official shopping cart we were told specifically no Obama deception so we
[28:12.180 --> 28:15.980]  know they've done this before and so what you do is now you make this the
[28:15.980 --> 28:22.500]  number one search term Google spies they've already blocked Google censors so
[28:22.500 --> 28:29.380]  now you search Google spies Google spies two words you go to Google and Yahoo
[28:29.380 --> 28:38.140]  and other searches you type in Google spies G-O-O-G-L-E-S-P-I-E-S two words
[28:38.140 --> 28:44.780]  Google spies and it will then take everybody to the number one link by
[28:44.780 --> 28:50.060]  Steve Watson prisonplanet.com and we're gonna add to this story not just my
[28:50.060 --> 28:54.980]  video that I shot Saturday night that was posted Sunday censorship alert
[28:54.980 --> 29:00.980]  Obama deception illegally removed we are now going to add the Obama deception
[29:00.980 --> 29:05.460]  that has risen like a phoenix from the ashes praise God and praise God that all
[29:05.460 --> 29:09.860]  of you took action because this is precedent setting we have never seen
[29:09.860 --> 29:14.820]  we did research there was one case where a video with over 200 million views a
[29:14.820 --> 29:19.500]  music video that was number one was hacked and replaced with something else
[29:19.500 --> 29:22.900]  and because they were Google partners they did take that down we've seen one
[29:22.900 --> 29:27.820]  other case this is precedent setting and we appreciate the NFC and Google
[29:27.820 --> 29:34.340]  backing off here and posting reposting it and I called for a criminal
[29:34.340 --> 29:38.140]  investigation yesterday I said YouTube you track the IP address so who went in
[29:38.140 --> 29:40.660]  there and did this
[29:43.220 --> 29:46.660]  why is this so important I'll explain why it's so important on the other side

[32:58.740 --> 33:21.220]  All right I want to hear from you specifically on 73,000 blogs were
[33:21.220 --> 33:25.140]  taken down by the federal government outside of a court outside of indictments
[33:25.140 --> 33:28.780]  they just took them down that's mainstream news under Justice
[33:28.780 --> 33:34.940]  Department orders I want to get your point your take on all these mainstream
[33:34.940 --> 33:38.420]  news articles about how the government needs to censor the web to protect it
[33:38.420 --> 33:42.500]  and this hoax that critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants in
[33:42.500 --> 33:45.700]  the Defense Department are hooked into the internet they are not hooked into
[33:45.700 --> 33:51.180]  the internet they have their own separate systems that's on record it's a lie
[33:51.180 --> 33:56.540]  some of the highway signs are hooked into a federal internet system and those
[33:56.540 --> 34:00.580]  have been hacked the main joke in the last three years is somebody hacks in
[34:00.580 --> 34:04.620]  and says zombies ahead be careful that's been in the news that happens every
[34:04.620 --> 34:09.300]  few weeks I see another article about a highway sign system being hacked because
[34:09.300 --> 34:12.660]  they are hooked into the internet because they use the internet to control them
[34:12.660 --> 34:16.660]  and so there is some infrastructure hooked in and it shouldn't be hooked in
[34:16.660 --> 34:21.660]  this is asinine but they're going to use that excuse and the government's going
[34:21.660 --> 34:25.540]  to attack the web themselves and they admit cybersecurity is to be offensive
[34:25.540 --> 34:29.620]  I want your take on the type of censorship we're seeing on the web you
[34:29.620 --> 34:33.940]  see when the name Alex Jones or info wars of the Obama deception and they've
[34:33.940 --> 34:37.340]  been number one in trends without us having listeners do it before go look
[34:37.340 --> 34:40.940]  at Google trends going back three four years we're way ahead of Rush Limbaugh
[34:40.940 --> 34:44.900]  Glenn Beck all of them we showed that yesterday we showed those trends on air
[34:44.900 --> 34:48.900]  for prison planet dot TV viewers go look at it for yourself do you think the
[34:48.900 --> 34:53.180]  system likes that no they thought they could use the web to surveil you to
[34:53.180 --> 34:56.860]  control you to gauge what you're doing what you're really thinking it's a total
[34:56.860 --> 35:00.020]  NSA system they weren't getting enough data just listening to your phones and
[35:00.020 --> 35:03.380]  reading your faxes they need to track what you're doing and what you're saying
[35:03.380 --> 35:06.940]  and what you're thinking to truly understand how to counter free humanity
[35:06.940 --> 35:11.100]  they admit they're using it for their psychological warfare studies against us
[35:11.100 --> 35:16.020]  but now we've taken it away from them not just Alex Jones but all of you out
[35:16.020 --> 35:20.220]  there all of the Patriots the globalists have tried to turn the internet
[35:20.220 --> 35:24.340]  into an infighting area where they admittedly send feds out to then get
[35:24.340 --> 35:28.100]  weak-minded people to parrot what they say to attack all the real patriot leaders
[35:28.100 --> 35:33.900]  like myself and Ron Paul and others but it's not working because people are
[35:33.900 --> 35:37.540]  discovering that and understanding what's happening and understanding that
[35:37.540 --> 35:41.260]  we're all in this together to defend the Bill of Rights the Constitution private
[35:41.260 --> 35:46.740]  property to stop the banking takeovers to stop the new wars we we we can all
[35:46.740 --> 35:51.300]  agree on those issues and the globalists are in the middle of their takeover right
[35:51.300 --> 35:56.700]  now and they don't want us to be out there countering them now I'm gonna
[35:56.700 --> 36:00.260]  explain this in layman terms because I've gotten so many emails and phone
[36:00.260 --> 36:04.460]  calls and comments on the websites and on YouTube and on info wars and prison
[36:04.460 --> 36:08.500]  planet I've seen just countless comments Friday Saturday Sunday and today
[36:08.500 --> 36:12.780]  saying Alex why don't you just re-upload the Obama deception if it was
[36:12.780 --> 36:16.620]  taken down off YouTube Alex why are you so upset about them taking it down
[36:16.620 --> 36:22.620]  someone hacking in and taking it down because for the last month for the last
[36:22.620 --> 36:27.940]  year and a half when you type in Obama or President Obama the number one well
[36:27.940 --> 36:31.220]  the last year and a half has been in the top three never number one was using
[36:31.220 --> 36:34.980]  number three or four sometimes number two in the last month if you type in
[36:34.980 --> 36:40.380]  President Obama Barack Obama Obama the number one link was a link to that six
[36:40.380 --> 36:44.620]  point five million viewed one and instead of it slowly growing to six
[36:44.620 --> 36:47.820]  point five million the last year and a half it was suddenly getting close to a
[36:47.820 --> 36:52.740]  hundred thousand a day on Saturday when they knocked it down they knew the trend
[36:52.740 --> 36:57.540]  it was about to get six million views in the next month not six million in a year
[36:57.540 --> 37:03.340]  and a half in fact I haven't tested that yet let me just test it right now let me
[37:03.340 --> 37:09.620]  put Obama deception in and see if it's the number one link again the number one
[37:09.620 --> 37:17.340]  link is Obama deception censored 73 related articles so there's 73 articles
[37:17.340 --> 37:21.940]  right now about the Obama deception being censored out there a lot of them are
[37:21.940 --> 37:27.620]  major news sites reporting on it see previously before this happened the
[37:27.620 --> 37:34.260]  number one link was the Obama deception and it is no longer the number one link
[37:34.260 --> 37:37.500]  so I guess their mission was accomplished we've got to go back into all
[37:37.500 --> 37:40.860]  these articles we wrote pointing out have been taken down and posted at the top
[37:40.860 --> 37:46.780]  so that people understand when they go to read that that it's now back up it is
[37:46.780 --> 37:55.020]  now the 1234 it is now the fifth link now since they made it go live again the
[37:55.020 --> 37:59.220]  link with six point five million but that's only under Obama deception it was
[37:59.220 --> 38:05.860]  when you search the term Obama let me do that search the term Obama and it is no
[38:05.860 --> 38:10.220]  longer the number one link with just the name Obama it's 1234 it's the fourth
[38:10.220 --> 38:13.780]  link that you give me a document cam shot on the big TV that I use to surf on
[38:13.780 --> 38:16.900]  I want people to see what I'm seeing right now they're watching on prison
[38:16.900 --> 38:22.220]  planet dot TV because this is info war this is the power of patriots and people
[38:22.220 --> 38:25.180]  that know the truth to say no to government-run health care no to new
[38:25.180 --> 38:30.260]  wars no to internet censorship no to tyranny it shows that when you put the
[38:30.260 --> 38:37.060]  name Obama in the number one thing in the last month you got was my film
[38:37.060 --> 38:42.580]  people doing school reports government people anybody worldwide typing in
[38:42.580 --> 38:46.380]  president Obama Barack Obama or Obama the number one link and when they knocked
[38:46.380 --> 38:50.660]  that out Saturday when they brought that video down and they've now restored it
[38:50.660 --> 38:56.140]  this is the second time ever heard of this happening this is praise God you
[38:56.140 --> 39:04.340]  know Google is getting a major backlash over this it is the fifth link down see
[39:04.340 --> 39:09.980]  before it wasn't the official website of Barack Obama as it is now it was my
[39:09.980 --> 39:13.260]  film you think the White House likes that when they admit they ran a quote
[39:13.260 --> 39:18.220]  and remember candidate Obama runs a YouTube campaign CNN headline remember
[39:18.220 --> 39:22.220]  all the news about the Obama girl get millions of views and that's why he won
[39:22.220 --> 39:28.380]  was YouTube YouTube is over half the video views in the world hundreds of
[39:28.380 --> 39:34.100]  millions of people a day go to it do you think that that they want you to go to
[39:34.100 --> 39:38.180]  youtuber Google or Yahoo and type in the name Obama or president Obama and get
[39:38.180 --> 39:42.740]  my videos number one link by killing that video they knocked it down but
[39:42.740 --> 39:46.900]  let's drive it up everybody's got to type Obama into a search engine scroll
[39:46.900 --> 39:50.380]  down to the fifth link that is the Obama deception high quality full-length
[39:50.380 --> 39:55.260]  version that's the name and click on it over and over again to drive it to
[39:55.260 --> 40:00.540]  number one and to get it space at the top and to put it above the official
[40:00.540 --> 40:07.420]  Barack Obama website that man is a hoax his approval rating is in freefall and
[40:07.420 --> 40:12.860]  this film exposes how he's run by the offshore banks it exposes how Bush was
[40:12.860 --> 40:15.900]  controlled by the same people liberals see this and wake up and it shatters
[40:15.900 --> 40:19.580]  their paradigm right wingers seeing it shatters their paradigm and opens up
[40:19.580 --> 40:23.900]  their mind of the wider world you know how many people commented and have sent
[40:23.900 --> 40:27.540]  me emails and have commented on my website and online saying the Obama
[40:27.540 --> 40:32.740]  deception woke me up this is a film that is the number one thing we've ever done
[40:32.740 --> 40:36.900]  the most devastating to the globalist and that's why they're so scared of it
[40:36.900 --> 40:42.420]  and this is a fast response by YouTube and Google to re-enable it in fact I've
[40:42.420 --> 40:49.060]  got the number to Kenneth Webb in here that runs that director channel we need
[40:49.060 --> 40:55.300]  to call him and see here it is guys his name's right here we need to call him
[40:55.300 --> 41:00.900]  the top paper here we need to call him and see what message YouTube gave him
[41:00.900 --> 41:11.980]  thank you sir but again everybody needs to type in Obama on the search engine
[41:11.980 --> 41:15.660]  and go down to that link to the video to click it that will drive it back to the
[41:15.660 --> 41:24.220]  top here's the comments on the video the resistances alive do you see what we
[41:24.220 --> 41:29.060]  are capable of as a whole well we're capable of a lot more than that resist
[41:29.060 --> 41:33.980]  oppression resist eugenics resist economic takeover promote freedom know
[41:33.980 --> 41:38.980]  what you're putting in your body grow up grow your own organic food get ready
[41:38.980 --> 41:47.220]  this will be a long fight but truth and light will prevail God bless you all and
[41:47.220 --> 41:54.860]  so that's what John C. L. one said and so it is back up let's send it to 7
[41:54.860 --> 42:01.220]  million by tomorrow let's give it 500,000 more views not just a hundred
[42:01.220 --> 42:07.940]  thousand by tomorrow go get the video the Obama deception in high quality it has
[42:07.940 --> 42:15.500]  6,509,624 views before that gets taken down again God forbid and get it out
[42:15.500 --> 42:20.420]  to your email list send it out post it on message boards go everywhere and say
[42:20.420 --> 42:24.180]  this is a censored video they don't want you to see see they took this down and
[42:24.180 --> 42:30.540]  it backfired and some idiots I've even seen mainstream news articles out there
[42:30.540 --> 42:34.860]  associated content had a three-page article this morning trying to imply
[42:34.860 --> 42:39.180]  that I would do this this isn't my stinking account this is Kenneth Webb
[42:39.180 --> 42:42.180]  who lives out in the country and can't even re upload it because his internet
[42:42.180 --> 42:47.020]  so slow he's got dial-up it was already the number one search it was
[42:47.020 --> 42:51.700]  everywhere it was the number one search the number one video why would I do that
[42:51.700 --> 42:57.660]  when you can't put it back up as a user only YouTube could put it back up what
[42:57.660 --> 43:02.340]  is your major problem we were already number one
[43:02.340 --> 43:07.740]  their censorship going on that put that up on screen 73,000 blogs taken down
[43:07.740 --> 43:12.940]  Thursday 73,000 blogs pulled by the federal government and they've got
[43:12.940 --> 43:16.380]  judges and lawyers on record saying there's no law to do this the Justice
[43:16.380 --> 43:21.580]  Department just did it 73,000 blogs gone they are testing to see what we're
[43:21.580 --> 43:29.260]  gonna do you think you think the establishment wants people to see what's
[43:29.260 --> 43:32.700]  in the Obama deception when it lays it all out shows Obama at the Bilderberg
[43:32.700 --> 43:36.620]  group meeting with Hillary a day before they made the announcement that she was
[43:36.620 --> 43:42.660]  dropping out you think people people that run this new world order want the
[43:42.660 --> 43:50.020]  population there it is US authorities shut down blog site hosting 73,000 blogs
[43:50.020 --> 43:58.380]  because they talked about file sharing on the site because they talked about it
[43:58.380 --> 44:06.500]  that's in the order the system is scared right now and they they talk in the
[44:06.500 --> 44:11.500]  Ministry of Defense report from 2007 about flash mobs on the ground flash mobs
[44:11.500 --> 44:15.100]  in the web and now they've got to take over the web to block the population
[44:15.100 --> 44:19.500]  from being able to take action now you need to search the term they've they've
[44:19.500 --> 44:25.020]  blocked out the Obama deception and the Obama deception censored that's where
[44:25.020 --> 44:27.900]  that can't go into the top trend so we've got to come up with other search
[44:27.900 --> 44:35.580]  terms that will lead people to the Obama deception my idea this morning was to
[44:35.580 --> 44:40.820]  have Steve Watson write an article with the title Google spies censors users
[44:40.820 --> 44:47.540]  you just search the term Google spies Google spies Google spies those two
[44:47.540 --> 44:51.300]  words Google spies and it will lead them to an article where Google admittedly
[44:51.300 --> 44:56.100]  spies and censors users and censored us with our shopping cart selling the
[44:56.100 --> 44:59.500]  Obama deception they're caught red-handed and then when they click on that
[44:59.500 --> 45:05.500]  article I'm gonna have Steve Watson right now it's an emergency call him he
[45:05.500 --> 45:09.540]  needs to post in that article the full Obama deception that's back up with a
[45:09.540 --> 45:13.940]  headline saying it's back up he needs to add that so that when people then search
[45:13.940 --> 45:17.820]  this number one search term they'll be taken to the Obama deception and they'll
[45:17.820 --> 45:21.140]  learn about Google and the NSA and what's going on and some people say well
[45:21.140 --> 45:24.460]  if Google's the NSA if yahoo's admittedly in bed with the government and
[45:24.460 --> 45:28.580]  admittedly a year ago now takes orders directly from the Senate and the office
[45:28.580 --> 45:31.940]  of Lieberman on what to take down and what to put up that that was admitted
[45:31.940 --> 45:37.180]  why are you there because that's where the war is people ask why do you have an
[45:37.180 --> 45:41.940]  iPhone app that's free if iPhone spy on you admittedly because that's what
[45:41.940 --> 45:46.460]  people got that's how I reached them that's like asking somebody in World
[45:46.460 --> 45:51.060]  War one on the line between the front lines with the French and the Germans
[45:51.060 --> 45:55.780]  why are you fighting on the front line because that's where the war is the war
[45:55.780 --> 46:05.500]  is on YouTube and Google the war is on yahoo the war is on the internet and if
[46:05.500 --> 46:09.500]  you'll unleash the power you've got as individuals we collectively can defeat
[46:09.500 --> 46:13.140]  these scumbags very quickly
[46:21.500 --> 46:26.300]  we have got to get serious minds we have to get focused minds we have to have
[46:26.300 --> 46:34.340]  committed minds when I was about 18 to 22 I went into a health kick got out of
[46:34.340 --> 46:37.900]  it after that sort of drink and smoke and few people do that actually get in
[46:37.900 --> 46:41.340]  shape and completely out of it I ran six miles every two every other day I
[46:41.340 --> 46:46.180]  looked at weights four days a week for two hours I power lifted you know I mean
[46:46.180 --> 46:50.740]  I was a little guy at 180 pounds I could bench press 330 squat over 600 I could do
[46:50.740 --> 46:57.460]  over 40 chin ups and it's because I exercised my muscles and because I read
[46:57.460 --> 47:02.860]  books on power lifting and how it was psychological and I went out with my UT
[47:02.860 --> 47:07.780]  football buddies who played football I didn't play football and I worked out
[47:07.780 --> 47:12.740]  with guys that were a lot bigger and stronger than me and it was all about
[47:12.740 --> 47:18.420]  getting in the zone a little old lady can squat a thousand pounds she just
[47:18.420 --> 47:21.540]  doesn't believe she can that's why they've had cases of women when their
[47:21.540 --> 47:26.380]  kids squealing under a car police have witnessed hundreds of times a woman
[47:26.380 --> 47:31.660]  going there's the whole car and it's the same thing in the info war it's that
[47:31.660 --> 47:37.740]  place in your mind it's that place in your mind where you've got to trick it
[47:37.740 --> 47:48.860]  and flip it into survival mode and then nothing can stop you it's that it's that
[47:48.860 --> 47:53.220]  place you've got to get your mind in a place it's like when your arm rust one
[47:53.220 --> 47:57.300]  somebody and if you try really hard you're not going to beat them it's
[47:57.300 --> 48:00.900]  being in a place where you literally flip a switch that you're going to die
[48:00.900 --> 48:07.020]  and I never understood it when I was able to do it innately as a primitive as
[48:07.020 --> 48:13.380]  a throwback as my late grandfather would call it that it's just you're doing
[48:13.380 --> 48:18.300]  it it's going to happen now when you run into somebody else who's doing like
[48:18.300 --> 48:23.220]  that that's when people get killed a lot of times it's gonna be you that's a
[48:23.220 --> 48:30.260]  problem anybody can turn this on ladies and gentlemen anybody can turn it on now
[48:30.260 --> 48:33.580]  you can do that when you're young when you get old you turn it on you're gonna
[48:33.580 --> 48:37.300]  pull arms out of sockets you're gonna your muscles are gonna tear off their
[48:37.300 --> 48:40.740]  joints if you're not in shape because the body can't handle it you take a
[48:40.740 --> 48:56.500]  young focus body it's the same thing you have to have a cold where you just
[48:56.500 --> 48:59.980]  clench your teeth and just feel that electricity in your mind and your soul
[48:59.980 --> 49:03.220]  you've just got to have that spirit of liberty and just say I don't care what
[49:03.220 --> 49:08.220]  it takes I'm gonna realize how hardcore this takeover is and how much danger our
[49:08.220 --> 49:13.540]  entire society's in and how wicked these evil people are we have a variety of
[49:13.540 --> 49:17.180]  evil running our society that is the most wicked I have ever seen and I've
[49:17.180 --> 49:23.980]  studied history deeply to them you watch a movie like The Road and it's
[49:23.980 --> 49:28.420]  depressing and shocking and horrific and depressing but for the globalist this
[49:28.420 --> 49:32.620]  is beautiful to them do you know what all the top artwork in the world is now
[49:32.620 --> 49:37.380]  sold for tens of millions per painting the top five or six artists you can go
[49:37.380 --> 49:43.260]  at Christie's and other things are buckets of maggots blood skulls photos of
[49:43.260 --> 49:48.060]  dead babies Swartz and Eger has huge art collections in my research of him of
[49:48.060 --> 49:55.180]  dead children killed in car wrecks dead babies and Nazi uniforms oh yeah just
[49:55.180 --> 49:57.900]  search Arnold Swartz and Eger at art exhibit you can pull it up it's a deep
[49:57.900 --> 50:05.100]  search you'll find it the point is the elite these bankers and people their
[50:05.100 --> 50:10.100]  houses are just filled with blood and death and slime and they think it's
[50:10.100 --> 50:14.540]  beautiful they they love piles of dead bodies they love piles of little kids
[50:14.540 --> 50:20.580]  shoes and in people being thrown into basements to rot and die they love seeing
[50:20.580 --> 50:25.140]  people with their ribs sticking out like concentration camp victims Hitler would
[50:25.140 --> 50:29.500]  sit there on the front lines in World War two during the invasion of Poland and
[50:29.500 --> 50:34.380]  Czechoslovakia with a telescope just watching burning buildings for
[50:34.380 --> 50:40.700]  sometimes more than 24 hours they love it they want to hurt you don't you

[55:00.940 --> 55:07.340]  the other salmon within 40 generations they are genetically engineering every

[56:03.340 --> 56:08.140]  we're on where it leads and it leads to the greatest mass murder and destruction
[56:08.140 --> 56:12.220]  and evil this planet has ever seen and whether it's going to come or not

[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:19.660]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:26.620]  Alex Jones. Alright Max Kaiser is coming up in an hour we'll have open phones when
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:32.900]  he's on with us as well. We're taking calls for the next 30 minutes solid then
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.980]  I'm the news blitz and I mean it's key info coming up T-minus 32 minutes we come
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.100]  out of that break right now let's go to your calls one after the other John and
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:47.420]  Ohio thanks for holding you're on the air. Thank you Alex hey I just want to let
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.060]  you guys know I had a tool that you can use for the search engine it's a site
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:57.020]  called site reloader.appspot.com and what you do is you just put the link in
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.660]  you hit put in a refresh rate and you hit the button and it
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:07.460]  refreshes all day every day 365 days a year and also put a tutorial in your
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.660]  YouTube page as well. Well that's awesome but we know that once it becomes
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.780]  number one trend they then block that trend so you've got to change the thing
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.340]  you're searching every day. Absolutely so if you come up with ten search items
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.180]  everybody can put those ten search items into this program and we can come up
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.060]  with ten new ones a day and take over the trend every day. And by the way that's
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:34.740]  what TMZ to make Lindsay Lohan number one is doing. The people really don't care
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.220]  about Lindsay Lohan they've even had a front line special a few years ago about
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:43.140]  the media force feeds the petty issues they force feed it. We're already been
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.020]  the number one trend many times just naturally and it's certainly upset the
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:51.700]  system when when the listeners made Obama deception number one on Saturday so
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.260]  somebody went in and deleted it and now YouTube has reversed it and put it back
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:00.660]  up. That's amazing isn't it? It's absolutely amazing I just can't believe
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.340]  that they're doing that I mean obviously they want to keep the truth hidden but
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.100]  you know the honest thing is that they can't keep us from you know just
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.940]  sitting back and doing nothing so I mean I stayed up all night yesterday
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:15.580]  researching you know what to do what else I could do and you know refreshing
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.300]  the page over and over it kind of gets tiresome but with this you know you said
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.500]  it forget it and you know at least it'll do something to help out the
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.220]  info work. Well done John and of course today's term for those that don't know
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.940]  and we're gonna have Steve Lincoln this article to the Obama deception that's
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:39.060]  been reposted the 6.5 million version Google spies censors users and again
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:47.620]  we're gonna get Steve to repost in that article the Obama deception in full so
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.100]  when people go click on Google spies they'll be able to read about it and
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:56.220]  then also see the video there that's key to get Steve Paul's on vacation for a
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.180]  week to get that added or we can send this version of the story to Curtin
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.740]  Emma and have him add the video in there as well that is vital because this is
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.340]  about to be the number one search term and they'll slap it down and I won't
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.100]  allow it in the search terms soon but they won't notice it on their radar
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:15.180]  until it's number one anything else John? No that's all just check out the your
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:18.220]  YouTube channel because I did post a tutorial in there and how to use it to
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.620]  make it user-friendly for everybody but it'll definitely help us out. All right
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:27.060]  good job John. Julio in Illinois you're on the air. Alex, good afternoon, how are
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.220]  you sir? Good sir, good to hear from you. To be here from you as always quickly I

[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:45.580]  against Alexi Janulius who has ties to Rom sugar daddy Emanuel and he's going
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:51.260]  up against Mark Kirk who is pro cap and trade taxing us for breathing if you
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.700]  can interview this man he's pro first amendment freedom of speech anti NAFTA

[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.940]  interviewed him on my radio show before I got kicked off the air and he did a
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:11.140]  credible man former Leatherneck Marine so check that out now I'm so proud of all
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:16.620]  the info warriors this past weekend for taking the initiative and you know
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.660]  posting Obama deception all over YouTube all over Facebook Twitter I don't use
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:27.020]  Twitter but for those who do great job the Obama deception I said this on your
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:32.660]  program it woke me up to you know the left-right paradigm KRS one had a great
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.380]  line in your in your film talking about how the globalist media to put a black
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:42.700]  face up against the new world order Obama was elected and everyone kind of
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.380]  took a sigh relief or across their shoulders and just stand down you see
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:52.900]  now all over the Mockingbird media they're talking about how oh the key
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.500]  party I'm not a key party member just stay there Hulio finish up on the other
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:02.500]  side we'll be back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.940]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.980]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.860]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.860]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.420]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:27.420]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.220]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.860]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:39.220]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:08:54.900 --> 01:09:03.300]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 that's what we say to the new world order
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:09.780]  the spirit of liberty is rising the globalists are going down
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:14.900]  the spirit of victory is being awoken on a planetary scale
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.780]  for every action there's an equal reaction and it's happening
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:25.460]  we are in a global fight against tyranny and there is a cyber war going on of
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.140]  propaganda and brainwashing and issues of no significance to distract and
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:33.460]  divert you and every time you send someone a link to info wars.com
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.900]  or the obama deception or any of the work we've done or other work that you
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:41.300]  think is important it has a giant effect
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.860]  it has a cumulative effect against the new world order
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.700]  and we've seen the power of the people we see obama's approval ratings dropping
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:53.220]  we see the mainline republicans approval ratings dropping we see
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.820]  the fact that world governments being set up is now mainstream news
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.660]  so we can have a real debate about it think how far we've come where
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.020]  over 80 of the american people in major polls want to audit or abolish the
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.540]  fellow reserve 10 years ago almost no one knew it was
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.820]  private no one knew it hadn't been audited oh sure they just
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.020]  passed the law to give themselves even more power but that's the beginning of
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:18.420]  the end that's them trying to secure their ill-gotten gains
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.620]  they want to bankrupt you and make you dependent on government
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.820]  they want to deval devalue the dollar and bring in this new global sdr
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.540]  currency but we're going to be here every step of the way
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.380]  telling people the truth and as things get darker the light of liberty will
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.140]  shine that much brighter the people are looking for the truth
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.500]  and it's vital that we be there to show them what's really happening and to
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.180]  show them the facts for those who just joined us
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:45.300]  someone hacked in i believe it was an insider at youtube or google may have
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.380]  been a rogue employee but that's the prime suspect the people of interest i'll
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.900]  put it to you that way and remove that film in police
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:57.380]  state for the rise of fema luckily twitters were sent matt ryan picked up
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.580]  on him he was doing updating on info wars on saturday
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:04.260]  he called me and said what do we do i called
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.300]  didn't have his number in my phone so rob drove in from his apartment because he
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.980]  lives close to the office rob Jacobson got me the number to kenneth webb who
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.620]  runs change the channel he has a directors account
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.540]  only people early on in youtube history get those and they're pretty rare
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.380]  and he posts our films in full length on parts
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.540]  youtube cuts them in you know 10 minute increments
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:30.340]  and he went into the interface saw the erasing going on and locked them out
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.540]  see if youtube would have gone in there and just changed the passcode
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.620]  then there would have been a big investigation we would have found out
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:39.300]  who did it but by going in and just hitting my films
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.100]  they thought they'd get away with it and i'm not a hundred percent of about 95
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.780]  percent chance it was an insider there i mean this was a long complex
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.580]  numbered passcode i mean there's no way uh that's
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.540]  it's just like with your iphone if you're entering your passcode and you do it a
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.700]  few times wrong it locks you out or like with your atm card
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:01.460]  well youtube's the same way there's no way this big they have computers that can
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.820]  randomly try to catch crack a code but it doesn't allow you to just
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.820]  plug in the interface and just sit there and hit it with new ones
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.620]  we also had uh dav who runs our official alex jones channel he works for us
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.180]  that's our channel officially he kept getting emails last week saying oh
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:23.060]  your your passcode change failed please uh send us your email back so they
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.860]  could try to you know manipulate him into giving
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:30.580]  him the passcode uh and uh so somebody was trying to hack
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.460]  into that and somebody could have hacked into kenneth
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:39.540]  webb's own computer and they could have gotten his passcode that way
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.980]  so he needs to put some serious security procedures in there and keep
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.780]  changing the passcode every day or two that's what he's going to be doing
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.700]  because you type the name obama and it's the number one link in the world not
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.580]  just on trends with listeners putting in to make that happen it was already the
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:55.700]  number one link in the last month the system doesn't like that now since it
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.340]  went back up about two hours ago an hour and a half ago
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:03.460]  or so it's the number five link to that particular
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.140]  free video when you put the name obama in so let's let's click on that link to
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.540]  get it back to number one and let's search the term
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:13.620]  google spies today because it will then take you to
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.340]  an article on prismplanet.com
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.140]  that will have the full length version posted my analysis video and the
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:26.980]  history of google censoring all proven they're google spies
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.340]  let's make that the number one search term today they'll then erase it out of
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.140]  it we'll have a new term and i'm not going to do this all the time
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.340]  i just wanted to show them what the people can do
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.700]  instead of them force feeding us lindsay lohan and mel gibson scandal
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.660]  okay i'm going to try to hurry through your calls now uh let's just i just want
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.580]  to give people those updates julio in illinois
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:48.740]  for those that just joined us you were bringing up the media is now in a
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.260]  like a tree full of parrots saying tea party racist tea party racist don't like
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:56.420]  health care but on my government racist don't like big government racist
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.940]  and that's just to keep the democratic base of minorities
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.780]  afraid and clinging to their eugenics nazi masters who they don't know are
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.660]  eugenics nazi masters because they haven't researched it
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.620]  uh so that's what's going on what's your point on that julio
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:14.900]  yeah they're just acting like uh true cia mockingbird assets just continuously
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:19.940]  trying to demonize uh everyone in the freedom movement for not liking
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:25.380]  you know barry cittoro mr uh obama but i i just want to say great job to
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:29.460]  everyone for you know showing the globalist that we
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:34.420]  the human being we as people do have great power i smiled at myself last
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.620]  night and told myself that as bob Chapman always says over the last few
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:40.340]  weeks we're going to beat these people because they are
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.180]  desperately afraid obama deception is such a powerful film it woke me up
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.140]  it woke so many of my so many of my friends up
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.020]  they're afraid alex we're going to beat these people
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.540]  i'm going to have you because they're criminals there i mean they're criminals
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.780]  and all we've got to do is stand up to them i mean literally made off

[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:08.180]  they're a pack of crooks there's no reason that that fat pervert
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:12.980]  uh al gore should be better than us and be able to defeat us
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.940]  it's only because we lay down and don't have faith in ourselves
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:20.820]  that that demonic slug is able to dominate and put all these taxes on us
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:26.660]  it's time to arrest these scumbags the truth set us free god bless you alex

[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:30.580]  thank you for what you're doing um i was a typical classic
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:34.020]  zombie didn't have any idea what was going on around me caught one of your
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:38.660]  videos on the independent channel on cable and it just like went right
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:43.700]  through me uh i'm an ex marine uh i did a lot of
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:46.500]  things for this country that i'm not very proud of but
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.940]  i want you to say that i hopefully hopefully we can
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:54.420]  resolve this peaceably uh but i'm sorry i'm just a little nervous right now
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.860]  what i really want to tell you was i was on yahoo today and i see like 19
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:01.460]  million hits on the obama deception
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:06.580]  uh area yes oh okay you realize that there
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.980]  and uh no i haven't seen that what did it say it got 19 million hits
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.580]  on uh actually i'm there right now obama deception 19
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:19.700]  million 1230 uh so you might want to look that up
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.580]  and get that out there i've been at it all weekend
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.660]  uh you know clicking on the different search engines and
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.020]  and bringing it up and uh i just want to tell you that you're doing a great job
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.060]  i appreciate it i'm doing everything i can and it
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:37.060]  felt really good to actually become involved
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.420]  you know i tell i tell everyone that i know about and everyone that i meet
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.820]  uh about the new world order and all but it felt really good to actually be able
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:49.460]  to physically carry out the tax that you gave us
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.620]  it was uh it was an awesome experience it felt really good
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:57.780]  and listen it scared the system we only know of one other example because it's
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.740]  in youtube rules that if somebody hacks your account
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:03.540]  and erases your videos they don't put them back up
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:08.420]  and we know of one case with a video uh that uh dave who runs the channel brought
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.740]  to my attention of uh what last year a video a music
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:16.420]  video had over 200 million views somebody hacked it and put their own thing
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.100]  up and it took about a month but but youtube fixed it because of the big
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.500]  backlash but by the record company that was so angry about it
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.300]  this is the really the first time we've seen a political video that's been
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:30.660]  hacked and removed put back up and it's because they know
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:33.620]  that we had the spirit of victory that we weren't going to give up that i was
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.900]  going to go completely ape about this because
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.940]  them wronging us and allowing this to happen
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:43.060]  galvanize people that's the reason they don't kill me
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.860]  you think this obama deception things bigger if they killed me it'd be a
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.220]  thousand times bigger that's why they want to demonize me
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:52.900]  have their operatives lie about me harass me all this other stuff because
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.060]  they know i'm real they listen to my phone
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.100]  they know we're for real they know we're real patriots
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.220]  you know and and and and and they know you're real and they're scared and
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.700]  they've got all the numbers they know we outnumber them
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:08.420]  see that's the final illusion mark is that
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.940]  we feel like we're alone we feel like we're the minority i mean and i appreciate
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:15.780]  your calling god bless you mark you touched my heart
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:25.060]  in national polls right at 90 percent on average summer 85 summer 92 but
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.020]  every year they have all these mainstream polls some scientific some not but

[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:18.340]  hey but in indiana you're on the air welcome how you doing elks doing all
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:22.260]  right my friend okay well i just like to say about
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:26.260]  the internet the last place where the masses can have a free
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:30.420]  exchange of ideas it is not controlled by the globalists and that's why they
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.180]  want to shut it down well said
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:37.540]  then basically uh i got a personal battle
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.740]  going on here in stark county indiana because of
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:46.260]  my wife basically followed uh false criminal charges against me and had me
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:50.660]  thrown out of my property and uh basically they start
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.260]  counting trampled out all over my constitutional rights
[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:57.700]  but basically had to do with because i was involved in the truth movement
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.300]  since 98 and my wife couldn't stand my political
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:08.580]  activism and so basically uh i got a big mess going on
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:13.300]  with them because uh my lawyer didn't really go into that for me or trying to
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:16.900]  give me well that's the problem is and it's it's come out in the news that a
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.300]  lot of these bad lawyers tell women to lie
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:25.140]  to like get control of a court case or property and men have done it as well
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:29.380]  but predominantly it comes out that women are told to do it
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:32.500]  because there's so many cases where men are abusive to women that then
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:37.060]  women can claim that when it's not true but i see more and more people
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.660]  individually doing that as well i mean i've seen other
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:45.140]  talk show hosts and media people before just tell complete lies you know
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.580]  say things like alish jones called up and threatened to kill me
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.780]  just complete in total lie and then i luckily had guys here in the studio
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:55.060]  who'd been there during the conversation and it was a calm conversation
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:57.940]  nothing was said and i called back and i said you know what
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:01.540]  you retract that or i'm gonna have to sue you and of course they did retract it
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.300]  but i mean it just seems like it's a normal thing for people to do in this
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:10.100]  society now is to just lie about people they folks have no honor
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.860]  and i'm sorry to hear that's happening to you that's why i think it's important
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:18.100]  that men meet women who are into the freedom and up front you know
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:22.020]  not just their looks but what they stand for i'd rather have a woman
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.460]  who wasn't the most beautiful uh you know in the world according to worldly
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:29.140]  standards but had a good heart that would love my children and love me
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.740]  and who was smart i mean i'd rather have a smart woman
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:36.340]  and a loving woman than than than one of these trophy wives
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.300]  uh and of course there's a lot of great looking women that are great people as
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.340]  well but i mean it's it's it's about
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.540]  it's about the soul of the woman and the soul of the man
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:49.140]  it's not about uh just boy that's a good looking uh you know
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:54.180]  philly but basically i've been out of my home for 10 months now i'm living in my
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:58.100]  sister's place and basically they act like uh like i don't have
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:03.060]  any rights at all and it was all based on lies she used the lies to
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.540]  basically file false charges against me to get a protective order filed to get
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.220]  me tossed out of property you can file civil suits
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.220]  to get your portion of the property uh well
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:18.420]  i'm already going through divorce proceedings but my lawyer is not very
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:21.300]  aggressive he called me well that's because they get more money the longer
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:25.700]  they draw it out you need to get law books yourself
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:29.220]  and you need to file your own stuff and just start hitting her lawyer with
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:33.220]  injunctions and filings every week and her lawyer will ditch her quick
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:37.460]  they're only running over you because it's easy yeah because they know the
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.700]  law and i don't basically but uh basically you know it's just like
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:45.700]  they come on my property with no evidence and
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:49.700]  they didn't even file domestic charges or domestic violence charges
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:53.140]  on me after they threw me off the property because they knew they didn't
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.420]  have a case and you own an interest in this property
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.220]  well it'll be fleshed out in court you need to get a new
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.580]  lawyer god bless you i'm sorry to hear that's happening to you

[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:17.060]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:20.580]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:24.180]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:28.100]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.700]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:34.740]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:13.140]  mega massive news splits coming up and then i'll go back to your phone calls
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.220]  and then we got max kaiser coming up to continue with calls then
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:20.980]  and i wanted to make this point right now
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:27.540]  we have the number one search terms on yahoo and google
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:31.460]  today the term is google spies
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:36.020]  if you put an automatic program on your computer and keep reloading that though
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:38.580]  you may have trouble with your isp is calling it
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.700]  spamming i don't know if that's good for people to do
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:44.820]  i'm saying in your regular course of the day
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:50.420]  go search the term google spies and things like that
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:53.540]  to drive it up in the ratings
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:34:00.340]  but before we did this on friday the number one link by itself just because
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:03.620]  of traffic was the obama deception when you search the
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.500]  term barack obama president obama or obama
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:11.780]  it's now the number five link so that's the main reason it was knocked down
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:16.020]  so that people wouldn't watch that link when they put the president's name in
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:24.580]  the top link is now barack obama's official site
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:28.980]  but so many people see going to the county courthouse or going to the city
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.420]  council or going to their state house or calling congress or calling the talk
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:36.260]  radio as work it's fun to resist tyranny
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.540]  you're meant to be struggling for freedom like it's a football game those
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.260]  instincts when you go in a hundred thousand if you get to stadium and
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:46.500]  chant you know that's that's a facsimile
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.940]  of your normal tribal instincts to get together for war
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:53.860]  well in the modern sense it's info war this is the team we're on
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:58.180]  team liberty team freedom team private property
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:04.100]  team not having parasites rob is blind if we don't have freedom we have nothing
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.780]  we will be enslaved in every case in history
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:11.140]  it's just that simple but i do want to salute
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.660]  and thank and appreciate all of you out there

[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.540]  after we ship it and everything but the point is the the system is scared of
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:51.140]  this and and the low tech way to have it in the highest quality on dvd and make
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:54.900]  copies of it and give it to people or to give them

[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:39.220]  of news that i've read over and gone over before the show and
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:42.340]  every one of these articles i could talk about them for an hour
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:47.380]  but i look at these stacks there's got to be 130 or so or more
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:51.620]  that's just a guesstimation i wonder how right i am let's do that

[01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:02.420]  eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.340]  there's another 10 articles or so in there that's 30
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:12.180]  other four or five articles uh yeah it's it's guesstimation's right it's
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.580]  probably 120 130 articles here again i did reckon a lot
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.380]  in fact you should i right now just count every one of them here on air just to
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:23.140]  see i haven't done it but

[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:13.620]  and there's all these stacks yeah i bet it's 100 there's no way to read it all
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:17.700]  the point is i got a lot of articles here and and any one of
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.340]  these i could spend hours on but let's just uh at least run through the
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:25.220]  headlines uh here for people right now today

[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.980]  article said obama needs to look like a strong leader to have people rally
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:20.340]  around him for protection the government blows up a building and then
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:23.380]  you run up and and then hug on to the black uniform leg

[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.740]  the obama deception and had it put back up it's impossible
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:09.060]  for a user who runs an account to take their video down and then
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:13.300]  put it back up do you understand that anyone who runs a youtube channel knows
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:16.500]  that if you delete a video that's what the hack
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.380]  was somebody went in said they were the user deleted it wasn't even my account
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:24.340]  it was someone else's you go in and do that you cannot restore it
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:27.140]  by the way i talked to kithweb earlier that runs that channel
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:31.300]  he said that videos he'd had removed years ago by them were suddenly restored
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:34.660]  they have lied and said they can't restore videos that are hacked and taken
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:37.620]  down videos that were taken down of his years ago have
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:43.460]  everything's been restored and that points towards somebody inside
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.100]  they're doing something they weren't supposed to i'm not saying google and
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:49.460]  their parent company i'm not saying youtube and their parent
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:52.660]  company google gave the orders to do this i'm saying
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:55.860]  there's no way somebody figured out that passcode on their own out there and
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:45:00.900]  this was a mainline hack i believe it's an inside job as most crimes are and it
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.340]  is a federal crime and i believe that all the evidence points
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:09.620]  towards it being an insider and i've never seen google
[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.820]  put something back up again except when a record company got involved in
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.780]  something over 200 million views and somebody else put up another video in
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.700]  its place there's been one case we know of this
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:24.660]  is the first time a political video has been put back up the obama deception
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:29.780]  i mean this is so huge okay you understand i physically can't put it back
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:34.420]  up i can re upload it i could re upload it
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:39.060]  if he gives me the codes but it's not the same video it will show up with zero
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:43.700]  views when it first goes up they restored the video that had six
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:48.020]  million five hundred thousand hits on it
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:51.300]  they restored it that's the one that's linked all over the web
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:54.500]  that's the one that has the value that's the one when you type in obama's name
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:58.580]  that was the top link why in the world would i take
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:03.700]  my own video down when they've never restored one this is history
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:07.860]  making doesn't matter though i physically cannot put it back up
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:10.740]  only google can do this and they've always said they couldn't
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:14.500]  they did it they did it and i believe it's because they went to an ip search
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:17.780]  like i demanded and they found out one of their own stinkers did it
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:23.620]  because they do have the passcodes at youtube youtube has the passcodes to
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:26.420]  youtube comprende if the police were doing an
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.900]  investigation of this that's the first place they'd go
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.580]  in 101 criminology it's not like i'm pulling rabbits out of my head here
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:35.860]  it's not like i'm sitting here speculating i study this stuff it's
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.500]  what i do
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:46.900]  all right it doesn't matter let me continue with the news
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:49.780]  let me continue with the news
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:57.460]  when you make a film and you love it
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:01.460]  and it's like a child it's like an oil painting that you spent months on
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:04.420]  and then somebody takes it and tears it up and burns it
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:08.020]  it makes you mad it makes you angry but this wasn't just some painting that
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:11.380]  people had viewed and loved this is something that woke up millions of
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:15.620]  people that's precious to me i don't care about diamonds
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:19.380]  and crap and and status i care about people's minds
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:22.580]  i want to unlock minds that's what's valuable to me
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:28.820]  this was like somebody burning down my house
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:31.940]  because what i love is waking people up that's the equivalent of a house it's
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.980]  like burning down a family home it's like burning up burning down a
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:39.460]  house i grew up in i became physically ill and almost
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:42.980]  vomited my wife's like what's wrong and i'm sitting in a chair i became
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:47.140]  nauseous saturday when i got the news when matt ryan called me
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:52.260]  i went and pulled it up and saw it was gone and i became nauseous
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.580]  i almost threw up
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:00.980]  because that film is going more viral it's going to unlock millions of more
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:05.220]  minds god blessed me with the skill to be able to transmit the truth
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:09.060]  god blessed me with the energy to make that film and to have a platform
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:13.620]  that was able to reach people it's precious it's precious to me to be
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:16.420]  able to stand in front of a sports stadium of a hundred thousand people
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:20.660]  all those people and to be able to address them
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:25.380]  with this one version of the film i addressed more than 65 sports stadiums
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:32.420]  with 100,000 people per stadium 65 sports stadiums with 100,000 people
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:36.260]  in each one i addressed them for two hours with
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:40.100]  that film and i'm going to address tens of
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:46.580]  millions more hundreds of more sports stadiums full of people
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:50.980]  i value what's valuable and we don't have a future i'm dead
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:54.420]  if we don't win this thing i passed the pointer no return a long time ago the
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:58.580]  globalists want to smash me fighter in a pancake i can't quit i can't fade off
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:01.540]  into the sunset they'll come after me i've studied history
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:04.340]  just like they told jim garrison you've got to stay on the spotlight for the
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:08.500]  rest of your life boy with the kennedy assassination
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:13.940]  i'm in this bear trap there's no getting out of it i got to go through it
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:24.180]  and i believe the globalists are going to counter strike
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:29.380]  i don't believe they're going to give up on this they don't like to lose
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:32.580]  and i would predict they're going to come after us really bad now
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:39.460]  i told the guys that last night at dinner after the show took them to dinner
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:42.580]  it's like standing at the edge of a high dive
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:45.220]  first time you jump off one when you're eight years old and it's
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.900]  40 feet down it's scary but as soon as you jump
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:53.620]  you feel your stomach you know come up in you
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:57.380]  you're falling and pretty soon you hit the water i jumped off that high dive a
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:03.060]  long time ago folks i'm not going back up i'm going down
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.580]  but we're all going down we're all gonna die we're all gonna grow old we're all
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.340]  gonna end up with wires crammed up our nose at some hospital or in a big car
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:13.060]  wreck smashed all tied up inside the vehicle with blood
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.740]  spilling out of us so why in the world will we not have courage to stand up
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:19.700]  against tyranny none of you are getting out of this alive
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.580]  and it's the fact that people are cowardly and weak and scared of what
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:24.900]  their neighbors are going to think of them and they can't get outside these
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:27.780]  comfort zone bubbles it's the mere fact that we have this
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:31.700]  weak loser attitude that's allowed a bunch of scum to come in and take over
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:38.020]  our society and boss us around and try to control us
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:41.620]  so i know this i'm not getting in any ditch and licking boots
[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:45.460]  i'm not going to die on my knees i'm not going to die on my belly
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:50.660]  i'm going to die on my feet and i'm going to give the new world order the
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:53.780]  biggest fight they've ever seen and if you'll just commit and do the same
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:57.940]  thing these enemies will vanish like specters at dawn

[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:45.300]  globalist and a teleprompter reading lawyer but he himself is just a puppet

[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:38.100]  about max he said i'm going to talk about a hidden world growing beyond
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:42.500]  control close to a million nsa and cia private
[02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:48.100]  operatives now 854 000 and the washington post itself a
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:52.100]  spook factory uh you know a month ago they admitted that the cia
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:55.460]  created fake bin laden videos we told you those were fake years ago but
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:59.140]  now they just throw it in your face a hidden world growing beyond control and
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:02.420]  who's the big part of the national security clearances google
[02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:05.780]  youtube they are the nsa and that's all in this
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.220]  article and i i want to get into golden sacks being slapped on the
[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:12.020]  rest the federal reserving even more power over our economy
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:15.620]  with the passage of the financial overhaul last week with max
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:18.580]  but max wanted to talk about the obama deception first he said i don't this is
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:22.340]  big news and and literally now i said 20 it's now hundreds of
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:26.180]  newspapers and blogs big ones are reporting on the censorship of the
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.900]  obama deception and this is the first time ever
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:31.620]  they happened with one music video before that over 200 million views this
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:37.780]  one 6.5 million if if it says the users removed
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:41.460]  it which was the hack you you cannot put it back up anybody who has a youtube
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:45.220]  channel knows that it's gone they didn't just restore the director
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:49.140]  channel video they restored every video that
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:52.820]  kenneth webb had ever deleted himself or any video that had been removed for
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:57.540]  terms of use his whole account going back five years he's had one over five
[02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:59.860]  years he's got a director's account a founder account
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:03.780]  it's even more than a director account it's one of the first people on youtube
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.660]  because again we don't have a director account somebody gave us one youtube
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:09.860]  wouldn't let us have it last year so this fellow
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:13.940]  you know this great guy he uploaded it there's thousands of other versions
[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:16.820]  on youtube and google but it's they're broken up in 10 minute pieces
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:21.300]  a million here entered thousand there half a million here 400 000 there
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:24.420]  this one though was the top link when you search the name obama
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:27.380]  not just the top and the trends with my listeners putting that in to make up the
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:31.940]  top of google trends no no it was on its own the number one thing in the world
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:35.540]  when you said president obama barack obama or obama
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:38.580]  it knocked us out of the top searches when they did this but today when they
[02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:42.020]  put it back up it's already number five when you'd say barack obama president
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:45.700]  obama or obama and you bet it's going to be number one the next week
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:49.540]  i predict you go in there you click on it in the in the search engine
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:52.580]  put obama deception in you see the link to the full length video
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:57.300]  you click on that drive it to number one max i mean this is crazy
[02:10:57.300 --> 02:11:00.740]  that this is going on what's your take on it okay well
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:04.740]  washington post just came out with their big report they spent two years
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:08.980]  it with this report they've got a website called top secret america
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:14.100]  850 000 people in america are on the highest clearance for secrecy
[02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:17.220]  and they cobbled together all the companies that are
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:22.180]  working together to create a what they call a fourth branch of government the
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:27.540]  top secret branch and prominent on the list is google you know google is
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:31.300]  prominent in top secret america so i'm not surprised with the obama
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:36.020]  deception and the key here is that the the military
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:39.940]  industrial complex that people used to talk about is given away purely to the
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:44.740]  information industrial complex it's obviously info wars
[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:48.900]  that you know you correctly predicted this years ago that information would be
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:52.820]  the battleground and you're fighting the info wars and you've been fighting
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:59.460]  really against this clandestine multi hundred billion dollar
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:03.700]  secret part of the american government and
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:06.980]  obviously when you put something up like the obama deception
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:10.020]  and that you've got folks who are pushing that up and
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:14.020]  dominating the search results and skewing the public perception in the
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:18.260]  very carefully crafted publicity and propaganda
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:22.020]  to keep people away from thinking intelligently about
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:26.020]  some of the wrongs being done they have to act and they act in the way that
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:29.140]  you've just seen the mac but you're getting so big now that you
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:32.580]  apparently you got them to reverse themselves so kudos to you
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:37.060]  well i have to tell you max my sixth sense my spidey sense is off the charts
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:40.820]  this is not fun getting this much attention but i've set out
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:44.500]  to mobilize the people to defeat these globalists and what you hit on
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.940]  and what the washington post admits in this top secret america
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:51.140]  to your report this is them coming out in the open
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:54.820]  the washington post is the top bill berger paper the grams have been attending
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:59.140]  for 50 plus years of the owners uh they are the ones that are there to
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:02.820]  whitewash everything and they basically claim they're
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:05.700]  reporting on it but they're really just selling it to people
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:09.300]  when i read the spp documents that judicial watch student got three years
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:13.140]  ago that i talked so much about there is the fortune 100
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:17.060]  it's a little over 100 companies the top ones there at this vamp canada meeting
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:19.860]  and they'd had others and the first item of agenda was
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:23.140]  this is under international corporate government security
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:26.820]  all of you were sworn to secrecy we need a carbon tax to fund the world
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.780]  government we're going to shut down all the industries
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:33.620]  and uh this corporate body is going to vote and then
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:36.580]  the head of the mexican u.s and canadian state departments
[02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:40.580]  will implement through the agencies this is the highest security level and it's
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:44.020]  it's been released and so the corporations have meetings
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:47.860]  they give orders and it is carried out and that's what this is
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:51.620]  they have they're merging the four branches of the military with google
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:56.660]  with youtube with yahoo with oracle with a handful of others and they all
[02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:58.820]  admit they're going to take the web all over
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:02.340]  block everybody else they'll get all the business there's a revolving door
[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:05.780]  between government these corporations so the people in government will then get
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:08.740]  jobs with them and then go back into government and around and around
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:12.580]  and this is a total global corporate coup over everything
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:16.100]  with 800 plus thousand private corporate spies
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:20.580]  part of infregard where they are all government agents with license to kill
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:23.460]  powers according to mainstream news two years ago
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:27.940]  via infregard they are being trained to literally kill employees if they ever
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:31.300]  try to save the country they are i mean this this is hell
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:36.900]  world this makes the nazis look tame in organizational skill max
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:40.980]  well i i agree to that major media mainstream media including the washington
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:45.140]  post are totally compromised by what you call the
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:48.820]  globalist what are now being referred to openly as top secret
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:53.140]  america but i think that occasionally some truth
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:58.660]  manages to get through and if it becomes a big enough problem
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.700]  then move to position b which of course is your false flag attack
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:07.140]  so in other words i don't doubt the credibility of this report
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:12.260]  what i think it came through uh now the 11th hour apparently insiders that the
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:15.940]  paper and the media uh wanted to block this publication
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:18.820]  or wanted to find out more about what was in the publication but now it's out
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:21.460]  it's on the web people are seeing it so now i believe
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:25.540]  the timing for the false flag is here because this is a
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:28.500]  bombshell report this is going to really send
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:31.380]  shock waves throughout washington i want you to elaborate but i want to
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:36.260]  interject here if one three hundredth of the nation
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:39.220]  and that's counting men women and children so it's even higher
[02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:43.140]  if one one three hundredth or one three hundredth
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:47.620]  one out of three hundred is a top secret spy and they admittedly for every top
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:50.020]  secret spy they probably have as many as 10
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:53.380]  auxiliaries uh i mean you're talking about a stasi
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:57.300]  level number where probably 10 of the people in the country are now spies at
[02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:00.820]  one level or another uh for this corporate takeover i mean
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:05.220]  and and they're funding themselves with tax money this is a takeover this is a
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:08.340]  criminal enterprise just like goldman sacks for 30 years
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:12.260]  put their people in every management and regulatory position
[02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:16.740]  before they rob the country this has been a long term strategic plan and of
[02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:19.860]  course they were profiting the whole time taking over the infrastructure
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:22.820]  while they did it i mean this is diabolical
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:27.220]  well the idea of spying and spies going back a few decades
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:31.860]  it usually gets back to corporations seeking intelligence on other
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:36.420]  corporations and this is really the cia and
[02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:39.460]  these organizations that came out of world war two
[02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:42.980]  and a lot of the corporate work that was done in world war two
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:46.500]  transformed into this intelligent network of corporate
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:51.780]  espionage and it's an unfair trade advantage yeah and this is but today
[02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:56.900]  because of the economy collapsing what we're seeing is something different a
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:00.820]  little different in that folks who want to run the
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:04.020]  global game are trying to come up with new ways
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:10.580]  to um to to let's say replace the current system
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:14.420]  where people are working for a salary and that salary goes
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:18.900]  toward consumption we're seeing a migration toward a system
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:22.740]  where people are going to be working more for credit and these credits are
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:26.100]  are being controlled by the same group of companies like a google
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:29.540]  or a facebook or these two social networking sites you know this is a
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:32.020]  theme i've explored with you before on your show
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:35.620]  that currency is being replaced with credits and debits and if you
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:40.980]  go to alexjonesinfowars.com you will find your online accounts filled with
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:46.500]  debits but if you go to uh goldman sacs propagated.com you find
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:51.780]  your online account filled with credits and this is a new virtual currency
[02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:55.700]  that's coming online and it's already a multi-billion dollar industry
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:00.660]  a company called the zinga which makes the virtual currency for online games
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:04.100]  is already a multi-billion dollar industry people
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:08.820]  are swapping their time for virtual credit and effectively working for 30 or
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:12.500]  40 cents a day and they're happy to do it because they think they're winning
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:15.300]  something and it's the combination of these
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:19.460]  online social networks the banking system looking for a new form of virtual
[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:21.940]  currency and the casino industry and all their
[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:25.540]  technology to get people to gamble away their lives have come together
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:28.580]  and so this is part of what we're seeing also they need all this intelligence
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:32.580]  gathering in order to create this incredible
[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:36.020]  new society of people who are basically just
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:39.380]  on the web but only in in ways that are approved
[02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:43.460]  by by the google that's right now stop there stop there because
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:47.300]  this is so key if you read george george arwell's 1984 and of course he
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:50.980]  worked for british intelligence at bbc in black ops his character is
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:55.860]  winston smith he said the public won't rise up because of the
[02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:00.420]  lottery and he talks about how people believing they have a chance to win
[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:03.620]  within that fake paradigm is why they would never rise up
[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:06.180]  because they've been trained to only care about issues of little or no
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:11.860]  significance and fake pop icons that big brother produced and pornography
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:14.660]  and that's because they understood psychology 50 something years ago when
[02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:18.900]  he wrote that in 48 now we see the high tech version of
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:21.860]  this where everything is about that chance to win
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:24.740]  and oh i better not get out of the federal reserve system because then i'll
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:28.660]  get none of my retirement when you're not going to get it to begin with
[02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:32.020]  right now you lose all of your chances to win at the lottery so
[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:35.220]  dollar bills are replaced with virtual lottery tickets
[02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:39.060]  and people will be happy to spend hours their entire lives
[02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:43.220]  clicking away online for more of these virtual lottery tickets in the hope that
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:47.220]  someday day two will graduate to the higher level
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:51.780]  in the game stay there max this is so profound what you just
[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:56.740]  talked about they create a false reality of sports
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:20:01.380]  movies icons fake credits and you sell your soul for it
[02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:05.140]  what started as an idea to provide power for a small hunting cabin has grown
[02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:08.100]  into a passion for creating an alternative energy source that's

[02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:32.980]  job we changed the passcodes again they have now
[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:36.900]  they have now disabled it all over the web if it's embedded on somebody else's
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:40.180]  web page of the articles we've written and it says
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:46.580]  and it says disabled by user disabled it says it's been disabled that you
[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:50.020]  have to go to youtube to watch it now go back to the other screen
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:55.940]  when you go to youtube it says renting on youtube starts with
[02:24:55.940 --> 02:25:03.460]  youtube account it is 295 to rent it
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:07.140]  ladies and gentlemen we get the film out for free

[02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:19.300]  this is happening live time it is going mega viral on the web
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:22.740]  the obama deception and our story google spies
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:26.340]  and so now they're making you pay money to them
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:30.980]  for my film my film and they are one of them
[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:34.020]  i told you i had a feeling they were going to strike back i knew
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:37.860]  there was something chicanery going on here google never when they bring a
[02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:41.220]  video down put it back up this is unprecedented
[02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:44.660]  max keiser max keiser this is exactly what you're talking about how they use
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:49.300]  everybody's content make you pay for it this is insane max
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:53.620]  now on the yeah you own the copyright right yes
[02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:56.820]  okay so they're violating copyright law they've taken the court
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:59.860]  immediately well these are people that say they own every book in the world
[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:03.940]  they're going to publish it now online in charge and give no one money
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:07.700]  because it's the government they know other corporations don't get away with
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:10.420]  this there's a reason they let youtube and google be the biggest
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:13.300]  and again we're on there because that's where the fight's happening i can't
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:17.540]  believe this all right okay go to do if you do search video games
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:21.540]  ceo chairs digital tyranny let me read you this little
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:26.100]  bit he says as more power is taken from the hands of ordinary people and they
[02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:29.380]  find themselves working harder and harder for fewer and fewer
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:33.700]  real reward they're seeking escape in a sense of personal achievement by
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:37.780]  building make-believe farms and creating pretend empires through fake
[02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:42.180]  mafia family because similar to our federal reserve note
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:45.380]  the objects obtained from these games are made out of thin air
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:48.740]  but without any need for physical resources to create them
[02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:53.300]  there's no scarcity of reward to be handed out people pay real money
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:56.820]  real defined as credit obtained from labor in the real world
[02:26:56.820 --> 02:27:00.980]  for the chance to one-up their friends in what is ultimately just a game
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:04.580]  now as the games are just the beginning the future
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:08.660]  the outlines will bring the structure of these games into the real world where
[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:12.020]  our lives will be controlled by a similar point system
[02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:15.700]  to replace our currency he speaks with the potential for a government
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:19.140]  awarding credits through youtube and through google
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:22.980]  to people who walk to work take public transportation
[02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:28.420]  they brush their teeth so it's total social control through the web and then
[02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:31.780]  and then it's a controlled web you talked about this five years ago
[02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:35.860]  and it's a casino gulag but can you believe
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:39.540]  that first they go in clearly youtube they've got our account number
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:43.940]  and now we changed the passcode they they're the only ones that have it nobody
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:46.820]  could hack it in this time and they go in and disable
[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:50.580]  all the millions of links around the web where other news websites and people
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:55.140]  have posted it so it's going mega viral and their new sabotage is to make it a
[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:58.980]  rental i mean my i cannot believe this man i can
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:03.140]  folks do not pay for it do not give them a red stinking scent it's still free
[02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:06.980]  and a lot of other news websites and places but send the links to ones that
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:11.060]  are working out to everyone you know i tell you they max they are scared of
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:13.860]  this film you're in fall the republic part two of the obama deception i think
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:17.220]  it's even more important but i mean you've seen the obama deception
[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:20.900]  why do you think they're so scared of it well first of all change the name of
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:24.340]  fall the republic to the obama deception part two
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:27.700]  that'll totally screw up their head
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:31.220]  because then they have to go chase after another 10 million videos out there
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.140]  in other words hit information overload with information overload you know what
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:40.020]  is it about the word war in info war that people don't understand it's a war
[02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:43.940]  it's an info war so we got to fight back with information
[02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:47.940]  so just change everything to car the obama deception change your name on

[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:59.460]  and they're panicking right now it's been the number one search term for three
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:03.620]  days people keep varying it like the obama deception at info wars the
[02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:07.140]  obama deception censored and they keep censoring that but not
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:10.820]  before it hits number one they are in panic mode i think we're seeing a
[02:29:10.820 --> 02:29:15.540]  digital revolt right now max if people go completely ape right now
[02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:19.620]  well two years ago remember china in america had a digital war
[02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:22.100]  they did had a distributed denial of service attack
[02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:25.140]  that china hit the u.s with and then the u.s hit
[02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:28.420]  with a doubting of some some kind of surveillance technology
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:32.100]  so now you've become as effectively your own country the info war
[02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:36.020]  dot com has become as big as a country what we're doing is fighting for truth
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:39.540]  and justice and freedom lovingly to wake people up
[02:29:39.540 --> 02:29:42.820]  but they're gonna love the fact we use the term war to turn the pentagon loose
[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:46.020]  on us that runs google there's no doubt this is happening we're trying to get
[02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:50.980]  the head of the channel on right now ladies and gentlemen this is total war
[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:54.820]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:59.780]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:07.620]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:11.300]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:14.980]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:30:14.980 --> 02:30:17.860]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:21.380]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:24.980]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:24.980 --> 02:30:28.900]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:32.500]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:35.540]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[02:33:24.820 --> 02:33:28.180]  the network and the satellites max geyser's gonna stay with us
[02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:31.220]  in his words during the break he said i'm not leaving my post
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:35.780]  they've also disabled police stayed for the rise of femum
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:40.420]  they've also disabled that on all of the search engines when you click on it
[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:43.460]  it tells you you've got to go to youtube to watch it they're trying to charge
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:48.340]  people money when we give this film out for free
[02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:53.060]  as a way to keep people from watching it this is outrageous
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:56.660]  ladies and gentlemen don't give youtube or google any money
[02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:59.140]  do not pay to watch it they're still free versions
[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:02.900]  but once they do this i've read about this they're going to try to knock out
[02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:04.980]  all the other free versions that are out there
[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:08.500]  and then they'll shut down this version we can now see their plan they do not
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:12.500]  want you to see the obama deception for a limited time until they run out
[02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:16.900]  i've got the obama deception four copies for 1995 and the hardcover dvd
[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:20.020]  with the expanded extras in the highest quality get it
[02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:24.180]  make physical copies and hand them out on the street but you can really see how
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:27.700]  they get everything hooked into google and youtube it's really an nsa front
[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:30.500]  it takes over the web it publishes books
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:34.980]  doesn't care of publishers sue them the courts always rule for google
[02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:38.580]  they are allowed to do things that nobody else is ever allowed to do
[02:34:38.580 --> 02:34:43.060]  and you can see the strategic plan i saw this years ago but now it's very clear
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:46.500]  they are meant to absorb the web in fact that's come out in major news headlines
[02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:50.020]  that google is to be the web
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:55.460]  and it is a pentagon operation with the select corporations it is it is nsa
[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:59.300]  keyword software that google was built on 11
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.420]  years ago when it first launched out of nowhere
[02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:06.740]  it is using nsa keyword software that's its base search function
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:09.540]  and it's to understand society it's to track us
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:17.780]  it's to go out and wage cyber war and that's why our headline google spies
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:21.300]  is so key to make that the number one search term so that people understand
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:24.180]  this and i'll have steve watson let's call him update the fact that they're
[02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:27.220]  now trying to charge people for it and this is not us
[02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:30.500]  if you want to support us by the dvds at info wars dot com
[02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:35.060]  you can get 10 of them for 39.95 that's about four bucks a piece
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:39.140]  you can get four of them for 1995 at info wars dot com or by calling toll
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:43.700]  free 8882533139 we're going into overdrive in the
[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:47.220]  next hour will be live it'll be on the network the stations all of it
[02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:49.860]  but right now we're talking to max kaiser then we're gonna start going to your
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:52.100]  phone calls i want to get in some other financial news
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:55.220]  but max has agreed to stay with us 30 minutes the next hour
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:36:00.020]  max this is insane i mean what's your breakdown of what we see happening
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:04.980]  well first of all i just want to point out that the max kaiser youtube channel
[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:09.220]  on youtube has a very paltry 10 000 subscribers
[02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:13.380]  the next time i come on your show alex if that number's not a 20 000
[02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:17.540]  i'm going to recite the entire obama deception
[02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:22.900]  in sanskrit for a captive audience uh and make them listen to me do it i mean
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:26.500]  this is this is pitiful i only have 10 000 subscribers it's got to be at least
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:29.540]  20 000 subscribers but anyway let's continue talking about the
[02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:33.540]  financial news well no going back to this obama situation
[02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:37.700]  i don't think people realize how big this is and that we're literally battling
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:41.540]  with youtube and google in real time how arrogant are they to take it down
[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:45.060]  then put it back up and i said i smell a rat i think they're going to counter
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:47.940]  strike and their way of doing it is to disable it all over the web
[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:51.940]  except for youtube and then you go there and they want money
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:56.420]  well i think what we're seeing also is an inter interplay between
[02:36:56.420 --> 02:36:59.780]  how computers are programmed to do different things
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:04.260]  and i think that certainly on wall street the computers are programmed
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:08.100]  it's called program trading and they can program computers to do all kinds of
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:12.500]  market manipulation and this is how most of wall street makes their money
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:15.460]  these days they simply program computers to steal
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:19.780]  and uh this is exactly what they do but computers are also programmed to
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:23.700]  the sniff out like you say that the obama deception is rising quickly
[02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:27.860]  on the trend list that in fact it was a trending higher than it had been
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:30.580]  recently well the computers see that and they make the
[02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:33.860]  calculations and they see that the words associated with obama
[02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:38.420]  and then a deception is untenable so then the computer simply kicked in and
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:42.500]  start to delete videos or change videos and they figure they can always
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:47.460]  mop up the legal mess later but the computers have dominion the computers
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:51.380]  run the show they will change the programming tomorrow or the next day
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:54.500]  and what we see today is that they're trying to catch up with what's going on
[02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:58.980]  in your situation you've basically broken the computers for today
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:02.900]  just like when you uh flood a website with too much traffic it goes crazy and
[02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:05.300]  they can't catch up but they will learn more next time
[02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:09.620]  we've got to learn more next time this is humans interfacing with machines
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:12.820]  to battle the artificial intelligence of the nsa
[02:38:12.820 --> 02:38:17.060]  well it's info wars and so what you're you are winning a battle here you're
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:21.380]  winning a battle in the info wars and i think that to build on the success
[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:24.900]  uh there's got to be more strategies and more tactics
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:28.980]  based on the fact that the current propaganda wars are
[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:33.220]  made entirely of information and as this report called top secret america
[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:36.900]  point out the industrial military industrial complex doesn't
[02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:40.660]  really care so much about the hardware anymore the planes the bombs
[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:44.580]  the tanks they're focused now all of their budget is focused on information
[02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:47.860]  technology and information wars and propaganda wars
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:50.980]  and so clearly uh moving into this new century
[02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:54.580]  if you look at your site i mean your site is aggregating huge
[02:38:54.580 --> 02:38:57.940]  popularity it's referenced not by the biggest sites i mean i see you
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:39:01.300]  reference on drug report all the time i even see you
[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:05.700]  i talked about on hoffington post which is you know perceptibly
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.820]  on the other side of the political aisle but you're
[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:12.020]  becoming a force to be reckoned with so the computers
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:17.780]  have have isolated you and are trying to combat you with algorithms
[02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:22.020]  and programs to try to over over over over
[02:39:22.020 --> 02:39:25.060]  over read you overwrite you with additional information
[02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:27.780]  and we see the same thing it's very interesting because we see the exact same
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:32.180]  thing on on the wall street the flash crash of may six the one thousand
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:34.980]  point drop that was a computer glitch you know the
[02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:38.340]  computers are programmed to steal money slowly
[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:41.300]  not in one thousand point grabs you know when i was working on wall street
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:44.100]  we had a saying that went like this we used to say
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:47.780]  shear don't slaughter and what that means is
[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:51.220]  you take a little bit from your clients every single day but don't kill your
[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:54.660]  clients because you want to keep them alive long enough to shear them
[02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:58.660]  the next day and this is exactly the way all right we're going to talk about that
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:02.180]  more in a moment max is going to be with us into the next hour but kenneth web
[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:05.220]  runs the director channel and people get confused he's not the director
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:08.580]  of the obama deception though he's directed his own great films like debunk
[02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:12.100]  this but he's a guy who has an account that
[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:15.860]  can upload more than 10 minute chunks so he uploaded the number one version of
[02:40:15.860 --> 02:40:19.700]  the obama deception back in march of last year it's had six point five million
[02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:22.740]  views it was surging and growing even faster it
[02:40:22.740 --> 02:40:25.940]  was somebody hacked in deleted it and he's i guess that on the road because
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:30.420]  the cell phone's cutting out kenneth uh...
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:34.260]  they are in there now inside making people pay
[02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:37.300]  to see the obama deception on all our computers
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:41.460]  in the office uh... this is outrageous you you haven't implemented that because
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:43.940]  i've i've i haven't talked to you yet but i know
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:47.700]  google has to offer that and we're not asking for it so so i mean this is
[02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:50.900]  amazing yeah it was it was actually and how's it going
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:53.940]  actually um i was just throwing and i've seen
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:58.580]  some people from the uk saying that they were unable to access the video
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:01.300]  so i went in to see what the problem was
[02:41:01.300 --> 02:41:06.180]  and um it it had some kind of rental thing on all it
[02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:09.700]  specifically all three of those videos that were taken down
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:15.140]  they were all for rent and you know it wasn't like that you know an hour ago
[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:18.900]  and then all of a sudden it's like that i don't know
[02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:22.500]  it's kind of crazy and i'm boggling because
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:26.740]  they you know when they reinstated those three videos
[02:41:26.740 --> 02:41:30.740]  they reinstated videos that have been down for years now
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:35.700]  the one they took down um the first few videos they took down that i actually
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:39.380]  put up were from military dot com and they you know
[02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:42.180]  they say you know copyright and printed they took it down and everything
[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:46.420]  and those were backed up so i had to get all the videos i was about and i called
[02:41:46.420 --> 02:41:50.020]  you this morning and i said i believe that's a false flag by putting videos
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:54.100]  up to get more strikes against your account and now they've thrown this
[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.660]  pay thing on it and and the thousands of sites and that's
[02:41:56.660 --> 02:42:00.340]  conservative that it's linked to around the web where people embed the video
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:04.500]  to obama deception police state for the rise of fema and your film debunk this
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:08.020]  which is about government sponsored terror and fluoride and other issues
[02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:13.060]  now they're trying to make you pay for those this is i guess you've got to turn
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:16.660]  google ads off i think that's how they're able to claim they can do this can you
[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:20.420]  turn that off oh yeah i could turn that off actually
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:22.900]  when i went in they had added the whole
[02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:27.220]  rentable button and it's old sluice stuff when they when they reinstated all
[02:42:27.220 --> 02:42:30.180]  these videos they put all this new stuff up
[02:42:30.180 --> 02:42:35.380]  i don't even know where that came from and you know i went through and i i found
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.300]  the the rentable part where it says rentable videos which is new
[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:43.300]  to me and i disabled them and then what it did
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:47.140]  it took all of those videos and it made them private
[02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:52.180]  so i had to go back in to the actual video and edit that and make them uh
[02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:56.580]  not private anymore for everybody and it's they're back up now
[02:42:56.580 --> 02:43:00.660]  kenneth kenneth this could be another hack too probably an insider change your
[02:43:00.660 --> 02:43:04.900]  passcode instantly i mean on delay let let change
[02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:07.940]  it now change it now don't you agree
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:12.580]  oh definitely definitely already done alex already done
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:15.860]  well don't lose that passcode my god this is getting insane
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:18.980]  stay there kenneth well uh max keiser's in the wings
[02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:22.180]  uh now we've got more intel from the man that runs the channel
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:26.340]  kenneth web this does sound like an automatic computer system
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:30.340]  or that somebody's using those systems uh to to keep this from being all over
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:33.540]  the web uh max keiser what's your take
[02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:38.100]  well here you're heading into the november election the obama team is
[02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:40.660]  nervous because their programs have been at
[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:44.020]  failure for the very reasons that you talk about in your film the obama
[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:48.260]  deception and so um it's a simple
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:52.900]  conversation with the webmasters at google uh try to do what you can to
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:56.580]  shape the information and to shape these words
[02:43:56.580 --> 02:44:01.140]  so that we can move beyond the idea that obama and the obama deception
[02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:04.500]  so the computers do all the heavy lifting and occasionally when there's a
[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:08.420]  traffic anomaly like you're talking about leading up to this
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:12.500]  the catastrophe um you know the computers show their hand
[02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:16.500]  as being basically running the show let me ask you this question uh max
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:19.460]  because i mean max invented the hollywood stock exchange system that
[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:23.460]  they admittedly use in many modern stock exchange computer systems now
[02:44:23.460 --> 02:44:28.580]  uh looking at this do you think obama and his people like the fact that when
[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:32.180]  you typed his name in in the last month the top link was this link to this
[02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:35.940]  particular version of the obama deception there's no way going into an
[02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:38.820]  election that that that they wanted when somebody
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:42.340]  searched the name obama in any variation it was my film
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:46.260]  i mean clearly they have shown their hand by doing this
[02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:49.940]  because the attention span of them the average american is so short
[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:56.020]  that even just the one second uh connection of obama with the word
[02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:59.860]  deception is a problem because people in their
[02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:03.860]  subconscious mind that equate obama with deception
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:07.940]  and if this is a huge result of searching obama and you get deception
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:11.460]  whether you even consciously admit it or not or recognize it when you go to the
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:15.540]  voting booth you equate obama with deception this is all part of the
[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:19.220]  propaganda that was invented by uh you know the
[02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:22.100]  national socialist of germany and then picked up by
[02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:26.260]  um the brand eyes in in this country when they started the public relations
[02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:30.740]  firms uh back after world war two and this is what's used and understood is
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:35.060]  that the it's the Freudian um psychology that unconsciously people
[02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:39.060]  but see i didn't name it that out of manipulation i just try to tell the
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:43.700]  truth and i know he's deceiving and i know that obama is a front and a
[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:47.620]  himself is a deception you know the whole persona of obama
[02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:52.740]  is a manufactured madison avenue system and so if you just organically tell the
[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:56.180]  truth it trumps all their lies and spin and
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:46:00.100]  manipulation let's go back to kenneth webb yeah and then come back to you
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:02.900]  keiser kenneth i mean what was it like for you
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:06.180]  to find out saturday that they had taken this video down
[02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:10.740]  oh it's horrible it was horrible i i got really got sick at the stomach
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:15.780]  um you know my my mom you know pretty pretty simple
[02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:19.540]  said that you know if if if this is happening that means you're actually
[02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:22.100]  you know that you guys are really doing something
[02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:27.060]  so there was uh a good side to it and i had to focus on that and then trying to
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:29.780]  you know get it back up and everything and um
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:34.340]  but i know i know we're stomping on some toes there's no doubt about it
[02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:38.100]  you know they've hacked my website by with this news.org
[02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:42.660]  we've had problems with these videos a couple of times we've had
[02:46:42.660 --> 02:46:47.380]  people actually hacked the youtube page for obama deception
[02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:50.740]  putting all kinds of coding and that was having an effect on the page that
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:54.420]  happens for like a day something about a month ago
[02:46:54.420 --> 02:47:00.340]  um it's just crazy it's crazy but like i said i believe that you know we're
[02:47:00.340 --> 02:47:03.700]  really having an effect elsewhere would they even mess around with anything
[02:47:03.700 --> 02:47:07.540]  like this i mean even if it's small time hackers or
[02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:12.820]  or big time hackers they're definitely feeling it yeah but small time hackers
[02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:15.540]  can't shut it down all over the web and make people pay for it
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:18.580]  only google and youtube can do it and i say they're the number one
[02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:22.900]  prime suspects uh in all of this but notice if we would have just laid down
[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:26.900]  to this they would have won but by fighting back
[02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:30.180]  now we have an even bigger victory and we show people these crooks
[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:34.740]  aren't invincible and so now it's an even bigger disaster for them
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:38.420]  and this is all i mean this is the biggest thing we've ever done
[02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:42.260]  our response to this our resistance to them the idea to promote the obama
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:45.700]  deception last week this has turned into the biggest event
[02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:50.260]  of anything i've ever done and it's only growing faster i'm telling you folks i
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:52.100]  feel like we've got lightning in a bottle here
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:55.140]  i think they've miscalculated i think they're going to go ahead and just take
[02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:57.300]  it down again i believe that they've done this because
[02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:00.500]  i've read their rules to start purging the thousands of other copies on
[02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:03.140]  youtube and other places claiming it's theirs
[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:06.180]  because when they uh i've written they enable this rental thing they don't
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:09.460]  allow other versions i believe they're about to start purging it
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:12.820]  so folks you better spread the word about the obama deception now can stay
[02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:15.300]  there kaiser your your take on this you're trying to say
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:18.580]  something well if everybody who has a blog
[02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:23.700]  embed in the header of their blog obama equals deception
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:27.700]  you know then you're fighting info wars you don't even have to link to the film
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.860]  or or you can just have that link in the heading of your blog
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:34.420]  so that with the search search engines will equate
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:39.460]  obama with deception remember obama won because if you did a search in 2008 for
[02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:42.820]  the word hope you would get results obama
[02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:46.500]  america obama and that's why he's the president of the state he essentially
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:50.660]  commandeered the word hope okay now you've equated
[02:48:50.660 --> 02:48:54.260]  obama with deception let's keep pushing that theme
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:59.380]  if you keep pushing that theme and you uh institute a major political overturn
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:02.740]  in the next six to seven months you will have accomplished a major battle in
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:05.540]  the info wars and i guess they're propagandist and
[02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:08.820]  they recognize this i mean max i'm just a regular guy who just
[02:49:08.820 --> 02:49:12.420]  swings with the truth and i guess it trumps them over and over again but
[02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:16.660]  the more i think about it it was the top link obama deception they don't
[02:49:16.660 --> 02:49:20.100]  like that this was this is this is important they wouldn't have censored
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:23.220]  this and revealed themselves unless they knew it was important
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:26.900]  but what is it washington post just released today in top secret america
[02:49:26.900 --> 02:49:30.980]  there's 800 000 people in a fourth branch of government
[02:49:30.980 --> 02:49:33.940]  in the united states who are fighting the info wars
[02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:38.100]  who have allegiances with the information technology firms in america
[02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:41.940]  including google and this is now out in the washington post this is
[02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:46.420]  this is now the war is on the battle lines have been drawn
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:51.380]  the the tyranny is here well i agree i agree we've seen massive increases
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:55.460]  73 000 blogs taken down last week no court order no nothing
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:58.340]  just department just ordered it saying they didn't like their speech because
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:01.140]  they were talking about sharing files and talking about
[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:04.580]  stuff online now your speech is illegal we're seeing
[02:50:04.580 --> 02:50:08.100]  other sites being hacked they've tried to take down the alex jones channel
[02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:12.020]  with hacks last week and and and dave who runs it hadn't even told me that when
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:14.740]  i called him saturday said yeah they're trying it here too
[02:50:14.740 --> 02:50:19.540]  so it looks like the green light was given in the last week or two max to
[02:50:19.540 --> 02:50:23.460]  launch a major cyber attack against us and everybody else for that matter
[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:26.580]  well the program the computer program and your
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:30.020]  film hit the traffic anomaly it started to go in the
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:33.300]  in the direction that the computers couldn't figure out why
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:36.980]  because it didn't fit into any of their templates uh logic
[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:40.740]  and so they shut down or dismantle their hacks or
[02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:43.620]  took it offline and this is what their program stay there stay there because
[02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:46.900]  that's what obama says i've got to shut the web down to save it they mean
[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:50.740]  their globalist web they always speak in you know triple meanings
[02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:55.540]  and so you you've got to know their fail safes built in to shut down things on
[02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:58.420]  the web when everything goes to hell in a handbasket this is a
[02:50:58.420 --> 02:51:03.460]  cyber security takeover kill switch test hounded by debt collectors with phone

[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:46.740]  um i think he got some threats but he wouldn't say that he just said look i
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:49.380]  can't i like what you're doing but it just he got too heavy
[02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:52.820]  he he was the first person i ever said that's who said look they're not
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:57.300]  influenced by the cia and then i say he said alex they are
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:02.660]  they are they are and he said check out this doctor's name that doctor's name
[02:55:02.660 --> 02:55:07.940]  when it was mit it was nsa you know these doctors of technology these gurus
[02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:11.300]  and they're literally taking over the whole planet with this and people say
[02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:15.300]  well why are you on google and youtube that's the war that's the internet we

[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:38.340]  it's a computer glitch um in other words um it's like you were at the uh
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:42.900]  playing 21 in las vegas and you started to win too many ants
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:46.980]  behind the sky picks it up and then you get a visit from the pit spot
[02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:51.380]  so there's no way you can beat the house now your video started to
[02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:56.340]  impinge on obama's game and their ability to control the propaganda wars and
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:55:59.220]  the intro wars so you're getting a visit from the equivalent
[02:55:59.220 --> 02:56:02.260]  the equivalent of the pit boss in the virtual world
[02:56:02.260 --> 02:56:06.420]  they need to remove you from the table because you're winning too many ants
[02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:10.500]  and and and this computer picks it up that's why i call the casino gulag
[02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:13.700]  because a lot of the technology used to keep people in line
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:17.460]  is the same as a casino they know how to incentivize you to keep you gambling
[02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:20.340]  but they know how to discipline you from winning too much
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:24.820]  and they also keep you unemployed and low wages so you're there in the gulag
[02:56:24.820 --> 02:56:29.540]  so you helix john we're winning too many views with this video and you got a
[02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:32.420]  visit from the virtual pit boss they had to shut you down because you're
[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:36.660]  winning too many ants it's a casino gulag and now we're pointing out that
[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:39.380]  the house is fixed so they're backing off
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:43.860]  because it's revealing who they really are well it's not necessarily
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:49.940]  fixed per se it's that human uh the human being is easily manipulated
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:54.180]  and they manipulate the the humans you see at the point of the
[02:56:54.180 --> 02:56:58.020]  starting a country like america to begin with was to try to
[02:56:58.020 --> 02:57:02.020]  tease out the greatest part of humanity to create something that's
[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:06.420]  better and bigger than the sum of this part but now you've got bankers in
[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:10.180]  control they're breaking it down so it's a less than the sum of its part
[02:57:10.180 --> 02:57:13.700]  and it's just a bunch of greedy people trying to win off of each other
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:18.340]  in a less than zero outcome and the bankers can set the rules so they game
[02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:22.420]  everything and they get the world out of fiat currency
[02:57:22.420 --> 02:57:26.100]  they just make up out of nothing as thomas jefferson said they were facing
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:29.620]  attention he said if you let private banks issue currency and credit uh your
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:33.620]  children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:37.140]  it doesn't have to be rigged it just has to be marginally
[02:57:37.140 --> 02:57:40.580]  uh successful because and get the majority of people
[02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:43.940]  to give up their self-respect and you end up with a casino gulag
[02:57:43.940 --> 02:57:47.540]  and you you've now had a direct interaction with the pit boss in the
[02:57:47.540 --> 02:57:50.580]  virtual world who's come over to you and said sorry you're winning too many hands
[02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:53.140]  you're getting too many views you're co-opping the word
[02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:57.780]  uh obama which needs to be associated only with the word hope we cannot
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:01.460]  tolerate the word obama to be associated with the word deception
[02:58:01.460 --> 02:58:05.620]  that's intolerable it cannot happen and we'll do whatever it takes we'll
[02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:09.220]  stick our computer algorithms on you they'll do all the dirty work
[02:58:09.220 --> 02:58:13.140]  and i'm sorry but that's just the way it is you have to leave the casino now

[03:00:07.940 --> 03:00:14.180]  all right we're live in the fourth hour it is the 19th day of july 2010
[03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:16.900]  i want to get into some of the financial news that max keiser and your phone
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:20.500]  calls and the balance of the time we have but we are in the middle of the
[03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:23.620]  greatest offensive in the info war we've ever launched
[03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:26.660]  and it's happening because people have seen the attempt to censor the film the
[03:00:26.660 --> 03:00:31.060]  obama deception and it's backfiring against the globalist and it's revealing
[03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:34.820]  how their system operates this on the same day it's admitted that google is
[03:00:34.820 --> 03:00:39.380]  basically an nsa master hub uh the washington post even admits this and
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:42.900]  so are 800 and let me give you the actual
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:48.420]  number here 800 plus thousand 854 thousand people
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:52.100]  in private industry have the highest level security clearances
[03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:55.700]  the corporations are making themselves the government so they can rob and steal
[03:00:55.700 --> 03:00:59.300]  from you uh kenneth webb who runs the director channel he's out of director
[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:02.740]  channel since youtube began so he's able to upload the films
[03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:07.460]  in one piece in high quality it's free and uh he was able to go into the
[03:01:07.460 --> 03:01:12.580]  interface and remove the paid link that was on there
[03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:16.740]  and they've taken it down for the last two days it went back up today
[03:01:16.740 --> 03:01:20.020]  we don't know what's going to happen with this he was hacked
[03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:23.700]  but i want to finish up with kenneth webb and go back to max keiser
[03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:27.700]  kenneth webb any other points you want to make here sir oh yeah definitely i
[03:01:27.700 --> 03:01:31.300]  wanted to thank all the info warriors out there because i believe that i don't
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:35.780]  know if they underestimated them or what but it was all over the net everything
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:39.860]  that they did and like i haven't heard back from youtube
[03:01:39.860 --> 03:01:44.100]  or they just reinstated all kinds of videos like i said earlier
[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:48.420]  but i really want to thank everybody and you guys for being right on that
[03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:51.540]  you know and and they felt that they felt the voice
[03:01:51.540 --> 03:01:55.140]  and we like you say we do have them on the run they thought that they could take
[03:01:55.140 --> 03:01:57.700]  it away and like we were going to go quietly in
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:01.380]  the night or something and and people that was a big outpour and a lot of
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:04.660]  videos a lot of blogs a lot of posts all over the
[03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:09.460]  internet and it had an effect it certainly did and i think
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:13.620]  everybody should rewatch the first 10 minutes of the obama deception i
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:17.220]  it's that information that scares them so much and tomorrow i'm going to play that
[03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:20.260]  first 10 minutes on air it's that first 10 minutes that
[03:02:20.260 --> 03:02:23.380]  crystallizes the left right paradigm and shows
[03:02:23.380 --> 03:02:27.220]  what's really happening and bush making jokes about dead kids in iraq
[03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:30.740]  and then we cut right to obama and say meet the new boss same as the old boss
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:33.780]  kenneth god bless you continue fighting in there
[03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:38.020]  and continue to watch your six my friend and now the fact is we came in saturday
[03:02:38.020 --> 03:02:41.300]  night we cut a video wrote an article to counter it erin and rob stayed up till
[03:02:41.300 --> 03:02:44.980]  seven eight in the morning to get it completed and we fought back
[03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:48.180]  immediately and we're going to continue to fight back this is a war when the
[03:02:48.180 --> 03:02:51.220]  globalists push back people go oh my gosh they're attacking us
[03:02:51.220 --> 03:02:54.660]  that means we're in a fight it means they're having to engage us it means
[03:02:54.660 --> 03:02:58.340]  we're having an effect we're in a war an info war with
[03:02:58.340 --> 03:03:01.460]  these illegitimate criminals we have the moral high ground that's why the
[03:03:01.460 --> 03:03:04.660]  government bombs buildings and then blames it on patriots and
[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:08.420]  liberty groups to make us be the bad guy they are the bad guys kenneth web god
[03:03:08.420 --> 03:03:10.740]  bless you all right bless you throughout take care
[03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:12.980]  max kaiser we're going to break and we'll come back with you and give you the
[03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:16.660]  floor and take calls but i wanted to bring that point up
[03:03:16.660 --> 03:03:19.700]  did you see the financial times of london with robert superior the
[03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:23.540]  top advisor to clinton advising obama that he needs to an oklahoma city or
[03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:26.900]  911 attack so the public quote sees him as strong
[03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:30.580]  and that's quote the only way he's going to win the midterm elections
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:34.500]  i mean these guys are one inch away from admitting stage terror
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:38.100]  sure sure but before just one quick note um
[03:03:38.100 --> 03:03:42.820]  you know just a couple weeks go out remember that on facebook after the bp
[03:03:42.820 --> 03:03:46.980]  oil disaster more than 800 000 people joined a boycott
[03:03:46.980 --> 03:03:50.580]  and then facebook decided to delete that boycott
[03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:54.180]  and that's exactly the kind of thing that we just saw in your case
[03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:57.700]  so this is enormous power given to these
[03:03:57.700 --> 03:04:02.020]  sites and they are destroying the ability for people to express themselves
[03:04:02.020 --> 03:04:05.860]  politically 800 000 people were going to join the bp boycott and facebook
[03:04:05.860 --> 03:04:08.420]  simply said well we just deleted it because it didn't think was in the
[03:04:08.420 --> 03:04:14.900]  interest of of our uh associate and meanwhile the founder of facebook
[03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:18.820]  calls his i can't quote its cuss words calls his users
[03:04:18.820 --> 03:04:22.660]  dumb efforts because they trust him and he sits around giggling calling them
[03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:26.420]  scum and filth well it's 500 million people now on
[03:04:26.420 --> 03:04:30.980]  facebook it's the basis for this casino gulag so in other words going forward
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:34.820]  the people who joined the bp boycott would be awarded debit
[03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:38.740]  that they can only work off by virtual slaves technically by working off the
[03:04:38.740 --> 03:04:42.260]  credits by viewing on ads and the people who didn't join the bp boycott
[03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:45.540]  would be awarded virtual credit
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:50.260]  meanwhile he's laughing at you he facebook's literally part of the nsa
[03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:54.100]  cia and he's just look at these scum i rule these stupid pathetic
[03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:57.540]  filth because they trust me stop trusting them
[03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:01.300]  max keiser stay there my friend we'll come back stay with us

[03:08:53.380 --> 03:08:57.460]  having all the major federal regulators their own internal email saying this is
[03:08:57.460 --> 03:09:01.460]  pure bleeping garbage but we're going to sell it to people ha ha ha
[03:09:01.460 --> 03:09:05.540]  while they were betting against it and the congress and the federal trade
[03:09:05.540 --> 03:09:11.620]  commission said no wrongdoing you've got to pay a 500 million dollar fine a
[03:09:11.620 --> 03:09:17.460]  fraction of the money they stole and now we see the financial reform act
[03:09:17.460 --> 03:09:22.180]  which gives the very same banks more power over the entire economy this is
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:26.580]  amazing give us your take on that well i'll talk about the financial reform
[03:09:26.580 --> 03:09:30.820]  act in a second but this is an interesting headline europe freezes
[03:09:30.820 --> 03:09:35.940]  out goldman sachs shocked by past deals with italy and greece
[03:09:35.940 --> 03:09:39.860]  governments are excluding goldman sachs from now from their
[03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:44.820]  sovereign bond sale so european banks especially in greece and italy where
[03:09:44.820 --> 03:09:48.660]  goldman cooked the books of these countries to allow them to enter the
[03:09:48.660 --> 03:09:51.700]  euro and then subsequently when they couldn't make the
[03:09:51.700 --> 03:09:54.260]  payment they attacked them with naked short sales
[03:09:54.260 --> 03:09:57.860]  and other forms of financial terrorism to profit on their demise and their
[03:09:57.860 --> 03:10:03.300]  misery and the people's austerity they're now kick goldman out exactly what i
[03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:07.460]  said in a video that's got over 400 000 views on youtube where i recommended
[03:10:07.460 --> 03:10:10.260]  that the greek government kick goldman sachs out of their country
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:14.020]  that's exactly what they did they kick goldman sachs greece has kicked goldman
[03:10:14.020 --> 03:10:17.540]  sachs out italy is kicking goldman sachs out so the europeans
[03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:21.460]  are not taking this financial terrorism anymore and they've drawn a line in
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:25.140]  the sand and they said no more financial terrorism no more goldman sachs
[03:10:25.140 --> 03:10:28.180]  you know do all your dirty dealings your crooked accounting
[03:10:28.180 --> 03:10:31.620]  your naked short selling your high frequency trading and you keep it there
[03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:34.740]  in the united states where you've got friends in washington you don't care
[03:10:34.740 --> 03:10:39.380]  how much misery and austerity you wreck upon the american economy now on the
[03:10:39.380 --> 03:10:42.820]  financial reform bill as you know i've been fighting again
[03:10:42.820 --> 03:10:46.820]  box office features contract and they have outlawed box office features
[03:10:46.820 --> 03:10:49.700]  contract because of the kaiser report show
[03:10:49.700 --> 03:10:55.860]  my parents is on your show the npaa and blanche lincoln uh we have defeated
[03:10:55.860 --> 03:10:59.940]  box office features trading so the one industry in america that's still made
[03:10:59.940 --> 03:11:03.860]  in america hollywood films is being saved from financial
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:07.540]  terrorists the cancer fifth gerald and the new cancer exchange
[03:11:07.540 --> 03:11:11.700]  and another company called trend exchange so we have made these
[03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:16.820]  uh box office features contract illegal uh this was a campaign that i've been
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:20.740]  doing for six months and i know all the players
[03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:25.780]  i was able to get into the um internal forces that were shaping this
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:31.380]  legislation and we struck a blow to the financial terrorist industry let me go
[03:11:31.380 --> 03:11:33.700]  back to the first point though and back you up
[03:11:33.700 --> 03:11:37.540]  remember those headlines with merkel saying criminal banks looting us by
[03:11:37.540 --> 03:11:40.340]  design and then she actually came out and she's a
[03:11:40.340 --> 03:11:44.580]  globalist but she said that they had to kick the big central banks out because
[03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:48.100]  they were destroying the country so i mean the globalists are even fighting
[03:11:48.100 --> 03:11:51.620]  with each other well that's predicted the millionaires
[03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:56.660]  are fighting with the billionaires uh you know because of this credit crash
[03:11:56.660 --> 03:12:00.180]  which is making everybody who is less than
[03:12:00.180 --> 03:12:03.700]  a hundred million dollars net worth fight for their lives
[03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:07.700]  because the wealth is being confiscated uh through
[03:12:07.700 --> 03:12:10.820]  draconian taxes through all kinds of new
[03:12:10.820 --> 03:12:16.020]  regulations and through capital controls and through all kinds of new
[03:12:16.020 --> 03:12:20.020]  predatory uh practices that are being given to the banks
[03:12:20.020 --> 03:12:23.540]  the financial reform bill actually gives the banks more ways
[03:12:23.540 --> 03:12:27.540]  to prey on folks they make them even bigger
[03:12:27.540 --> 03:12:31.300]  than they were before and it's just going in the opposite direction
[03:12:31.300 --> 03:12:35.300]  now as you point out the governments in europe they were shocked as says in this
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:39.060]  article the emergence of the past transaction between golden and greece
[03:12:39.060 --> 03:12:43.140]  and italy where products the bank helped to sell aided them in hiding the debt
[03:12:43.140 --> 03:12:47.140]  greece would use golden and the bond sales practically a war with the bank
[03:12:47.140 --> 03:12:50.740]  so here they say greece is at war with golden tax and they should be
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:54.740]  just because there's a war on terror and i don't condone terror and golden
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:58.980]  tax is a terrorist and they need to be shut down
[03:12:58.980 --> 03:13:02.500]  because they're not going to stop i mean as thomas jefferson said quoting him
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:06.500]  again the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you put up
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:10.340]  with of course if they've got the regulators and are able to rob everyone
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:14.260]  they're going to do it of course if private corporations can be given
[03:13:14.260 --> 03:13:18.100]  top level cia nsa clearances and be given government power
[03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:22.340]  they're going to grab it i mean it's amazing
[03:13:22.340 --> 03:13:26.500]  well the uh the question is why are americans condoning this
[03:13:26.500 --> 03:13:30.020]  financial terrorism and the european countries in europe by the way
[03:13:30.020 --> 03:13:34.180]  when this news was announced the euro traded up because people said
[03:13:34.180 --> 03:13:37.940]  they're doing something against terrorism the euro was was members a
[03:13:37.940 --> 03:13:41.380]  couple weeks ago they said the euro was going to go to parity with the dollar
[03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:44.980]  was crashing it was 120 now suddenly it's back to 130
[03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:48.020]  why because the government's getting rid of the financial terrorists they're
[03:13:48.020 --> 03:13:52.420]  kicking out golden tax europe is a buy again
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:56.580]  before you leave us i want to get into all this talk about the dollars demise
[03:13:56.580 --> 03:14:01.060]  the chinese taking away our triple a rating moody's taking away
[03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:04.980]  the rating of ireland where you see things going in the short and long term
[03:14:04.980 --> 03:14:09.540]  but right now let's go quickly to calls alan arizona you're on the air welcome
[03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:12.420]  hey how you doing alex thanks for taking a call
[03:14:12.420 --> 03:14:17.540]  wanted to point out two things one is the race for uh mccain there's a guy
[03:14:17.540 --> 03:14:21.700]  needing running by the name of jim deacon and he is the man that stands for
[03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:25.460]  what we believe in not hayworth less and not mccame
[03:14:25.460 --> 03:14:30.100]  also listen i agree hayworth isn't perfect but he's light years but he's not
[03:14:30.100 --> 03:14:35.060]  anti-gun and pro open border and he's anti napkin get i think jd hayworth
[03:14:35.060 --> 03:14:38.100]  that's why they ran him out of congress the fact that he was run out of
[03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:41.140]  congress the house shows he's better than mccain
[03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:45.060]  and i've looked at the race closely the other guy has got hardly any numbers i
[03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:48.820]  know he's great but wouldn't you it's neck and neck with mccain and hayworth
[03:14:48.820 --> 03:14:52.180]  wouldn't you rather vote for jd hayworth and and send mccain home
[03:14:52.180 --> 03:14:56.900]  like arland specter trust either one of them they've been in politics or career
[03:14:56.900 --> 03:15:02.100]  politicians and hayworth uh has a lot more dirt on him than people know
[03:15:02.100 --> 03:15:04.980]  the other thing i wanted to bring up is family court the guy that called in
[03:15:04.980 --> 03:15:09.300]  about family court i spent 10 years in las vegas trying to reform
[03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:12.980]  family court he needs to get into mediation and get out of family court
[03:15:12.980 --> 03:15:16.420]  that whole system is designed to steal your money and destroy
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:20.340]  well al do you know the history of family court and this is they do
[03:15:20.340 --> 03:15:24.100]  this segways into kaiser for those that don't know it was set up in england
[03:15:24.100 --> 03:15:28.020]  about 130 years ago in the u.s and about the last 95
[03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:32.580]  it started in a few eastern states it it's outside the constitution
[03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:36.020]  there's no due process they say because they're protecting the kids
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:40.420]  and so it's a judge it's not a jury and it's totally illegal
[03:15:40.420 --> 03:15:44.420]  and now it's come out that they have uh quotas on taking kids and it's all a
[03:15:44.420 --> 03:15:49.140]  big casino gulag like max talks about meant to destroy families and get as
[03:15:49.140 --> 03:15:51.460]  much money as possible i appreciate your call
[03:15:51.460 --> 03:15:55.300]  uh... your take on the family courts max geyser
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:59.140]  to play into the privatization of the prison system and companies like
[03:15:59.140 --> 03:16:02.260]  corrections core of america which is a publicly listed corporation on the
[03:16:02.260 --> 03:16:05.300]  new york stock exchange the more prisoners than they have the
[03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:08.260]  more profits they make not only do they own the prison but they own the
[03:16:08.260 --> 03:16:11.620]  restaurants and hotels near the prison when you go to visit your family in
[03:16:11.620 --> 03:16:14.820]  prison you stay at the hotel and you eat at the restaurant that is owned by the
[03:16:14.820 --> 03:16:17.460]  prison and it's a hugely profitable business
[03:16:17.460 --> 03:16:21.460]  and you put kids in prison and just move more money for the private prison
[03:16:21.460 --> 03:16:24.500]  operated and i noticed and i've noticed i've done an analysis
[03:16:24.500 --> 03:16:27.860]  of the big three prison companies they're all tied to big banks that
[03:16:27.860 --> 03:16:30.420]  bloomberg admits are laundering the drug money
[03:16:30.420 --> 03:16:34.340]  so the drug dealers own the prisons your kids are in
[03:16:34.340 --> 03:16:37.700]  well did you see that story about wacovia which is now owned by well
[03:16:37.700 --> 03:16:42.100]  spargo they were caught laundering 250 billion
[03:16:42.100 --> 03:16:47.140]  dollars for drug cartels in mexico they've been on the aircraft they've been
[03:16:47.140 --> 03:16:49.540]  on the aircraft yeah they don't deny it
[03:16:49.540 --> 03:16:52.740]  they were just given a slap on the wrist they paid a fine
[03:16:52.740 --> 03:16:56.820]  now it's amazing that back in 2008 when the
[03:16:56.820 --> 03:17:01.060]  credit crisis was added to nature and bank also was in front of congress
[03:17:01.060 --> 03:17:03.700]  begging for a 700 billion dollars to keep his
[03:17:03.700 --> 03:17:08.100]  buddies goldman sacks alive the the only cash available to roll over
[03:17:08.100 --> 03:17:12.020]  short term paper on wall street was available from the drug cartel
[03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:15.700]  and this is a documented fact they're the only organization in the world that
[03:17:15.700 --> 03:17:20.020]  had actual cash everyone else was rolling virtual
[03:17:20.020 --> 03:17:23.540]  treasury nonsense well that's the point i'm trying to make
[03:17:23.540 --> 03:17:27.940]  is that we're in deadly danger folks i mean when i say the government and the
[03:17:27.940 --> 03:17:31.940]  big mega corporations are completely ruthless and criminal and want to
[03:17:31.940 --> 03:17:35.460]  bankrupt you so they can have an emergency reorganization
[03:17:35.460 --> 03:17:38.820]  and secure their ill gotten gains i mean it i mean
[03:17:38.820 --> 03:17:42.660]  none of us whether you work for the fbi or a school teacher or nuclear
[03:17:42.660 --> 03:17:47.460]  physicist or a tv host like max keiser 99 percent of us are on the
[03:17:47.460 --> 03:17:51.140]  short end of the stick in this the new world they got so many petty people
[03:17:51.140 --> 03:17:54.100]  they give little badges and security clearances too and these
[03:17:54.100 --> 03:17:58.340]  little power trips folks you better choose sides now
[03:17:58.340 --> 03:18:02.500]  we better decide to get rid of these people or it's over i mean i'm not
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:08.980]  kidding around here max comments
[03:18:08.980 --> 03:18:13.540]  well i think the demarcation between safety and money
[03:18:13.540 --> 03:18:16.740]  you know in wall street we have what we call the fb money
[03:18:16.740 --> 03:18:20.900]  which is the amount of money you needed to basically say f u to the system
[03:18:20.900 --> 03:18:24.500]  and you know back in the 80s i think if you had 10 or 20 million dollars you
[03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:27.060]  could comfortably say f u to the system but
[03:18:27.060 --> 03:18:30.820]  today that number is up at the 100 to 200 million range and once you've got
[03:18:30.820 --> 03:18:34.820]  100 or 200 million to really seriously bribe the politicians you need to bribe
[03:18:34.820 --> 03:18:39.860]  to stay out of prison you are vulnerable i've heard a lot of really rich people
[03:18:39.860 --> 03:18:43.460]  talk about f u money people were two three million that
[03:18:43.460 --> 03:18:46.660]  three four years ago left and they said there will be no america
[03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:50.180]  and i guess that's the only positive thing is the top globalist and and then
[03:18:50.180 --> 03:18:54.580]  and then their wealth you know you're wealthy uh people who who who they're
[03:18:54.580 --> 03:18:57.380]  in the same family with but who disagree with each other there's a lot of
[03:18:57.380 --> 03:19:01.780]  fights going on within these families uh they realize they destroyed things so
[03:19:01.780 --> 03:19:05.300]  badly that was even the financial times last year that it may destroy their own
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:08.500]  system they've been so greedy it's gotten out of control

[03:22:19.220 --> 03:22:21.940]  from counterfeit has colluded with private business
[03:22:21.940 --> 03:22:26.340]  creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced
[03:22:26.340 --> 03:22:30.180]  this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable
[03:22:30.180 --> 03:22:33.540]  to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than
[03:22:33.540 --> 03:22:37.060]  90 cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to

[03:24:28.980 --> 03:24:34.260]  you my wife and i and uh yesterday i posted a comment on your message board
[03:24:34.260 --> 03:24:37.860]  under info wars dot com uh under the obama the sense
[03:24:37.860 --> 03:24:42.900]  deception censored and today when i checked my stats on my own uh
[03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:47.300]  uh site i noticed that the homeland security gave me a visit
[03:24:47.300 --> 03:24:51.060]  and the way i know that is that you have to register and actually enter the entry
[03:24:51.060 --> 03:24:55.460]  page and it records it and i got a screenshot right now up on that link
[03:24:55.460 --> 03:24:59.700]  uh that i posted uh my comment oh yeah we pay our tax money to be spot on by a
[03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:04.420]  bunch of private corporate crooks i mean kaiser how creepy is that
[03:25:04.420 --> 03:25:07.940]  well it gets back to something called the asymptotic curve
[03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:13.540]  the cost for data storage data processing and data transmission is
[03:25:13.540 --> 03:25:18.020]  constantly moving towards zero so it doesn't cost anything for the
[03:25:18.020 --> 03:25:21.380]  government or it costs of course a lot of money but the cost to them
[03:25:21.380 --> 03:25:25.940]  is getting cheaper every day so they just rake information so to get
[03:25:25.940 --> 03:25:29.700]  a visit to a website to your website to make a comment
[03:25:29.700 --> 03:25:33.380]  sure just put that into their master database another company on the top
[03:25:33.380 --> 03:25:38.100]  secret america list by the way is oracle oracle software they make all the
[03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:40.660]  databases that's where all the secrets are kept
[03:25:40.660 --> 03:25:44.420]  larry ellison the billionaire who's always winning the world cup with his
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:49.940]  fabulous yacht racing he's on the top secret america list along with google
[03:25:49.940 --> 03:25:53.540]  and these other information technology companies but the cost of all this stuff
[03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:57.140]  keeps getting cheaper and cheaper so while it's cheap for
[03:25:57.140 --> 03:26:00.580]  bloggers to blog because you have an international audience
[03:26:00.580 --> 03:26:04.180]  it's cheap for the government to spy but what's asymmetric and what's
[03:26:04.180 --> 03:26:07.940]  unacceptable is that the government simply gets rid of the competition gets
[03:26:07.940 --> 03:26:11.780]  rid of all the blogs gets rid of all the dissenting views and keeps all the
[03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:14.500]  economies of scale having cheap surveillance technology
[03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:18.180]  that's completely busted man we want to compete fairly we want to be free
[03:26:18.180 --> 03:26:20.500]  speech we want to have views and opinions
[03:26:20.500 --> 03:26:25.380]  expressed we don't want to have to do with to to blog for credit to go into a
[03:26:25.380 --> 03:26:29.060]  virtual slave plantation to get processed cheese for every 14 hours of
[03:26:29.060 --> 03:26:33.540]  clicking we do that's not tolerable we're not going to stand for that
[03:26:33.540 --> 03:26:38.740]  joe i appreciate your call good points bj in arizona you're on the year
[03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:44.420]  hi alex and max um alex something happened yesterday that was uh smaller
[03:26:44.420 --> 03:26:47.620]  than what you're going through but just as important
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:53.700]  dr rima labo i don't know if you recall her she was in conspiracy theories but
[03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:57.380]  no i've interviewed her many times she's the she's a doctor she's the wife of
[03:26:57.380 --> 03:27:01.620]  general stubblebine she was hacked and blocked from doing
[03:27:01.620 --> 03:27:07.060]  her sunday night radio show on blog talk radio no i know that that's what i'm
[03:27:07.060 --> 03:27:11.060]  saying there's massive censorship intensifying everywhere i appreciate
[03:27:11.060 --> 03:27:14.660]  your call max there's no doubt they are really testing
[03:27:14.660 --> 03:27:17.460]  their system now and they're openly saying they're going to start censoring
[03:27:17.460 --> 03:27:22.020]  us more i mean the government's admitting it that's chilling
[03:27:22.020 --> 03:27:26.660]  right i mean it's not uh you know an accident that my shows are on
[03:27:26.660 --> 03:27:34.340]  rt russia today press tv this is a iranian uh france 24 bbc
[03:27:34.340 --> 03:27:38.660]  and global tv network the reason i'm not on a u.s network
[03:27:38.660 --> 03:27:42.580]  is because the u.s considers my information to be too inflammatory
[03:27:42.580 --> 03:27:46.660]  so i'm on a network outside of the u.s
[03:27:46.660 --> 03:27:50.340]  now just their english we made a film and now there's their english a year before
[03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:53.540]  iceland collapsed it was called money geyser and we went to iceland and we
[03:27:53.540 --> 03:27:57.300]  said to the people there your economy and currency will collapse within a year
[03:27:57.300 --> 03:28:00.580]  exactly what happened nobody in the u.s a broadcast that film
[03:28:00.580 --> 03:28:04.100]  only out of their english a broadcast that film had people in the united states
[03:28:04.100 --> 03:28:07.060]  seen that film and we talk about the bear sterns and
[03:28:07.060 --> 03:28:10.020]  lenin brokers talking about collapsing the
[03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:13.060]  x-flat economy in reiki a vicki here before it happened
[03:28:13.060 --> 03:28:16.420]  then maybe somebody in the u.s would have started to question what was going on
[03:28:16.420 --> 03:28:20.180]  in their own economy and maybe the crash of 2008 wouldn't have happened the way
[03:28:20.180 --> 03:28:22.500]  it did but you see we weren't allowed to play that
[03:28:22.500 --> 03:28:25.780]  film in the u.s because it's considered to be against the interests of wall
[03:28:25.780 --> 03:28:28.260]  street banks but algezer english played that film
[03:28:28.260 --> 03:28:32.180]  so people all around the world in indian bangladesh and pakistan and europe
[03:28:32.180 --> 03:28:35.460]  and asia and middle east knew about the crash that was coming but nobody in
[03:28:35.460 --> 03:28:38.820]  america knew about it because these films wouldn't play in america
[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:41.860]  by the way algezeria does reach hundreds of millions of people it's better
[03:28:41.860 --> 03:28:45.700]  than most u.s networks but it's banned from the u.s
[03:28:45.700 --> 03:28:50.180]  it's banned from the u.s because they are dealing with the factual matters and
[03:28:50.180 --> 03:28:54.100]  they have real journalism on there which we expose the bankers
[03:28:54.100 --> 03:28:57.540]  and we show the public exactly how the games are played we had a film on there
[03:28:57.540 --> 03:29:01.780]  called rig the market which and i and i outlined 13 ways
[03:29:01.780 --> 03:29:06.500]  that banks rig the market and that was two years before the crash of 2008
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:09.940]  all right max we're out of time i look forward to having you back
