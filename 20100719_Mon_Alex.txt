[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.753]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:11.334]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:12.874]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:17.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:22.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:23.997]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:26.178]  It is Monday, July 19th, 2010.
[00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:30.939]  We're going to be live here, ladies and gentlemen, for the next three hours.
[00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:41.235]  Coming up, Max, Kaiser is joining us in the third hour to talk about the economy, the police state, the buildup for war with Iran, and a lot more.
[00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:54.722]  For people who are watching the PrisonPlanet.tv simulcast, not just listening to the radio, look at all the stacks neatly organized here that we are going to be covering today.
[00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:59.144]  We have all these different stacks of news and information.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.591]  We're going to be going over and that is the economy stack, the oil spill stack,
[00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:17.479]  The health stack, the climate, energy and environment stack, the police state New World Order stack, the U.S.
[00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.923]  politics stack, the war on terror military stack, the immigration border stack.
[00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:33.229]  Yeah, they've had a bunch of car bombings and mass murders in the last day down in Mexico and a lot of it right on the Texas border, Arizona border.
[00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.130]  We have the Iran.
[00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.614]  Israel-Middle East stack, the miscellaneous stack, and of course, this is my IM stack.
[00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:43.457]  This is the IMs I sent to the guys to print.
[00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:47.460]  Really what you could call our top news story stack.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.901]  And yes, it makes my head spin.
[00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.884]  I know it'll make your head spin.
[00:01:52.884 --> 00:02:01.932]  And of course, I'm also beside myself with anger, with rage that is on the verge of being uncontrollable.
[00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:10.276]  Dealing with the fact that we are being censored all over Google and YouTube.
[00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:21.063]  And if you go back three years, the term Alex Jones or InfoWars has dwarfed Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Keith Oberman, Glenn Beck in the Google Trends.
[00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:26.347]  So that is a occurrence happening because of you searching those terms.
[00:02:26.347 --> 00:02:27.168]  And since Friday,
[00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:41.342]  Listeners pointed out, Tim from Michigan pointed out, that why was Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson above the BP oil spill in top searches?
[00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:44.506]  And so I said, well, why don't we just Google the Obama deception and make it number one?
[00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:45.347]  It was number one.
[00:02:46.485 --> 00:02:55.109]  And see, the mainstream media, they artificially make Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson the number one search by hyping it and promoting it and pushing it and ramming it down your throat.
[00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.350]  They could set the agenda for real issues.
[00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.592]  Like, hey look, the Federal Reserve is about to get a total dictatorship over our economy.
[00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:06.874]  But they choose to basically obscure that real news.
[00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.975]  And we have now proven over the weekend that Google
[00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:27.837]  When the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Info Wars were all number one, number two, number three, number four, number five, number six, they all rotated in those slots, that Google sent messages to people that tried to search the term saying, you're not allowed to search that term because, you know, this is part of an automated response.
[00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:32.765]  And so now if you search those terms, they're unsearchable.
[00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:40.766]  Now I noticed this was happening Saturday, so Sunday I said, instead of searching Obama deception, search Obama deception censored.
[00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:44.047]  And it was number one yesterday, Obama deception censored.
[00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:50.149]  They've since blocked it out of the trends and blocked many people from searching it, period.
[00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.749]  People say, well why do trends matter?
[00:03:52.654 --> 00:03:54.496]  Well, this is an info war.
[00:03:54.496 --> 00:04:06.630]  This is an info war's revolt against the controlled corporate media force-feeding us Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson and other distractions.
[00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.331]  Tiger Woods.
[00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:17.855]  And when you have the number one search term, hundreds of blogs and newspapers, and that's what happened, then write articles about the Obama deception.
[00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:19.755]  They go in and look what the top trends are.
[00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:22.037]  They then write stories about it because they want traffic.
[00:04:22.037 --> 00:04:22.817]  And that's what happened.
[00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:24.998]  Huge success, bigger than I thought it would be.
[00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:32.242]  So successful, I have no doubt it was an insider at YouTube or their parent company Google, because they've censored us before, and I'm going to go over that coming up.
[00:04:33.228 --> 00:04:34.829]  Specifically with the Obama deception.
[00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.050]  We've been censored by Google.
[00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.977]  We have the letter from them saying you're not allowed on a Google shopping cart that we went and signed up for, remember six months ago, to talk bad about Obama.
[00:04:44.977 --> 00:04:46.979]  So we know it's them.
[00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.081]  Who else could hack that passcode?
[00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:54.205]  They've got the passcode to the director's channel that had it with 6.5 million and growing views.
[00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:56.807]  And they went in, it's clear, and erased it.
[00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:58.809]  But they've shown us who they are in the process.
[00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:03.995]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:10.398]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.398 --> 00:05:17.781]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:22.663]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:22.663 --> 00:05:24.784]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:31.314]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:35.043]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.343]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:42.343 --> 00:05:46.225]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:54.309]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.750]  Thank you.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.321]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:14.182]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:18.803]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:29.625]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:39.768]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:45.210]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:52.693]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:55.454]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:03.787]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:04.707]  Number one.
[00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:08.130]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.990]  Number two.
[00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.873]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:14.634]  It's true.
[00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:19.497]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:20.317]  Number three.
[00:07:20.317 --> 00:07:23.900]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.602]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:28.602]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.602 --> 00:07:31.363]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.363 --> 00:07:35.045]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.045 --> 00:07:35.845]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:39.987]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:45.029]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:49.210]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.991]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:55.593]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:55.913 --> 00:07:56.173]  877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:57.855]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:05.783]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:26.606]  Well, we're kicking off a new week of radio transmissions against tyranny.
[00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:29.671]  We're hitting pay dirt big time in the war against the globalists.
[00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:35.320]  We are cutting them up in a lot of places and they are bleeding bad.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.741]  And I look to open up even bigger wounds in the enemy.
[00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:52.845]  If you turn loose the power that is innate in every one of you and start taking action and start exposing these murderous, traitorous, larcenous, rat-like scum, these vipers, they will fall.
[00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:56.886]  You'll just simply take action against them.
[00:08:56.886 --> 00:08:58.486]  There was never a bully in the world
[00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:02.136]  That wasn't defeated by laying down.
[00:09:02.136 --> 00:09:04.076]  You gotta stand up against them.
[00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:08.137]  You're never gonna defeat these bullies by licking their boots.
[00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:15.119]  How many of you in life were a coward when you were young and you got beat up many times till the first time you got mad and beat the living daylights out of the bully?
[00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:22.601]  Didn't matter how many times you rolled over, you finally learned to stand up.
[00:09:22.601 --> 00:09:26.862]  And when you learned that you could stand up, you learned how easy those bullies get knocked into the dirt.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.724]  We've got to find that spirit of liberty inside each and every one of us.
[00:09:33.724 --> 00:09:36.527]  We've got to take action.
[00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:44.174]  We've got to get our fighting spirits back, because we are going into a controlled depression.
[00:09:44.174 --> 00:09:52.081]  I am so angry, so focused, so enraged, and also so cognizant of the fact that we can beat these people.
[00:09:56.141 --> 00:10:15.781]  That unknown country of true liberty and freedom is just a few hundred yards away across this chasm of apathy and weakness and societal malaise and weakness.
[00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.322]  And if we would all just come together,
[00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:30.250]  against corruption and recognize what evil is and start taking action against it, we could build a bridge to liberty, to freedom very, very quickly, but I can't do it alone.
[00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:44.495]  And it's frustrating because I see the awakening accelerating, but I also see the enemy becoming cognizant of that fact and pulling out all the stops to collapse this society into the arms of total dehumanization.
[00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:56.616]  You know what I'm gonna do?
[00:10:56.616 --> 00:10:59.598]  This happens a lot.
[00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:06.621]  More often than I would like it to.
[00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:14.425]  I get agitated and then I start having brainstorms of understanding.
[00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:18.527]  And it's kind of like over revving a race car engine.
[00:11:18.527 --> 00:11:21.529]  I don't want to spin out of control here today and just start ranting and raving.
[00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:31.870]  So I'm gonna try to settle down right now and being as calm as I can.
[00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.490]  And I'm gonna go over the news here.
[00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:43.713]  And then later in the hour, I'm gonna get into the censorship of the Obama deception.
[00:11:43.713 --> 00:11:52.015]  Because the censorship of this film has now led us into other avenues that illustrate other forms of censorship and control.
[00:11:54.065 --> 00:12:06.791]  And just how the internet has been designed to be a system to surveil us and to track us, and in the future, to censor everything we do.
[00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:18.316]  It is a giant NSA psychological warfare tool, but it's also a psychological testing tool to gauge and control the population.
[00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:20.557]  And as I learn more about how the internet works,
[00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:45.710]  And as I learn how the enemy has been trying to suppress what we've been doing in the last few years, and they've been failing, and as we begin to go mega viral on a daily basis, not just on a monthly basis, we're seeing the enemy pull out the stops to try to block us, and to know that on the level playing field of ideas, we would already have had victory.
[00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.413]  And to know how close we are to routing these criminals,
[00:12:51.323 --> 00:13:20.155]  If the public knew that our enemies are not all powerful, if the public knew how weak they are, if the public knew that it's only our apathy that allows them to run rampant on us, and if you knew what I knew, if you could understand what I understand, and I try to lay this information out, but those of you that are experts in a field, you understand how complex it is and hard it is to explain to a layperson who hasn't studied your field the subtle nuances of it.
[00:13:20.155 --> 00:13:20.875]  It's an art form.
[00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:43.302]  And my understanding of this system exponentially grows by the day, until I feel like the top of my head's about to blow off.
[00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:46.524]  We have caught Google red-handed
[00:13:47.691 --> 00:13:50.152]  Spying on the American people and the people of the world.
[00:13:50.152 --> 00:13:51.693]  They are the NSA.
[00:13:51.693 --> 00:13:53.574]  They are the CIA on record.
[00:13:53.574 --> 00:14:01.299]  We told you that six years ago with high-level CIA officers coming on the show who retired and exposing it.
[00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.861]  Like Mr. Steele.
[00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:06.742]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:14:06.742 --> 00:14:07.782]  They just throw it in your face.
[00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:10.003]  They think you're just going to accept it.
[00:14:10.003 --> 00:14:11.965]  The head of Facebook calls you a bunch of
[00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:15.382]  Effing suckers and idiots because you trust him.
[00:14:15.382 --> 00:14:18.482]  He publicly laughs at you and calls you dumb animals.
[00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:22.603]  I'm so sick of these arrogant filth.
[00:14:22.603 --> 00:14:40.667]  The only way they get away with this is our apathy and the fact that we're all jacked into the television sets and only care about issues of no significance because since we were small children, the controlled corporate media purposefully ruined many people's psyches and their roadmaps for understanding human civilization and history.
[00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:51.647]  I listen to grown men, how they're into being mindless idiots, and how they're into just making endless jokes, and laughing about everything.
[00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:55.408]  It's like Arrested Development at about a fifth grade level out there.
[00:14:55.408 --> 00:15:01.270]  I listen to other talk radio hosts, and they're just gibbering monkeys.
[00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.411]  They have no idea how dangerous history is.
[00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:06.471]  They have no idea.
[00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:12.294]  That in the siege of Leningrad, close to half a million people died.
[00:15:12.294 --> 00:15:15.095]  Just regular citizens of the city.
[00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:21.657]  And that more than 300,000 German soldiers died, and more than 300,000 Russian soldiers.
[00:15:21.657 --> 00:15:22.977]  In fact, I'm going from memory.
[00:15:22.977 --> 00:15:29.059]  Will you pull up estimates of death from the Battle of Leningrad?
[00:15:29.059 --> 00:15:29.319]  Was it 1943, 44?
[00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:35.977]  Enemy at the gates doesn't even scratch the surface.
[00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.437]  The cannibalism!
[00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:41.679]  That city living on human meat for a year.
[00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:45.100]  There wasn't a rat left in the city that humans hadn't tracked down.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:53.743]  They were eating the wallpaper off the walls because they'd used flour as the adhesive to put the wallpaper up.
[00:15:53.743 --> 00:15:55.143]  They were eating wood.
[00:15:55.143 --> 00:16:01.305]  They were roasting children on spits!
[00:16:01.305 --> 00:16:02.466]  This movie, The Road,
[00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:09.801]  People kept telling me to watch it and I don't like disturbing movies because reality is disturbing enough for me.
[00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:13.650]  Knowing about the cannibalism in Africa and the South Pacific still going on.
[00:16:15.262 --> 00:16:29.411]  Studying as much history as I have, knowing that within 10 days, and these are even government studies, Pentagon studies conducted in the 50s, within 10 days, 90 plus percent of individuals will rape, murder, kill for food.
[00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:37.297]  Within 15 days, almost everyone becomes a cannibal.
[00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:40.679]  I've got the university studies that during the depression,
[00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:52.615]  That during the Depression, 7 million people starved to death.
[00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:55.557]  Millions more during the Dust Bowl.
[00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:59.601]  And that's when 90% of the public were self-sufficient and could take care of themselves.
[00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.482]  7 million, bye-bye.
[00:17:00.482 --> 00:17:06.047]  If you looked at the photos of the Great Depression, families with their cars broke down trying to go out West.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.402]  Their children's ribs sticking out of their bodies.
[00:17:10.402 --> 00:17:13.924]  Their little ribcages looking like concentration camp victims.
[00:17:13.924 --> 00:17:23.649]  That was all engineered by the very same banking families that perch on top of this country right now, getting ready to do the same thing.
[00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:26.971]  I watched this movie about a week and a half ago.
[00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:29.452]  And I've been having nightmares about it every single day.
[00:17:29.452 --> 00:17:30.873]  And I'm gonna tell you something.
[00:17:30.873 --> 00:17:32.113]  I had a nightmare last night about this.
[00:17:32.113 --> 00:17:33.594]  And you know why I had a nightmare?
[00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.095]  Folks, nothing gives me nightmares.
[00:17:36.374 --> 00:17:37.134]  We're good to go.
[00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:09.707]  And other tribes of humans coming in and conking our ancestors on the head and dragging the men off to eat them and taking our women and children and raping the hell out of them.
[00:18:09.707 --> 00:18:11.828]  That's what evil people do.
[00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:19.493]  That's the norm, is people taking your child and running a metal rod through them and turning them on a spit to eat them.
[00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:22.916]  Every culture has engaged in cannibalism, even when there's plenty of food.
[00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:24.077]  It's an act of dominance.
[00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:30.521]  By psychopathic control freak groups that tend to take control of societies.
[00:18:30.521 --> 00:18:38.325]  But those societies can never become industrialized because only a loving good culture can build a true system.
[00:18:38.325 --> 00:18:42.767]  But then the parasites always come in and take over civilizations and then they implode.
[00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:43.987]  And that's what's happened to us.
[00:18:43.987 --> 00:18:44.708]  And you watch.
[00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.349]  This society's done.
[00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:47.549]  It's going down.
[00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:52.952]  We are a diseased, filthy, demonic country and world full of soft people
[00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:55.533]  It's a total realization.
[00:18:55.533 --> 00:19:05.098]  And let me tell you something, if we don't stand up and get ready and speak out, it's gonna get bad.
[00:19:05.098 --> 00:19:10.641]  But if we don't speak out and take action, it's going to get, in many cases, as bad as it is in this film.
[00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:13.322]  You know what happened in Rwanda?
[00:19:13.322 --> 00:19:17.564]  In that UN-funded slaughter there?
[00:19:17.564 --> 00:19:20.946]  You can search the term UN soldiers roast child on spit.
[00:19:20.946 --> 00:19:21.606]  You can look at that.
[00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:22.167]  That's official.
[00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.712]  You can look at children they beat to death everywhere the UN goes.
[00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:28.614]  Who do you think they have an army of child rapist pedophiles?
[00:19:28.614 --> 00:19:29.555]  That's who they are.
[00:19:29.555 --> 00:19:31.256]  They go and join to do that.
[00:19:31.256 --> 00:19:35.780]  Whether it's Serbia or African countries.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.862]  Watch a movie like The Road.
[00:19:37.862 --> 00:19:39.823]  They pulled up some World War II numbers.
[00:19:39.823 --> 00:19:40.964]  It said 450,000.
[00:19:40.964 --> 00:19:42.625]  I've watched a lot of documentaries and read books on it.
[00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:45.548]  The estimates are probably a lot higher than that.
[00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:46.989]  The point is cannibalism.
[00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:55.041]  Hell, that's one of the main meat products sold in North Korea.
[00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:56.867]  That's even been in Vanity Fair.
[00:19:56.867 --> 00:19:59.314]  They've had reporters there to watch the stalls selling human flesh.
[00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:03.651]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:20:03.651 --> 00:20:05.712]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:20:05.712 --> 00:20:08.473]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.694]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:20:10.694 --> 00:20:12.095]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:20:12.095 --> 00:20:13.996]  But first, the facts.
[00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:15.937]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:20:15.937 --> 00:20:17.918]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:21.600]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:29.365]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:20:29.365 --> 00:20:29.965]  Sinofresh.
[00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:33.307]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:49.976]  Mention GCN.

[00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:51.276]  It works!
[00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:08.044]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:08.044 --> 00:21:20.112]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:28.397]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:28.397 --> 00:21:32.059]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:49.107]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:49.107 --> 00:21:51.830]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:57.214]  I'm Big John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:01.374 --> 00:22:04.736]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[00:22:29.728 --> 00:22:30.969]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:30.969 --> 00:22:35.532]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.532 --> 00:22:41.336]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.336 --> 00:22:44.998]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:44.998 --> 00:22:49.862]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.862 --> 00:22:52.763]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:24:12.552 --> 00:24:21.256]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[00:24:21.256 --> 00:24:28.839]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:32.601]  So, Cyrus Jones, live forever.
[00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.002]  Grave digger!
[00:24:34.002 --> 00:24:35.502]  Grave digger.
[00:24:35.502 --> 00:24:36.623]  When you dig my grave.
[00:24:36.623 --> 00:24:38.204]  When you dig my grave.
[00:24:38.204 --> 00:24:39.464]  Make it shallow.
[00:24:39.464 --> 00:24:40.905]  Would you make it shallow?
[00:24:49.691 --> 00:24:50.892]  We are back live.
[00:24:50.892 --> 00:24:52.953]  We have some incredible news.
[00:24:52.953 --> 00:24:54.374]  I just learned this during the break.
[00:24:54.374 --> 00:25:01.038]  The Obama deception, as many of you know, was hacked.
[00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:04.500]  The main version with 6.5 million plus views.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.702]  It was the number one search term Friday and Saturday.
[00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:15.015]  The passcode for the director channel, we don't have a director channel, but Kenneth Webb does.
[00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:17.917]  It's changed the channel as the handle.
[00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:24.543]  It was hacked, and someone went in and erased the Obama deception, and it said remove by user.
[00:25:24.543 --> 00:25:27.965]  When that happens, you cannot put the video back up.
[00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:35.211]  If you remove a video, it's gone, and to my knowledge, because we did research on this, Google, the parent company of YouTube, has never
[00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:48.027]  Never re-enabled a video that was hacked and removed, because they've had this happen in the past to some large videos.
[00:25:48.027 --> 00:26:03.236]  It was put back up minutes ago, so I think Google, the parent company of YouTube, felt the power of our counter-info war, where over the weekend and yesterday I said, searched the term Obama deception censored,
[00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:12.923]  And that became the number one search, the number two search, Follow the Republic, the number three search, Infowars.com.
[00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:19.745]  When we got a screenshot last night, Obama deception censored was number one, Follow the Republic number two, Infowars number six.
[00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:22.405]  By the time I went to bed, Infowars was number three.
[00:26:22.405 --> 00:26:23.926]  So we have the top three searches.
[00:26:25.353 --> 00:26:27.837]  And we also have the screenshots here.
[00:26:27.837 --> 00:26:38.655]  Jaren, if he gets a chance, can pull up those images for you of messages people got from Google when people did the search for the Obama deception saying, you're not allowed to look at this.
[00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:42.635]  They were blocking that search.
[00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:47.216]  It looks like they've removed that block as well, because they're not stupid.
[00:26:47.216 --> 00:27:03.279]  I was intending today to go on a full frontal assault and give you new search terms, because we can give out new search terms on air that we can make number one, because of our millions of listeners taking action, that they'll have to continue to block out of their list.
[00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:09.660]  Because when they blocked out the Obama deception, the Obama deception censored Infowars.com, when they block that out,
[00:27:13.117 --> 00:27:14.558]  They blocked it out of the complete list.
[00:27:14.558 --> 00:27:17.040]  It was nowhere in the top thousand list.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.624]  They just completely removed it.
[00:27:24.624 --> 00:27:29.628]  And I've got Steve Watson doing a story about that right now.
[00:27:29.628 --> 00:27:31.469]  In fact, it just went live.
[00:27:31.469 --> 00:27:34.751]  The headline is, Google spies, censors, users.
[00:27:36.744 --> 00:27:39.045]  And Google has been caught spying.
[00:27:39.045 --> 00:27:41.806]  Google has been caught working with the NSA.
[00:27:41.806 --> 00:27:55.050]  Google, of course, six months ago, we have a link to their email they sent us, said you're not allowed to sell the Obama deception on a Google shopping cart that we had gone and purchased and signed up for through their sales system.
[00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.751]  I mean, they told us you're not allowed to show Obama in a bad light.
[00:27:58.751 --> 00:28:00.071]  This is not allowed.
[00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:01.792]  This video is not allowed.
[00:28:01.792 --> 00:28:05.113]  Now, people pointed out, well, wait, there's other shopping carts that are allowed to sell it on there.
[00:28:05.113 --> 00:28:06.193]  Yes, it was our official
[00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:08.484]  Chopping cart.
[00:28:08.484 --> 00:28:11.946]  We were told specifically, no Obama deception.
[00:28:11.946 --> 00:28:13.686]  So we know they've done this before.
[00:28:13.686 --> 00:28:17.368]  And so what you do is, now you make this the number one search term.
[00:28:17.368 --> 00:28:19.529]  Google spies.
[00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:22.410]  They've already blocked Google sensors.
[00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.251]  So now you search Google spies.
[00:28:25.251 --> 00:28:26.531]  Google spies.
[00:28:26.531 --> 00:28:27.392]  Two words.
[00:28:27.392 --> 00:28:32.434]  You go to Google and Yahoo and other search engines and you type in Google spies.
[00:28:33.823 --> 00:28:46.698]  G-O-O-G-L-E-S-P-I-E-S, two words, Google Spies, and it will then take everybody to the number one link by Steve Watson, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:47.898 --> 00:28:58.843]  And we're going to add to this story, not just my video that I shot Saturday night that was posted Sunday, censorship alert, Obama deception illegally removed.
[00:28:58.843 --> 00:29:03.706]  We are now going to add the Obama deception that has risen like a phoenix from the ashes.
[00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:04.706]  Praise God.
[00:29:04.706 --> 00:29:07.587]  And praise God that all of you took action.
[00:29:07.587 --> 00:29:08.928]  Because this is precedent setting.
[00:29:08.928 --> 00:29:10.689]  We have never seen, we did research.
[00:29:11.988 --> 00:29:20.292]  There was one case where a video with over 200 million views, a music video that was number one, was hacked and replaced with something else.
[00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:22.493]  And because they were Google partners, they did take that down.
[00:29:22.493 --> 00:29:23.734]  We've seen one other case.
[00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:33.338]  This is precedent setting, and we appreciate the NSA and Google backing off here and posting, reposting it.
[00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.459]  And I called for a criminal investigation yesterday.
[00:29:35.459 --> 00:29:38.781]  I said, YouTube, you track the IP address of who went in there and did this.
[00:29:44.073 --> 00:29:45.074]  Why is this so important?
[00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:46.775]  I'll explain why it's so important on the other side.
[00:29:46.775 --> 00:29:47.976]  This is so important.
[00:29:47.976 --> 00:29:49.658]  And I'll get into all the news and take your phone calls.
[00:29:49.658 --> 00:29:50.539]  Max Keiser's coming up.
[00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:51.940]  We're on the march.

[00:30:59.813 --> 00:31:04.776]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:31:04.776 --> 00:31:05.777]  What have we got?
[00:31:05.777 --> 00:31:08.218]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:31:08.218 --> 00:31:09.239]  A republic.
[00:31:09.239 --> 00:31:11.881]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:14.142]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:31:14.142 --> 00:31:16.163]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:31:16.163 --> 00:31:17.844]  So they think they own our land?
[00:31:17.844 --> 00:31:19.165]  They think they own our water?
[00:31:19.165 --> 00:31:19.785]  Children?
[00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:20.906]  Our education?
[00:31:20.906 --> 00:31:21.727]  Our money?
[00:31:21.727 --> 00:31:25.389]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:31:25.749 --> 00:31:30.715]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:31:30.715 --> 00:31:31.736]  We have the facts.
[00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:32.897]  We have the Constitution.
[00:31:32.897 --> 00:31:33.819]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:33.819 --> 00:31:34.700]  We have common law.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.223]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:37.223 --> 00:31:41.007]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[00:33:03.045 --> 00:33:05.006]  We won't be left behind.
[00:33:05.006 --> 00:33:11.770]  Our memories live on in Port-au-Prince.
[00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:12.531]  And for it's real,
[00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:25.671]  All right, I want to hear from you specifically on 73,000 blogs were taken down by the federal government outside of a court, outside of indictments.
[00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:26.632]  They just took them down.
[00:33:26.632 --> 00:33:29.555]  That's mainstream news under Justice Department orders.
[00:33:30.484 --> 00:33:44.895]  I want to get your point, your take on all these mainstream news articles about how the government needs to censor the web to protect it, and this hoax that critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants and the Defense Department are hooked into the Internet.
[00:33:44.895 --> 00:33:46.076]  They are not hooked into the Internet.
[00:33:46.076 --> 00:33:47.477]  They have their own separate systems.
[00:33:47.477 --> 00:33:48.698]  That's on record.
[00:33:48.698 --> 00:33:49.359]  It's a lie.
[00:33:52.381 --> 00:33:57.904]  Some of the highway signs are hooked into a federal internet system, and those have been hacked.
[00:33:57.904 --> 00:34:03.027]  The main joke in the last three years is somebody hacks in and says, zombies ahead, be careful.
[00:34:03.027 --> 00:34:04.068]  That's been in the news.
[00:34:04.068 --> 00:34:05.088]  That happens every few weeks.
[00:34:05.088 --> 00:34:12.893]  I see another article about a highway sign system being hacked because they are hooked into the internet, because they use the internet to control them.
[00:34:12.893 --> 00:34:17.615]  And so there is some infrastructure hooked in, and it shouldn't be hooked in.
[00:34:17.615 --> 00:34:18.536]  This is asinine.
[00:34:19.636 --> 00:34:25.963]  But they're going to use that excuse, and the government's going to attack the web themselves, and they admit cybersecurity is to be offensive.
[00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:29.586]  I want your take on the type of censorship we're seeing on the web.
[00:34:29.586 --> 00:34:36.654]  You see, win the name Alex Jones, or InfoWars, or the Obama deception, and they've been number one in trends without us having listeners do it before.
[00:34:37.054 --> 00:34:39.495]  Go look at Google Trends going back three, four years.
[00:34:39.495 --> 00:34:42.417]  We're way ahead of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, all of them.
[00:34:42.417 --> 00:34:43.498]  We showed that yesterday.
[00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:46.980]  We showed those trends on air for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.321]  Go look at it for yourself.
[00:34:48.321 --> 00:34:50.302]  Do you think the system likes that?
[00:34:50.302 --> 00:34:51.142]  No!
[00:34:51.142 --> 00:34:56.365]  They thought they could use the web to surveil you, to control you, to gauge what you're doing, what you're really thinking.
[00:34:56.365 --> 00:34:57.926]  It's a total NSA system.
[00:34:57.926 --> 00:35:00.828]  They weren't getting enough data just listening to your phones and reading your faxes.
[00:35:01.388 --> 00:35:07.172]  They need to track what you're doing and what you're saying and what you're thinking to truly understand how to counter free humanity.
[00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:11.455]  They admit they're using it for their psychological warfare studies against us.
[00:35:11.455 --> 00:35:18.600]  But now we've taken it away from them, not just Alex Jones, but all of you out there, all of the patriots.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:30.768]  The globalists have tried to turn the Internet into an infighting area where they admittedly send feds out to then get weak minded people to parrot what they say to attack all the real patriot leaders like myself and Ron Paul and others.
[00:35:31.974 --> 00:35:46.349]  But it's not working because people are discovering that and understanding what's happening and understanding that we're all in this together to defend the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, private property, to stop the banking takeovers, to stop the new wars.
[00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:54.398]  We can all agree on those issues and the globalists are in the middle of their takeover right now and they don't want us to be out there countering them.
[00:35:56.411 --> 00:36:05.496]  Now I'm gonna explain this in layman terms because I've gotten so many emails and phone calls and comments on the websites and on YouTube and on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:13.941]  I've seen just countless comments Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and today saying, Alex, why don't you just re-upload the Obama deception if it was taken down off YouTube?
[00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:20.665]  Alex, why are you so upset about them taking it down, someone hacking in and taking it down?
[00:36:20.665 --> 00:36:25.348]  Because for the last month, for the last year and a half, when you type in Obama or President Obama,
[00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:30.279]  The number one, well the last year and a half it's been in the top three.
[00:36:30.279 --> 00:36:33.183]  Never number one, it was usually number three or four, sometimes number two.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:41.093]  In the last month, if you type in President Obama, Barack Obama, Obama, the number one link was a link to that 6.5 million viewed one.
[00:36:42.614 --> 00:36:52.000]  And instead of it slowly growing to 6.5 million in the last year and a half, it was suddenly getting close to 100,000 a day on Saturday when they knocked it down.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.880]  They knew the trend.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:37:00.025]  It was about to get 6 million views in the next month, not 6 million in a year and a half.
[00:37:00.025 --> 00:37:01.626]  In fact, I haven't tested that yet.
[00:37:01.626 --> 00:37:02.706]  Let me just test it right now.
[00:37:02.706 --> 00:37:09.170]  Let me put Obama Deception in and see if it's the number one link again.
[00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.592]  The number one link is Obama Deception censored.
[00:37:13.176 --> 00:37:15.919]  73 related articles.
[00:37:15.919 --> 00:37:20.165]  So there's 73 articles right now about the Obama deception being censored out there.
[00:37:20.165 --> 00:37:25.491]  A lot of them are major news sites reporting on it.
[00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:31.079]  See, previously, before this happened, the number one link was the Obama deception.
[00:37:32.695 --> 00:37:36.578]  And it is no longer the number one link, so I guess their mission was accomplished.
[00:37:36.578 --> 00:37:46.586]  We've got to go back into all these articles we wrote pointing out have been taken down and post it at the top, so that people understand when they go to read that, that it's now back up.
[00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:52.831]  It is now the 1, 2, 3, 4... It is now the fifth link.
[00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:59.076]  Now since they made it go live again, the link with 6.5 million, but that's only under Obama deception.
[00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.757]  It was when you search the term Obama.
[00:38:00.757 --> 00:38:01.338]  Let me do that.
[00:38:02.506 --> 00:38:07.988]  Search the term Obama, and it is no longer the number one link with just the name Obama.
[00:38:07.988 --> 00:38:08.408]  It's 1, 2, 3, 4.
[00:38:08.408 --> 00:38:09.749]  It's the fourth link.
[00:38:09.749 --> 00:38:14.291]  In fact, will you give me a document cam shot on the big TV that I use to surf on?
[00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.072]  I want people to see what I'm seeing right now.
[00:38:16.072 --> 00:38:18.993]  They're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, because this is InfoWar.
[00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:28.877]  This is the power of patriots and people that know the truth to say no to government-run healthcare, no to new wars, no to internet censorship, no to tyranny.
[00:38:28.877 --> 00:38:37.784]  It shows that when you put the name Obama in, the number one thing in the last month you got was my film!
[00:38:37.784 --> 00:38:45.790]  People doing school reports, government people, anybody worldwide typing in President Obama, Barack Obama, or Obama, the number one link.
[00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.013]  And when they knocked that out Saturday, when they brought that video down,
[00:38:49.741 --> 00:38:50.702]  And they've now restored it.
[00:38:50.702 --> 00:38:53.203]  This is the second time I've ever heard of this happening.
[00:38:53.203 --> 00:38:56.065]  This is, praise God.
[00:38:56.065 --> 00:38:59.008]  You know Google is getting a major backlash over this.
[00:38:59.008 --> 00:39:04.231]  It is the fifth link down.
[00:39:04.231 --> 00:39:07.874]  See, before it wasn't the official website of Barack Obama, as it is now.
[00:39:09.358 --> 00:39:10.379]  It was my film.
[00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:14.002]  You think the White House likes that when they admit they ran a quote?
[00:39:14.002 --> 00:39:17.986]  Remember, candidate Obama runs a YouTube campaign, CNN headline.
[00:39:17.986 --> 00:39:23.550]  Remember all the news about the Obama girl getting millions of views and that's why he won was YouTube.
[00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.834]  YouTube is over half the video views in the world.
[00:39:27.834 --> 00:39:30.436]  Hundreds of millions of people a day go to it.
[00:39:30.436 --> 00:39:31.838]  Do you think that
[00:39:32.864 --> 00:39:40.210]  That they want you to go to YouTube or Google or Yahoo and type in the name Obama or President Obama and get my video's number one link.
[00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.671]  By killing that video, they knocked it down.
[00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:43.672]  But let's drive it up.
[00:39:43.672 --> 00:40:02.026]  Everybody's got to type Obama into a search engine, scroll down to the fifth link that is the Obama Deception high-quality full-length version, that's the name, and click on it over and over again to drive it to number one and to get its space at the top and to put it above the official Barack Obama website.
[00:40:04.517 --> 00:40:05.678]  That man is a hoax.
[00:40:05.678 --> 00:40:07.378]  His approval rating is in free fall.
[00:40:07.378 --> 00:40:10.600]  And this film exposes how he's run by the offshore banks.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.181]  It exposes how Bush was controlled by the same people.
[00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:16.842]  Liberals see this and wake up and it shatters their paradigm.
[00:40:16.842 --> 00:40:20.684]  Right-wingers see it and it shatters their paradigm and opens up their mind to the wider world.
[00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:29.631]  You know how many people commented and have sent me emails and have commented on my website and online saying the Obama deception woke me up?
[00:40:29.631 --> 00:40:37.453]  This is a film that is the number one thing we've ever done, the most devastating to the globalists, and that's why they're so scared of it.
[00:40:37.453 --> 00:40:41.154]  And this is a fast response by YouTube and Google to re-enable it.
[00:40:41.154 --> 00:40:48.796]  In fact, I've got the number to Kenneth Webb in here that runs that director channel.
[00:40:48.796 --> 00:40:50.617]  We need to call him and see
[00:40:52.182 --> 00:40:52.982]  Here it is, guys.
[00:40:52.982 --> 00:40:54.383]  His name's right here.
[00:40:54.383 --> 00:40:55.363]  We need to call him.
[00:40:55.363 --> 00:40:57.224]  It's the top paper here.
[00:40:57.224 --> 00:41:00.986]  We need to call him and see what message YouTube gave him.
[00:41:00.986 --> 00:41:06.948]  Thank you, sir.
[00:41:06.948 --> 00:41:14.511]  But again, everybody needs to type in Obama on the search engine and go down to that link to the video to click it.
[00:41:14.511 --> 00:41:15.952]  That will drive it back to the top.
[00:41:20.336 --> 00:41:21.897]  Here's the comments on the video.
[00:41:21.897 --> 00:41:23.438]  The resistance is alive.
[00:41:23.438 --> 00:41:26.080]  Do you see what we are capable of as a whole?
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.681]  Well, we're capable of a lot more than that.
[00:41:28.681 --> 00:41:29.802]  Resist oppression.
[00:41:29.802 --> 00:41:31.183]  Resist eugenics.
[00:41:31.183 --> 00:41:32.824]  Resist economic takeover.
[00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:33.885]  Promote freedom.
[00:41:33.885 --> 00:41:35.886]  Know what you're putting in your body.
[00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:37.267]  Grow up.
[00:41:37.267 --> 00:41:38.588]  Grow your own organic food.
[00:41:38.588 --> 00:41:39.389]  Get ready.
[00:41:39.389 --> 00:41:42.070]  This will be a long fight, but truth and light will prevail.
[00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.891]  God bless you all.
[00:41:47.228 --> 00:41:51.969]  And so that's what John CL1 said.
[00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:53.250]  And so it is back up.
[00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:57.791]  Let's send it to 7 million by tomorrow.
[00:41:57.791 --> 00:42:02.792]  Let's give it 500,000 more views, not just 100,000 by tomorrow.
[00:42:02.792 --> 00:42:04.593]  Go get the video.
[00:42:04.593 --> 00:42:06.213]  The Obama deception in high quality.
[00:42:09.103 --> 00:42:12.665]  It has 6,509,624 views.
[00:42:12.665 --> 00:42:17.107]  Before that gets taken down again, God forbid, and get it out to your email list.
[00:42:17.107 --> 00:42:17.707]  Send it out.
[00:42:17.707 --> 00:42:19.268]  Post it on message boards.
[00:42:19.268 --> 00:42:23.130]  Go everywhere and say this is a censored video they don't want you to see.
[00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:26.872]  See, they took this down and it backfired.
[00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:29.694]  And some idiots, I've even seen mainstream news articles out there,
[00:42:31.218 --> 00:42:36.201]  Associated Content had a three-page article this morning trying to imply that I would do this.
[00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:38.322]  This isn't my stinking account.
[00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:45.126]  This is Kenneth Webb, who lives out in the country and can't even re-upload it because his internet's so slow he's got dial-up.
[00:42:45.126 --> 00:42:46.826]  It was already the number one search.
[00:42:46.826 --> 00:42:48.507]  It was everywhere.
[00:42:48.507 --> 00:42:50.709]  It was the number one search, the number one video.
[00:42:50.709 --> 00:42:55.071]  Why would I do that when you can't put it back up as a user?
[00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:57.552]  Only YouTube could put it back up.
[00:42:57.552 --> 00:42:59.013]  What is your major problem?
[00:42:59.013 --> 00:43:00.454]  We were already number one!
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.040]  There's censorship going on.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.881]  Put that up on screen.
[00:43:06.881 --> 00:43:09.982]  73,000 blogs taken down Thursday.
[00:43:09.982 --> 00:43:12.602]  73,000 blogs pulled by the federal government.
[00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:15.983]  And they've got judges and lawyers on record saying there's no law to do this.
[00:43:15.983 --> 00:43:19.004]  The Justice Department just did it.
[00:43:19.004 --> 00:43:20.164]  73,000 blogs gone.
[00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.065]  They are testing to see what we're going to do.
[00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:33.847]  You think the establishment wants people to see what's in the Obama deception when it lays it all out and shows Obama at the Bilderberg Group meeting?
[00:43:33.847 --> 00:43:35.108]  With Hillary?
[00:43:35.108 --> 00:43:37.430]  A day before they made the announcement that she was dropping out?
[00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:44.956]  You think people, people that run this new world order want the population?
[00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:46.056]  There it is.
[00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:46.317]  U.S.
[00:43:46.317 --> 00:43:54.123]  authorities shut down blog site hosting 73,000 blogs because they talked about file sharing on the site.
[00:43:56.906 --> 00:43:58.367]  Because they talked about it!
[00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:02.870]  That's in the order!
[00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:12.437]  The system is scared right now and they talk in the Ministry of Defense report from 2007 about flash mobs on the ground, flash mobs in the web.
[00:44:12.437 --> 00:44:17.020]  Now they've got to take over the web to block the population from being able to take action.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.881]  Now you need to search the term.
[00:44:18.881 --> 00:44:23.704]  They've blocked out the Obama deception and the Obama deception censored.
[00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:26.468]  That's where that can't go into the top trends.
[00:44:26.468 --> 00:44:33.314]  So we've got to come up with other search terms that will lead people to the Obama deception.
[00:44:33.314 --> 00:44:40.900]  My idea this morning was to have Steve Watson write an article with the title, Google Spies, Censors Users.
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:47.264]  You just search the term Google Spies, Google Spies, Google Spies.
[00:44:47.264 --> 00:44:56.851]  Those two words, Google Spies, and it will lead them to an article where Google admittedly spies and censors users and censored us with our shopping cart, selling the Obama deception.
[00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:58.572]  They're caught red-handed.
[00:44:58.572 --> 00:44:59.933]  And then when they click on that article,
[00:45:02.779 --> 00:45:05.441]  I'm gonna have Steve Watson right now, it's an emergency, call him.
[00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:11.264]  He needs to post in that article the full Obama deception that's back up with a headline saying it's back up.
[00:45:11.264 --> 00:45:20.469]  He needs to add that so that when people then search this number one search term, they'll be taken to the Obama deception and they'll learn about Google and the NSA and what's going on.
[00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:31.636]  And some people say, well, if Google's the NSA, if Yahoo's admittedly in bed with the government, and admittedly a year ago now takes orders directly from the Senate and the office of Lieberman on what to take down and what to put up, that was admitted.
[00:45:32.762 --> 00:45:33.643]  Why are you there?
[00:45:33.643 --> 00:45:36.105]  Because that's where the war is!
[00:45:36.105 --> 00:45:41.269]  People ask, why do you have an iPhone app that's free if iPhones spy on you, admittedly?
[00:45:41.269 --> 00:45:43.050]  Because that's what people got!
[00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.172]  That's how I reach them!
[00:45:45.172 --> 00:45:52.758]  That's like asking somebody in World War I on the line between the front lines with the French and the Germans, why are you fighting on the front line?
[00:45:52.758 --> 00:45:55.440]  Because that's where the war is!
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.203]  The war is on YouTube and Google!
[00:45:58.203 --> 00:46:00.284]  The war is on Yahoo!
[00:46:00.284 --> 00:46:02.046]  The war is on the internet!
[00:46:05.307 --> 00:46:22.441]  And if you'll unleash the power you've got as individuals, we collectively can defeat these scumbags very quickly!
[00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:24.523]  We have got to get serious minds.
[00:46:24.523 --> 00:46:25.744]  We have to get focused minds.
[00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:27.285]  We have to have committed minds.
[00:46:31.035 --> 00:46:36.756]  When I was about 18 to 22, I went into a health kick, got out of it after that, started drinking, smoking.
[00:46:36.756 --> 00:46:38.997]  Few people do that, actually get in shape and get completely out of it.
[00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:41.197]  I ran six miles every other day.
[00:46:41.197 --> 00:46:43.558]  I lifted weights four days a week for two hours.
[00:46:43.558 --> 00:46:44.858]  I power lifted.
[00:46:44.858 --> 00:46:48.859]  I mean, I was a little guy at 180 pounds, but I could bench press 330, squat over 600.
[00:46:48.859 --> 00:46:49.759]  I could do over 40 chin-ups.
[00:46:54.232 --> 00:47:01.899]  And it's because I exercise my muscles and because I read books on powerlifting and how it was psychological.
[00:47:01.899 --> 00:47:05.002]  And I went out with my UT football buddies who played football.
[00:47:05.002 --> 00:47:06.764]  I didn't play football.
[00:47:06.764 --> 00:47:11.068]  And I worked out with guys that were a lot bigger and stronger than me.
[00:47:11.068 --> 00:47:13.631]  And it was all about getting in the zone.
[00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:18.090]  A little old lady can squat a thousand pounds.
[00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:19.810]  She just doesn't believe she can.
[00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:24.551]  That's why they've had cases of women when they're kids squealing under a car.
[00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:29.493]  Police have witnessed hundreds of times a woman going, there's the whole car!
[00:47:29.493 --> 00:47:31.393]  And it's the same thing in the info war.
[00:47:31.393 --> 00:47:35.454]  It's that place in your mind.
[00:47:35.454 --> 00:47:41.476]  It's that place in your mind where you've got to trick it and flip it into survival mode and then nothing can stop you.
[00:47:47.717 --> 00:47:49.398]  It's that place.
[00:47:49.398 --> 00:47:52.099]  You've got to get your mind in a place.
[00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:54.541]  It's like when you're arm wrestling somebody.
[00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:57.122]  And if you try really hard, you're not gonna beat them.
[00:47:57.122 --> 00:48:01.244]  It's being in a place where you literally flip a switch that you're going to die.
[00:48:01.244 --> 00:48:12.009]  And I never understood it when I was able to do it innately, as a primitive, as a throwback, as my late grandfather would call it.
[00:48:12.009 --> 00:48:13.670]  That it's just, you're doing it.
[00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:14.671]  It's going to happen.
[00:48:16.496 --> 00:48:20.419]  Now, when you run into somebody else who's doing like that, that's when people get killed.
[00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:23.021]  A lot of times, it's gonna be you.
[00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:23.722]  That's a problem.
[00:48:23.722 --> 00:48:25.723]  Anybody can turn this on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:25.723 --> 00:48:30.227]  Anybody can turn it on!
[00:48:30.227 --> 00:48:31.328]  Now, you can do that when you're young.
[00:48:31.328 --> 00:48:33.429]  When you get old, you turn it on.
[00:48:33.429 --> 00:48:36.071]  You're gonna pull arms out of sockets.
[00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:40.475]  Your muscles are gonna tear off their joints if you're not in shape, because the body can't handle it.
[00:48:40.475 --> 00:48:41.816]  You take a young, focused body,
[00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:52.983]  It's the same thing.
[00:48:52.983 --> 00:49:00.247]  You have to have a cold where you just clench your teeth and just feel that electricity in your mind and your soul.
[00:49:00.247 --> 00:49:04.370]  You've just got to have that spirit of liberty and just say, I don't care what it takes.
[00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:12.495]  I'm going to realize how hardcore this takeover is and how much danger our entire society's in and how wicked these evil people are.
[00:49:12.495 --> 00:49:17.038]  We have a variety of evil running our society that is the most wicked I have ever seen.
[00:49:17.038 --> 00:49:18.339]  And I've studied history deeply.
[00:49:20.509 --> 00:49:30.304]  To them, you watch a movie like The Road, and it's depressing and shocking and horrific and depressing, but for the globalists, this is beautiful to them.
[00:49:30.304 --> 00:49:34.530]  Do you know what all the top artwork in the world is now, sold for tens of millions per painting?
[00:49:35.819 --> 00:49:45.307]  The top five or six artists, you can go at Christie's and other things, are buckets of maggots, blood, skulls, photos of dead babies.
[00:49:45.307 --> 00:49:54.735]  Schwarzenegger has huge art collections, in my research of him, of dead children killed in car wrecks, dead babies in Nazi uniforms.
[00:49:54.735 --> 00:49:57.037]  Oh yeah, just search Arnold Schwarzenegger at Art Exhibit.
[00:49:57.037 --> 00:49:57.618]  You can pull it up.
[00:49:57.618 --> 00:49:58.739]  It's a deep search, but you'll find it.
[00:50:01.923 --> 00:50:10.633]  The point is, the elite, these bankers and people, their houses are just filled with blood and death and slime and they think it's beautiful.
[00:50:10.633 --> 00:50:13.016]  They love piles of dead bodies.
[00:50:13.016 --> 00:50:18.422]  They love piles of little kids' shoes and people being thrown into basements to rot and die.
[00:50:18.422 --> 00:50:19.243]  They love...
[00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:24.672]  Seeing people with their ribs sticking out like concentration camp victims.
[00:50:24.672 --> 00:50:35.516]  Hitler would sit there on the front lines in World War II during the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia with a telescope just watching burning buildings for sometimes more than 24 hours.
[00:50:37.537 --> 00:50:38.797]  They love it.
[00:50:38.797 --> 00:50:40.398]  They want to hurt you.
[00:50:40.398 --> 00:50:41.258]  Don't you understand?
[00:50:41.258 --> 00:50:43.119]  I know who they are.
[00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:48.540]  As a primitive, who also has the intellectual mind, I'm able to face the harm.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.422]  I'm able to tap in not only to wisdom and history, but my ancestral memories.
[00:50:53.422 --> 00:50:54.122]  All of you have it.
[00:50:54.122 --> 00:50:58.224]  It's called your instincts.
[00:50:58.224 --> 00:50:58.884]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.884 --> 00:50:59.244]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.192 --> 00:51:05.793]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:04.924 --> 00:52:06.185]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.185 --> 00:52:09.887]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.887 --> 00:52:12.349]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:18.212]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.212 --> 00:52:24.436]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.876 --> 00:52:30.861]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:35.044]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.044 --> 00:52:39.328]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.328 --> 00:52:45.273]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.273 --> 00:52:48.836]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.836 --> 00:52:50.817]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.817 --> 00:52:51.238]  It's here.

[00:53:00.082 --> 00:53:01.382]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.382 --> 00:53:06.965]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:06.965 --> 00:53:11.987]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:11.987 --> 00:53:17.029]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:22.790]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:29.892]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.892 --> 00:53:31.012]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.012 --> 00:53:37.374]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.694 --> 00:53:40.895]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.895 --> 00:53:43.116]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:44.056]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.056 --> 00:53:44.436]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.436 --> 00:53:47.697]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.697 --> 00:53:49.417]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:28.214 --> 00:54:29.614]  I can see the New World Order.
[00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:31.275]  I can see right inside their psyche.
[00:54:31.275 --> 00:54:33.896]  And I've read their writings.
[00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:35.697]  I know what they love.
[00:54:35.697 --> 00:54:39.198]  They love piles of dead children covered with maggots.
[00:54:39.198 --> 00:54:40.398]  They love burning cities.
[00:54:40.398 --> 00:54:41.959]  They love starvation.
[00:54:41.959 --> 00:54:43.840]  They love piles of ashes.
[00:54:45.438 --> 00:54:48.760]  They love dead forests and dead rivers and dead lakes.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.801]  They could care less about the environment.
[00:54:50.801 --> 00:55:05.849]  All the top eugenicists are transhumanists and talk about how they're rewriting the entire genetic code, releasing salmon into the ocean in major university studies that they know will extinct all the other salmon within 40 generations.
[00:55:05.849 --> 00:55:08.530]  They are genetically engineering every major food crop.
[00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.412]  Every one of them engineered to sterilize you and give you cancer.
[00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:16.841]  You gotta face the horror and realize what we're up against.
[00:55:16.841 --> 00:55:17.942]  I know it's scary.
[00:55:17.942 --> 00:55:20.164]  I know it's easier just to say this guy's crazy.
[00:55:20.164 --> 00:55:22.947]  But if you'll do the research, you'll find out I've told you the truth.
[00:55:22.947 --> 00:55:25.249]  And nothing but the truth, so help me God!
[00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:41.295]  On my name, on my family name, on my honor, on my children, on my soul, I pledge to you that what I've told you is the truth.
[00:55:41.295 --> 00:55:48.178]  I pledge to you that I am real and have a heart of love and strength, and I know you do as well.
[00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:54.481]  And I know, I pledge to you, I know in my spirit and in my heart that we can beat these people.
[00:55:54.481 --> 00:55:56.502]  And I know how great the cost is.
[00:55:57.777 --> 00:56:00.039]  I understand what the globalists are going to do.
[00:56:00.039 --> 00:56:04.864]  I have seen, on the historical parallel lines, the road we're on, where it leads.
[00:56:04.864 --> 00:56:10.809]  And it leads to the greatest mass murder and destruction and evil this planet has ever seen.
[00:56:10.809 --> 00:56:18.957]  And whether it's going to come or not, whether we can stop it or not, we know that we're going to be in a better position if we stand up and know the truth now.
[00:56:18.957 --> 00:56:20.158]  What did Patrick Henry say?
[00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.151]  I wish to know the truth, the whole of the truth, and prepare for it.
[00:56:26.151 --> 00:56:27.732]  Will you guys search that term?
[00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:31.273]  Patrick Henry, I wish to know the whole truth and make preparation for it.
[00:56:31.273 --> 00:56:33.974]  I wish to know the whole truth.
[00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:38.195]  Some of you, to paraphrase him, don't have the strength to know the truth.
[00:56:38.195 --> 00:56:43.537]  Some of you want to rationalize and lie to yourselves, but as for me, I want to know the whole truth.
[00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:45.818]  I want to face it and I want to make preparation for it.
[00:56:47.552 --> 00:56:50.297]  Our ancestors have lived through this over and over again.
[00:56:50.297 --> 00:56:51.739]  It's the human experience.
[00:56:51.739 --> 00:56:54.243]  It's what we've always struggled against.
[00:56:54.243 --> 00:56:56.026]  Survival against the elements.
[00:56:56.026 --> 00:56:59.131]  Survival against other corrupt tribes and bad groups of people.
[00:57:00.814 --> 00:57:06.818]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights isn't perfect, but it's the greatest hedge against evil this world has ever seen.
[00:57:06.818 --> 00:57:14.563]  It produced wealth and inventiveness and beauty like nothing has ever done in history, and it's being removed.
[00:57:14.563 --> 00:57:16.264]  The shields are down.
[00:57:16.264 --> 00:57:21.267]  Evil is flooding in and taking control of every sector and every system.
[00:57:24.124 --> 00:57:25.424]  Don't let the globalists stop you.
[00:57:25.424 --> 00:57:30.366]  Get the free link that's going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to the Obama deception.
[00:57:30.366 --> 00:57:31.966]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[00:57:31.966 --> 00:57:32.787]  Get the DVD.
[00:57:32.787 --> 00:57:35.107]  We've got, we can get four of them for $19.95 right now.
[00:57:35.107 --> 00:57:36.408]  That's basically my cost.
[00:57:36.408 --> 00:57:37.608]  With a free citizen rule book.
[00:57:37.608 --> 00:57:39.149]  Make copies of the DVDs.
[00:57:39.149 --> 00:57:39.669]  Get them out.
[00:57:39.669 --> 00:57:40.909]  InfoWars.com.
[00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:41.870]  The guys found the quote.
[00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:42.290]  Good job.
[00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:44.110]  Let's put it back on screen.
[00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:51.573]  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.
[00:57:51.573 --> 00:57:52.213]  Patrick Henry.
[00:57:53.137 --> 00:57:59.321]  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I'm living and experiencing what Patrick Henry experienced.
[00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:10.949]  I'm experiencing the anguish of knowing the truth and knowing that silly-minded people won't face up to it, won't realize it's real evil we're facing, and that it's not cute and funny.
[00:58:10.949 --> 00:58:21.456]  The devil isn't a hot cheerleader, you know, like that famous tattoo or that rockabilly image of a beautiful woman with voluptuous curves, with little devil horns, smiling with a pitchfork.
[00:58:21.456 --> 00:58:22.777]  She's got some fun for you.
[00:58:23.277 --> 00:58:24.257]  That's not the devil.
[00:58:24.257 --> 00:58:31.079]  The devil is mass death and piles of dead bodies and lice crawling all over rotten flesh.
[00:58:31.079 --> 00:58:37.361]  I have seen evil, I know evil, and I commit my entire being against it!
[00:58:37.361 --> 00:58:38.501]  We shall return!
[00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:45.063]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.063 --> 00:58:47.004]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.131 --> 00:58:51.772]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.772 --> 00:58:55.135]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:58:55.135 --> 00:59:00.359]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:59:00.359 --> 00:59:03.802]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:59:03.802 --> 00:59:06.144]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:06.764 --> 00:59:10.307]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:59:10.307 --> 00:59:11.428]  Take my word for it.
[00:59:11.428 --> 00:59:14.091]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:59:14.091 --> 00:59:20.596]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:59:20.596 --> 00:59:22.118]  Buy American and stay clean.
[00:59:22.118 --> 00:59:25.401]  As well as support InfoWars, visit 5starsoap.com today.
[00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:25.841]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:59:25.841 --> 00:59:27.142]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:38.353]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[00:59:38.353 --> 00:59:48.396]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:48.396 --> 00:59:53.257]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.257 --> 00:59:55.638]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.638 --> 00:59:58.459]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:10.012]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.012 --> 01:00:11.594]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.594 --> 01:00:13.155]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:17.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:24.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.024 --> 01:00:25.746]  Alright, Max Keiser's coming up in an hour.
[01:00:25.746 --> 01:00:27.567]  We'll have open phones when he's on with us as well.
[01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:38.992]  We're taking calls for the next 30 minutes solid, then I'm going to news blitz, and I mean it's key info coming up in T-minus 32 minutes when we come out of that break.
[01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:41.756]  But right now, let's go to your calls, one after the other.
[01:00:41.756 --> 01:00:44.019]  John in Ohio, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:00:45.506 --> 01:00:46.187]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:00:46.187 --> 01:00:51.472]  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know I had a tool that you can use for the search engine.
[01:00:51.472 --> 01:00:55.416]  It's a site called sitereloader.appspot.com.
[01:00:55.416 --> 01:01:03.665]  And what you do is you just put the link in, you put in a refresh rate, and you hit the button and it refreshes all day, every day, 365 days a year.
[01:01:05.777 --> 01:01:06.177]  Absolutely.
[01:01:06.177 --> 01:01:07.558]  So if you come up with 10 search items,
[01:01:22.907 --> 01:01:29.254]  Everybody can put those 10 search items into this program and we can come up with 10 new ones a day and take over the trend every day.
[01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:33.598]  And by the way, that's what TMZ to make Lindsay Lohan number one is doing.
[01:01:33.598 --> 01:01:36.221]  The people really don't care about Lindsay Lohan.
[01:01:36.221 --> 01:01:41.406]  They even had a frontline special a few years ago about how the media force feeds the petty issues.
[01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:42.528]  They force feed it.
[01:01:42.528 --> 01:01:45.330]  We're already been the number one trend many times just naturally.
[01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:51.615]  And it certainly upset the system when the listeners made Obama deception number one on Saturday.
[01:01:51.615 --> 01:01:56.438]  So somebody went in and deleted it, and now YouTube has reversed it and put it back up.
[01:01:56.438 --> 01:01:57.399]  That's amazing, isn't it?
[01:01:58.996 --> 01:02:00.037]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:02:00.037 --> 01:02:01.838]  I just can't believe that they're doing that.
[01:02:01.838 --> 01:02:09.362]  I mean, obviously they want to keep the truth hidden, but you know, the honest thing is that they can't keep us from, you know, just sitting back and doing nothing.
[01:02:09.362 --> 01:02:16.586]  So, I mean, I stayed up all night yesterday researching, you know, what to do, what else I could do, and, you know, refreshing the page over and over.
[01:02:16.586 --> 01:02:18.087]  It kind of gets tiresome, but with this,
[01:02:18.757 --> 01:02:23.379]  You know, you said it, forget it, and, you know, at least it'll do something to help out the InfoWare.
[01:02:23.379 --> 01:02:24.139]  Well done, John.
[01:02:24.139 --> 01:02:38.164]  And, of course, today's term, for those that don't know, and we're going to have Steve link in this article to the Obama deception that's been reposted, the 6.5 million version, Google spies, censors users.
[01:02:38.164 --> 01:02:43.886]  And, again, we're going to get Steve to repost in that article.
[01:02:45.701 --> 01:02:53.564]  The Obama Deception in full, so when people go click on Google Spies, they'll be able to read about it and then also see the video there.
[01:02:53.564 --> 01:02:57.665]  That's key to get Steve, Paul's on vacation for a week, to get that added.
[01:02:57.665 --> 01:03:01.526]  Or we can send this version of the story to Curt Nemo and have him add the video in there as well.
[01:03:01.526 --> 01:03:11.030]  That is vital because this is about to be the number one search term and they'll slap it down and won't allow it in the search term soon but they won't notice it on their radar until it's number one.
[01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.730]  Anything else, John?
[01:03:13.342 --> 01:03:13.822]  No, that's all.
[01:03:13.822 --> 01:03:20.046]  Just check out your YouTube channel, because I did post a tutorial in there on how to use it to make it user-friendly for everybody.
[01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:21.467]  But it'll definitely help us out.
[01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:22.367]  Alright, good job, John.
[01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:23.868]  Julio in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:03:23.868 --> 01:03:26.189]  Alex, what's up?
[01:03:26.189 --> 01:03:26.950]  Alex, good afternoon.
[01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:27.570]  How are you, sir?
[01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:27.950]  Good, sir.
[01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:28.551]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:29.312 --> 01:03:30.452]  Good to hear from you as always.
[01:03:45.157 --> 01:03:51.098]  And he's going up against Mark Kirk, who is pro-cap-and-trade, taxing us for breathing.
[01:03:51.098 --> 01:03:57.940]  If you can interview this man, he's pro-First Amendment, freedom of speech, anti-NAFTA, runrandyrun.com.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:00.701]  I posted it on your Facebook page for people to look at.
[01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:06.762]  I interviewed him on my radio show before he got kicked off the air, and he's an incredible man, former Leatherneck Marine.
[01:04:07.342 --> 01:04:09.224]  So check that out.
[01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:21.338]  Now, I'm so proud of all the Info Warriors this past weekend for taking the initiative and posting Obama Deception all over YouTube, all over Facebook, Twitter.
[01:04:21.338 --> 01:04:24.081]  I don't use Twitter, but for those who do, great job.
[01:04:25.266 --> 01:04:31.629]  The Obama Deception, I said this on your program, it woke me up to, you know, the left-right paradigm.
[01:04:31.629 --> 01:04:37.851]  KRS-One had a great line in your film talking about how the globalists needed to put a black face
[01:04:38.883 --> 01:04:47.113]  Up against the New World Order, Obama was elected and everyone kind of took a sigh of relief or like crossed their shoulders and just, uh, stand down.
[01:04:47.113 --> 01:04:55.784]  You see now, all over the Mockingbird media, they're talking about how, oh, the Tea Party- I'm not a Tea Party member, just a- Stay there, Herlio.
[01:04:55.784 --> 01:04:57.206]  Finish up on the other side.
[01:04:57.206 --> 01:04:57.647]  We'll be back.
[01:05:00.179 --> 01:05:04.742]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.742 --> 01:05:05.643]  Number one.
[01:05:05.643 --> 01:05:09.066]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.066 --> 01:05:09.926]  Number two.
[01:05:09.926 --> 01:05:14.830]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:15.570]  It's true.
[01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:20.434]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.434 --> 01:05:21.275]  Number three.
[01:05:21.275 --> 01:05:24.857]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.857 --> 01:05:28.560]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.540]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.302]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:36.004]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.004 --> 01:05:36.784]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.784 --> 01:05:40.926]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.926 --> 01:05:45.989]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:05.383]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.383 --> 01:07:09.304]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.304 --> 01:07:11.545]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:11.545 --> 01:07:17.407]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.407 --> 01:07:24.069]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:30.032]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.032 --> 01:07:33.713]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.233 --> 01:07:38.517]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.517 --> 01:07:44.483]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.483 --> 01:07:48.026]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:50.008]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.008 --> 01:07:51.129]  It's here.

[01:08:10.039 --> 01:08:14.661]  This is our land.
[01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:17.982]  These are our people.
[01:08:17.982 --> 01:08:18.742]  The workers.
[01:08:18.742 --> 01:08:21.844]  The strivers.
[01:08:21.844 --> 01:08:24.525]  The builders.
[01:08:24.525 --> 01:08:26.706]  These are our people.
[01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:28.266]  Who are they?
[01:08:31.329 --> 01:08:34.152]  They are the Dark Armies.
[01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:38.517]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[01:08:38.517 --> 01:08:39.298]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:39.298 --> 01:08:41.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:55.094 --> 01:08:58.736]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:08:58.736 --> 01:09:03.358]  That's what we say to the New World Order.
[01:09:03.358 --> 01:09:06.859]  The spirit of liberty is rising.
[01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:09.920]  The globalists are going down.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.002]  The spirit of victory is being awoken on a planetary scale.
[01:09:15.002 --> 01:09:17.524]  For every action, there's an equal reaction.
[01:09:17.524 --> 01:09:18.204]  And it's happening.
[01:09:19.844 --> 01:09:23.285]  We are in a global fight against tyranny.
[01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:30.646]  And there is a cyber war going on of propaganda and brainwashing and issues of no significance to distract and divert you.
[01:09:30.646 --> 01:09:41.508]  And every time you send someone a link to Infowars.com or the Obama deception or any of the work we've done or other work that you think is important, it has a giant effect.
[01:09:41.508 --> 01:09:44.969]  It has a cumulative effect against the new world order.
[01:09:46.087 --> 01:09:47.808]  And we've seen the power of the people.
[01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:49.890]  We see Obama's approval ratings dropping.
[01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:52.652]  We see the mainline Republican's approval ratings dropping.
[01:09:52.652 --> 01:09:59.336]  We see the fact that world government's being set up is now mainstream news so we can have a real debate about it.
[01:09:59.336 --> 01:10:04.740]  Think how far we've come where over 80% of the American people in major polls want to audit or abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.704]  Ten years ago, almost no one knew it was private.
[01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.206]  No one knew it hadn't been audited.
[01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:14.751]  Oh sure, they just passed the law to give themselves even more power, but that's the beginning of the end.
[01:10:14.751 --> 01:10:17.073]  That's them trying to secure their ill-gotten gains.
[01:10:18.578 --> 01:10:21.839]  They want to bankrupt you and make you dependent on government.
[01:10:21.839 --> 01:10:25.681]  They want to devalue the dollar and bring in this new global SDR currency.
[01:10:25.681 --> 01:10:29.023]  But we're going to be here every step of the way telling people the truth.
[01:10:29.023 --> 01:10:33.364]  And as things get darker, the light of liberty will shine that much brighter.
[01:10:33.364 --> 01:10:39.967]  The people are looking for the truth, and it's vital that we be there to show them what's really happening and to show them the facts.
[01:10:39.967 --> 01:10:40.928]  For those who just joined us,
[01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:55.191]  Someone hacked in, I believe it was an insider at YouTube or Google, may have been a rogue employee, but that's the prime suspect, the people of interest, I'll put it to you that way, and removed that film and police stayed for The Rise of FEMA.
[01:10:55.191 --> 01:11:00.694]  Luckily, Twitters were sent, Matt Ryan picked up on them, he was doing updating on InfoWars on Saturday.
[01:11:00.694 --> 01:11:01.975]  He called me and said, what do we do?
[01:11:01.975 --> 01:11:02.435]  I called.
[01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:11.941]  I didn't have his number on my phone, so Rob drove in from his apartment, because he lives close to the office, Rob Jacobson, got me the number to Kenneth Webb, who runs Change the Channel.
[01:11:11.941 --> 01:11:13.803]  He has a director's account.
[01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:17.186]  Only people early on in YouTube history get those, and they're pretty rare.
[01:11:17.186 --> 01:11:21.551]  And he posts our films in full length, not in parts.
[01:11:21.551 --> 01:11:25.815]  YouTube cuts them in, you know, 10-minute increments.
[01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:28.978]  And he went into the interface, saw the erasing going on, and locked them out.
[01:11:30.569 --> 01:11:35.174]  See, if YouTube would have gone in there and just changed the passcode, then there would have been a big investigation.
[01:11:35.174 --> 01:11:36.536]  We would have found out who did it.
[01:11:36.536 --> 01:11:40.540]  But by going in and just hitting my films, they thought they'd get away with it.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.683]  And I'm not 100% of about 95% chance it was an insider there.
[01:11:43.683 --> 01:11:46.887]  I mean, this was a long, complex, numbered passcode.
[01:11:46.887 --> 01:11:48.969]  I mean, there's no way that's...
[01:11:50.782 --> 01:11:51.883]  It's just like with your iPhone.
[01:11:51.883 --> 01:11:55.745]  If you're entering your passcode and you do it a few times wrong, it locks you out.
[01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.866]  Or like with your ATM card.
[01:11:57.866 --> 01:11:59.387]  Well, YouTube's the same way.
[01:11:59.387 --> 01:12:08.953]  There's no way this big... They have computers that can randomly try to crack a code, but it doesn't allow you to just plug in the interface and just sit there and hit it with new ones.
[01:12:08.953 --> 01:12:13.016]  We also had Dave, who runs our official Alex Jones channel.
[01:12:13.016 --> 01:12:13.736]  He works for us.
[01:12:13.736 --> 01:12:14.797]  That's our channel officially.
[01:12:16.271 --> 01:12:21.016]  He kept getting emails last week saying, oh, your passcode change failed.
[01:12:21.016 --> 01:12:28.043]  Please send us your email back so they could try to manipulate him into giving him the passcode.
[01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:38.313]  And so somebody was trying to hack into that and somebody could have hacked into Kenneth Webb's own computer and they could have gotten his passcode that way.
[01:12:39.557 --> 01:12:39.857]  I think so.
[01:13:01.474 --> 01:13:05.737]  It's the number five link to that particular free video, when you put the name Obama in.
[01:13:05.737 --> 01:13:15.783]  So let's click on that link to get it back to number one, and let's search the term Google Spies today, because it will then take you to an article on prisonplanet.com.
[01:13:19.332 --> 01:13:25.537]  That will have the full-length version posted, my analysis video, and the history of Google censoring all proven.
[01:13:25.537 --> 01:13:27.119]  They're Google spies.
[01:13:27.119 --> 01:13:29.401]  Let's make that the number one search term today.
[01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:30.722]  They'll then erase it out of it.
[01:13:30.722 --> 01:13:31.563]  We'll have a new term.
[01:13:31.563 --> 01:13:33.384]  And I'm not going to do this all the time.
[01:13:33.384 --> 01:13:35.166]  I just wanted to show them what the people can do.
[01:13:36.527 --> 01:13:39.850]  Instead of them force-feeding us Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson scandal.
[01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:42.131]  Okay, I'm gonna try to hurry through your calls now.
[01:13:42.131 --> 01:13:43.552]  I just want to give people those updates.
[01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:54.541]  Julio in Illinois, for those that just joined us, you were bringing up the media is now in a, like a tree full of parrots saying, Tea Party racist, Tea Party racist, don't like healthcare, bar my government, racist.
[01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:56.562]  Don't like big government, racist.
[01:13:56.562 --> 01:14:06.170]  And that's just to keep the Democratic base of minorities afraid and clinging to their eugenics Nazi masters, who they don't know are eugenics Nazi masters, because they haven't researched it.
[01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:07.881]  So that's what's going on.
[01:14:07.881 --> 01:14:08.889]  What's your point on that, Julio?
[01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:23.498]  Yeah, they're just acting like true CIA mockingbird assets, just continuously trying to demonize everyone in the freedom movement for not liking, you know, Barry Fitoro, Mr. Obama.
[01:14:23.498 --> 01:14:33.263]  But, again, I just want to say great job to everyone for, you know, showing the globalists that we, the human beings, we as people, do have great power.
[01:14:33.263 --> 01:14:37.666]  I smiled at myself last night and told myself, as Bob Chapman always does over the last few
[01:14:38.166 --> 01:14:41.387]  We're going to beat these people because they are desperately afraid.
[01:14:41.387 --> 01:14:43.428]  Obama Deception is such a powerful film.
[01:14:43.428 --> 01:14:44.368]  It woke me up.
[01:14:44.368 --> 01:14:47.249]  It woke so many of my friends up.
[01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.549]  They're afraid, Alex.
[01:14:48.549 --> 01:14:50.210]  We're going to beat these people.
[01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:52.150]  I'm going to have you... Because they're criminals!
[01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:55.811]  I mean, they're criminals, and all we've got to do is stand up to them!
[01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:59.532]  I mean, literally, Madoff created the Nasdaq.
[01:14:59.532 --> 01:15:03.133]  Kinley, with BP and Al Gore, created carbon taxes.
[01:15:03.133 --> 01:15:04.454]  They're a pack of crooks!
[01:15:05.054 --> 01:15:13.121]  There's no reason that that fat pervert, Al Gore, should be better than us and be able to defeat us.
[01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:20.949]  It's only because we lay down and don't have faith in ourselves that that demonic slug is able to dominate and put all these taxes on us.
[01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:24.612]  It's time to arrest these scumbags!
[01:15:24.612 --> 01:15:25.673]  The truth set us free.
[01:15:25.673 --> 01:15:26.714]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:15:26.714 --> 01:15:28.536]  God bless you, and I do need your prayers, Julio.
[01:15:29.454 --> 01:15:29.934]  And I love it.
[01:15:29.934 --> 01:15:31.135]  We are the freedom movement.
[01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:32.877]  It's not the Tea Party.
[01:15:32.877 --> 01:15:33.978]  We are freedom movement.
[01:15:33.978 --> 01:15:34.738]  We are truth.
[01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:35.759]  We are love.
[01:15:35.759 --> 01:15:36.880]  We are honor.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.581]  We are liberty.
[01:15:37.581 --> 01:15:38.482]  We are free market.
[01:15:38.482 --> 01:15:39.542]  We are private property.
[01:15:39.542 --> 01:15:41.364]  We live our own lives.
[01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:42.385]  Leave us alone.
[01:15:42.385 --> 01:15:43.846]  We're independents.
[01:15:43.846 --> 01:15:46.148]  We're people that aren't slaves!
[01:15:46.148 --> 01:15:46.969]  We're red-blooded!
[01:15:48.609 --> 01:15:50.409]  We're the red blood movement.
[01:15:50.409 --> 01:15:53.830]  You can have red blood and be Hispanic, black, white, purple.
[01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:54.691]  I don't care.
[01:15:54.691 --> 01:15:57.671]  As long as you want freedom and hate tyranny, I'm your brother.
[01:15:57.671 --> 01:15:58.772]  We're blood brothers.
[01:15:58.772 --> 01:16:00.492]  We're blood sisters.
[01:16:00.492 --> 01:16:02.372]  We're the red blood movement.
[01:16:02.372 --> 01:16:04.033]  We got red blood!
[01:16:04.033 --> 01:16:04.973]  It's red!
[01:16:04.973 --> 01:16:06.473]  It's not cowardly and weak.
[01:16:06.473 --> 01:16:10.394]  It's strong like our ancestors, who struggled for us to have what we have.
[01:16:10.394 --> 01:16:12.535]  And it's not going to be taken by a bunch of scum.
[01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:20.389]  I want to give some new callers a chance because I'm noticing a lot of same callers here.
[01:16:20.389 --> 01:16:21.932]  So I'm going to race through some of these calls.
[01:16:21.932 --> 01:16:22.933]  Mark in Texas, go ahead.
[01:16:24.284 --> 01:16:26.125]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:29.047]  I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing.
[01:16:29.047 --> 01:16:31.169]  I was a typical, classic zombie.
[01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.471]  Didn't have any idea what was going on around me.
[01:16:33.471 --> 01:16:40.235]  Caught one of your videos on the independent channel on cable and it just like went right through me.
[01:16:40.235 --> 01:16:42.537]  I'm an ex-marine.
[01:16:42.537 --> 01:16:48.601]  I did a lot of things for this country that I'm not very proud of, but I want you to say that.
[01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:51.303]  Hopefully we can resolve this peaceably.
[01:16:53.238 --> 01:16:54.559]  I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous right now.
[01:16:54.559 --> 01:17:03.322]  What I really wanted to tell you was, I was on Yahoo today, and I see like 19 million hits on the Obama deception, uh, area.
[01:17:03.322 --> 01:17:05.123]  Yes.
[01:17:05.123 --> 01:17:06.744]  Oh, okay, you realize that, too?
[01:17:06.744 --> 01:17:08.044]  And, uh... No, I haven't seen that.
[01:17:08.044 --> 01:17:08.624]  What did it say?
[01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.146]  It had gotten 19 million hits.
[01:17:11.146 --> 01:17:14.027]  On, uh, actually on there right now, Obama deception, 19,001,230.
[01:17:18.751 --> 01:17:21.312]  So you might want to look that up and get that out there.
[01:17:21.312 --> 01:17:27.573]  I've been at it all weekend, you know, clicking on the different search engines and bringing it up.
[01:17:27.573 --> 01:17:30.153]  And I just want to tell you that you're doing a great job.
[01:17:30.153 --> 01:17:31.393]  I appreciate it.
[01:17:31.393 --> 01:17:32.934]  I'm doing everything I can.
[01:17:32.934 --> 01:17:37.194]  And it felt really good to actually become involved.
[01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:45.636]  You know, I tell everyone that I know about it and everyone that I meet about the New World Order and all, but it felt really good to actually be able to physically
[01:17:47.133 --> 01:17:49.639]  Carry out the task that you gave us.
[01:17:49.639 --> 01:17:52.084]  It was an awesome experience.
[01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:52.926]  It felt really good.
[01:17:53.809 --> 01:17:55.630]  Well, listen, it scared the system.
[01:17:55.630 --> 01:18:03.717]  We only know of one other example, because it's in YouTube rules, that if somebody hacks your account and erases your videos, they don't put them back up.
[01:18:03.717 --> 01:18:14.706]  And we know of one case with a video that Dave, who runs the channel, brought to my attention of what, last year, a video, a music video, had over 200 million views.
[01:18:14.706 --> 01:18:17.188]  Somebody hacked it and put their own thing up.
[01:18:17.188 --> 01:18:21.951]  And it took about a month, but YouTube fixed it because of the big backlash by the record company.
[01:18:23.052 --> 01:18:24.614]  That was so angry about it.
[01:18:24.614 --> 01:18:40.989]  This is really the first time we've seen a political video that's been hacked and removed, put back up, and it's because they know that we have the spirit of victory, that we weren't going to give up, that I was going to go completely ape about this, because them wronging us and allowing this to happen galvanized people.
[01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:43.231]  That's the reason they don't kill me.
[01:18:43.231 --> 01:18:45.073]  You think this Obama deception thing's bigger?
[01:18:45.073 --> 01:18:47.254]  If they killed me, it'd be a thousand times bigger.
[01:18:47.254 --> 01:18:54.040]  That's why they want to demonize me, have their operatives lie about me, harass me, all this other stuff, because they know I'm real.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.241]  They listen to my phone.
[01:18:55.241 --> 01:18:56.121]  They know we're for real.
[01:18:56.121 --> 01:18:58.723]  They know we're real patriots.
[01:18:58.723 --> 01:19:00.605]  And they know you're real.
[01:19:00.605 --> 01:19:01.265]  And they're scared.
[01:19:01.265 --> 01:19:02.366]  And they've got all the numbers.
[01:19:02.366 --> 01:19:03.847]  They know we outnumber them.
[01:19:03.847 --> 01:19:06.810]  See, that's the final illusion, Mark, is that
[01:19:08.547 --> 01:19:09.708]  We feel like we're alone.
[01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:11.128]  We feel like we're the minority.
[01:19:11.128 --> 01:19:19.052]  I mean, and I appreciate your calling, God bless you, Mark, you touch my heart.
[01:19:19.052 --> 01:19:33.159]  In national polls, right at 90% on average, some are 85, some are 92, but every year they have all these mainstream polls, some scientific, some not, but they're always above 80 plus percent, believe the government killed Kennedy.
[01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:38.062]  But you have the media representing 10% of idiots telling us we're the kooks.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.621]  See, they just tell us we're nuts.
[01:19:40.621 --> 01:19:42.062]  Oh, you think the government's corrupt?
[01:19:42.062 --> 01:19:43.623]  You think the bankers have power?
[01:19:43.623 --> 01:19:45.184]  There's no such thing as elite power.
[01:19:45.184 --> 01:19:46.946]  You're a conspiracy cook.
[01:19:46.946 --> 01:19:48.687]  Ah, you think there's a world government?
[01:19:48.687 --> 01:19:50.328]  Ah, you think Google's spying on you?
[01:19:50.328 --> 01:19:53.010]  Now it's all admitted.
[01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:54.511]  See, it's that illusion.
[01:19:54.511 --> 01:19:55.812]  We are the majority.
[01:19:55.812 --> 01:19:57.053]  We are the power.
[01:19:57.053 --> 01:19:58.214]  We are the people.
[01:19:58.214 --> 01:19:59.515]  We're gonna arrest these scum.
[01:20:00.922 --> 01:20:04.283]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:04.283 --> 01:20:08.204]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:11.926]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:21:59.955 --> 01:22:09.977]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:09.977 --> 01:22:16.398]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:25.260]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:34.824]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:39.426]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:39.426 --> 01:22:41.227]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:41.227 --> 01:22:43.728]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:10.469]  Big news blitz coming up.
[01:24:10.469 --> 01:24:11.210]  Then more calls.
[01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:13.570]  Max Geiser straight ahead in the next hour.
[01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.831]  David in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:24:15.831 --> 01:24:17.332]  Welcome.
[01:24:17.332 --> 01:24:18.132]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:24:18.132 --> 01:24:20.393]  Doing alright, my friend.
[01:24:20.393 --> 01:24:31.298]  Okay, well, I'd just like to say about the Internet, the last place where the masses can have a free exchange of ideas, it is not controlled by the globalists, and that's why they want to shut it down.
[01:24:32.611 --> 01:24:34.512]  Well said.
[01:24:34.512 --> 01:24:48.417]  Basically, I got a personal battle going on here in Stark County, Indiana, because my wife basically filed false criminal charges against me and had me thrown out of my property.
[01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:54.539]  And basically, Stark County trampled all over my constitutional rights.
[01:24:54.539 --> 01:25:01.962]  Basically, I had to do it because I was involved in the Truth Movement since 98, and my wife couldn't stand my political activism.
[01:25:03.655 --> 01:25:11.611]  So basically I got a big mess going on with them because my lawyer didn't really go into
[01:25:13.627 --> 01:25:36.266]  Well that's the problem is and it's come out in the news that a lot of these bad lawyers tell women to lie to like get control of a court case or property and men have done it as well but predominantly it comes out that women are told to do it because there's so many cases where men are abusive to women that then women can claim that when it's not true but I see more and more people
[01:25:37.142 --> 01:25:39.425]  Individually doing that as well.
[01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:47.733]  I mean, I've seen other talk show hosts and media people before just tell complete lies, you know, say things like Alex Jones called up and threatened to kill me.
[01:25:48.652 --> 01:26:09.608]  Just complete and total lie and then I luckily had guys here in the studio who'd been there during the conversation and it was a calm conversation nothing was said and I called back and I said you know what you retract that or I'm gonna have to sue you and of course they did retract it but I mean it just seems like it's a normal thing for people to do in this society now is to just lie about people they folks have no honor
[01:26:10.288 --> 01:26:12.749]  And I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.
[01:26:12.749 --> 01:26:20.372]  That's why I think it's important that men meet women who are into the freedom and up front, you know, not just their looks, but what they stand for.
[01:26:20.372 --> 01:26:30.175]  I'd rather have a woman who wasn't the most beautiful, you know, in the world, according to worldly standards, but had a good heart that would love my children and love me and who was smart.
[01:26:30.175 --> 01:26:35.737]  I mean, I'd rather have a smart woman and a loving woman than one of these trophy wives.
[01:26:36.477 --> 01:26:38.199]  Basically, I've been out of my home for ten months now.
[01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:39.200]  I'm living in my sister's place.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.102]  Basically, they act like I don't have any rights at all.
[01:27:05.726 --> 01:27:15.608]  Well, you can file civil suits to get your portion of the property.
[01:27:15.608 --> 01:27:24.090]  Well, that's because they get more money the longer they draw it out.
[01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:27.851]  You need to get law books yourself and you need to file your own stuff.
[01:27:27.851 --> 01:27:33.353]  And just start hitting her lawyer with injunctions and filings every week and her lawyer will ditch her quick.
[01:27:33.353 --> 01:27:35.053]  They're only running over you because it's easy.
[01:27:36.348 --> 01:27:39.529]  Yeah, because they know the law and I don't, basically.
[01:27:39.529 --> 01:27:54.813]  But basically, you know, it's just like they come on my property with no evidence and they didn't even file domestic charges or domestic violence charges on me after they threw me off the property because they knew they didn't have a case.
[01:27:54.813 --> 01:27:56.514]  And you own an interest in this property.
[01:27:56.514 --> 01:27:58.694]  Well, it'll be fleshed out in court.
[01:27:58.694 --> 01:27:59.955]  You need to get a new lawyer.
[01:27:59.955 --> 01:28:00.475]  God bless you.
[01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.875]  I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.
[01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:04.116]  Let's talk to Terry in Florida.
[01:28:04.116 --> 01:28:04.916]  Terry, you're on the air.
[01:28:05.731 --> 01:28:27.135]  Yeah hey Alex, I just want to thank you for your enthusiasm and inspiration that you've been sharing with your audience today and yesterday and it's really affected me and I just want to share with everyone that
[01:28:27.994 --> 01:28:31.235]  The time to stand up is now.
[01:28:31.235 --> 01:28:48.182]  If we are ever going to be heard, if truth is going to shine forth brightly and overcome this darkness that's trying to entrap us and wipe us out, the time to do it is now.
[01:28:48.182 --> 01:28:51.844]  Wherever you are in the grocery store, with your neighbors,
[01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:57.167]  It's time to get to know your neighbors.
[01:28:57.167 --> 01:29:00.709]  It's time to have talks with your family about where the world's going.
[01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:05.653]  It's time to really focus in on what our priorities should be.
[01:29:05.653 --> 01:29:07.434]  And that is happening.
[01:29:08.537 --> 01:29:29.430]  You're exactly right, and I saw that the video had gone back up on Change the Channel, the Obama deception, and that just shows the power that we have in rising up against
[01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:35.514]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:35.514 --> 01:29:38.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:05.133 --> 01:32:08.556]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:09.416]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.416 --> 01:32:14.319]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.319 --> 01:32:15.060]  It's true.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:19.923]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.923 --> 01:32:20.763]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.763 --> 01:32:24.346]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.346 --> 01:32:28.048]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.248 --> 01:32:29.049]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.049 --> 01:32:31.811]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:35.495]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.495 --> 01:32:36.276]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.276 --> 01:32:40.419]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.419 --> 01:32:45.184]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.464 --> 01:32:49.645]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.645 --> 01:32:51.426]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.426 --> 01:32:53.666]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:56.027]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:08.497 --> 01:33:13.361]  Mega massive news splits coming up and then I'll go back to your phone calls.
[01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:15.682]  Then we got Max Keiser coming up with the team with calls then.
[01:33:15.682 --> 01:33:22.967]  But I wanted to make this point right now.
[01:33:22.967 --> 01:33:27.691]  We have the number one search terms on Yahoo and Google.
[01:33:27.691 --> 01:33:29.452]  Today the term is Google Spies.
[01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:39.449]  If you put an automatic program on your computer and keep reloading that though, you may have trouble with your ISPs calling it spamming.
[01:33:39.449 --> 01:33:41.890]  I don't know if that's good for people to do.
[01:33:41.890 --> 01:33:54.313]  I'm saying, in your regular course of the day, go search the term Google Spies and things like that to drive it up in the ratings.
[01:33:54.313 --> 01:33:56.133]  But before we did this on Friday,
[01:33:58.188 --> 01:34:06.673]  The number one link by itself, just because of traffic, was the Obama deception when you search the term Barack Obama, President Obama, or Obama.
[01:34:06.673 --> 01:34:09.595]  It's now the number five link.
[01:34:09.595 --> 01:34:16.219]  So that's the main reason it was knocked down, so that people wouldn't watch that link when they put the President's name in.
[01:34:16.219 --> 01:34:19.001]  The top link is now Barack Obama's official site.
[01:34:25.444 --> 01:34:34.269]  But so many people see going to the county courthouse, or going to the city council, or going to their state house, or calling Congress, or calling the talk radio as work.
[01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:36.350]  It's fun to resist tyranny.
[01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:39.371]  You're meant to be struggling for freedom, like it's a football game.
[01:34:39.371 --> 01:34:49.477]  Those instincts when you go and 100,000 of you get in a stadium and chant, you know, that's a facsimile of your normal tribal instincts to get together for war.
[01:34:50.057 --> 01:34:52.439]  Well, in the modern sense, it's Infowar.
[01:34:52.439 --> 01:34:53.900]  This is the team we're on.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:54.840]  Team Liberty.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.161]  Team Freedom.
[01:34:56.161 --> 01:34:58.223]  Team Private Property.
[01:34:58.223 --> 01:35:02.486]  Team Not Having Parasites Rob Us Blind.
[01:35:02.486 --> 01:35:04.187]  If we don't have freedom, we have nothing.
[01:35:04.187 --> 01:35:07.949]  We will be enslaved in every case in history.
[01:35:07.949 --> 01:35:08.830]  It's just that simple.
[01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:09.831]  But I do want to salute
[01:35:11.269 --> 01:35:22.176]  And thank and appreciate all of you out there over the years that have made my films number one on the web, that have bought the DVDs and the books and the materials.
[01:35:22.176 --> 01:35:29.181]  And so to say thank you to all of you, you can buy four copies of The Obama Deception right now at Infowars.com for $5 a piece, or $4 and change.
[01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:30.461]  You get four for $19.95, you get 10 for $39.95.
[01:35:30.461 --> 01:35:32.203]  That's down at like four bucks a piece.
[01:35:39.227 --> 01:35:40.649]  And you get a citizen rule book.
[01:35:40.649 --> 01:35:44.413]  We basically make no money on this after we ship it and everything.
[01:35:44.413 --> 01:35:59.131]  But the point is, the system is scared of this, and the low-tech way to have it in the highest quality on DVD and make copies of it and give it to people, or to give them it in the pretty color case with all the information, they have a better chance of them watching it.
[01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:01.135]  Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:01.135 --> 01:36:02.096]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[01:36:02.096 --> 01:36:02.658]  Box 19549 Austin, TX 78760.
[01:36:02.658 --> 01:36:04.321]  I can't offer this deal for very long.
[01:36:13.737 --> 01:36:18.619]  When this printing runs out, it'll go back to the regular price, because that's how we fund our operation.
[01:36:18.619 --> 01:36:21.060]  But I am dedicated to getting this out.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:33.806]  And so for a limited time, you can write to us, you can call, or you can go to the website and get four copies for $19.95 of The Obama Deception, and part two of it, Fall of the Republic, that I quite frankly think is an even better film.
[01:36:35.006 --> 01:36:36.327]  And that's free on the web as well.
[01:36:36.327 --> 01:36:38.069]  Get the links to it, send it out to everybody.
[01:36:38.069 --> 01:36:43.193]  Realize that the system wouldn't be removing this stuff if it wasn't hurting them, if they weren't scared, if they weren't concerned.
[01:36:43.193 --> 01:36:43.734]  That's the point.
[01:36:43.734 --> 01:36:46.016]  They're not invincible.
[01:36:46.016 --> 01:36:48.958]  And lastly, before I news blitz and then go back into your calls,
[01:36:49.957 --> 01:36:52.761]  I want to tell you about Wake the Church.
[01:36:52.761 --> 01:37:00.032]  It's an event coming up with Alan Keyes, Dr. Chuck Baldwin, of course, George W. Hunt.
[01:37:00.032 --> 01:37:02.296]  Also, they're going to be Dr. Katherine Albrecht.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.043]  On privacy, Daryl Rundis, our good friend, is hosting the event.
[01:37:10.043 --> 01:37:11.744]  And it's $5.95 for tickets.
[01:37:11.744 --> 01:37:13.425]  That'll just pay for the hotel and banquet hall.
[01:37:13.425 --> 01:37:14.526]  Probably won't even pay for that.
[01:37:14.526 --> 01:37:15.626]  I've tried to rent hotels before.
[01:37:15.626 --> 01:37:17.507]  I know how much it costs.
[01:37:17.507 --> 01:37:19.168]  And it's liberty2010.com.
[01:37:19.168 --> 01:37:20.729]  That's faithandliberty2010.com.
[01:37:20.729 --> 01:37:22.010]  Faithandliberty2010.com.
[01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.750]  One word.
[01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:23.531]  Faith and liberty.
[01:37:28.435 --> 01:37:33.361]  2010.com for that event coming up July 24th in Colorado.
[01:37:36.986 --> 01:37:40.128]  And lastly, I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com.
[01:37:40.128 --> 01:37:46.852]  In these insane times we're entering into, in this depression we're entering into, you're probably going to end up having to use this food.
[01:37:46.852 --> 01:37:47.893]  More and more it looks like that.
[01:37:47.893 --> 01:37:55.278]  But if there was a 10% chance that things are going to collapse and get really serious and that the dollar was going to be devalued, it's a lot higher than that.
[01:37:55.278 --> 01:37:56.238]  You should have storable food.
[01:37:56.238 --> 01:37:57.319]  It's high quality.
[01:37:57.319 --> 01:37:58.160]  It's freshly made.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.161]  They're wonderful patriots.
[01:38:00.161 --> 01:38:07.646]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[01:38:07.646 --> 01:38:10.127]  You'll never stand on a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:38:10.127 --> 01:38:13.389]  eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:38:13.389 --> 01:38:18.933]  Don't procrastinate, at least calling it a free brochure of their wonderful food products that they have there.
[01:38:18.933 --> 01:38:21.755]  No GMO, no hybrid, none of that garbage.
[01:38:21.755 --> 01:38:24.417]  They got gourmet meals, they got regular meals, they got everything.
[01:38:24.417 --> 01:38:25.257]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:38:30.387 --> 01:38:34.950]  It's actually like looking at your garage when you hadn't cleaned it out in three or four years every day.
[01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:42.516]  Every day when I get on air, I have all these stacks of news that I've read over and gone over before the show, and every one of these articles, I could talk about them for an hour.
[01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:47.560]  But I look at these stacks, there's gotta be 130 or so or more.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.821]  That's just a guesstimation.
[01:38:49.821 --> 01:38:50.782]  I wonder how right I am.
[01:38:50.782 --> 01:38:51.863]  Let's do that.
[01:38:51.863 --> 01:38:56.506]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:02.562]  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[01:39:02.562 --> 01:39:05.323]  There's another 10 articles or so in there.
[01:39:05.323 --> 01:39:05.603]  That's 30.
[01:39:05.603 --> 01:39:07.863]  Another four or five articles.
[01:39:07.863 --> 01:39:12.105]  Yeah, it's, it's, guesstimation's right.
[01:39:12.105 --> 01:39:14.586]  It's probably 120, 130 articles here.
[01:39:14.586 --> 01:39:16.686]  Again, I dead reckon a lot.
[01:39:16.686 --> 01:39:20.468]  In fact, should I right now just count every one of them here on air just to see?
[01:39:20.468 --> 01:39:21.208]  I haven't done it, but
[01:39:23.464 --> 01:39:25.084]  People say, well, how do you know it's 130 articles?
[01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:27.045]  Here, let's just see how close I was, then I'll get into the news.
[01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:28.085]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
[01:39:28.085 --> 01:39:28.805]  That's 16 articles.
[01:39:28.805 --> 01:39:28.965]  17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
[01:39:54.090 --> 01:40:11.674]  Probably shouldn't do this on air, but it's 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, and there's all these stacks.
[01:40:11.674 --> 01:40:12.954]  Yeah, I bet it's 100.
[01:40:12.954 --> 01:40:13.714]  There's no way to read it all.
[01:40:13.714 --> 01:40:23.676]  The point is I got a lot of articles here, and any one of these I could spend hours on, but let's just at least run through the headlines here for people right now, today.
[01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:27.766]  Four dead in Juarez bombing.
[01:40:27.766 --> 01:40:31.235]  People in Juarez are recovering from a car bomb that killed four.
[01:40:33.314 --> 01:40:36.677]  Don't decriminalize the drugs and shut off this war instantly.
[01:40:36.677 --> 01:40:37.938]  No, no, no.
[01:40:37.938 --> 01:40:41.642]  Because the government's in a war to keep control of the drugs and laundering it.
[01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:04.331]  Schwarzenegger sends California National Guard troops to border security.
[01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:05.452]  That'll be a complete whitewash.
[01:41:05.452 --> 01:41:06.793]  They'll just arrest citizens.
[01:41:06.793 --> 01:41:08.034]  We've seen what they've done in the past.
[01:41:08.034 --> 01:41:10.656]  That's an election stunt.
[01:41:10.656 --> 01:41:14.139]  Inside Mexico's drug war, Americans allege abuse.
[01:41:14.139 --> 01:41:15.360]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.842]  Americans allege?
[01:41:17.842 --> 01:41:19.683]  I don't even go to Mexico anymore.
[01:41:19.683 --> 01:41:29.210]  I mean, the last time I saw the tour bus we were on in southern Mexico get pulled over by army troops and shake down the driver and take the tips away from him,
[01:41:30.111 --> 01:41:33.552]  Or back in college I would go down there and they'd pull us over and shake us down.
[01:41:33.552 --> 01:41:42.915]  You know, I mean, corrupt guys in black uniforms with gold teeth demanding, you know, smiling at you and calling you stupid gringo and demanding your money.
[01:41:42.915 --> 01:41:45.916]  Can you imagine if our cops did this to the illegal aliens?
[01:41:45.916 --> 01:41:47.517]  It'd be the end of the world!
[01:41:48.197 --> 01:41:50.198]  I mean, anybody who goes to Mexico is out of their mind.
[01:41:50.198 --> 01:41:51.738]  It's a collapsed, failed society.
[01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.739]  They allege abuse.
[01:41:53.739 --> 01:41:56.380]  And it shows these Americans.
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:42:07.804]  What they do is they get you, they find some petty crime, and then they get, on average, they run your family's credit off your driver's license, and they say, your family is rich.
[01:42:07.804 --> 01:42:08.164]  $100,000.
[01:42:08.164 --> 01:42:10.605]  You go to Mexico, and the police kidnap you.
[01:42:10.605 --> 01:42:11.885]  It's very simple.
[01:42:11.885 --> 01:42:12.806]  Okay?
[01:42:12.806 --> 01:42:13.686]  Don't go to Mexico.
[01:42:13.686 --> 01:42:15.347]  Don't let your family go to Mexico.
[01:42:15.347 --> 01:42:16.287]  It's a failed state.
[01:42:17.822 --> 01:42:21.783]  Immigrant deaths in Arizona desert soar in July, and it goes over all of that.
[01:42:21.783 --> 01:42:25.223]  You build a wall there and stop it, these people wouldn't be dying en masse.
[01:42:25.223 --> 01:42:29.064]  The bodies of 40 illegal immigrants have been brought into the office of Pima County Medical Examiner.
[01:42:29.064 --> 01:42:32.685]  Many of them shot and killed and robbed by the coyotes.
[01:42:32.685 --> 01:42:35.785]  You don't hear the civil rights activists talking about that, though.
[01:42:35.785 --> 01:42:37.526]  I already did the four dead in Juarez.
[01:42:37.526 --> 01:42:41.286]  Okay, so that's the stack on that front.
[01:42:41.286 --> 01:42:45.267]  Got Glenn Spencer from the Arizona border joining us tomorrow to talk about that.
[01:42:46.463 --> 01:42:47.485]  Here's Time Magazine.
[01:42:47.485 --> 01:42:52.010]  Dems starting to panic as reality of midterm woes sets in.
[01:42:53.829 --> 01:42:59.735]  But don't worry, you've got all these White House officials and people saying they want an Oklahoma City or 9-11 event to save themselves.
[01:42:59.735 --> 01:43:01.476]  That's in the Financial Times of London.
[01:43:01.476 --> 01:43:06.301]  Don't worry, they'll launch a new war with Iran or blow up some federal buildings and blame it on patriots.
[01:43:06.301 --> 01:43:09.764]  Don't worry, the scumbag murderers are going to try something.
[01:43:09.764 --> 01:43:11.866]  You don't need to worry about that.
[01:43:11.866 --> 01:43:18.292]  In fact, even Robert Shapiro in that article said Obama needs to look like a strong leader and have people rally around him for protection.
[01:43:19.033 --> 01:43:23.536]  The government blows up a building and then you run up and hug onto the black uniformed leg.
[01:43:23.536 --> 01:43:25.937]  Oh, government, oh, police, oh.
[01:43:25.937 --> 01:43:29.920]  This is a narcotics child kidnapping criminal group.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.703]  Congressional hearings, how they run giant white slavery rings worldwide.
[01:43:34.703 --> 01:43:40.286]  Every time I say white slavery ring, some idiot sends me an email saying, oh, black slavery isn't a bad thing.
[01:43:40.286 --> 01:43:42.428]  White slavery means sex slavery.
[01:43:47.441 --> 01:43:50.583]  Again, it's like trying to communicate with people who have no vocabulary.
[01:43:50.583 --> 01:43:51.903]  I'm not talking about my general audience.
[01:43:51.903 --> 01:43:54.985]  I mean the morons out there.
[01:43:54.985 --> 01:44:01.269]  I'm seeing comments on the YouTube channel now going, clearly Alex took down the Obama deception and had it put back up.
[01:44:01.269 --> 01:44:06.351]  It's impossible for a user who runs an account to
[01:44:07.751 --> 01:44:10.154]  Take their video down and then put it back up.
[01:44:10.154 --> 01:44:11.897]  Do you understand that?
[01:44:11.897 --> 01:44:14.040]  Anyone who runs a YouTube channel knows that.
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:20.789]  If you delete a video, and that's what the hack was, somebody went in, said they were the user, deleted it, wasn't even my account, it was someone else's.
[01:44:20.789 --> 01:44:23.092]  You go in and do that, you cannot restore it.
[01:44:24.514 --> 01:44:27.335]  By the way, I talked to Kenneth Webb earlier that runs that channel.
[01:44:27.335 --> 01:44:31.416]  He said that videos he had removed years ago by them were suddenly restored.
[01:44:31.416 --> 01:44:35.437]  They have lied and said they can't restore videos that are hacked and taken down.
[01:44:35.437 --> 01:44:37.798]  Videos that were taken down of his years ago!
[01:44:37.798 --> 01:44:41.319]  Everything's been restored!
[01:44:41.319 --> 01:44:44.920]  And that points towards somebody inside there doing something they weren't supposed to.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.901]  I'm not saying Google and their parent company
[01:44:48.444 --> 01:44:52.065]  I'm not saying YouTube and their parent company, Google, gave the orders to do this.
[01:44:52.065 --> 01:44:58.307]  I'm saying there's no way somebody figured out that passcode on their own out there, and this was a mainline hack.
[01:44:58.307 --> 01:45:02.088]  I believe it's an inside job, as most crimes are, and it is a federal crime.
[01:45:02.088 --> 01:45:05.910]  And I believe that all the evidence points towards it being an insider.
[01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:16.313]  And I've never seen Google put something back up again, except when a record company got involved, and something had over 200 million views, and somebody else put up another video in its place.
[01:45:18.166 --> 01:45:19.607]  There's been one case we know of.
[01:45:19.607 --> 01:45:22.929]  This is the first time a political video has been put back up.
[01:45:22.929 --> 01:45:23.810]  The Obama deception.
[01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:26.812]  I mean, this is so huge.
[01:45:26.812 --> 01:45:27.252]  Okay?
[01:45:27.252 --> 01:45:28.073]  You understand?
[01:45:28.073 --> 01:45:30.755]  I physically can't put it back up.
[01:45:30.755 --> 01:45:33.177]  I can re-upload it.
[01:45:33.177 --> 01:45:36.399]  I could re-upload it if he gives me the codes.
[01:45:36.399 --> 01:45:38.000]  But it's not the same video.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.643]  It will show up with zero views when it first goes up.
[01:45:41.643 --> 01:45:43.944]  They restored the video that had 6,500,000 hits on it.
[01:45:48.137 --> 01:45:49.118]  They restored it.
[01:45:49.118 --> 01:45:51.421]  That's the one that's linked all over the web.
[01:45:51.421 --> 01:45:52.923]  That's the one that has the value.
[01:45:52.923 --> 01:45:56.428]  That's the one when you type in Obama's name that was the top link.
[01:45:56.428 --> 01:45:59.712]  Why in the world would I take my own video down?
[01:46:00.731 --> 01:46:02.352]  When they've never restored one!
[01:46:02.352 --> 01:46:04.973]  This is history making!
[01:46:04.973 --> 01:46:05.794]  Doesn't matter, though.
[01:46:05.794 --> 01:46:08.035]  I physically cannot put it back up.
[01:46:08.035 --> 01:46:10.857]  Only Google can do this, and they've always said they couldn't.
[01:46:10.857 --> 01:46:11.797]  They did it.
[01:46:11.797 --> 01:46:12.538]  They did it.
[01:46:12.538 --> 01:46:17.921]  And I believe it's because they went and did an IP search like I demanded, and they found out one of their own stinkers did it.
[01:46:17.921 --> 01:46:19.942]  Because they do have the passcodes at YouTube.
[01:46:21.721 --> 01:46:24.442]  YouTube has the passcodes to YouTube.
[01:46:24.442 --> 01:46:25.583]  Comprende?
[01:46:25.583 --> 01:46:30.626]  If the police were doing an investigation of this, that's the first place they'd go in 101 criminology.
[01:46:30.626 --> 01:46:32.647]  It's not like I'm pulling rabbits out of my hat here.
[01:46:32.647 --> 01:46:34.908]  It's not like I'm sitting here speculating.
[01:46:34.908 --> 01:46:35.789]  I study this stuff.
[01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:36.469]  It's what I do.
[01:46:36.469 --> 01:46:44.353]  All right, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:44.353 --> 01:46:45.073]  Let me continue with the news.
[01:46:45.073 --> 01:46:47.755]  Let me continue with the news.
[01:46:55.250 --> 01:47:04.576]  When you make a film and you love it, and it's like a child, it's like an oil painting that you spent months on, and then somebody takes it and tears it up and burns it.
[01:47:04.576 --> 01:47:05.636]  It makes you mad.
[01:47:05.636 --> 01:47:06.657]  It makes you angry.
[01:47:06.657 --> 01:47:09.618]  But this wasn't just some painting that people had viewed and loved.
[01:47:09.618 --> 01:47:11.980]  This is something that woke up millions of people.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.941]  That's precious to me.
[01:47:13.941 --> 01:47:17.583]  I don't care about diamonds and crap and status.
[01:47:17.583 --> 01:47:19.584]  I care about people's minds.
[01:47:19.584 --> 01:47:20.825]  I want to unlock minds.
[01:47:20.825 --> 01:47:22.686]  That's what's valuable to me.
[01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:23.747]  This was like somebody
[01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:28.952]  Burning down my house.
[01:47:28.952 --> 01:47:30.772]  Because what I love is waking people up.
[01:47:30.772 --> 01:47:31.912]  That's the equivalent of a house.
[01:47:31.912 --> 01:47:33.853]  It's like burning down a family home.
[01:47:33.853 --> 01:47:37.714]  It's like burning down a house I grew up in.
[01:47:37.714 --> 01:47:40.094]  I became physically ill and almost vomited.
[01:47:40.094 --> 01:47:41.515]  My wife's like, what's wrong?
[01:47:41.515 --> 01:47:42.395]  I was sitting in a chair.
[01:47:42.395 --> 01:47:47.356]  I became nauseous Saturday when I got the news, when Matt Ryan called me.
[01:47:47.356 --> 01:47:53.658]  I went and pulled it up and saw it was gone, and I became nauseous.
[01:47:53.658 --> 01:47:54.638]  I almost threw up.
[01:47:57.554 --> 01:47:59.376]  Because that film is going more viral.
[01:47:59.376 --> 01:48:01.618]  It's going to unlock millions of more minds.
[01:48:01.618 --> 01:48:05.342]  God blessed me with the skill to be able to transmit the truth.
[01:48:05.342 --> 01:48:10.608]  God blessed me with the energy to make that film and to have a platform that was able to reach people.
[01:48:10.608 --> 01:48:12.710]  It's precious.
[01:48:12.710 --> 01:48:16.635]  It's precious to me to be able to stand in front of a sports stadium of 100,000 people.
[01:48:16.635 --> 01:48:18.316]  All those people.
[01:48:18.316 --> 01:48:19.458]  And to be able to address them.
[01:48:20.762 --> 01:48:29.445]  With this one version of the film, I addressed more than 65 sports stadiums with 100,000 people per stadium.
[01:48:29.445 --> 01:48:33.747]  65 sports stadiums with 100,000 people in each one.
[01:48:33.747 --> 01:48:38.268]  I addressed them for two hours with that film.
[01:48:38.268 --> 01:48:43.310]  And I'm going to address tens of millions more, hundreds of more sports stadiums full of people.
[01:48:47.105 --> 01:48:49.286]  I value what's valuable.
[01:48:49.286 --> 01:48:50.306]  We don't have a future.
[01:48:50.306 --> 01:48:52.487]  I'm dead if we don't win this thing.
[01:48:52.487 --> 01:48:54.487]  I passed the point of no return a long time ago.
[01:48:54.487 --> 01:48:56.868]  The globalists want to smash me flat in a pancake.
[01:48:56.868 --> 01:48:57.908]  I can't quit.
[01:48:57.908 --> 01:48:59.489]  I can't fade off into the sunset.
[01:48:59.489 --> 01:49:00.569]  They'll come after me.
[01:49:00.569 --> 01:49:01.670]  I've studied history.
[01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:08.732]  Just like they told Jim Garrison, you've got to stay in the spotlight for the rest of your life, boy, with the Kennedy assassination.
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:09.972]  I'm in this bear trap.
[01:49:09.972 --> 01:49:11.093]  There's no getting out of it.
[01:49:11.093 --> 01:49:11.933]  I've got to go through it.
[01:49:19.861 --> 01:49:24.382]  And I believe the Globalists are going to counter-strike.
[01:49:24.382 --> 01:49:26.003]  I don't believe they're going to give up on this.
[01:49:26.003 --> 01:49:29.563]  They don't like to lose.
[01:49:29.563 --> 01:49:32.824]  And I would predict they're going to come after us really bad now.
[01:49:32.824 --> 01:49:35.145]  I told the guys that last night at dinner.
[01:49:35.145 --> 01:49:39.686]  After the show, I took them to dinner.
[01:49:39.686 --> 01:49:42.707]  It's like standing at the edge of a high dive.
[01:49:42.707 --> 01:49:46.628]  First time you jump off one when you're 8 years old and it's 40 feet down, it's scary.
[01:49:47.659 --> 01:49:53.789]  But as soon as you jump, you feel your stomach, you know, come up in you.
[01:49:53.789 --> 01:49:56.273]  You're falling and pretty soon you hit the water.
[01:49:56.273 --> 01:49:58.296]  I jumped off that high dive a long time ago, folks.
[01:49:58.296 --> 01:49:59.258]  I'm not going back up.
[01:49:59.258 --> 01:49:59.919]  I'm going down.
[01:50:03.148 --> 01:50:04.248]  But we're all going down.
[01:50:04.248 --> 01:50:05.309]  We're all going to die.
[01:50:05.309 --> 01:50:06.389]  We're all going to grow old.
[01:50:06.389 --> 01:50:14.331]  We're all going to end up with wires crammed up our nose at some hospital or in a big car wreck smashed all tied up inside the vehicle with blood spilling out of us.
[01:50:14.331 --> 01:50:17.731]  So why in the world would we not have courage to stand up against tyranny?
[01:50:17.731 --> 01:50:19.892]  None of you are getting out of this alive.
[01:50:19.892 --> 01:50:26.393]  And it's the fact that people are cowardly and weak and scared of what their neighbors are going to think of them and they can't get outside these comfort zone bubbles.
[01:50:26.393 --> 01:50:32.655]  It's the mere fact that we have this weak loser attitude that's allowed a bunch of scum to come in and take over our society.
[01:50:33.095 --> 01:50:38.158]  And boss us around and try to control us.
[01:50:38.158 --> 01:50:39.118]  So I know this.
[01:50:39.118 --> 01:50:41.759]  I'm not getting in any ditch and licking boots.
[01:50:41.759 --> 01:50:43.460]  I'm not going to die on my knees.
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:45.601]  I'm not going to die on my belly.
[01:50:45.601 --> 01:50:48.823]  I'm going to die on my feet.
[01:50:48.823 --> 01:50:52.364]  And I'm going to give the New World Order the biggest fight they've ever seen.
[01:50:52.364 --> 01:50:57.447]  And if you'll just commit and do the same thing, these enemies will vanish like specters at dawn.
[01:50:57.447 --> 01:50:58.427]  I'll be back.
[01:51:01.013 --> 01:51:02.794]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:51:02.794 --> 01:51:04.135]  How would that make you feel?
[01:51:04.135 --> 01:51:05.856]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:51:05.856 --> 01:51:08.397]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:51:08.397 --> 01:51:15.961]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:51:15.961 --> 01:51:17.462]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:51:17.462 --> 01:51:20.203]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:51:20.203 --> 01:51:25.506]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:51:25.506 --> 01:51:30.549]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:51:30.729 --> 01:51:35.831]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:49.731]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:49.731 --> 01:51:54.694]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:54.694 --> 01:51:55.915]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:09.565 --> 01:52:12.747]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:12.747 --> 01:52:18.331]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:23.555]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.555 --> 01:52:30.680]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.521]  And here's the best part.

[01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:48.452]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.452 --> 01:52:50.193]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:13.222 --> 01:54:15.904]  is world's biggest energy consumer.
[01:54:15.904 --> 01:54:20.346]  Well, yeah, we build, what, three or four new coal plants a year.
[01:54:20.346 --> 01:54:23.547]  They build, what, three or four a week.
[01:54:23.547 --> 01:54:29.711]  In fact, pull up average number of Chinese coal plants built per week, and I believe it's four.
[01:54:29.711 --> 01:54:32.152]  But I want to show people I'm not just making this stuff up.
[01:54:33.311 --> 01:54:35.693]  It's three or four a week, we build four a year.
[01:54:35.693 --> 01:54:36.533]  We're not allowed to.
[01:54:36.533 --> 01:54:37.394]  They harass everybody.
[01:54:37.394 --> 01:54:38.995]  They're shutting down our refineries.
[01:54:38.995 --> 01:54:42.478]  The carbon tax is an economic siege.
[01:54:42.478 --> 01:54:44.019]  It is high treason.
[01:54:44.019 --> 01:54:48.802]  And it's taxes paid to the same bloodthirsty, parasitic banks.
[01:54:48.802 --> 01:54:50.143]  That's the Wall Street Journal.
[01:54:50.143 --> 01:54:53.385]  Of course they passed us as the number one manufacturer this year.
[01:54:53.385 --> 01:54:56.368]  Of course they passed us as the biggest owner of our debt.
[01:54:56.368 --> 01:54:59.850]  We're not allowed to have industry with all the taxes and regulations.
[01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:01.992]  Of course they're the biggest energy consumer.
[01:55:03.055 --> 01:55:05.256]  Makes me sick!
[01:55:05.256 --> 01:55:06.597]  China building more power plants.
[01:55:06.597 --> 01:55:09.318]  China's now building about two power stations every week.
[01:55:09.318 --> 01:55:10.519]  The number I've seen is three to four.
[01:55:10.519 --> 01:55:11.819]  That's BBC.
[01:55:11.819 --> 01:55:13.320]  Oh, but that's from three years ago.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.981]  Yes, no, in 2010, it's now four a week.
[01:55:15.981 --> 01:55:17.722]  Revise the search, men.
[01:55:17.722 --> 01:55:20.623]  The point is, we get four a year, they get two a week.
[01:55:20.623 --> 01:55:23.245]  The number I've seen is four.
[01:55:23.245 --> 01:55:24.805]  The jobless effect.
[01:55:24.805 --> 01:55:26.506]  Is the real unemployment rate 16.5 or 22 or even higher?
[01:55:32.577 --> 01:55:37.621]  And it goes on to say that the number could be even higher than 22.
[01:55:37.621 --> 01:55:38.822]  That's the Daily Finance.
[01:55:38.822 --> 01:55:40.963]  Truth's coming out.
[01:55:40.963 --> 01:55:42.604]  Great article here by Activist Post.
[01:55:42.604 --> 01:55:46.027]  Ten ways the banks are robbing you, the way they're fleecing you.
[01:55:46.027 --> 01:55:55.394]  Predatory lending, bailouts, TARP, credit cards, stock market, pensions they're robbing, Social Security, raising the age, inflation, commodity prices, debt and deficits, wars.
[01:55:58.288 --> 01:56:05.030]  Here's CNBC, Dow may crash to 7,500 if 10,600 not breached.
[01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:09.412]  And they go on to say, looking at the 1930s depression chart, that we're mirroring the depression.
[01:56:09.412 --> 01:56:15.053]  This is giving you the idea that the market is natural and, oh, we better boost it or we're gonna be in a depression.
[01:56:15.053 --> 01:56:16.934]  It's all rigged!
[01:56:16.934 --> 01:56:18.975]  Hell, even Rattigan admits that.
[01:56:18.975 --> 01:56:22.936]  You can search the term Rattigan, MSNBC, stock market rigged.
[01:56:22.936 --> 01:56:25.077]  Of course it's rigged!
[01:56:25.077 --> 01:56:25.877]  It's a casino!
[01:56:27.315 --> 01:56:28.976]  Look at this Wall Street Journal article.
[01:56:28.976 --> 01:56:30.036]  Roads to ruin.
[01:56:30.036 --> 01:56:32.898]  Towns rip up the pavement.
[01:56:32.898 --> 01:56:38.481]  All over the country, they're getting rid of the pavement, getting rid of the asphalt, and going back to dirt roads.
[01:56:38.481 --> 01:56:40.802]  They're announcing all over the country, they're slashing police.
[01:56:40.802 --> 01:56:42.343]  But the taxes go up.
[01:56:42.343 --> 01:56:45.405]  All your money goes to the stinking bankers like it does in Nigeria.
[01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:49.151]  You like to make fun of the Nigerians, the Argentines, and others?
[01:56:49.151 --> 01:56:50.992]  Well, you're gonna live like they did.
[01:56:50.992 --> 01:56:52.472]  There it is, MSNBC, Radigan.
[01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:55.033]  Stock market, obviously corrupt, a fraud.
[01:56:55.033 --> 01:56:55.934]  You know, there's the raw story.
[01:56:55.934 --> 01:56:58.915]  He actually said it was rigged, but, you know.
[01:56:58.915 --> 01:57:02.416]  That's why I love having that crew in there, and they Google everything I say, and you'll just see it right there.
[01:57:02.416 --> 01:57:03.477]  Not making any of this up!
[01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:07.732]  Ireland's credit rating downgraded by Moody's.
[01:57:07.732 --> 01:57:09.313]  Irish Times.
[01:57:09.313 --> 01:57:12.274]  Same rating agency that works for the big bankers.
[01:57:12.274 --> 01:57:15.656]  Meanwhile, the Chinese have downgraded the dollar and our T-bills.
[01:57:15.656 --> 01:57:17.337]  You know what that means?
[01:57:17.337 --> 01:57:18.658]  More interest to these slugs.
[01:57:21.394 --> 01:57:22.795]  Look at this Bloomberg article.
[01:57:22.795 --> 01:57:27.259]  The new Prime Minister raids dormant UK accounts as Minister attacks banks.
[01:57:27.259 --> 01:57:27.639]  What's next?
[01:57:27.639 --> 01:57:30.181]  They'll throw you in prison for six months and raid your account?
[01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:36.226]  They're already raiding Social Security, uh, excuse me, safety deposit boxes in San Francisco and taking people's money.
[01:57:36.226 --> 01:57:38.408]  Just all the government needs money, we're just gonna take it.
[01:57:38.408 --> 01:57:46.695]  UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to use hundreds of millions of pounds from dormant bank accounts to fund community projects, while Business Secretary Vince Cable
[01:57:47.395 --> 01:57:53.257]  That means everything's going to this private government, this privatization where it's groups of private thugs with government power.
[01:57:53.257 --> 01:57:54.537]  The opposite of free market.
[01:58:13.089 --> 01:58:16.912]  Obama says to the GOP, restore jobless benefits.
[01:58:16.912 --> 01:58:20.115]  Yeah, people are dependent on that, but a lot of people are milking it.
[01:58:20.115 --> 01:58:21.356]  But some people aren't.
[01:58:21.356 --> 01:58:23.478]  Some people can't find jobs, but then others are milking it.
[01:58:23.478 --> 01:58:32.446]  I mean, if you've had some $100,000 a year job, and you lose your job, you shouldn't be able to get it, and it shouldn't be so high.
[01:58:32.446 --> 01:58:36.149]  We're just going to go bankrupt, though, and none of you are going to get any of it soon.
[01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:39.231]  You understand we're killing the goose that lays the golden eggies?
[01:58:42.708 --> 01:58:45.332]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:54.622 --> 01:59:01.043]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.043 --> 01:59:08.424]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:08.424 --> 01:59:13.285]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:59:55.861 --> 01:59:58.644]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.407 --> 02:00:10.253]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.253 --> 02:00:11.855]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.855 --> 02:00:13.397]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.397 --> 02:00:17.603]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.603 --> 02:00:21.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.235 --> 02:00:26.358]  We are now into hour number three.
[02:00:26.358 --> 02:00:28.600]  Max Keiser coming up in this next segment.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.442]  I'm going to take a few of your phone calls.
[02:00:30.442 --> 02:00:32.405]  I'll continue to blitz through key news.
[02:00:32.405 --> 02:00:35.589]  Haven't gotten to even a third of it yet in this hour.
[02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:39.293]  I'll just throw out articles every time we come on a break before we go back to Keiser.
[02:00:39.293 --> 02:00:42.036]  Freeman in Washington, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:00:42.757 --> 02:00:43.938]  Hey, God bless you, Alex.
[02:00:43.938 --> 02:00:45.538]  It's been worth the wait.
[02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:55.483]  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I've got a duplicator on the way from New York City, and I've got three stacks of Virgin DVDs here.
[02:00:55.483 --> 02:01:04.367]  I'm going to dupe the Obama deception and stuff it into sleeves with a little Infowars.com stamp on it and stuff it in all my neighbors' mailboxes.
[02:01:04.367 --> 02:01:06.488]  I just thought of a pun.
[02:01:06.488 --> 02:01:10.010]  We're going to undupe the dupes with the dupes.
[02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:14.131]  Right on, bro.
[02:01:14.131 --> 02:01:15.652]  Anyway, I love Austin, Texas.
[02:01:15.652 --> 02:01:20.857]  I haven't been there in about 25 years, but everybody was really nice down there.
[02:01:20.857 --> 02:01:23.039]  I used to be a musician until I messed up my left arm.
[02:01:23.039 --> 02:01:25.100]  Anyway, I still play music.
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:31.226]  Anyway, I just wanted to ask, like, why hasn't anybody arrested this Obama puke yet, you know?
[02:01:31.226 --> 02:01:37.491]  I mean, it's like he's already using a false social security number, so I mean, like, isn't that, like, identity theft right there?
[02:01:38.832 --> 02:01:47.878]  Obama is terrible and a globalist and a teleprompter reading lawyer, but he himself is just a puppet and is in free fall now, so they'll bring a new puppet in.
[02:01:47.878 --> 02:01:54.162]  You know, why haven't we arrested the heads of the major banks that openly sold the derivatives knowing it was fraud?
[02:01:54.162 --> 02:01:59.285]  And why did the federal government just say, oh, you didn't engage in any fraud last week and let Goldman Sachs off?
[02:01:59.285 --> 02:02:01.247]  You know, that's the bigger issue.
[02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:06.350]  I mean, Obama is just a birdcage dropping compared to the bird that's the New World Order.
[02:02:07.213 --> 02:02:17.383]  Yeah, but you know, it's like, all those executive orders he's signed since the, uh, since the, uh, phony inauguration, I mean, like, all of that would go away if we could just, you know, like...
[02:02:18.115 --> 02:02:26.240]  He does need to be impeached, Freeman.
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:28.041]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:30.902]  Look, clearly he was born in Kenya and they're covering it up.
[02:02:30.902 --> 02:02:32.423]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:02:32.423 --> 02:02:37.025]  But what we know 100% is he gave up his citizenship to be an Indonesian citizen.
[02:02:37.025 --> 02:02:38.586]  That is on record.
[02:02:38.586 --> 02:02:40.107]  And right there, he's illegitimate.
[02:02:40.107 --> 02:02:40.848]  So, done.
[02:02:40.848 --> 02:02:41.708]  Case closed.
[02:02:41.708 --> 02:02:42.749]  Right there.
[02:02:42.749 --> 02:02:44.069]  Let's talk to Paul in New Hampshire.
[02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.830]  Paul, you're on the air.
[02:02:45.914 --> 02:02:47.975]  Alex, I feel like you're my brother.
[02:02:47.975 --> 02:02:49.196]  You are my brother, my friend.
[02:02:49.196 --> 02:02:49.936]  We love liberty.
[02:02:49.936 --> 02:02:52.057]  That's right.
[02:02:52.057 --> 02:02:58.440]  From the home of the highest property taxes in the United States, I've been following you now for about a year.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.721]  I haven't had the internet for a while anyway.
[02:03:00.721 --> 02:03:10.306]  What I wanted to get to was, I really liked Clint Eastwood movies for a long time, and the Josie Wills movie goes into the corruption that was started back during the Civil War.
[02:03:11.289 --> 02:03:14.991]  I really kind of like the way that they put that across, you know, you get an idea.
[02:03:14.991 --> 02:03:22.415]  You know, that's what happened for five years or more during Reconstruction, just bands of criminals ran around murdering people en masse.
[02:03:22.415 --> 02:03:31.720]  We have family cemeteries with tombstones, with people, and it says on the tombstone, you know, killed by Northern troops after the war.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.262]  Raping, murdering, killing, it was just so enjoyable.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:35.741]  Right.
[02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:42.566]  Well, my main concern is where in heck are the white hats in the United States?
[02:03:42.566 --> 02:03:54.116]  I mean, for a long time before I came involved with you, I was looking for the senator or somebody to come up in the middle of front of TV, palm of his fist, saying four-letter words on the television.
[02:03:54.116 --> 02:03:54.976]  What is going on?
[02:03:54.976 --> 02:03:56.157]  Why do we got to stop this?
[02:03:56.157 --> 02:03:57.438]  This is what we're going to do.
[02:03:57.438 --> 02:04:00.100]  You know, somebody to stand up and be the leader.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:01.682]  And I really appreciate what you do.
[02:04:02.242 --> 02:04:12.828]  And then I find myself thinking about the positive and negative of everything, the good and evil, and I thank God you have the Christian values that you expose every day.
[02:04:12.828 --> 02:04:22.334]  The fact that every little molecule of every atom of every molecule is a positive and negative pulling and tugging on each other, that good and evil is a positive and negative pulling on each other,
[02:04:22.674 --> 02:04:29.041]  This whole world is made up of a positive and negative and for the life of me, I can't believe that this has gone on this long.
[02:04:29.041 --> 02:04:33.886]  And we've got to learn to recognize evil and stand up against it or it will take over.
[02:04:33.886 --> 02:04:35.588]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[02:04:35.588 --> 02:04:38.271]  Al, Joe, BJ, many others, your calls are coming up.
[02:04:38.271 --> 02:04:43.896]  Max Keiser on the economy and a lot more straight ahead with his once a month visit with us.
[02:04:45.131 --> 02:04:56.057]  We're searching the term today, Google Spies, so it'll lead them to an article that has the re-uploaded Obama deception, there for everybody, and the history of Google spying.
[02:04:56.057 --> 02:04:56.678]  It's key.
[02:04:56.678 --> 02:04:58.579]  Google the term, Google Spies, today.

[02:07:00.256 --> 02:07:05.219]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.219 --> 02:07:06.220]  What have we got?
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:08.661]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.661 --> 02:07:09.682]  A republic.
[02:07:09.682 --> 02:07:12.324]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.324 --> 02:07:14.585]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.585 --> 02:07:16.606]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.606 --> 02:07:18.287]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:18.287 --> 02:07:19.608]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:19.608 --> 02:07:20.208]  Children?
[02:07:20.208 --> 02:07:21.329]  Our education?
[02:07:21.329 --> 02:07:22.170]  Our money?
[02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:25.812]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.192 --> 02:07:31.159]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:31.159 --> 02:07:32.180]  We have the facts.
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:33.342]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:33.342 --> 02:07:34.243]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.243 --> 02:07:35.144]  We have common law.
[02:07:35.144 --> 02:07:37.668]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:10.845]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.845 --> 02:08:14.468]  Max Keiser joining us from Paris is our guest, MaxKeiser.com.
[02:08:14.468 --> 02:08:19.050]  He's hosted BBC TV shows, RT shows, press TV programs.
[02:08:19.050 --> 02:08:23.593]  He has an RT and press TV show right now, a show on Genesis Saturdays.
[02:08:23.593 --> 02:08:27.636]  And of course he's the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange system, much of that technology used today.
[02:08:28.596 --> 02:08:32.604]  He was working in and around the Twin Towers on 9-11, has helped expose that.
[02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:34.227]  And I said, what do you want to talk about, Max?
[02:08:34.227 --> 02:08:35.148]  And he said, I want to talk about...
[02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:38.770]  A hidden world growing beyond control.
[02:08:38.770 --> 02:08:44.395]  Close to a million NSA and CIA private operatives now.
[02:08:44.395 --> 02:08:44.415]  854,000.
[02:08:44.415 --> 02:08:49.018]  And the Washington Post itself, a spook factory.
[02:08:49.018 --> 02:08:53.722]  A month ago they admitted that the CIA created fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:08:53.722 --> 02:08:55.043]  We told you those were fake years ago.
[02:08:55.043 --> 02:08:57.425]  But now they just throw it in your face.
[02:08:57.425 --> 02:08:59.146]  A hidden world growing beyond control.
[02:08:59.146 --> 02:09:01.989]  And who's a big part of the national security clearances?
[02:09:01.989 --> 02:09:02.509]  Google.
[02:09:02.509 --> 02:09:02.910]  YouTube.
[02:09:03.650 --> 02:09:05.171]  They are the NSA.
[02:09:05.171 --> 02:09:06.712]  And that's all in this article.
[02:09:06.712 --> 02:09:15.758]  And I want to get into Goldman Sachs being slapped on the wrist, the Federal Reserve being given more power over our economy, with the passage of the financial overhaul last week with Max.
[02:09:15.758 --> 02:09:17.899]  But Max wanted to talk about the Obama deception first.
[02:09:17.899 --> 02:09:20.161]  He said, this is big news.
[02:09:20.161 --> 02:09:27.666]  And literally now, I said 20, it's now hundreds of newspapers and blogs, big ones, are reporting on the censorship of the Obama deception.
[02:09:27.666 --> 02:09:28.786]  And this is the first time ever.
[02:09:28.786 --> 02:09:31.588]  It happened with one music video before that had over 200 million views.
[02:09:31.588 --> 02:09:31.908]  This one, 6.5.
[02:09:33.447 --> 02:09:36.049]  We're good to go.
[02:09:43.752 --> 02:09:53.876]  They didn't just restore the director channel video, they restored every video that Kenneth Webb had ever deleted himself, or any video that had been removed for terms of use.
[02:09:53.876 --> 02:10:03.019]  His whole account, going back five years, he's had one over five years, he's got a director's account, a founder account, it's even more than a director account, he's one of the first people on YouTube.
[02:10:03.979 --> 02:10:05.541]  Because, you know, we don't have a director account.
[02:10:05.541 --> 02:10:08.125]  Somebody gave us one, YouTube wouldn't let us have it last year.
[02:10:08.125 --> 02:10:12.351]  So this fellow, you know, this great guy, he uploaded it.
[02:10:12.351 --> 02:10:16.997]  There's thousands of other versions on YouTube and Google, but they're broken up in 10-minute pieces.
[02:10:16.997 --> 02:10:18.740]  A million here, 800,000 there, half a million here, 400,000 there.
[02:10:21.383 --> 02:10:24.506]  This one, though, is the top link when you search the name Obama.
[02:10:24.506 --> 02:10:28.169]  Not just the top in the trends, with my listeners putting that in, to make it the top of Google Trends.
[02:10:28.169 --> 02:10:28.689]  No, no.
[02:10:28.689 --> 02:10:34.574]  It was on its own the number one thing in the world when you said President Obama, Barack Obama, or Obama.
[02:10:35.703 --> 02:10:40.405]  It knocked us out of the top searches when they did this, but today when they put it back up, it's already number five.
[02:10:40.405 --> 02:10:43.146]  When you'd say Barack Obama, President Obama, or Obama.
[02:10:43.146 --> 02:10:45.868]  And you bet, it's gonna be number one the next week.
[02:10:45.868 --> 02:10:47.008]  I predict.
[02:10:47.008 --> 02:10:54.832]  You go in there, you click on it in the search engine, put Obama deception in, you see the link to the full length video, you click on that, drive it to number one.
[02:10:54.832 --> 02:10:58.434]  Max, I mean, this is crazy that this is going on.
[02:10:58.434 --> 02:10:59.174]  What's your take on it?
[02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:03.471]  Okay, well, Washington Post just came out with their big report.
[02:11:03.471 --> 02:11:05.773]  They spent two years with this report.
[02:11:05.773 --> 02:11:08.355]  They've got a website called Top Secret America.
[02:11:09.539 --> 02:11:26.212]  850,000 people in America are on the highest clearance for secrecy, and they cobbled together all the companies that are working together to create what they call a fourth branch of government, the top secret branch, and prominent on the list is Google.
[02:11:26.212 --> 02:11:31.896]  You know, Google is prominent in top secret America, so I'm not surprised with the Obama deception.
[02:11:32.496 --> 02:11:42.683]  And the key here is that the military-industrial complex that people used to talk about is given away purely to the information-industrial complex.
[02:11:42.683 --> 02:11:58.193]  And so obviously, InfoWars, you correctly predicted this years ago, that information would be the battleground, and you're fighting the InfoWars, and you've been fighting, really, against this clandestine, multi-hundred-billion-dollar
[02:11:58.713 --> 02:12:00.915]  We're good to go.
[02:12:14.705 --> 02:12:15.006]  I don't know.
[02:12:32.731 --> 02:12:37.215]  Well, I have to tell you, Max, my sixth sense, my spidey sense is off the charts.
[02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:43.101]  This is not fun, getting this much attention, but I've set out to mobilize the people to defeat these globalists.
[02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:51.348]  And what you hit on, and what the Washington Post admits in this top-secret America two-year report, this is them coming out in the open.
[02:12:51.348 --> 02:12:53.911]  The Washington Post is the top Bilderberg Group paper.
[02:12:53.911 --> 02:12:56.653]  The Grams have been attending for 50-plus years, the owners.
[02:12:57.674 --> 02:12:58.034]  I don't know.
[02:13:13.325 --> 02:13:13.465]  I don't
[02:13:33.729 --> 02:13:33.809]  The
[02:13:48.977 --> 02:14:01.446]  They're merging the four branches of the military with Google, with YouTube, with Yahoo, with Oracle, with a handful of others, and they all admit they're going to take the web over, block everybody else, they'll get all the business.
[02:14:01.446 --> 02:14:08.911]  There's a revolving door between government and these corporations, so the people in government will then get jobs with them and then go back into government and around and around.
[02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:17.237]  And this is a total global corporate coup over everything, with 800 plus thousand private corporate spies, part of InfraGard,
[02:14:17.617 --> 02:14:24.423]  Where they are all government agents with license to kill powers, according to mainstream news two years ago, via InfraGard.
[02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:29.787]  They are being trained to literally kill employees if they ever try to save the country.
[02:14:29.787 --> 02:14:32.029]  I mean, this is hell world!
[02:14:32.029 --> 02:14:35.712]  This makes the Nazis look tame in organizational skill, Max.
[02:14:37.011 --> 02:14:50.038]  Well, I agree with you that major media, mainstream media, including the Washington Post, are totally compromised by what you call the globalists, what are now being referred to openly as top secret America.
[02:14:50.038 --> 02:14:54.680]  But I think that occasionally some truth manages to get through.
[02:14:55.607 --> 02:15:03.594]  And if it becomes a big enough problem, then move to position B, which of course is your false flag attack.
[02:15:03.594 --> 02:15:07.458]  In other words, I don't doubt the credibility of this report.
[02:15:07.458 --> 02:15:18.347]  What I think it came through, now at the 11th hour, apparently insiders at the paper and the media wanted to block this publication or wanted to find out more about what was in the publication.
[02:15:18.347 --> 02:15:20.349]  But now it's out, it's on the web, people are seeing it.
[02:15:20.349 --> 02:15:22.251]  So now I believe the timing
[02:15:22.851 --> 02:15:25.334]  I want you to elaborate, but I want to interject here.
[02:15:25.334 --> 02:15:27.577]  If one three hundredth of the nation
[02:15:36.397 --> 02:15:39.419]  And that's counting men, women, and children, so it's even higher.
[02:15:39.419 --> 02:15:58.234]  If 1 out of 300 is a top-secret spy, and they admittedly, for every top-secret spy, they probably have as many as 10 auxiliaries, I mean, you're talking about a Stasi-level number where probably 10% of the people in the country are now spies at one level or another.
[02:15:59.134 --> 02:16:03.617]  For this corporate takeover, I mean and and they're funding themselves with tax money.
[02:16:03.617 --> 02:16:14.105]  This is a takeover This is a criminal enterprise just like Goldman Sachs for 30 years put their people in every Management and regulatory position before they robbed the country.
[02:16:14.105 --> 02:16:20.689]  This has been a long-term strategic plan And of course they were profiting the whole time taking over the infrastructure while they did it.
[02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:21.790]  I mean this is diabolical
[02:16:22.992 --> 02:16:33.537]  Well, the idea of spying and spies, going back a few decades, it usually gets back to corporations seeking intelligence on other corporations.
[02:16:33.537 --> 02:16:47.364]  And this is really the CIA and these organizations that came out of World War II and a lot of the corporate work that was done in World War II transformed into this intelligent network of corporate espionage.
[02:16:47.364 --> 02:16:48.685]  And it's an unfair trade advantage?
[02:16:49.747 --> 02:17:04.388]  Yeah, but today, because of the economy collapsing, what we're seeing is something different, a little different, in that folks who want to run the global game are trying to come up with new ways to
[02:17:06.263 --> 02:17:07.084]  We're good.
[02:17:26.281 --> 02:17:28.984]  Or a Facebook, or these social networking sites.
[02:17:28.984 --> 02:17:35.010]  You know, this is a theme I've explored with you before on your show, that currency is being replaced with credits and debit.
[02:17:35.010 --> 02:17:41.918]  And if you go to AlexJonesInfoWars.com, you will find your online account filled with debit.
[02:17:41.918 --> 02:17:48.845]  But if you go to GoldmanSachsPropaganda.com, you find your online account filled with credit.
[02:17:49.446 --> 02:17:55.927]  And this is a new virtual currency that's coming online and it's already a multi-billion dollar industry.
[02:17:55.927 --> 02:18:03.309]  A company called Zynga, which makes the virtual currency for online games, is already a multi-billion dollar industry.
[02:18:03.309 --> 02:18:10.370]  People swapping their time for virtual credit and effectively working for 30 or 40 cents a day.
[02:18:10.370 --> 02:18:13.370]  And they're happy to do it because they think they're winning something.
[02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:16.711]  And it's the combination of these online social networks
[02:18:17.171 --> 02:18:25.716]  The banking system looking for a new form of virtual currency and the casino industry and all their technology to get people to gamble away their lives have come together.
[02:18:25.716 --> 02:18:27.557]  And so this is part of what we're seeing also.
[02:18:27.557 --> 02:18:35.622]  They need all this intelligence gathering in order to create this incredible new society of people who are basically just
[02:18:36.303 --> 02:18:40.908]  On the web, but only in ways that are approved by the Googles of the world.
[02:18:40.908 --> 02:18:41.388]  That's right.
[02:18:41.388 --> 02:18:42.189]  Now stop there.
[02:18:42.189 --> 02:18:44.832]  Stop there, because this is so key.
[02:18:44.832 --> 02:18:51.720]  If you read George Orwell's 1984, and of course he worked for British Intelligence at BBC and Black Ops, his character is Winston Smith.
[02:18:53.406 --> 02:18:56.929]  He said the public won't rise up because of the lottery.
[02:18:56.929 --> 02:19:12.001]  And he talks about how people believing they have a chance to win within that fake paradigm is why they would never rise up because they've been trained to only care about issues of little or no significance and fake pop icons that Big Brother produced and pornography.
[02:19:12.001 --> 02:19:15.324]  And that's because they understood psychology 50-something years ago when he wrote that in 48.
[02:19:16.505 --> 02:19:28.096]  Now, we see the high-tech version of this, where everything is about that chance to win, and, oh, I better not get out of the Federal Reserve System, because then I'll get none of my retirement, when you're not going to get it to begin with.
[02:19:28.829 --> 02:19:31.651]  Right, you lose all of your chances to win at the lottery.
[02:19:31.651 --> 02:19:35.354]  So dollar bills are replaced with virtual lottery tickets.
[02:19:35.354 --> 02:19:49.586]  And people will be happy to spend hours their entire lives clicking away online for more of these virtual lottery tickets in the hopes that someday they too will graduate to the higher level in the game.
[02:19:49.586 --> 02:19:52.388]  Stay there Max, this is so profound what you just talked about.
[02:19:54.298 --> 02:20:00.310]  They create a false reality of sports, movies, icons, fake credits, and you sell your soul for it.
[02:20:01.465 --> 02:20:10.270]  What started as an idea to provide power for a small hunting cabin has grown into a passion for creating an alternative energy source that's both affordable and reliable.
[02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:16.574]  At Wind Blue Power, our goal is to provide you with the best selection of parts and accessories to power your own ideas.

[02:20:30.803 --> 02:20:32.064]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:32.064 --> 02:20:36.607]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.607 --> 02:20:42.431]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.431 --> 02:20:46.073]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:46.073 --> 02:20:48.795]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.795 --> 02:20:53.858]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:53.858 --> 02:20:54.099]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:54.099 --> 02:20:55.500]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:01.043 --> 02:21:10.247]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:21:10.247 --> 02:21:13.808]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:21:13.808 --> 02:21:23.392]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:21:23.392 --> 02:21:28.654]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:21:28.954 --> 02:21:44.407]  Off The Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.

[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:08.983]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:22:08.983 --> 02:22:14.265]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[02:22:14.265 --> 02:22:27.631]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[02:22:28.571 --> 02:22:33.594]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[02:22:52.524 --> 02:22:53.724]  fallofamerica.net
[02:23:01.775 --> 02:23:05.519]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:23:05.519 --> 02:23:06.860]  Think again.
[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:14.509]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:23:14.509 --> 02:23:21.436]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:23:21.736 --> 02:23:30.299]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[02:23:30.299 --> 02:23:31.399]  Do what NOAA did.

[02:23:57.974 --> 02:23:59.916]  Your trusted advisor for clean air.
[02:24:04.124 --> 02:24:06.408]  Ladies and gentlemen, huge breaking news.
[02:24:06.408 --> 02:24:08.031]  Wal-Max Kaiser is with us.
[02:24:08.031 --> 02:24:09.393]  Huge breaking news.
[02:24:09.393 --> 02:24:17.526]  We're seeing a 21st century example of information war going on with the NSA, RUN, Google, and YouTube.
[02:24:19.204 --> 02:24:21.526]  It has been the number one video.
[02:24:21.526 --> 02:24:25.409]  This particular version was 6.5 million views, getting about 100,000 a day.
[02:24:25.409 --> 02:24:27.531]  They hacked into our account, they took it down.
[02:24:27.531 --> 02:24:29.352]  I've said I believe it's an inside job.
[02:24:29.352 --> 02:24:31.794]  We changed the passcodes again.
[02:24:31.794 --> 02:24:39.601]  They have now disabled it all over the web if it's embedded on somebody else's webpage of the articles we've written.
[02:24:39.601 --> 02:24:40.762]  And it says, disabled by user.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:45.080]  Disabled.
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.223]  It says it's been disabled that you have to go to YouTube to watch it.
[02:24:48.223 --> 02:24:50.184]  Now, go back to the other screen.
[02:24:50.184 --> 02:24:58.310]  When you go to YouTube, it says, renting on YouTube starts with YouTube account.
[02:24:58.310 --> 02:25:03.593]  It is $2.95 to rent it.
[02:25:03.593 --> 02:25:05.775]  Ladies and gentlemen, we give the film out for free!
[02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:12.614]  When they enable this, I've read the rules, they will go and erase all the other copies, claiming that we've agreed.
[02:25:12.614 --> 02:25:14.815]  This is sabotage.
[02:25:14.815 --> 02:25:27.444]  This is happening live, time, it is going mega viral on the web, the Obama deception, and our story Google Spies, and so now they're making you pay money to them for my film.
[02:25:28.576 --> 02:25:33.341]  My film, and they are one of... I told you I had a feeling they were going to strike back.
[02:25:33.341 --> 02:25:36.523]  I knew there was something chicanery going on here.
[02:25:36.523 --> 02:25:39.146]  Google never, when they bring a video down, put it back up.
[02:25:39.146 --> 02:25:41.288]  This is unprecedented.
[02:25:41.288 --> 02:25:47.333]  Max Keiser, Max Keiser, this is exactly what you're talking about, how they use everybody's content and make you pay for it.
[02:25:47.333 --> 02:25:49.395]  This is insane, Max.
[02:25:49.395 --> 02:25:51.758]  Now... You own the copyright, right?
[02:25:52.594 --> 02:25:53.715]  Yes!
[02:25:53.715 --> 02:25:55.876]  Okay, so they're violating copyright law.
[02:25:55.876 --> 02:25:57.337]  They should take them to court immediately.
[02:25:57.337 --> 02:26:04.102]  Well, these are people that say they own every book in the world and they're going to publish it now online and charge and give no one money.
[02:26:04.102 --> 02:26:05.283]  Because it's the government.
[02:26:05.283 --> 02:26:06.223]  They know.
[02:26:06.223 --> 02:26:07.925]  Other corporations don't get away with this.
[02:26:07.925 --> 02:26:10.546]  There's a reason they let YouTube and Google be the biggest.
[02:26:10.546 --> 02:26:13.028]  And again, we're on there because that's where the fight's happening.
[02:26:13.028 --> 02:26:14.890]  I can't believe this!
[02:26:14.890 --> 02:26:20.153]  Alright, go to, if you do, search Video Game CEO Chairs Digital Tyranny.
[02:26:20.153 --> 02:26:21.154]  Let me read you this little
[02:26:21.604 --> 02:26:22.685]  We're good to go.
[02:26:39.313 --> 02:26:51.905]  Because, similar to our Federal Reserve note, the objects obtained from these games are made out of thin air, but without any need for physical resources to create them, there's no scarcity of reward to be handed out.
[02:26:51.905 --> 02:27:00.514]  People pay real money, real defined as credit obtained from labor in the real world, for the chance to one-up their friends in what is ultimately just a game.
[02:27:01.074 --> 02:27:13.885]  Now, as the games are just the beginning, the future, the outlines will bring the structure of these games into the real world where our lives will be controlled by a similar point system to replace our currency.
[02:27:13.885 --> 02:27:16.748]  He speaks of the potential for a government awarding credits.
[02:27:17.324 --> 02:27:19.206]  Through YouTube and through Google.
[02:27:19.206 --> 02:27:25.192]  To people who walk to work, take public transportation, they brush their teeth.
[02:27:25.192 --> 02:27:29.756]  So it's total social control through the web and then it's a controlled web.
[02:27:29.756 --> 02:27:31.538]  You talked about this five years ago.
[02:27:31.538 --> 02:27:33.460]  It's a casino gulag.
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:34.661]  It's a casino gulag.
[02:27:34.661 --> 02:27:41.508]  But can you believe that first they go in, clearly YouTube, they've got our account number, and now we change the passcode
[02:27:42.168 --> 02:27:43.729]  They're the only ones that have it.
[02:27:43.729 --> 02:27:45.269]  Nobody could hack it in this time.
[02:27:45.269 --> 02:27:55.973]  And they go in and disable all the millions of links around the web where other news websites and people have posted it, so it's going mega-viral, and their new sabotage is to make it a rental!
[02:27:55.973 --> 02:27:59.094]  I mean, my... I cannot believe this, man!
[02:27:59.094 --> 02:28:00.594]  Folks, do not pay for it.
[02:28:00.594 --> 02:28:02.275]  Do not give them a red stinking cent.
[02:28:02.275 --> 02:28:05.456]  It's still free, and a lot of other news websites and places.
[02:28:05.456 --> 02:28:08.697]  But send the links to ones that are working out to everyone you know.
[02:28:09.517 --> 02:28:11.558]  I tell you, Max, they are scared of this film.
[02:28:11.558 --> 02:28:13.780]  You're in Fall of the Republic Part 2 of the Obama Deception.
[02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:15.301]  I think it's even more important.
[02:28:15.301 --> 02:28:17.322]  But, I mean, you've seen the Obama Deception.
[02:28:17.322 --> 02:28:19.504]  Why do you think they're so scared of it?
[02:28:19.504 --> 02:28:24.447]  Well, first of all, change the name of Fall of the Republic to the Obama Deception Part 2.
[02:28:24.447 --> 02:28:25.668]  That'll totally screw up their head.
[02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:31.073]  Then they're going to have to go chase after another 10 million videos out there.
[02:28:31.073 --> 02:28:34.856]  In other words, information overload with information overload.
[02:28:34.856 --> 02:28:39.180]  You know, what is it about the word war, info war, that people don't understand?
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:40.180]  It's a war.
[02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:41.461]  It's an info war.
[02:28:41.461 --> 02:28:44.064]  So we've got to fight back with information.
[02:28:44.064 --> 02:28:47.226]  So just change everything to cause the Obama deception.
[02:28:47.226 --> 02:28:49.688]  Change your name on Facebook to the Obama deception.
[02:28:49.688 --> 02:28:52.611]  Change everything on your digital profile to the Obama deception.
[02:28:52.611 --> 02:28:54.412]  They can't kill at all.
[02:28:54.412 --> 02:28:55.393]  And they're panicking!
[02:28:56.694 --> 02:28:58.016]  And they're panicking right now.
[02:28:58.016 --> 02:29:00.079]  It's been the number one search term for three days.
[02:29:00.079 --> 02:29:03.643]  People keep varying it, like the Obama deception at InfoWars.
[02:29:03.643 --> 02:29:05.605]  The Obama deception censored.
[02:29:05.605 --> 02:29:08.809]  And they keep censoring that, but not before it hits number one.
[02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:10.151]  They are in panic mode.
[02:29:10.151 --> 02:29:14.616]  I think we're seeing a digital revolt right now, Max, if people go completely ape right now.
[02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:19.702]  Well, two years ago, remember, China and America had a digital war.
[02:29:19.702 --> 02:29:23.443]  They had a distributed denial-of-service attack that China hit the U.S.
[02:29:23.443 --> 02:29:24.484]  with, and then the U.S.
[02:29:24.484 --> 02:29:28.525]  hit with a downing of some kind of surveillance technology.
[02:29:28.525 --> 02:29:31.186]  So now you've become, effectively, your own country.
[02:29:31.186 --> 02:29:34.268]  Theinfowar.com has become as big as a country.
[02:29:35.128 --> 02:29:37.249]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:37.249 --> 02:29:39.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.489 --> 02:30:05.052]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.052 --> 02:30:05.952]  Number 1.
[02:30:05.952 --> 02:30:09.394]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.394 --> 02:30:10.254]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.254 --> 02:30:15.137]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.137 --> 02:30:15.878]  It's true.
[02:30:15.878 --> 02:30:20.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:21.581]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.581 --> 02:30:25.163]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.163 --> 02:30:28.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.065 --> 02:30:29.865]  Number four.
[02:30:29.865 --> 02:30:32.626]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.626 --> 02:30:36.308]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.308 --> 02:30:37.088]  Number five.
[02:30:37.088 --> 02:30:41.250]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.250 --> 02:30:46.292]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:42.256 --> 02:32:45.960]  Summer fun with food just doesn't get any better than this, folks.
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:46.761]  You need it.
[02:32:46.761 --> 02:32:47.622]  They've got it.
[02:32:47.622 --> 02:32:48.583]  Just get it.
[02:32:48.583 --> 02:32:52.408]  efoodsdirect.com slash summer or 800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com slash summer or 800-409-5633.
[02:33:12.262 --> 02:33:15.923]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:33:15.923 --> 02:33:18.883]  Run on for a long time.
[02:33:18.883 --> 02:33:22.104]  Run on for a long time.
[02:33:22.104 --> 02:33:24.545]  Alright, we're going into overdrive into the fourth hour.
[02:33:24.545 --> 02:33:26.245]  It'll be on the network and the satellites.
[02:33:26.245 --> 02:33:28.366]  Max Keiser's gonna stay with us.
[02:33:28.366 --> 02:33:31.386]  In his words during the break, he said, I'm not leaving my post.
[02:33:31.386 --> 02:33:34.827]  They've also disabled police state for the rise of FEMA.
[02:33:35.916 --> 02:33:39.441]  They've also disabled that on all of the search engines.
[02:33:39.441 --> 02:33:42.605]  When you click on it, it tells you you've got to go to YouTube to watch it.
[02:33:42.605 --> 02:33:50.956]  They're trying to charge people money when we give this film out for free as a way to keep people from watching it.
[02:33:50.956 --> 02:33:52.137]  This is outrageous!
[02:33:53.171 --> 02:33:56.793]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't give YouTube or Google any money.
[02:33:56.793 --> 02:33:57.753]  Do not pay to watch it.
[02:33:57.753 --> 02:33:59.314]  They're still free versions.
[02:33:59.314 --> 02:34:06.537]  But once they do this, I've read about this, they're going to try to knock out all the other free versions that are out there, and then they'll shut down this version.
[02:34:06.537 --> 02:34:08.238]  We can now see their plan.
[02:34:08.238 --> 02:34:10.399]  They do not want you to see the Obama deception.
[02:34:10.399 --> 02:34:19.463]  For a limited time, until they run out, I've got the Obama deception, four copies for $19.95, and the hardcover DVD with the expanded extras in the highest quality.
[02:34:19.463 --> 02:34:22.244]  Get it, make physical copies, and hand them out on the street.
[02:34:22.944 --> 02:34:26.167]  But you can really see how they get everything hooked into Google and YouTube.
[02:34:26.167 --> 02:34:27.928]  It's really an NSA front.
[02:34:27.928 --> 02:34:29.269]  It takes over the web.
[02:34:29.269 --> 02:34:30.651]  It publishes books.
[02:34:30.651 --> 02:34:33.193]  Doesn't care if publishers sue them.
[02:34:33.193 --> 02:34:35.094]  The courts always rule for Google.
[02:34:35.094 --> 02:34:38.758]  They are allowed to do things that nobody else is ever allowed to do.
[02:34:38.758 --> 02:34:40.379]  And you can see the strategic plan.
[02:34:40.379 --> 02:34:43.161]  I saw this years ago, but now it's very clear.
[02:34:43.161 --> 02:34:44.963]  They are meant to absorb the web.
[02:34:44.963 --> 02:34:48.346]  In fact, that's come out in major news headlines that Google is to be the web.
[02:34:50.251 --> 02:34:54.312]  And it is a Pentagon operation with these select corporations.
[02:34:54.312 --> 02:35:02.613]  It is NSA keyword software that Google was built on 11 years ago when it first launched out of nowhere.
[02:35:02.613 --> 02:35:04.894]  It is using NSA keyword software.
[02:35:04.894 --> 02:35:06.914]  That's its base search function.
[02:35:06.914 --> 02:35:17.056]  And it's to understand society, it's to track us, it's to go out and wage cyber war, and that's why our headline, Google Spies
[02:35:17.856 --> 02:35:21.539]  is so key to make that the number one search term so that people understand this.
[02:35:21.539 --> 02:35:27.344]  And I'll have Steve Watson, let's call him, update the fact that they're now trying to charge people for it and this is not us.
[02:35:27.344 --> 02:35:30.647]  If you want to support us, buy the DVDs at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:30.647 --> 02:35:32.148]  You can get ten of them for $39.95.
[02:35:32.148 --> 02:35:35.271]  That's about four bucks a piece.
[02:35:35.271 --> 02:35:39.534]  You can get four of them for $19.95 at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:35:42.697 --> 02:35:44.218]  We're going into overdrive in the next hour.
[02:35:44.218 --> 02:35:47.379]  We'll be live, it'll be on the network, the stations, all of it.
[02:35:47.379 --> 02:35:50.481]  But right now we're talking to Max Keiser, then we're going to start going to your phone calls.
[02:35:50.481 --> 02:35:55.323]  I want to get into some other financial news, but Max has agreed to stay with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[02:35:55.323 --> 02:35:56.543]  Max, this is insane!
[02:35:56.543 --> 02:36:00.165]  I mean, what's your breakdown of what we see happening?
[02:36:00.165 --> 02:36:08.549]  Well, first of all, I just want to point out that the Max Keiser YouTube channel on YouTube has a very paltry 10,000 subscribers.
[02:36:09.358 --> 02:36:22.781]  The next time I come on your show, Alex, if that number's out of 20,000, I'm going to recite the entire Obama deception in Sanskrit for a captive audience and make the Muslims in me do it.
[02:36:22.781 --> 02:36:24.041]  I mean, this is pitiful.
[02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:25.822]  I only have 10,000 subscribers.
[02:36:25.822 --> 02:36:28.543]  There's got to be at least 20,000 subscribers!
[02:36:28.543 --> 02:36:30.283]  But anyway, let's continue talking about the financial news.
[02:36:30.723 --> 02:36:39.545]  Well no, going back to this Obama situation, I don't think people realize how big this is, and that we're literally battling with YouTube and Google in real time.
[02:36:39.545 --> 02:36:50.948]  How arrogant are they to take it down, then put it back up, and I said, I smell a rat, I think they're gonna counter-strike, and their way of doing it is to disable it all over the web, except for YouTube, and then you go there and they want money.
[02:36:52.079 --> 02:36:59.949]  Well, I think what we're seeing also is an interplay between how computers are programmed to do different things.
[02:36:59.949 --> 02:37:09.162]  And I think that certainly on Wall Street, the computers are programmed, it's called program trading, and they can program computers to do all kinds of market manipulation.
[02:37:09.822 --> 02:37:13.186]  And this is how most of Wall Street makes their money these days.
[02:37:13.186 --> 02:37:15.628]  They simply program computers to steal.
[02:37:15.628 --> 02:37:17.270]  And this is exactly what they do.
[02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:25.838]  But computers are also programmed to sniff out, like you say, that the Obama deception is rising quickly on the trend list, and in fact it was
[02:37:26.558 --> 02:37:28.560]  Trending higher than it had been recently.
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:36.747]  Well the computers see that and they make the calculations and they see that the words associated with Obama and then a deception is untenable.
[02:37:36.747 --> 02:37:44.874]  So then the computers simply kick in and start to delete videos or change videos and they figure they can always mop up the legal mess later.
[02:37:44.874 --> 02:37:46.896]  But the computers have dominion.
[02:37:46.896 --> 02:37:48.618]  The computers run the show.
[02:37:48.618 --> 02:37:51.140]  They will change the programming tomorrow or the next day.
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:55.702]  And what we see today is that they're trying to catch up with what's going on in your situation.
[02:37:55.702 --> 02:37:59.063]  You've basically broken the computers for today.
[02:37:59.063 --> 02:38:03.645]  Just like when you flood a website with too much traffic, it goes crazy and they can't catch up to it.
[02:38:03.645 --> 02:38:05.385]  But they will learn more next time.
[02:38:05.385 --> 02:38:07.106]  We've got to learn more next time.
[02:38:07.106 --> 02:38:12.248]  This is humans interfacing with machines to battle the artificial intelligence of the NSA.
[02:38:12.932 --> 02:38:14.053]  Well, it's InfoWars.
[02:38:14.053 --> 02:38:17.035]  And so, you are winning a battle here.
[02:38:17.035 --> 02:38:19.016]  You're winning a battle in the InfoWars.
[02:38:19.016 --> 02:38:31.044]  And I think that to build on the success, there's got to be more strategies and more tactics based on the fact that the current propaganda wars are made entirely of information.
[02:38:31.044 --> 02:38:40.491]  And as this report called Top Secret America points out, the military-industrial complex doesn't really care so much about the hardware anymore, the planes, the bombs.
[02:38:40.891 --> 02:38:41.572]  I don't
[02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:59.932]  I mean, I see you referenced on Drudge Report all the time.
[02:38:59.932 --> 02:39:08.258]  I even see you talked about on Huffington Post, which is, you know, perceptibly on the other side of the political aisle.
[02:39:08.258 --> 02:39:10.540]  But you're becoming a force to be reckoned with.
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:19.728]  So, the computers have isolated you and are trying to combat you with algorithms and programs to try to over...
[02:39:20.678 --> 02:39:25.219]  Over, over, over, over-read you, over-write you with additional information.
[02:39:25.219 --> 02:39:26.119]  And we see the same thing.
[02:39:26.119 --> 02:39:29.660]  It's very interesting because we see the exact same thing on Wall Street.
[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:33.201]  The flash crash of May 6th, the 1,000-point drop.
[02:39:33.201 --> 02:39:34.701]  That was a computer glitch.
[02:39:34.701 --> 02:39:39.863]  You know, the computers are programmed to steal money slowly, not in 1,000-point grabs.
[02:39:39.863 --> 02:39:43.163]  You know, when I was working on Wall Street, we had a saying that went like this.
[02:39:43.163 --> 02:39:45.864]  We used to say, shear, don't slaughter.
[02:39:46.525 --> 02:39:56.011]  And what that means is, you take a little bit from your clients every single day, but don't kill your clients, because you want to keep them alive long enough to shear them the next day.
[02:39:56.011 --> 02:39:59.413]  And this is exactly the way... Alright, we're going to talk about that more in a moment.
[02:39:59.413 --> 02:40:03.556]  Max is going to be with us into the next hour, but Kenneth Webb runs the Director Channel.
[02:40:03.556 --> 02:40:04.237]  People get confused.
[02:40:04.237 --> 02:40:08.920]  He's not the director of the Obama Deception, though he's directed his own great films, like Debunk This.
[02:40:10.342 --> 02:40:14.225]  But he's a guy who has an account that can upload more than 10 minute chunks.
[02:40:14.225 --> 02:40:18.469]  So he uploaded the number one version of the Obama deception back in March of last year.
[02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:20.730]  It's had 6.5 million views.
[02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:22.792]  It was surging and growing even faster.
[02:40:22.792 --> 02:40:24.814]  It was somebody hacked and deleted it.
[02:40:24.814 --> 02:40:26.935]  And he's, I guess, out on the road because his cell phone's cutting out.
[02:40:30.578 --> 02:40:38.706]  They are in there now, inside, making people pay to see the Obama deception on all our computers in the office.
[02:40:38.706 --> 02:40:40.227]  This is outrageous.
[02:40:40.227 --> 02:40:46.794]  You haven't implemented that, because I haven't talked to you yet, but I know Google has to offer that, and we're not asking for it.
[02:40:46.794 --> 02:40:49.136]  So, I mean, this is amazing.
[02:40:49.136 --> 02:40:51.198]  Yeah, it was, actually, how's it going, Alex?
[02:40:52.811 --> 02:40:58.733]  I was just going and I seen some people from the UK saying that they weren't able to access the video.
[02:40:58.733 --> 02:41:09.837]  So I went in to see what the problem was and it had some kind of rental thing on all, specifically all three of those videos that were taken down.
[02:41:09.837 --> 02:41:11.857]  They were all for rent.
[02:41:11.857 --> 02:41:15.239]  And, you know, it wasn't like that, you know, an hour ago.
[02:41:15.239 --> 02:41:17.559]  And then all of a sudden, it's like that.
[02:41:17.559 --> 02:41:18.320]  I don't know.
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:22.001]  It's kind of crazy and mind boggling because
[02:41:22.634 --> 02:41:30.893]  They, you know, when they reinstated those three videos, they reinstated videos that have been down for years now.
[02:41:30.893 --> 02:41:32.276]  The ones they took down.
[02:41:32.959 --> 02:41:43.844]  Um, the first few videos they took down that I actually put up were from Military.com and they, you know, they said, you know, copyright infringement, they took it down and everything and those were back up.
[02:41:43.844 --> 02:41:45.545]  So I had to get through all the videos.
[02:41:45.545 --> 02:41:52.188]  I was about, and I called you this morning and I said, I believe that's a false flag by putting videos up to get more strikes against your account.
[02:41:52.748 --> 02:42:08.132]  And now they've thrown this pay thing on it, and the thousands of sites, and that's conservative, that it's linked to around the web, where people embed the video to Obama deception, police aid for the rise of FEMA in your film, debunk this, which is about government-sponsored terror and fluoride and other issues.
[02:42:08.132 --> 02:42:10.212]  Now they're trying to make you pay for those.
[02:42:10.212 --> 02:42:14.233]  This is... I guess you've got to turn Google Ads off.
[02:42:14.233 --> 02:42:16.454]  I think that's how they're able to claim they can do this.
[02:42:16.454 --> 02:42:17.334]  Can you turn that off?
[02:42:18.183 --> 02:42:19.284]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:19.284 --> 02:42:20.184]  I could turn that off.
[02:42:20.184 --> 02:42:25.968]  Actually, when I went in, they had added the whole rentable button and this whole slew of stuff.
[02:42:25.968 --> 02:42:30.311]  When they reinstated all these videos, they put all this new stuff up.
[02:42:30.311 --> 02:42:32.712]  I don't even know where that came from.
[02:42:32.712 --> 02:42:42.578]  And, you know, I went through and I found the rentable part where it says rentable videos, which is new to me, and I disabled them.
[02:42:42.578 --> 02:42:46.481]  And then what it did, it took all of those videos and it made them private.
[02:42:47.270 --> 02:42:54.934]  So I had to go back in to the actual video and edit that and make them not private anymore for everybody.
[02:42:54.934 --> 02:42:56.315]  And they're back up now.
[02:42:56.315 --> 02:42:57.115]  Oh, definitely.
[02:42:57.115 --> 02:42:57.896]  Definitely.
[02:42:57.896 --> 02:42:58.596]  Already done, Alex.
[02:42:58.596 --> 02:42:59.156]  Already done.
[02:43:12.671 --> 02:43:14.072]  Well, don't lose that passcode.
[02:43:14.072 --> 02:43:15.973]  My God, this is getting insane.
[02:43:15.973 --> 02:43:16.734]  Stay there, Kenneth.
[02:43:16.734 --> 02:43:19.396]  Well, Max Keiser's in the wings.
[02:43:19.396 --> 02:43:23.819]  Now we've got more intel from the man that runs the channel, Kenneth Webb.
[02:43:23.819 --> 02:43:31.845]  This does sound like an automatic computer system, or that somebody's using those systems to keep us from being all over the web.
[02:43:31.845 --> 02:43:32.946]  Max Keiser, what's your take?
[02:43:33.717 --> 02:43:36.338]  Well, you know, you're heading into the November election.
[02:43:36.338 --> 02:43:45.441]  The Obama team is nervous because their programs have been a failure for the very reasons that you talk about in your film, The Obama Deception.
[02:43:45.441 --> 02:43:53.264]  And so a simple conversation with the webmasters at Google tried to do what you can to shape
[02:43:53.925 --> 02:43:54.165]  We're good.
[02:44:08.539 --> 02:44:22.994]  Let me ask you this question, Max, because I mean Max invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange system that they admittedly use in many modern stock exchange computer systems now.
[02:44:24.798 --> 02:44:34.721]  Looking at this, do you think Obama and his people like the fact that when you typed his name in in the last month, the top link was this link to this particular version of the Obama deception?
[02:44:34.721 --> 02:44:42.484]  There's no way going into an election that they wanted when somebody searched the name Obama in any variation, it was my film.
[02:44:42.484 --> 02:44:44.865]  I mean, clearly they have shown their hand by doing this.
[02:44:46.417 --> 02:44:56.677]  Because the attention span of the average American is so short that even just the one second connection of Obama with the word deception
[02:44:57.592 --> 02:45:04.058]  Is a problem, because people in their subconscious mind equate Obama with deception.
[02:45:04.058 --> 02:45:08.082]  And if this is a huge result of searching Obama, then you get deception.
[02:45:08.082 --> 02:45:14.447]  Whether you even consciously admit it or not, or recognize it, when you go to the voting booth, you equate Obama with deception.
[02:45:14.447 --> 02:45:21.634]  This is all part of the propaganda that was invented by, you know, the National Socialists of Germany, and then picked up by
[02:45:22.715 --> 02:45:24.076]  See, I didn't name it that.
[02:45:37.111 --> 02:45:38.152]  Out of manipulation.
[02:45:38.152 --> 02:45:45.538]  I just try to tell the truth and I know he's deceiving and I know that Obama is a front and himself is a deception.
[02:45:45.538 --> 02:45:50.422]  You know, the whole persona of Obama is a manufactured Madison Avenue system.
[02:45:50.422 --> 02:45:57.027]  And so if you just organically tell the truth, it trumps all their lies and spin and manipulation.
[02:45:57.027 --> 02:45:58.608]  Let's go back to Kenneth Webb.
[02:45:58.608 --> 02:45:59.469]  Yeah.
[02:45:59.469 --> 02:46:00.830]  And then come back to you, Kaiser.
[02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:05.474]  Kenneth, I mean, what was it like for you to find out Saturday that they had taken this video down?
[02:46:06.391 --> 02:46:07.352]  It was horrible.
[02:46:07.352 --> 02:46:08.512]  It was horrible.
[02:46:08.512 --> 02:46:11.935]  I really got sick at the stomach.
[02:46:11.935 --> 02:46:22.242]  You know, my mom, you know, pretty simple said that, you know, if this is happening, that means you're actually, you know, that you guys are really doing something.
[02:46:22.242 --> 02:46:28.786]  So there was a good side to it and I had to focus on that and then trying to, you know, get it backed up and everything.
[02:46:31.111 --> 02:46:34.754]  I know we're stomping on some toes, there's no doubt about it.
[02:46:34.754 --> 02:46:38.317]  They've hacked my website, spywitnessnews.org.
[02:46:38.317 --> 02:46:40.999]  We've had problems with these videos.
[02:46:40.999 --> 02:46:50.666]  A couple of times we've had people actually hack the YouTube page for Obama Deception, putting all kinds of code in that was having an effect on the page.
[02:46:50.666 --> 02:46:53.688]  That happened for like a day, something about a month ago.
[02:46:55.866 --> 02:46:57.148]  It's just crazy.
[02:46:57.148 --> 02:47:04.357]  It's crazy, but like I said, I believe that we're really having an effect, else why would they even mess around with anything like this?
[02:47:04.357 --> 02:47:10.725]  I mean, even if it's small-time hackers or big-time hackers, they're definitely feeling it.
[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:15.743]  Yeah, but small-time hackers can't shut it down all over the web and make people pay for it.
[02:47:15.743 --> 02:47:21.266]  Only Google and YouTube can do it, and I say they're the number one prime suspects in all of this.
[02:47:21.266 --> 02:47:24.649]  But notice, if we would have just laid down to this, they would have won.
[02:47:24.649 --> 02:47:25.910]  But by fighting back,
[02:47:26.986 --> 02:47:31.972]  Now we have an even bigger victory and we show people these crooks aren't invincible.
[02:47:31.972 --> 02:47:34.915]  And so now it's an even bigger disaster for them.
[02:47:34.915 --> 02:47:38.600]  And this is the biggest thing we've ever done.
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:45.388]  Our response to this, our resistance to them, the idea to promote the Obama deception last week, this has turned into the biggest event.
[02:47:45.888 --> 02:47:49.450]  Of anything I've ever done, and it's only growing faster.
[02:48:16.328 --> 02:48:25.471]  Well, if everybody who has a blog embeds in the header of their blog, Obama equals Deception, then you're fighting the Info Wars.
[02:48:25.471 --> 02:48:35.954]  You don't even have to link to the film, or you can just have that link in the heading of your blog, so that the search engines will equate Obama with Deception.
[02:48:35.954 --> 02:48:39.295]  Remember, Obama won because if you did a search in 2008 for the word Hope,
[02:48:41.019 --> 02:48:42.300]  You would get results.
[02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:42.921]  Obama.
[02:48:42.921 --> 02:48:44.082]  Barack Obama.
[02:48:44.082 --> 02:48:45.764]  That's why he's the President of the United States.
[02:48:45.764 --> 02:48:47.865]  He essentially commandeered the word hope.
[02:48:47.865 --> 02:48:52.450]  Okay, now you've equated Obama with deception.
[02:48:52.450 --> 02:48:54.411]  Let's keep pushing that theme.
[02:48:54.411 --> 02:49:03.420]  If you keep pushing that theme and you institute a major political overturn in the next six to seven months, you will have accomplished a major battle in the Info Wars.
[02:49:04.056 --> 02:49:07.080]  And I guess they're propagandist and they recognize this.
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:10.684]  I mean, Max, I'm just a regular guy who just swings with the truth.
[02:49:10.684 --> 02:49:12.447]  And I guess it trumps them over and over again.
[02:49:12.447 --> 02:49:16.372]  But the more I think about it, it was the top link, Obama deception.
[02:49:16.372 --> 02:49:17.253]  They don't like that.
[02:49:17.253 --> 02:49:19.275]  This is important.
[02:49:19.275 --> 02:49:22.880]  They wouldn't have censored this and revealed themselves unless they knew it was important.
[02:49:23.396 --> 02:49:26.980]  But what is it Washington Post just released today in Top Secret America?
[02:49:26.980 --> 02:49:38.972]  There's 800,000 people in a fourth branch of government in the United States who are fighting the Infowars, who have allegiances with the information technology firms in America, including Google.
[02:49:39.692 --> 02:49:43.714]  This is now out in the Washington Post.
[02:49:43.714 --> 02:49:45.015]  The war is on.
[02:49:45.015 --> 02:49:46.576]  The battle lines have been drawn.
[02:49:46.576 --> 02:49:48.097]  The tyranny is here.
[02:49:48.097 --> 02:49:49.317]  Well I agree, I agree.
[02:49:49.317 --> 02:49:52.439]  We've seen massive increases.
[02:49:52.439 --> 02:49:53.880]  73,000 blogs taken down last week.
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:55.220]  No court order, no nothing.
[02:49:55.220 --> 02:50:02.364]  The Justice Department just ordered it saying they didn't like their speech because they were talking about sharing files and talking about stuff online.
[02:50:02.364 --> 02:50:03.665]  Now your speech is illegal.
[02:50:04.045 --> 02:50:05.846]  We're seeing other sites being hacked.
[02:50:05.846 --> 02:50:09.888]  They've tried to take down the Alex Jones channel with hacks last week.
[02:50:09.888 --> 02:50:12.009]  And Dave, who runs it, hadn't even told me that.
[02:50:12.009 --> 02:50:14.810]  When I called him Saturday, he said, yeah, they're trying it here too.
[02:50:14.810 --> 02:50:23.034]  So it looks like the green light was given in the last week or two, Max, to launch a major cyber attack against us and everybody else for that matter.
[02:50:23.581 --> 02:50:28.963]  Well, the computers are programmed, and your film hit a traffic anomaly.
[02:50:28.963 --> 02:50:33.445]  It started to go in the direction that the computers couldn't figure out why.
[02:50:33.445 --> 02:50:37.207]  Because it didn't fit into any of their template logic.
[02:50:37.207 --> 02:50:41.749]  And so they shut down, or dismantled, or hacked, or took it offline.
[02:50:41.749 --> 02:50:42.769]  And this is what their program did.
[02:50:42.769 --> 02:50:43.089]  Stay there!
[02:50:43.089 --> 02:50:43.549]  Stay there!
[02:50:43.549 --> 02:50:44.750]  Because that's what Obama says.
[02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:46.671]  I've got to shut the web down to save it.
[02:50:46.671 --> 02:50:48.211]  They mean their globalist web.
[02:50:48.211 --> 02:50:50.912]  They always speak in triple meanings.
[02:50:50.912 --> 02:50:51.293]  And so...
[02:50:52.734 --> 02:50:57.666]  You've got to know there are fail safes built in to shut down things on the web when everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[02:50:57.666 --> 02:51:00.854]  This is a cyber security takeover kill switch test.
[02:51:01.468 --> 02:51:04.989]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:04.989 --> 02:51:07.290]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:08.150]  Don't!
[02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:11.592]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:51:11.592 --> 02:51:18.714]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:51:18.694 --> 02:51:20.675]  's number one debt secret.
[02:51:20.675 --> 02:51:24.336]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:51:24.736 --> 02:51:27.499]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:51:27.499 --> 02:51:35.268]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:51:35.268 --> 02:51:36.449]  Herb K was right.
[02:51:36.449 --> 02:51:39.493]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:51:39.633 --> 02:51:40.914]  What do you have to lose?
[02:51:40.914 --> 02:51:42.134]  Stop the calls now.
[02:51:42.134 --> 02:51:44.095]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:51:44.095 --> 02:51:44.675]  Get Herb K.'
[02:51:44.615 --> 02:51:47.396]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:51:47.396 --> 02:51:47.736]  Call 800-405-7850.
[02:51:47.736 --> 02:51:48.337]  That's 800-405-7850.
[02:51:48.337 --> 02:51:48.377]  800-405-7850.
[02:52:01.272 --> 02:52:03.613]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.613 --> 02:52:05.974]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.974 --> 02:52:09.196]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.196 --> 02:52:14.298]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.298 --> 02:52:18.480]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:21.164]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.164 --> 02:52:24.048]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.048 --> 02:52:26.952]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.952 --> 02:52:34.564]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.881 --> 02:52:40.264]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.264 --> 02:52:42.605]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.605 --> 02:52:46.827]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.827 --> 02:52:47.888]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.888 --> 02:52:49.229]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:13.867]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:54:13.867 --> 02:54:15.568]  Well, I hope Max Keiser's right.
[02:54:15.568 --> 02:54:17.529]  This is just a computer glitch at Google.
[02:54:17.529 --> 02:54:24.334]  But here's the Washington Post, a two-year report admitting Google is top of the heat NSA.
[02:54:24.334 --> 02:54:28.957]  What did that CIA technology officer, retired Mr. Steele, what was his first name?
[02:54:28.957 --> 02:54:29.818]  We had him on a few times.
[02:54:31.723 --> 02:54:39.929]  He named In-Q-Tel, he named MIT, and everything he said, what, five years ago, and then again four years ago, he came on twice.
[02:54:39.929 --> 02:54:42.311]  He said he got so much heat, he wasn't gonna come on after that.
[02:54:42.311 --> 02:54:44.212]  He told us that on the phone.
[02:54:44.212 --> 02:54:46.093]  I think he got some threats, but he wouldn't say that.
[02:54:46.093 --> 02:54:47.114]  He just said, look, I can't.
[02:54:47.114 --> 02:54:49.536]  I like what you're doing, but it just got too heavy.
[02:54:49.536 --> 02:54:54.800]  He was the first person I ever said that, who said, look, they're not influenced by the CIA.
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:57.442]  And then I say, he said, Alex, they are.
[02:54:57.442 --> 02:54:58.042]  They are.
[02:54:58.956 --> 02:55:00.056]  They are.
[02:55:00.056 --> 02:55:02.977]  And he said, check out this doctor's name, that doctor's name.
[02:55:02.977 --> 02:55:10.980]  It was MIT, it was NSA, you know, these doctors of technology, these gurus, and they're literally taking over the whole planet with this.
[02:55:10.980 --> 02:55:12.881]  And people say, well, why are you on Google and YouTube?
[02:55:12.881 --> 02:55:13.982]  That's the war!
[02:55:13.982 --> 02:55:14.982]  That's the Internet!
[02:55:15.282 --> 02:55:16.842]  We don't give up landscape here.
[02:55:16.842 --> 02:55:18.123]  We're going back to Kenneth Webb.
[02:55:18.123 --> 02:55:20.383]  Kaiser with us on the economy and your phone calls.
[02:55:20.383 --> 02:55:21.884]  Going into the next hour in overdrive.
[02:55:21.884 --> 02:55:23.224]  MaxKaiser.com.
[02:55:23.224 --> 02:55:24.644]  His great YouTube channel.
[02:55:24.644 --> 02:55:25.965]  Stunning information.
[02:55:25.965 --> 02:55:27.805]  MaxKaiser.com.
[02:55:27.805 --> 02:55:31.626]  Max, do you think my analysis is accurate or do you have anything to add to that?
[02:55:31.626 --> 02:55:34.987]  I wouldn't say it's a computer glitch.
[02:55:34.987 --> 02:55:42.189]  In other words, it's like you were at the Playing 21 in Las Vegas and you started to win too many hands.
[02:55:43.055 --> 02:55:47.137]  Behind the Sky picks it up, and then you get a visit from the Pit Boss.
[02:55:47.137 --> 02:55:49.398]  So, there's no way you can beat the house.
[02:55:49.398 --> 02:55:57.543]  Now, your video started to impinge on Obama's team and their ability to control the propaganda wars and the info wars.
[02:55:57.543 --> 02:56:02.425]  So you're getting a visit from the equivalent, the equivalent of the Pit Boss in the virtual world.
[02:56:02.425 --> 02:56:05.847]  They need to remove you from the table because you're winning too many hands.
[02:56:06.961 --> 02:56:08.421]  And this computer picks that up.
[02:56:08.421 --> 02:56:10.642]  That's why I call it the Casino Gulag.
[02:56:10.642 --> 02:56:15.023]  Because a lot of the technology used to keep people in line is the same as the casino.
[02:56:15.023 --> 02:56:20.544]  They know how to incentivize you to keep you gambling, but they know how to discipline you from winning too much.
[02:56:20.544 --> 02:56:24.965]  And they also keep you unemployed and low wages, though you're there in the gulag.
[02:56:24.965 --> 02:56:33.607]  So you, Alex Jones, were winning too many views with this video, and you got a visit from the virtual pit boss who had to shut you down because you're winning too many hands.
[02:56:33.607 --> 02:56:34.907]  It's a casino gulag.
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:42.124]  And now we're pointing out that the House is fixed, so they're backing off because it's revealing who they really are.
[02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:44.946]  Well, it's not necessarily fixed, per se.
[02:56:44.946 --> 02:56:50.130]  It's that humans, the human being, is easily manipulated.
[02:56:50.130 --> 02:56:52.792]  And they manipulate the humans.
[02:56:52.792 --> 02:57:04.360]  You see, the point of starting a country like America to begin with was to try to tease out the greatest part of humanity, to create something that's better and bigger than the sum of its parts.
[02:57:04.986 --> 02:57:10.328]  But now that you've got bankers in control, they're breaking it down so it's less than the sum of its parts.
[02:57:10.328 --> 02:57:15.851]  And it's just a bunch of greedy people trying to win off of each other in a less than zero outcome.
[02:57:15.851 --> 02:57:22.514]  And the bankers can set the rules so they game everything and they get the world out of fiat currency.
[02:57:22.514 --> 02:57:24.494]  They just make up out of nothing.
[02:57:24.494 --> 02:57:26.455]  As Thomas Jefferson said, they were facing it then.
[02:57:26.455 --> 02:57:32.618]  He said, if you let private banks issue currency and credit, your children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[02:57:33.772 --> 02:57:44.118]  It doesn't have to be rigged, it just has to be marginally successful because they get the majority of people to give up their self-respect and you end up with a casino gulag.
[02:57:44.118 --> 02:57:52.664]  And you've now had a direct interaction with the pit boss in the virtual world who's come over to you and said, sorry, you're winning too many hands, you're getting too many views, you're co-opting the word.
[02:57:53.384 --> 02:57:57.126]  Obama, which needs to be associated only with the word hope.
[02:57:57.126 --> 02:58:01.569]  We cannot tolerate the word Obama to be associated with the word deception.
[02:58:01.569 --> 02:58:02.889]  That's intolerable.
[02:58:02.889 --> 02:58:04.030]  It cannot happen.
[02:58:04.030 --> 02:58:05.411]  And we'll do whatever it takes.
[02:58:05.411 --> 02:58:07.912]  We'll stick our computer algorithms on you.
[02:58:07.912 --> 02:58:09.413]  They'll do all the dirty work.
[02:58:09.413 --> 02:58:11.174]  And I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
[02:58:11.174 --> 02:58:12.375]  You have to leave the casino now.
[02:58:13.263 --> 02:58:31.878]  I'm so glad we had Max Keiser on today, because he just brought out, because he's an inventor of a major stock exchange system, and very intelligent and understands this, and everything he's talked about in the last few years, it's just so crystal clear how right he was, and he brought out issues here today that I didn't see or understand.
[02:58:31.878 --> 02:58:36.642]  I'm just in here toe-to-toe going at him, and my listeners are, and we're kicking their butt.
[02:58:36.642 --> 02:58:38.243]  We're going to go into the fourth hour live.
[02:58:38.243 --> 02:58:38.723]  Stay with us.
[02:58:38.723 --> 02:58:39.284]  We'll be right back.

[02:59:47.917 --> 02:59:49.657]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:59:51.673 --> 02:59:55.282]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.282 --> 02:59:58.490]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.377 --> 03:00:10.059]  We're live in the fourth hour.
[03:00:10.059 --> 03:00:13.722]  It is the 19th day of July 2010.
[03:00:13.722 --> 03:00:19.388]  I want to get into some of the financial news that Max Keiser and your phone calls and to balance the time we have.
[03:00:19.388 --> 03:00:22.911]  But we are in the middle of the greatest offensive in the info war we've ever launched.
[03:00:23.812 --> 03:00:33.038]  And it's happening because people have seen the attempt to censor the film The Obama Deception and it's backfiring against the globalists and it's revealing how their system operates.
[03:00:33.038 --> 03:00:37.641]  This on the same day it's admitted that Google is basically an NSA masterhub.
[03:00:37.641 --> 03:00:43.465]  The Washington Post even admits this and so are 800 and let me give you the actual number here.
[03:00:44.679 --> 03:00:52.241]  Eight hundred plus thousand, 854,000 people in private industry have the highest level security clearances.
[03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:56.762]  The corporations are making themselves the government so they can rob and steal from you.
[03:00:56.762 --> 03:01:04.744]  Kenneth Webb, who runs the director channel, he's had a director channel since YouTube began, so he's able to upload the films in one piece in high quality.
[03:01:04.744 --> 03:01:05.124]  It's free.
[03:01:06.264 --> 03:01:12.791]  And he was able to go into the interface and remove the paid link that was on there.
[03:01:12.791 --> 03:01:15.574]  And they've taken it down for the last two days.
[03:01:15.574 --> 03:01:16.895]  It went back up today.
[03:01:16.895 --> 03:01:18.397]  We don't know what's going to happen with this.
[03:01:18.397 --> 03:01:20.159]  He was hacked.
[03:01:20.159 --> 03:01:23.882]  But I want to finish up with Kenneth Webb and then go back to Max Keiser.
[03:01:23.882 --> 03:01:25.945]  Kenneth Webb, any other points you want to make here, sir?
[03:01:26.818 --> 03:01:27.698]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:01:27.698 --> 03:01:35.442]  I wanted to thank all the Infowarriors out there because I believe, I don't know if they underestimated them or what, but it was all over the net.
[03:01:35.442 --> 03:01:43.505]  Everything that they did, and like I haven't heard back from YouTube, they just reinstated all kinds of videos like I said earlier.
[03:01:44.245 --> 03:01:49.588]  But I really want to thank everybody and you guys for being right on that.
[03:01:49.588 --> 03:01:50.508]  And they felt it.
[03:01:50.508 --> 03:01:51.749]  They felt the voice.
[03:01:51.749 --> 03:01:54.250]  And we, like you say, we do have them on the run.
[03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:56.231]  They thought that they could take it away.
[03:01:56.231 --> 03:01:59.152]  And like we were going to go quietly in the night or something.
[03:01:59.152 --> 03:02:05.955]  And people, there was a big outpouring, a lot of videos, a lot of blogs, a lot of posts all over the internet.
[03:02:05.955 --> 03:02:06.976]  And it had an effect.
[03:02:08.453 --> 03:02:13.758]  It certainly did, and I think everybody should rewatch the first 10 minutes of the Obama deception.
[03:02:13.758 --> 03:02:19.083]  It's that information that scares them so much, and tomorrow I'm going to play that first 10 minutes on air.
[03:02:19.083 --> 03:02:22.666]  It's that first 10 minutes that crystallizes the left-right paradigm and shows
[03:02:23.507 --> 03:02:24.408]  What's really happening?
[03:02:24.408 --> 03:02:27.329]  And Bush making jokes about dead kids in Iraq.
[03:02:27.329 --> 03:02:30.871]  And then we cut right to Obama and say, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[03:02:30.871 --> 03:02:31.991]  Kenneth, God bless you.
[03:02:31.991 --> 03:02:35.914]  Continue fighting in there and continue to watch your six, my friend.
[03:02:35.914 --> 03:02:40.076]  And the fact is we came in Saturday night, we cut a video, wrote an article to counter it.
[03:02:40.076 --> 03:02:42.137]  Aaron and Rob stayed up till 7, 8 in the morning.
[03:02:42.997 --> 03:02:49.682]  To get it completed and we fought back immediately and we're gonna continue to fight back This is a war when the globalists push back people go.
[03:02:49.682 --> 03:02:52.984]  Oh my gosh, they're attacking us That means we're in a fight.
[03:02:52.984 --> 03:02:54.365]  It means they're having to engage us.
[03:02:54.365 --> 03:02:59.949]  It means we're having an effect We're in a war an info war with these illegitimate criminals.
[03:02:59.949 --> 03:03:08.356]  We have the moral high ground That's why the government bombs buildings and then blames it on Patriots and Liberty groups to make us be the bad guy They are the bad guys Kenneth Webb.
[03:03:08.356 --> 03:03:08.816]  God bless you
[03:03:10.888 --> 03:03:11.909]  Max Keiser, we're going to break.
[03:03:11.909 --> 03:03:16.814]  I'm going to come back with you and give you the floor and take calls, but I wanted to bring that point up.
[03:03:16.814 --> 03:03:30.809]  Did you see the Financial Times of London with Robert Shapiro, the top advisor to Clinton, advising Obama that he needs an Oklahoma City or 9-11 attack so the public, quote, sees him as strong, and that's, quote, the only way he's going to win the midterm elections?
[03:03:30.809 --> 03:03:33.312]  I mean, these guys are one inch away from admitting stage terror.
[03:03:34.636 --> 03:03:35.297]  Sure, sure.
[03:03:35.297 --> 03:03:38.300]  But before, just one quick note.
[03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:47.109]  You know, just a couple weeks ago, Alex, remember that on Facebook, after the BP oil disaster, more than 800,000 people joined a boycott.
[03:03:47.109 --> 03:03:50.753]  And then Facebook decided to delete that boycott.
[03:03:50.753 --> 03:03:53.756]  And that's exactly the kind of thing that we just saw in your case.
[03:03:54.318 --> 03:04:02.564]  So, this is enormous power given to these sites, and they are destroying the ability for people to express themselves politically.
[03:04:02.564 --> 03:04:13.211]  800,000 people were going to join the BP boycott, and Facebook simply said, well, we just deleted it because we didn't think it was in the interest of our associates.
[03:04:13.211 --> 03:04:23.599]  And meanwhile, the founder of Facebook calls his, I can't quote it, it's cuss words, calls his users dumb effers because they trust him, and he sits around giggling, calling them scum and filth.
[03:04:24.554 --> 03:04:26.995]  Well, it's 500 million people now on Facebook.
[03:04:26.995 --> 03:04:29.336]  It's the basis for this casino gulag.
[03:04:29.336 --> 03:04:40.501]  So, in other words, going forward, the people who joined the BP boycott would be awarded debit that they can only work off by virtual slave technique, by working off the credits by viewing on ads.
[03:04:40.501 --> 03:04:43.702]  And the people who didn't join the BP boycott would be awarded virtual credit.
[03:04:45.683 --> 03:04:47.966]  Meanwhile, he's laughing at you.
[03:04:47.966 --> 03:04:52.552]  Facebook's literally part of the NSA, CIA, and he's just, look at these scum.
[03:04:52.552 --> 03:04:56.017]  I rule these stupid, pathetic filth because they trust me.
[03:04:56.017 --> 03:04:57.719]  Stop trusting them.
[03:04:57.719 --> 03:04:59.061]  Max Keiser, stay there, my friend.
[03:04:59.061 --> 03:04:59.682]  We'll come back.
[03:04:59.682 --> 03:05:00.102]  Stay with us.
[03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:06.901]  Tyranny is here.
[03:05:06.901 --> 03:05:10.823]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:05:10.823 --> 03:05:13.064]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:05:13.064 --> 03:05:18.927]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:05:18.927 --> 03:05:25.150]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:31.575]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:05:31.575 --> 03:05:35.738]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:05:35.738 --> 03:05:40.042]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:05:40.042 --> 03:05:45.987]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:05:45.987 --> 03:05:49.550]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:51.511]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:05:51.511 --> 03:05:51.952]  It's here.
[03:05:52.613 --> 03:05:59.425]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:06:02.554 --> 03:06:12.116]  For decades, physician and veterinarian, Dr. Joel Wallach has been lecturing on how the mainstream medical system has failed us.
[03:06:12.116 --> 03:06:22.298]  The model of using drugs and surgeries isn't allowing Americans to live long and healthy lives, but there are alternatives to this broken model.
[03:06:22.298 --> 03:06:29.780]  Now, here's Dr. Joel Wallach with his Deadly Recipes lecture for your good health and longevity.
[03:06:31.064 --> 03:06:33.545]  Our goal, of course, is to have everybody die after 120.
[03:06:33.545 --> 03:06:36.787]  I don't care if it's 150 or 200, whatever it is.
[03:06:36.787 --> 03:06:39.969]  We have the capacity, we have the knowledge to get you well beyond 100.
[03:06:39.969 --> 03:06:45.351]  Everybody, when they die past 120, should only have two pieces of paper in your health chart.
[03:06:45.351 --> 03:06:47.212]  A birth certificate and a death certificate.
[03:06:47.212 --> 03:06:52.695]  If you have a 4-inch thick health chart full of all these surgeries and all these diseases, your doctor has failed you.
[03:06:52.695 --> 03:06:54.116]  The system has failed you.
[03:06:54.116 --> 03:06:56.978]  We want people, when they think of health, well, I'm not going to run to the doctor.
[03:06:56.978 --> 03:06:57.738]  I can do this myself.
[03:06:57.898 --> 03:06:59.859]  Just like when you're gonna lay tile in your house.
[03:06:59.859 --> 03:07:01.520]  Does everybody call a contractor now?
[03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:04.262]  No, they say, I'm gonna run to Home Depot and price some tile there.
[03:07:04.262 --> 03:07:05.263]  Hey, it's MZ.
[03:07:05.263 --> 03:07:09.806]  That's the beginning of an inspiring and masterful health lecture by Dr. Joel Wallach.
[03:07:09.806 --> 03:07:16.310]  Like Alex Jones, Doc has been subject to ridicule by mainstream forces just for telling the truth.
[03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:19.273]  Everyone needs to hear the Deadly Recipes lecture.
[03:07:19.273 --> 03:07:27.801]  Listen to it in full at DeadlyRecipes.com and please help us spread the message of the real and simple way to fix healthcare in America.
[03:07:27.801 --> 03:07:30.303]  Remember, DeadlyRecipes.com.
[03:07:30.303 --> 03:07:31.444]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:07:31.624 --> 03:07:36.188]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:07:36.188 --> 03:07:41.992]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:07:41.992 --> 03:07:45.655]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:07:45.655 --> 03:07:48.357]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:07:48.357 --> 03:07:53.421]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:07:53.421 --> 03:07:53.722]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:07:53.722 --> 03:07:55.063]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:08:06.192 --> 03:08:11.037]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:11.037 --> 03:08:12.619]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.619 --> 03:08:14.181]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.181 --> 03:08:18.366]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.366 --> 03:08:22.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.852 --> 03:08:25.854]  We're live, my friends.
[03:08:25.854 --> 03:08:29.657]  It's hour number four, the 19th day of July, 2010.
[03:08:29.657 --> 03:08:33.079]  Max Keiser is riding shotgun with us of the Keiser Report.
[03:08:33.079 --> 03:08:34.420]  I'll be on his TV show tomorrow.
[03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:36.742]  You can also check out his YouTube channel.
[03:08:36.742 --> 03:08:37.923]  A lot of great information there.
[03:08:37.923 --> 03:08:45.749]  Max, I want to briefly get into two big issues, and then to Al, Joe, BJ, Steve, and Matt, at least those callers with you today.
[03:08:45.749 --> 03:08:47.090]  And that's this.
[03:08:47.090 --> 03:08:52.294]  Your take on Goldman Sachs stealing billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars on record.
[03:08:53.516 --> 03:08:53.876]  I don't know.
[03:09:14.077 --> 03:09:21.982]  And now we see the Financial Reform Act, which gives the very same banks more power over the entire economy.
[03:09:21.982 --> 03:09:22.602]  This is amazing.
[03:09:22.602 --> 03:09:24.163]  Give us your take on that.
[03:09:24.163 --> 03:09:30.027]  Well, I'll talk about the Financial Reform Act in a second, but this is an interesting headline.
[03:09:30.027 --> 03:09:32.529]  Europe freezes out Goldman Sachs.
[03:09:32.529 --> 03:09:41.194]  Shocked by past deals with Italy and Greece, governments are excluding Goldman Sachs now from their sovereign bond sale.
[03:09:42.119 --> 03:10:00.119]  So, European banks, especially in Greece and Italy, where Goldman cooked the books of these countries to allow them to enter the Euro, and then subsequently, when they couldn't make the payment, they attacked them with naked short-sells and other forms of financial terrorism to profit on their demise and their misery and the people's austerity.
[03:10:00.882 --> 03:10:02.645]  Uh, they're now kicked Goldman out.
[03:10:02.645 --> 03:10:10.395]  Exactly what I said in a video that's got over 400,000 views on YouTube where I recommended that the Greek government kick Goldman Sachs out of their country.
[03:10:10.395 --> 03:10:12.037]  This is exactly what they did.
[03:10:12.037 --> 03:10:13.239]  They kicked Goldman Sachs.
[03:10:13.239 --> 03:10:14.681]  Greece has kicked Goldman Sachs out.
[03:10:14.681 --> 03:10:16.143]  Italy is kicking Goldman Sachs out.
[03:10:16.143 --> 03:10:16.944]  So the Europeans...
[03:10:17.691 --> 03:10:25.256]  Are not taking this financial terrorism anymore, and they've drawn a line in the sand, and they've said no more financial terrorism, no more golden facts.
[03:10:25.256 --> 03:10:39.146]  You know, do all your dirty dealings, your crooked accounting, your naked short selling, your high frequency trading, and you keep it there in the United States, where you've got friends in Washington who don't care how much misery and austerity you wreck upon the American economy.
[03:10:39.146 --> 03:10:40.647]  Now, on the financial reform bill,
[03:10:41.307 --> 03:10:55.077]  As you know, I've been fighting against box office features contracts, and they have outlawed box office features contracts because of the Kaiser Report Show, my appearances on your show, the NPAA, and Blanche Lincoln.
[03:10:55.077 --> 03:10:57.279]  We have defeated box office features trading.
[03:10:57.279 --> 03:11:02.803]  So the one industry in America that's still made in America, Hollywood Films, is being saved.
[03:11:03.343 --> 03:11:03.463]  Okay.
[03:11:19.211 --> 03:11:20.972]  And I know all the players.
[03:11:20.972 --> 03:11:31.019]  I was able to get into the internal forces that were shaping this legislation and we struck a blow to the financial terrorist industry.
[03:11:49.891 --> 03:12:06.700]  Well, as predicted, the millionaires are fighting with the billionaires, you know, because of this credit crash, which is making everybody who has less than $100 million net worth fight for their lives, because the wealth is being confiscated.
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:20.206]  Through draconian taxes, through all kinds of new regulations, and through capital controls, and through all kinds of new predatory practices that are being given to the banks.
[03:12:20.206 --> 03:12:25.688]  The financial reform bill actually gives the banks more ways to prey on folks.
[03:12:25.688 --> 03:12:31.411]  They make them even bigger than they were before, and it's just going in the opposite direction.
[03:12:31.411 --> 03:12:33.292]  Now, as you point out, the governments in Europe
[03:12:33.952 --> 03:12:43.276]  They were shocked, it says in this article, at the emergence of the past transaction between Goldman and Greece and Italy, where products the bank helped to sell aided them in hiding the debt.
[03:12:43.276 --> 03:12:47.298]  Greece, which used Goldman in the bond sales, practically a war with the bank.
[03:12:47.298 --> 03:12:50.100]  So here they say, Greece is at war with Goldman Sachs.
[03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:52.901]  And they should be, just because there's a war on terror.
[03:12:52.901 --> 03:12:55.782]  And I don't condone terror, and Goldman Sachs is a terrorist.
[03:12:55.782 --> 03:12:57.023]  And they need to be shut down.
[03:12:59.130 --> 03:13:00.751]  Because they're not going to stop.
[03:13:00.751 --> 03:13:07.533]  I mean, as Thomas Jefferson said, quoting him again, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you put up with.
[03:13:07.533 --> 03:13:11.775]  Of course, if they've got the regulators and are able to rob everyone, they're going to do it.
[03:13:11.775 --> 03:13:19.577]  Of course, if private corporations can be given top-level CIA, NSA clearances and be given government power, they're going to grab it.
[03:13:19.577 --> 03:13:21.298]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:13:22.441 --> 03:13:27.543]  Well, the question is, why are Americans condoning this financial terrorism?
[03:13:27.543 --> 03:13:29.184]  And the European countries.
[03:13:29.184 --> 03:13:33.266]  And by the way, when this news was announced, the Euro traded up.
[03:13:33.266 --> 03:13:36.467]  Because people said they're doing something against terrorism.
[03:13:36.467 --> 03:13:39.129]  The Euro was memorandumed a couple of weeks ago.
[03:13:39.129 --> 03:13:41.450]  They said the Euro was going to go to parity with the dollar.
[03:13:41.450 --> 03:13:42.190]  It was crashing.
[03:13:42.190 --> 03:13:42.410]  It was 120.
[03:13:42.410 --> 03:13:45.091]  Now suddenly it's back to 130.
[03:13:45.091 --> 03:13:45.612]  Why?
[03:13:45.612 --> 03:13:47.973]  Because the governments are getting rid of the financial terrorists.
[03:13:47.973 --> 03:13:49.513]  They're kicking out Goldman Sachs.
[03:13:49.513 --> 03:13:50.554]  Europe is a buy again.
[03:13:53.430 --> 03:14:05.125]  Before you leave us, I want to get into all this talk about the dollar's demise, the Chinese taking away our AAA rating, Moody's taking away the rating of Ireland, where you see things going in the short and long term.
[03:14:05.125 --> 03:14:06.968]  But right now, let's go quickly to calls.
[03:14:06.968 --> 03:14:08.710]  Allen, Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:09.031]  Welcome.
[03:14:09.747 --> 03:14:10.768]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[03:14:10.768 --> 03:14:11.889]  Thanks for taking the call.
[03:14:11.889 --> 03:14:14.212]  I wanted to point out two things.
[03:14:14.212 --> 03:14:16.875]  One is the race for McCain.
[03:14:16.875 --> 03:14:22.681]  There's a guy running by the name of Jim Deacon and he is the man that stands for what we believe in.
[03:14:22.681 --> 03:14:24.883]  Not Hayworth-less and not McSame.
[03:14:25.844 --> 03:14:33.930]  Well listen, I agree Hayworth isn't perfect, but he's not anti-gun and pro-open border, and he's anti-Nafta and GATT.
[03:14:33.930 --> 03:14:34.591]  I think J.D.
[03:14:34.591 --> 03:14:50.422]  Hayworth, that's why they ran him out of Congress, the fact that he was run out of Congress, the House, shows he's better than McCain, and I've looked at the race closely, the other guy has got hardly any numbers, and I know he's great, but wouldn't you, it's neck and neck with McCain and Hayworth, wouldn't you rather vote for J.D.
[03:14:50.422 --> 03:14:53.245]  Hayworth and send McCain home, like Arlen Specter?
[03:14:53.865 --> 03:14:55.509]  I don't trust either one of them.
[03:14:55.509 --> 03:15:01.423]  They've been in politics, they're career politicians, and Hayworth has a lot more dirt on him than people know.
[03:15:02.276 --> 03:15:04.377]  The other thing I wanted to bring up is family court.
[03:15:04.377 --> 03:15:06.639]  The guy that called in about family court?
[03:15:06.639 --> 03:15:10.141]  I spent 10 years in Las Vegas trying to reform family court.
[03:15:10.141 --> 03:15:13.103]  He needs to get into mediation and get out of family court.
[03:15:13.103 --> 03:15:17.106]  That whole system is designed to steal your money and destroy your family.
[03:15:17.106 --> 03:15:19.628]  Well, Al, Al, do you know the history of family court?
[03:15:19.628 --> 03:15:20.488]  Yes, I do.
[03:15:20.488 --> 03:15:22.610]  This segues into Kaiser.
[03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:26.052]  For those that don't know, it was set up in England about 130 years ago in the U.S.
[03:15:26.052 --> 03:15:27.013]  in about the last 95.
[03:15:27.013 --> 03:15:29.855]  It started in a few eastern states.
[03:15:31.136 --> 03:15:32.697]  It's outside the Constitution.
[03:15:32.697 --> 03:15:33.878]  There's no due process.
[03:15:33.878 --> 03:15:36.140]  They say because they're protecting the kids.
[03:15:36.140 --> 03:15:37.421]  And so, it's a judge.
[03:15:37.421 --> 03:15:39.143]  It's not a jury.
[03:15:39.143 --> 03:15:40.584]  And it's totally illegal.
[03:15:40.584 --> 03:15:50.273]  And now it's come out that they have quotas on taking kids, and it's all a big casino gulag, like Max talks about, meant to destroy families and get as much money as possible.
[03:15:50.273 --> 03:15:52.435]  I appreciate your call.
[03:15:52.435 --> 03:15:54.657]  Your take on the family courts, Max Keiser?
[03:15:55.430 --> 03:16:03.855]  It plays into the privatization of the prison system and companies like Corrections Corps of America, which is a publicly listed corporation on the New York Stock Exchange.
[03:16:03.855 --> 03:16:06.397]  The more prisoners they have, the more profits they make.
[03:16:06.397 --> 03:16:09.979]  Not only do they own the prison, but they own the restaurants and hotels near the prison.
[03:16:09.979 --> 03:16:15.703]  So when you go to visit your family in prison, you stay at the hotel and you eat at the restaurant that is owned by the prison.
[03:16:15.703 --> 03:16:17.684]  And it's a hugely profitable business.
[03:16:17.684 --> 03:16:22.026]  You put kids in prison, it's just more money for the private prison operators.
[03:16:23.007 --> 03:16:26.173]  And I've noticed I've done an analysis of the big three prison companies.
[03:16:26.173 --> 03:16:30.562]  They're all tied to big banks that Bloomberg admits are laundering the drug money.
[03:16:30.562 --> 03:16:33.728]  So the drug dealers own the prisons your kids are in.
[03:16:34.465 --> 03:16:38.629]  Well, did you see that story about Wachovia, which is now owned by Wells Fargo?
[03:16:38.629 --> 03:16:45.715]  They were caught laundering $250 billion for drug cartels in Mexico.
[03:16:45.715 --> 03:16:46.896]  They even owned the aircraft!
[03:16:46.896 --> 03:16:48.217]  They even owned the aircraft!
[03:16:48.217 --> 03:16:49.699]  Yeah, they don't deny it.
[03:16:49.699 --> 03:16:51.560]  They just gave it a slap on the wrist.
[03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:52.341]  They paid a fine.
[03:16:53.782 --> 03:17:12.137]  It's amazing that back in 2008, when the credit crisis was at its nadir, and Hank Paulson was in front of Congress begging for a $700 billion to keep his buddy Goldman Sachs alive, the only cash available to roll over short-term paper on Wall Street was available from the drug cartel.
[03:17:12.137 --> 03:17:13.678]  And this is a documented fact.
[03:17:13.678 --> 03:17:16.881]  They're the only organization in the world that had actual cash.
[03:17:17.501 --> 03:17:22.045]  Everyone else was rolling virtual treasury nonsense.
[03:17:22.045 --> 03:17:26.749]  Well, that's the point I'm trying to make, is that we're in deadly danger, folks.
[03:17:26.749 --> 03:17:38.199]  I mean, when I say the government and the big megacorporations are completely ruthless and criminal and want to bankrupt you so they can have an emergency reorganization and secure their ill-gotten gains, I mean it.
[03:17:38.199 --> 03:17:45.265]  I mean, none of us, whether you work for the FBI or you're a schoolteacher or a nuclear physicist or a TV host like Max Keiser,
[03:17:46.506 --> 03:17:49.128]  99% of us are on the short end of the stick in this.
[03:17:49.128 --> 03:17:55.913]  The New World, they got so many petty people they give little badges and security clearances to and these little power trips.
[03:17:55.913 --> 03:17:58.455]  Folks, you better choose sides now.
[03:17:58.455 --> 03:18:01.958]  We better decide to get rid of these people or it's over.
[03:18:01.958 --> 03:18:05.821]  I mean, I'm not kidding around here.
[03:18:05.821 --> 03:18:06.922]  Max, comments?
[03:18:09.056 --> 03:18:13.678]  Well, I think the demarcation between safety and money.
[03:18:13.678 --> 03:18:15.919]  You know, on Wall Street, we have what we call the F.U.
[03:18:15.919 --> 03:18:19.761]  money, which is the amount of money you needed to basically say F.U.
[03:18:19.761 --> 03:18:21.142]  to the system.
[03:18:21.142 --> 03:18:25.744]  And, you know, back in the 80s, I think if you had $10 or $20 million, you could comfortably say F.U.
[03:18:25.744 --> 03:18:26.744]  to the system.
[03:18:26.744 --> 03:18:30.206]  But today, that number is up in the $100 to $200 million range.
[03:18:30.206 --> 03:18:37.109]  And once you've got $100 or $200 million to really seriously bribe the politicians who need to bribe to stay out of prison, you are vulnerable.
[03:18:38.717 --> 03:18:40.799]  I've heard a lot of really rich people talk about F.U.
[03:18:40.799 --> 03:18:41.739]  money.
[03:18:41.739 --> 03:18:46.864]  People worth 2-3 billion that 3-4 years ago left and they said there will be no America.
[03:18:46.864 --> 03:18:57.072]  And I guess that's the only positive thing is the top globalist and then their wealth, you know, wealthy people who they're in the same family with but who disagree with each other.
[03:18:57.072 --> 03:18:58.873]  There's a lot of fights going on within these families.
[03:18:59.794 --> 03:19:05.955]  Uh, they realize they've destroyed things so badly, that was even in the Financial Times last year, that it may destroy their own system.
[03:19:05.955 --> 03:19:10.436]  They've been so greedy, it's gotten out of control in this orgy of looting.
[03:19:10.436 --> 03:19:16.477]  And so, the fact that they're leaving the country shows they know there's a good chance they're gonna end up going to prison.
[03:19:16.477 --> 03:19:19.617]  Well, the old adage here, don't slaughter.
[03:19:19.617 --> 03:19:28.179]  And a few greedy folks slaughtered the golden goose of the vulnerable and culpable and gullible American public.
[03:19:30.486 --> 03:19:34.689]  We're going to go to Bright, come back and jam in Joe, BJ, Steve, a few others with Max Keiser.
[03:19:34.689 --> 03:19:38.351]  Always informative to have Max on with us once a month.
[03:19:38.351 --> 03:19:39.852]  His website's MaxKeiser.com.
[03:19:39.852 --> 03:19:42.214]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:19:42.214 --> 03:19:48.878]  The search term today that we want to push to number one, we've done this three or four times the last five days, is Google Spies.
[03:19:48.878 --> 03:19:51.920]  Because, don't use the old terms, they're now blocking those.
[03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:54.402]  So just search the term Google Spies.
[03:19:54.402 --> 03:20:00.086]  It'll take them right to PrisonPlanet.com and the Obama Deception and how we expose Google and they are a bunch of NSA spies.
[03:20:06.169 --> 03:20:08.131]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:20:08.131 --> 03:20:10.033]  Afraid to answer your door?
[03:20:10.033 --> 03:20:17.321]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:20:17.321 --> 03:20:19.544]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:20:19.544 --> 03:20:21.566]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:20:21.566 --> 03:20:25.230]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another
[03:20:25.230 --> 03:20:25.450]  I think so.
[03:20:41.696 --> 03:20:46.118]  ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com is the quickest solution to debt relief on the planet.
[03:20:46.118 --> 03:20:51.680]  If you have more than $25,000 in credit card debt, student loans, or difficult mortgage situation, we can help.

[03:21:01.543 --> 03:21:03.925]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:21:03.925 --> 03:21:06.247]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:21:06.247 --> 03:21:09.449]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:21:09.449 --> 03:21:14.553]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:21:14.553 --> 03:21:18.756]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:21:19.056 --> 03:21:21.419]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:21:21.419 --> 03:21:24.302]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:21:24.302 --> 03:21:27.225]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:21:27.225 --> 03:21:34.814]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:21:35.157 --> 03:21:40.540]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:21:40.540 --> 03:21:42.861]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:21:42.861 --> 03:21:47.083]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:21:47.083 --> 03:21:48.144]  And I got news for you.
[03:21:48.144 --> 03:21:49.485]  You're everyone else.
[03:21:49.485 --> 03:21:50.985]  Invisible Empire.

[03:22:00.774 --> 03:22:10.801]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:22:10.801 --> 03:22:17.225]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:22:17.225 --> 03:22:26.091]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:22:26.451 --> 03:22:35.639]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:22:35.639 --> 03:22:40.243]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[03:22:40.243 --> 03:22:42.045]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:42.045 --> 03:22:44.547]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:22:44.827 --> 03:22:48.149]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.149 --> 03:22:52.331]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:22:52.331 --> 03:22:53.211]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.211 --> 03:22:53.592]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.791 --> 03:23:04.675]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[03:23:04.675 --> 03:23:06.637]  And I know you are too.
[03:23:06.637 --> 03:23:07.678]  Are you ready?
[03:23:07.678 --> 03:23:09.619]  Don't wait for an emergency to happen.
[03:23:09.619 --> 03:23:14.224]  Put a plan together now with quality dehydrated food from Ready Reserve Foods.
[03:23:14.224 --> 03:23:20.770]  For nearly 40 years, Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation canning the finest in dehydrated foods.
[03:23:20.770 --> 03:23:22.812]  Other companies just broker canned foods.

[03:23:52.875 --> 03:23:53.596]  We're good to go.
[03:24:18.118 --> 03:24:20.279]  Let's talk to John in Las Vegas.
[03:24:20.279 --> 03:24:22.341]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[03:24:22.341 --> 03:24:23.081]  Go ahead, John.
[03:24:23.081 --> 03:24:24.462]  Joe.
[03:24:24.462 --> 03:24:25.483]  Hey, Joe in Las Vegas.
[03:24:25.483 --> 03:24:25.863]  Alex.
[03:24:25.863 --> 03:24:28.545]  First of all, I want to say we love you.
[03:24:28.545 --> 03:24:39.852]  We respect you, my wife and I. And yesterday I posted a comment on your message board under InfoWars.com under the Obama Deception Censored.
[03:24:39.852 --> 03:24:46.956]  And today when I checked my stats on my own site, I noticed that the Homeland Security gave me a visit.
[03:24:47.478 --> 03:24:52.739]  And the way I know that is you have to register and actually enter the entry page and it records it.
[03:24:52.739 --> 03:24:57.500]  And I got a screenshot right now up on that link that I posted my comment from.
[03:24:57.500 --> 03:25:01.301]  Oh yeah, we pay our tax money to be spied on by a bunch of private corporate crooks.
[03:25:01.301 --> 03:25:04.582]  I mean, Kaiser, how creepy is that?
[03:25:04.582 --> 03:25:08.103]  Well, it gets back to something called the asymptotic curve.
[03:25:08.103 --> 03:25:15.545]  The cost for data storage, data processing, and data transmission is constantly moving towards zero.
[03:25:16.158 --> 03:25:22.925]  So, it doesn't cost anything for the government, or it costs, of course, a lot of money, but the cost to them is getting cheaper every day.
[03:25:22.925 --> 03:25:25.248]  So, they just rake information.
[03:25:25.248 --> 03:25:30.353]  So, to get a visit to a website, to your website, to make a comment, sure.
[03:25:30.353 --> 03:25:32.135]  Just put that into their master database.
[03:25:32.135 --> 03:25:35.499]  Another company on the Top Secret America list, by the way, is Oracle.
[03:25:35.979 --> 03:25:36.880]  We're good to go.
[03:25:57.219 --> 03:26:02.702]  Bloggers, the blog, because you have an international audience, it's cheap for the government to spy.
[03:26:02.702 --> 03:26:14.627]  But what's asymmetric and what's unacceptable is that the government simply gets rid of the competition, gets rid of all the blogs, gets rid of all the dissenting views, and keeps all the economies of scale having cheap surveillance technology.
[03:26:14.627 --> 03:26:16.088]  That's completely busted, man.
[03:26:16.088 --> 03:26:17.489]  We want to compete fairly.
[03:26:17.489 --> 03:26:18.649]  We want to be free speech.
[03:26:18.649 --> 03:26:20.070]  We want to have views and opinions.
[03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:21.310]  Express!
[03:26:21.310 --> 03:26:30.152]  We don't want to have to blog for credit to go into a virtual slave plantation to get processed cheese for every 14 hours of clicking we do.
[03:26:30.152 --> 03:26:31.093]  That's not tolerable.
[03:26:31.093 --> 03:26:33.613]  We're not going to stand for that.
[03:26:33.613 --> 03:26:34.893]  Joe, I appreciate your call.
[03:26:34.893 --> 03:26:35.574]  Good points.
[03:26:35.574 --> 03:26:38.834]  BJ in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:26:38.834 --> 03:26:40.875]  Hi, Alex and Max.
[03:26:40.875 --> 03:26:47.677]  Um, Alex, something happened yesterday that was smaller than what you're going through, but just as important.
[03:26:47.677 --> 03:26:49.217]  Dr. Rima Labo,
[03:26:50.043 --> 03:26:51.844]  I don't know if you recall her.
[03:26:51.844 --> 03:26:53.765]  She was in Conspiracy Theory.
[03:26:53.765 --> 03:26:56.086]  No, no, I've interviewed her many times.
[03:26:56.086 --> 03:26:56.786]  She's a doctor.
[03:26:56.786 --> 03:26:59.348]  She's the wife of General Stubblebine.
[03:26:59.348 --> 03:27:05.491]  She was hacked and blocked from doing her Sunday night radio show on Blog Talk Radio.
[03:27:05.939 --> 03:27:06.539]  No, I know.
[03:27:06.539 --> 03:27:07.400]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:27:07.400 --> 03:27:10.622]  There's massive censorship intensifying everywhere.
[03:27:10.622 --> 03:27:12.063]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:12.063 --> 03:27:18.247]  Max, there's no doubt they are really testing their system now, and they're openly saying they're going to start censoring us more.
[03:27:18.247 --> 03:27:20.028]  I mean, the government's admitting it.
[03:27:20.028 --> 03:27:20.729]  That's chilling.
[03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.490]  Right.
[03:27:22.490 --> 03:27:36.854]  I mean, it's not an accident that my shows are on RT, Russia Today, Press TV, which is Iranian, France 24, BBC, and Global TV Network.
[03:27:36.854 --> 03:27:38.094]  The reason I'm not on a U.S.
[03:27:38.094 --> 03:27:40.015]  network is because the U.S.
[03:27:40.015 --> 03:27:42.435]  considers my information to be too inflammatory.
[03:27:42.435 --> 03:27:45.156]  So I'm on a network outside of the U.S.
[03:27:46.926 --> 03:27:51.372]  Al Jazeera English, we made a film on Al Jazeera English a year before Iceland collapsed.
[03:27:51.372 --> 03:27:52.654]  It was called Money Geyser.
[03:27:52.654 --> 03:27:57.560]  And we went to Iceland and we said to the people there, your economy and currency will collapse within a year.
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:27:58.862]  Exactly what happened.
[03:27:58.862 --> 03:27:59.603]  Nobody in the U.S.
[03:27:59.603 --> 03:28:00.804]  had broadcast that film.
[03:28:00.804 --> 03:28:02.647]  Only Al Jazeera English had broadcast that film.
[03:28:02.947 --> 03:28:14.437]  Had people in the United States seen that film, and we talk about the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brokers talking about collapsing the Atlantic economy in Reykjavik a year before it happened, then maybe somebody in the U.S.
[03:28:14.437 --> 03:28:20.942]  would have started to question what was going on in their own economy, and maybe the crash of 2008 wouldn't have happened the way it did.
[03:28:20.942 --> 03:28:23.324]  But, you see, we weren't allowed to play that film in the U.S.
[03:28:23.324 --> 03:28:26.687]  because it's considered to be against the interests of Wall Street banks.
[03:28:26.687 --> 03:28:28.108]  But Al Jazeera English played that film.
[03:28:28.388 --> 03:28:35.075]  So people all around the world in India and Bangladesh and Pakistan and Europe and Asia and Middle East knew about the crash that was coming.
[03:28:35.075 --> 03:28:38.938]  But nobody in America knew about it because these films wouldn't play in America.
[03:28:38.938 --> 03:28:41.601]  By the way, Al Jazeera does reach hundreds of millions of people.
[03:28:41.601 --> 03:28:42.582]  It's bigger than most U.S.
[03:28:42.582 --> 03:28:43.283]  networks.
[03:28:43.283 --> 03:28:44.264]  But it's banned from the U.S.
[03:28:45.879 --> 03:28:46.900]  It's banned from the U.S.
[03:28:46.900 --> 03:28:56.927]  because they are dealing with the factual matters, and they have real journalism on there, which we expose the bankers, and we show the public exactly how the games are played.
[03:28:56.927 --> 03:29:05.593]  We had a film on there called Rig the Market, which, and I outlined 13 ways that banks rig the market, and that was two years before the crash of 2008.
[03:29:05.593 --> 03:29:06.033]  All right, Max.
[03:29:07.754 --> 03:29:08.435]  We're out of time.
[03:29:08.435 --> 03:29:10.616]  I look forward to having you back next month.
[03:29:10.616 --> 03:29:12.398]  Folks can find out more at MaxKaiser.com.
[03:29:12.398 --> 03:29:15.520]  Of course, our websites are InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[03:29:15.520 --> 03:29:16.380]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:29:16.380 --> 03:29:17.761]  All right.
[03:29:17.761 --> 03:29:19.082]  Bye.
[03:29:19.082 --> 03:29:19.783]  There goes Max.
[03:29:19.783 --> 03:29:20.884]  What a character.
[03:29:20.884 --> 03:29:25.527]  I want to thank everybody for the great job you've done getting the word out about the Obama deception being censored.
[03:29:25.527 --> 03:29:27.449]  We won a big victory with it being reposted.
[03:29:31.886 --> 03:29:33.427]  We're gonna end the live transmission now.
[03:29:33.427 --> 03:29:38.848]  We'll give you 30 minutes from the first hour, retransmit it, then we'll go back into all the other key stuff that happened throughout the day.
[03:29:38.848 --> 03:29:44.890]  It was an amazing broadcast and a lot of news got covered at the start of the second hour, so stay with us for that coming up in the rebroadcast.
[03:29:44.890 --> 03:29:47.851]  But the Obama Deception on DVD, get it, get it out to everybody.
[03:29:47.851 --> 03:29:51.433]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:51.433 --> 03:29:55.334]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.334 --> 03:29:58.055]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
