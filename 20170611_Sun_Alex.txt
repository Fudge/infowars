[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:06.160 --> 00:14.400]  It's already Sunday, June 11th, 2017, here's a powerful report from John Bowning and we're
[00:14.400 --> 00:15.400]  live.
[00:15.400 --> 00:23.240]  June 10th, 2017, Act 4 American, led by global Islamic terrorism expert Bridget Gabriel, staged
[00:23.240 --> 00:29.400]  roughly 30 anti-Sharia rallies in cities across America to bring average Americans face-to-face
[00:29.400 --> 00:35.040]  with those that would support honor killings, female mutilation, and a creeping non-conformist
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.240]  Sharia law into the final holdout known as these United States of America.
[00:40.240 --> 00:45.880]  Why I'm here is if they start violence, if they start attacking people, vandalize them.
[00:45.880 --> 00:49.360]  You know, cops are generally told to back down throughout America.
[00:49.360 --> 00:54.080]  It's going to take the American people to stand up to these guys and put them into place.
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.280]  You know, they have every right to do this, I respect that, I'm a patriot, and I will
[00:58.280 --> 01:01.320]  not sit by and watch them assault the vandalizers.
[01:01.320 --> 01:13.560]  Look at this man, back to your group and you tell them, you got a lot of history business,
[01:13.560 --> 01:14.560]  I told you.
[01:14.560 --> 01:20.920]  So, bottom line is these guys have got to know that America is not going to put up with
[01:20.920 --> 01:21.920]  them.
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.120]  Warren Morris, a victim of female mutilation and protected by oathkeepers after her life
[01:26.120 --> 01:31.400]  was threatened for speaking at the event, spoke in solidarity with the victims of Sharia
[01:31.400 --> 01:34.920]  law already affecting females in the United States.
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.760]  So what happened was, um, Act for America put up the Facebook event, right? March against
[01:41.760 --> 01:51.040]  Sharia and somehow decided or heard from other people that call Act for America a hate group.
[01:51.040 --> 01:58.040]  So all of a sudden here comes all these terms. Racism, which Islam is not a race.
[01:58.040 --> 02:08.040]  Yo, Islam isn't a race. Yo, your sign makes no sense.
[02:08.040 --> 02:13.880]  If you took a poll with any of these people over here, I'll bet you they could not even
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.720]  tell you what Sharia is. I don't see any Muslim people out there. Do you see any Muslim people
[02:19.720 --> 02:27.480]  out there? They don't want to associate with these people. These people started, these people
[02:27.480 --> 02:34.360]  started their own agenda and they started their own march and they made it about Trump
[02:34.360 --> 02:40.280]  and we're standing out there all day with our signs about women's rights, you know,
[02:40.280 --> 02:46.720]  safety, safety for women, you know, domestic violence and all this kind of stuff and they're
[02:46.720 --> 02:53.360]  out there yelling, bigot, fascist, everything. So they changed the narrative and they took
[02:53.360 --> 02:58.160]  it away. They took it away and they're coming out here marching for something that we are
[02:58.160 --> 03:03.800]  not about. But the statistics that I got just this week is that there are somewhere between
[03:03.800 --> 03:12.480]  27 and 30 actual auto killings that get discovered and get found out in the U.S., here, in the
[03:12.480 --> 03:20.440]  U.S. and Texas is a high risk state for that, New York is a high risk state that, you know,
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.640]  the public doesn't see it because these are women who live in the shadows. You've got
[03:24.640 --> 03:28.560]  to understand these are women that are not allowed to do anything. They're not allowed
[03:28.560 --> 03:35.560]  to go outside without a guardian, okay? And they're bringing a culture like that to the
[03:35.560 --> 03:40.520]  greatest country on the earth that has laws to protect them better than any place they
[03:40.520 --> 03:48.520]  have ever lived, ever. Our laws protect women. And the Sharia courts that want to raise up,
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.520]  that's what it's about. They want to take those rights away from women.
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.520]  We're standing with our white supremacist guys, we're here with our white supremacists.
[03:57.520 --> 03:58.520]  We're these guys.
[03:58.520 --> 04:01.520]  Alright, am I a white supremacist too?
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.520]  Not some of them.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.520]  How about we're just Americans?
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.520]  I think this is a Nazi flag. There's a lawyer that actually thought that was a Nazi flag.
[04:11.520 --> 04:12.520]  Really?
[04:12.520 --> 04:13.520]  Yeah.
[04:13.520 --> 04:14.520]  This is where the kid can kick down.
[04:14.520 --> 04:19.520]  Yeah, it's Kekistan. We're going to create our own country of like-minded people that
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.520]  aren't triggered by the minutiae that you focus on every day of your life.
[04:24.520 --> 04:31.520]  This is the free speech trap and they fell for it. They're not like rats. They don't know
[04:31.520 --> 04:36.520]  what to do. And as soon as I get up here I get called a fascist Nazi and all this other
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.520]  sh**. This guy's pissed his pants while he's telling me this.
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.520]  As expected, the Soros shill patrol known as Antifa was in full effect, offering zero
[04:45.520 --> 04:51.520]  topics for a rational debate. Their mind numbing cult-like teenage shrills, a reverse of the
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.520]  intended effect of dividing the Americans that gathered to question Antifa's moronic
[04:57.520 --> 05:04.520]  subversion, actually bringing average tax-paying Americans on their day off together to focus
[05:04.520 --> 05:08.520]  on the tide of extremism threatening the country's future.
[05:08.520 --> 05:10.520]  John Bowne, 3-4, Stock Talk.
[05:10.520 --> 05:17.520]  In the middle name, I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.520]  that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's
[05:22.520 --> 05:29.520]  organic and high quality. This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.520]  that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it. And if they're such
[05:34.520 --> 05:38.520]  patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging. It is an answer
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.520]  to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign of verado
[05:42.520 --> 05:48.520]  ship, an additional 25% off. It's all there. The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant,
[05:48.520 --> 05:53.520]  the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing. It is the exact same product, just the name
[05:53.520 --> 05:59.520]  is different, EmRick's Essentials and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores
[05:59.520 --> 06:04.520]  buying it directly from infowarstore.com. Help us win the info war while getting products
[06:04.520 --> 06:19.520]  that needs infowars.live.com where you'll find the entire line of EmRick's Essentials.
[06:34.520 --> 06:53.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. We're broadcasting worldwide and
[06:53.520 --> 07:00.880]  we're live on this Sunday, the 11th day of June 2017. Jack Basobiak will be joining us
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.760]  in the second hour. His new book came out today, but the reason I called him to come
[07:04.760 --> 07:10.960]  on is I saw a New York Times story that illustrates everything we're dealing with with the fake
[07:10.960 --> 07:23.520]  mainstream news. It said, well here's the headline, it says in the article that no one
[07:23.520 --> 07:39.520]  ever said in Congress that Trump was not told that he wasn't under investigation by the
[07:39.520 --> 07:47.360]  Russians or that Trump had ever blocked an investigation into the Russians. And then
[07:47.360 --> 07:54.200]  I've got the congressional clips of Senator Burr, you name it, it's all right here and
[07:54.200 --> 07:59.880]  it makes my head spin that they sit there and they lie in the New York Times and say
[07:59.880 --> 08:04.640]  Jack Basobiak put out a fake headline that got picked up by infowars and then picked
[08:04.640 --> 08:15.840]  up by Rush Limbaugh this week. And that is that Trump never ordered, these lies are so
[08:15.840 --> 08:25.600]  incredible that Trump never ordered the FBI Director Comey to stop investigating or that
[08:25.600 --> 08:30.080]  Trump never tried to influence the investigation. And I've got multiple hearings, including
[08:30.080 --> 08:36.840]  the one last week, where Comey says that's the case and then they write news articles
[08:36.840 --> 08:45.640]  saying it's fake news. They even show a quote, Basobiak put out and they say this is fake
[08:45.640 --> 08:54.520]  and we have C-SPAN on May 3rd and then again this week, whatever date it was, what was
[08:54.520 --> 09:01.880]  Thursday's date if it's the 11th now, the 10th, the 98th. I mean these lies are so
[09:01.880 --> 09:09.360]  blaring and so incredible I have trouble even being able to articulate it. It's so simple,
[09:09.360 --> 09:17.160]  it's complex, it's so whopper that I don't even know what to do at this point and of
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.880]  course I'm in the article, it says I'm fake. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play
[09:23.880 --> 09:31.280]  you the clip of last Thursday in the hearing. I've been answering the question on national
[09:31.280 --> 09:35.800]  television, it was on every major news network in the country, probably in the world and
[09:35.800 --> 09:41.160]  they just say it's fake. Here's the headline of the New York Times, a pro-Trump conspiracy
[09:41.160 --> 09:51.360]  theorist, a false tweet and a runaway story. Now I am getting Basobiak on about this, I'm
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.920]  not getting into all the other news but this is huge because it deals with fake news, this
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.880]  illustrates everything, it's a Rosetta Stone, it's a skeleton key, it opens every door because
[10:00.880 --> 10:08.680]  we're going to show you the clip last Thursday and we're going to show you the clip from
[10:08.680 --> 10:16.360]  May 3rd when he also previously said it and then they say it never happened. Ladies and
[10:16.360 --> 10:21.720]  gentlemen, you don't have to believe me after I play the clips, you can Google James Comey,
[10:21.720 --> 10:26.640]  Trump did not ask me to drop investigation into Russia election meddling and you'll get
[10:26.640 --> 10:33.840]  AP Reuters, London Independent but none of it makes it on TV. I mean look, right here,
[10:33.840 --> 10:37.960]  just type it in, you'll get hundreds of stories but we have the video, I mean just forget having
[10:37.960 --> 10:44.320]  to read it, it's not just us saying it, James Comey, Trump did not ask me to drop investigation
[10:44.320 --> 10:50.200]  into Russia election meddling and then we have the clip, Senator Burr asking the question
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.160]  but so did others, we've got him saying it three times on Thursday, three of them, I
[10:55.160 --> 10:59.680]  was covering it live Thursday, David Knight was covering it live, we played the clips,
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.280]  we're going to go over all of it for you but here's the problem, I've got a stack of news
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.160]  here today that's just as fake, I don't even have time to cover all the lies, that's where
[11:08.160 --> 11:12.800]  they're beating us, is they're lying so much in such a wall of deception that we can't even
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.840]  counter it, you've just got to know they're lying, here's another one, Trump's son tweeted
[11:17.840 --> 11:26.160]  80 times in defense of his father and in there, he's saying my dad didn't order him to stop
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.760]  investigating this, he was saying C vindicated, Comey said, in the tweet he says C, Comey says
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.480]  my dad didn't order him to do it because he didn't, if my dad orders you it's completely
[11:36.480 --> 11:47.840]  clear and then that is on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, everywhere with the headline that Trump's
[11:47.840 --> 11:58.080]  oldest son confirms the testimony that Comey gave that he was ordered to stop investigating,
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.400]  now there's a double lie there, he didn't tweet that, he said the opposite and the real
[12:03.400 --> 12:12.240]  video of Comey, three times last Thursday he says that Trump didn't, I mean ladies and
[12:12.240 --> 12:17.520]  gentlemen we have, I don't even know how you can lie like this, I mean this gives me a
[12:17.520 --> 12:28.320]  headache, this gives me a headache because it's just so insane, so let me cover this
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.120]  first, I'm gonna go to all the other news and then Jack the sobiex joining us, no they
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.000]  hate Jack so because he's effective, just like we're effective at Info Wars, just like
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.640]  Paul Watson's effective at PrisonPlanet.com, just like people like Mike Cernovich are
[12:41.640 --> 12:47.200]  effective with the great work he's doing because we're in live time battling these people and
[12:47.200 --> 12:53.480]  we're pointing out their lies, and I was on my Twitter this morning on Real Alex Jones
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.520]  and I saw Cernovich, we should probably get on tomorrow, he's such a great guy, the first
[13:00.520 --> 13:10.320]  guy I know that has more energy than I do, and he tweets that, look the New York Times
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.960]  says that this was never said and I clicked it and I could not believe it, but you know
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.960]  what I should have believed it because it already happened to me back a few weeks ago,
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.440]  let me start going over this, I'm gonna play the clips here for you, and this is the video,
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.880]  you know we're live right now on the radio, hundreds of stations across the country streaming
[13:27.880 --> 13:33.760]  at infowars.com as a television broadcast, infowars.com, but this is what you should
[13:33.760 --> 13:39.040]  send your so-called liberal friends and just say do you like being lied to because they
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.720]  say we're the fake news all day and use like the one correction we do a year where we make
[13:43.720 --> 13:47.680]  a mistake and go look he admits he's fake, he here, Jones you know, no it's because we're
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.800]  not fake, then we make mistakes, we come and tell you, our credibility is everything and
[13:51.800 --> 13:59.840]  that means when we're wrong we'll tell you, this is the media that's been caught lying
[13:59.840 --> 14:07.600]  so much and in so many ways it makes everybody's head spin, so here's the facts, here's the
[14:07.600 --> 14:15.040]  London Independent, Thursday, June 8th, 2017, James Comey, Trump did not ask me to drop
[14:15.040 --> 14:22.880]  investigation into Russian election meddling and there's a quote of that, now let's enter
[14:22.880 --> 14:32.760]  the next story, this is one from the 18th of May with yours truly the exact same story,
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.600]  stock surge as trading floors watched breaking info wars video, it was two weeks old and
[14:38.600 --> 14:45.520]  wrong, okay, it was two weeks old, it was not wrong, it contradicted the Comey memo,
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.400]  the Comey memo came out the day before, which he now admits was the FBI director leaking
[14:51.400 --> 14:57.720]  it and so now he's saying in a memo, according to the leak, Trump ordered him to stop but
[14:57.720 --> 15:04.560]  we have him two weeks before at that time on May 3rd telling Congress that no one, the
[15:04.560 --> 15:08.680]  AG or anybody else in the administration, he said no one did, it'd be a big deal if
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.480]  anybody did, so we put that out and said okay, he's either lying about the memo which he
[15:14.480 --> 15:25.560]  now says the president didn't order him or he's lying in his testimony and that's what
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.720]  my story was about, they then got pissed off that the stock market that had been plunging
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.960]  shot up, they talked to the head of the stock market, they said no, it was the info war
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.360]  story, Alan Jones, I then beg listeners, drudge everybody else to make it the number one story,
[15:39.360 --> 15:43.280]  it did become a huge story because he's saying there's a memo that says Trump ordered him
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.840]  to lie or ordered him to sit down in an investigation, then he's saying months later, no one ever
[15:48.840 --> 15:55.760]  told me that, that's incredibly newsworthy, they just spend the whole thing and go, now
[15:55.760 --> 16:03.520]  they've done it to Pesobiac, but this time it was last Thursday on video three times,
[16:03.520 --> 16:09.080]  when we come back we're going to devastate these scumbag liars that think you're stupid.

[20:07.480 --> 20:37.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, defending the republic from enemies foreign
[20:37.160 --> 20:59.200]  and domestic, it's Alex Jones, show we have some of the best job numbers since 1984, we
[20:59.200 --> 21:03.720]  have three plus trillion in the stock market, 16 points added since he was sworn in January
[21:03.720 --> 21:09.720]  20th, another four points before he even got sworn in just on anticipation, we've got big
[21:09.720 --> 21:15.080]  media trying to deep six the economy everywhere cheerleading for the fall of Trump, that's
[21:15.080 --> 21:24.160]  coming up in the next segment but right now let's get into bonafide, pure, absolute, concerted
[21:24.160 --> 21:31.160]  daily beast, New York times and others lying about info wars, lying about yours truly,
[21:31.160 --> 21:40.280]  lying about Rush Limbaugh, lying about Jack Pasobiak, lying about anybody that tells the
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.280]  truth.
[21:41.280 --> 21:51.400]  So if you just joined us, there is a New York Times article that came out today for TV
[21:51.400 --> 21:57.520]  viewers I'll put it on screen and it's titled to be technical as it came out last night
[21:57.520 --> 22:03.680]  it's June 11th, this is June 10th, it came out on Saturday, a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist,
[22:03.680 --> 22:11.400]  a false tweet and a runaway story and you read the article and it's not till the very
[22:11.400 --> 22:16.360]  end that they tell the truth but they know that 90% of people only read the headline
[22:16.360 --> 22:24.120]  and then only about half the people out there even read down, you're just a little bit depending
[22:24.120 --> 22:27.240]  on what demographic you look at but when you come to the internet a lot of folks just look
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.480]  at the headline when you actually look at it less than half read to the bottom, there's
[22:31.480 --> 22:36.920]  different studies, different angles but they know that most people don't read the majority
[22:36.920 --> 22:44.080]  of the story they look at headlines and so you read, a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist,
[22:44.080 --> 22:53.480]  a false tweet and a runaway story and then you read the article, Jack Pasobiak had his
[22:53.480 --> 23:00.600]  Twitter sites on James B. Comey, a pro-Trump activist notorious for his amateur sleuthing
[23:00.600 --> 23:06.480]  into red herrings and they make up stuff and then you read in the article, they've got
[23:06.480 --> 23:10.840]  a quote and say here is the fake tweet, now I'm going to read you the fake tweet and you're
[23:10.840 --> 23:21.960]  going to see the video, Hirano, that's the congressperson, show the Attorney General
[23:21.960 --> 23:26.920]  or Senior Officials of the Justice Department, opposes a specific investigation, can they
[23:26.920 --> 23:36.600]  halt the FBI investigation, Comey, in theory yes, Comey, goes on, have any of them done
[23:36.600 --> 23:37.600]  that?
[23:37.600 --> 23:42.920]  No, in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something
[23:42.920 --> 23:48.280]  that without an appropriate purpose, I mean, where oftentimes they give us opinions and
[23:48.280 --> 23:53.360]  we don't see a case, there are, you ought to stop investigating resources in it, but
[23:53.360 --> 23:59.320]  I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for political reasons
[23:59.320 --> 24:07.720]  that would be a very big deal, it's not happening in my experience and then he goes on to say
[24:07.720 --> 24:17.800]  no one has done that, no one ever, now that's very, very, very clear, but they say all of
[24:17.800 --> 24:25.600]  the article he put out a completely fake story in the New York Times, they're just saying
[24:25.600 --> 24:32.480]  it's fake, later at the end of the article they say actually this was back in May and
[24:32.480 --> 24:36.640]  they weren't talking about the president, they were talking about the AG or the Attorney
[24:36.640 --> 24:40.800]  General's office in general, but Comey says no, that would be a big deal if anybody did
[24:40.800 --> 24:44.800]  that because you don't tell the FBI not to do something, that would be a big deal, nobody
[24:44.800 --> 24:54.040]  did that, now that's clear because I made a big deal out of this clip last month because
[24:54.040 --> 24:58.200]  that's when Comey came out and released the memo, we now know he was the Laker, Trump
[24:58.200 --> 25:02.080]  said that early on it's confirmed, that's the big issue here, that's so huge, so criminal,
[25:02.080 --> 25:12.360]  so illegal and Comey came out and released this memo implying but not even let you see
[25:12.360 --> 25:16.520]  the memo that Trump had ordered him to stop the investigation, so the media for a month
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.080]  ran with that, but now it turns out the memo doesn't even actually say that, so that's
[25:21.080 --> 25:26.600]  the big hoax, that's the other big fake news, so how do they fix that, well they just put
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.320]  out articles in the Daily Beast of the New York Times, Alex Jones is a liar, how daring
[25:30.320 --> 25:35.120]  boost the stock market, this has no pertinent, why was there a two week old clip, why he
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.760]  said it was new, no I didn't, in our report that Daniels wrote, I said this is a two week
[25:39.760 --> 25:44.920]  old clip of him two months after the memo's written that we now hear of saying no one
[25:44.920 --> 25:50.600]  tried to influence him, that's totally pertinent, it absolutely impeaches his testimony, 101
[25:50.600 --> 25:57.600]  Perry Mason style, so how do they counter it, they say it's fake, it's misleading, it's
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.200]  not true, hoping you just don't read the story, but forget the story, we're gonna put the
[26:01.200 --> 26:09.680]  videos for you, but it gets better, let's go to the clip from May, and then let's go
[26:09.680 --> 26:15.640]  to the clip from Thursday with Senator Burr, here is the clip, the flashback from May.
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.120]  So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific
[26:20.120 --> 26:25.800]  investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[26:25.800 --> 26:28.320]  In theory, yes.
[26:28.320 --> 26:29.320]  Has it happened?
[26:29.320 --> 26:34.600]  Not in my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing
[26:34.600 --> 26:39.840]  something that without appropriate purpose, I mean, we're oftentimes, they give us opinions
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.080]  that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it, but
[26:44.080 --> 26:48.000]  I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason,
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.360]  that would be a very big deal, it's not happened in my experience.
[26:52.360 --> 26:57.600]  It's not happened in my experience, they went, fake news, they're saying the attorney general,
[26:57.600 --> 27:03.280]  that's the president's office, that's the executive, that's the same thing.
[27:03.280 --> 27:07.840]  It's very clear that in his experience, it's not happened.
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.120]  This is two months after the secret memo, February 18th is written, that they don't
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.320]  give the press, somebody leaks it, Comey, now admits it, if you were hiding in a cave
[27:16.320 --> 27:17.320]  somewhere.
[27:17.320 --> 27:22.720]  So this adds great credibility to Trump, what do they do about it?
[27:22.720 --> 27:25.760]  They ignore it, but what do they do when three different senators asked the question last
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.280]  Thursday, and it's in the news, what do we do, what do we do?
[27:29.280 --> 27:35.080]  They confirm everything Trump said, you just come out and you say Trump's son says that
[27:35.080 --> 27:41.680]  his father ordered him, or ordered Comey to not investigate, it's not true, his son didn't
[27:41.680 --> 27:47.480]  say it, but CNN just runs the headline and they don't care.
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.440]  Same deal, total lies, cuz they're so scared of this, of Comey being in peace, he's being
[27:52.440 --> 27:54.320]  exposed as a liar.
[27:54.320 --> 28:01.680]  So let's go to Senator Byrd, very quick clip, headlines everywhere about it, ask him about
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.960]  it and Comey says no, he did not order me to stop the Russia investigation, is this
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.960]  fake news too?
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.960]  Here it is.
[28:09.960 --> 28:18.160]  Director Comey, did the President at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into
[28:18.160 --> 28:21.520]  Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.400]  Not to my understanding, no.
[28:23.400 --> 28:28.760]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you
[28:28.760 --> 28:31.400]  to stop the Russian investigation?
[28:31.400 --> 28:32.400]  No.
[28:32.400 --> 28:44.400]  Director, when the President requested that you, and I quote, let Flynn go, General Flynn
[28:44.400 --> 28:51.640]  had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense.
[28:51.640 --> 28:58.000]  And if press accounts are right, there might have been discrepancies between FACTS and his
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  FBI testimony.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.680]  In your estimation, we'll be right back.
[29:03.680 --> 29:09.400]  The point is, the Soviet tweet is the exact words.
[29:09.400 --> 29:14.520]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony, Democrats hoping
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.040]  to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down when Comey's
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.320]  testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.720]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling
[29:29.720 --> 29:35.320]  rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation for
[29:35.320 --> 29:37.080]  investigating him.
[29:37.080 --> 29:42.280]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his memos to the media, the memos that further
[29:42.280 --> 29:46.040]  stirred suspicions against Trump for alleged Russian involvement.
[29:46.040 --> 29:52.200]  However, coincidentally, the fact that Trump wasn't under FBI investigation was never leaked
[29:52.200 --> 29:53.200]  to the media.
[29:53.200 --> 29:58.040]  Comey's testimony also revealed that our suspicions about Bill Clinton and Loretta
[29:58.040 --> 30:04.320]  Lynch's bizarre meeting on the tarmac were valid and may even prompt further investigation.
[30:04.320 --> 30:30.520]  For more reports go to infowars.com, this is Mellie Weaver.

[32:14.080 --> 32:18.760]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[32:18.760 --> 32:20.280]  to detoxify the body.
[32:20.280 --> 32:25.200]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[32:30.400 --> 32:33.480]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.

[33:35.400 --> 33:58.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:58.600 --> 34:13.560]  So what happens to the New York Times and the Daily Beast and others when they get caught
[34:13.560 --> 34:29.040]  saying, Comey never said that Trump did not ask him to drop the Russia investigation.
[34:29.040 --> 34:35.640]  We just played the clips of last week and then a month before in two different hearings,
[34:35.640 --> 34:43.240]  Comey's saying that and then they write articles saying I'm lying, Jack Passoviax lying, Sernovich's
[34:43.240 --> 34:44.240]  lying.
[34:44.240 --> 34:49.400]  Well, we just played you the clips and that's what they're doing.
[34:49.400 --> 34:51.420]  They're just branding us as the liars.
[34:51.420 --> 34:52.800]  I figured this out.
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.480]  They've just picked us to say we're the liars because they know full well there are hundreds
[34:58.480 --> 35:04.560]  of headlines like this and the London Independent, AP Reuters, you name it, where they did still
[35:04.560 --> 35:10.200]  put out the truth but it never hit the nightly news, James Comey, Trump did not ask me to
[35:10.200 --> 35:15.920]  drop investigation into Russian election meddling but I just played you the video clips in
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.840]  the last segment and that's it.
[35:20.840 --> 35:24.800]  They know not to challenge so-called journalistic groups when they watch C-span and write what
[35:24.800 --> 35:25.800]  we wrote.
[35:25.800 --> 35:31.600]  They just say, Oh, Alex Jones and Jack Passoviax and Mike Sernovich, they're liars, it's fake
[35:31.600 --> 35:37.200]  and then don't even show where we're liars or they show an exact tweet by Passoviax that
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.840]  is the exact words of one of the hearings and say he's a liar and then say I'm a liar
[35:42.840 --> 35:46.080]  in the article.
[35:46.080 --> 35:55.800]  I'm asking you a question, how dumb do you think they think we are?
[35:55.800 --> 35:59.680]  Or is it true we're this dumb?
[35:59.680 --> 36:00.680]  That's the question.
[36:00.680 --> 36:05.440]  I'm going to take that clip from right at that point and put it on the front of a Facebook
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.200]  and YouTube video and just lay all that out later that's going to go viral.
[36:09.200 --> 36:15.000]  I mean, New York Times caught red handed man and the problem is it's like this every day.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.120]  I've got so many articles where I know the facts, I've seen the clips, I've read the
[36:19.120 --> 36:22.200]  bill and I'm reading it and it's just total lies.
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.800]  Here's the Daily Beast, Jones put out the fake story that there were hearings and Comey
[36:27.800 --> 36:30.880]  said that Trump never asked him to drop the Russian investigation.
[36:30.880 --> 36:40.400]  And Jones is a filthy liar, more coming up at five o'clock and you're just like what?
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.200]  And then I go to any party or anywhere in public and people walk up and they go oh you're
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.000]  all over the news, you're that guy, you're like known as the ultimate liar and I'm like
[36:50.000 --> 36:58.120]  I am, ultimate liar, yeah, sure I am.
[36:58.120 --> 36:59.120]  But that's the idiots.
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.920]  I mean, there's a large portion of the public that understands are being lied to, not because
[37:02.920 --> 37:06.560]  I told them, they figured out for themselves, but I don't see how the New York Times is
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.160]  getting away with this.
[37:08.160 --> 37:11.160]  I don't see how CNN is getting away with this.
[37:11.160 --> 37:18.920]  I don't see how they do this anymore because I mean, I saw the clip and I read the tweets
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.440]  that were similar where Donald Jr. was live time tweeting the same stuff we were tweeting,
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.880]  not that he was even following us, it's true, Comey says no, he never asked me to block
[37:29.880 --> 37:31.320]  the Russian investigation.
[37:31.320 --> 37:35.960]  He tweets total vindication, exactly what my dad said.
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.520]  If my dad told him to do it, it'd be straightforward.
[37:39.520 --> 37:43.760]  They go, they said if his dad told him that it'd be straightforward, that means his dad
[37:43.760 --> 37:44.760]  did do it.
[37:44.760 --> 37:49.320]  No, Comey said it didn't happen, they don't care.
[37:49.320 --> 37:56.080]  They just say that Donald Jr. admits his dad did it, complete opposite, who cares?
[37:56.080 --> 38:02.920]  Because see, they know Donald Jr. isn't a coward, he's one of the best people around
[38:02.920 --> 38:07.560]  his father who's got this country's back.
[38:07.560 --> 38:11.520]  That's why they're out to destroy him as well and slap him down and demonize him and attack
[38:11.520 --> 38:12.520]  him.
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.680]  Shut up, don't stop it, you didn't see them say that on C-span, word for word he tweets
[38:17.680 --> 38:18.680]  would happen.
[38:18.680 --> 38:23.760]  Don't you see Donald Jr. lying again, why he says that Comey says that Trump never
[38:23.760 --> 38:25.160]  said stop the Russian investigation.
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.680]  And listen, I've got more news than I could cover in 15 hours.
[38:28.680 --> 38:36.400]  I've got over 150 articles here, 30 or 40 video clips, but sometimes you just can't
[38:36.400 --> 38:38.680]  focus on all of it because there's just too much.
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.440]  I could spend the next five hours just on this, this is insane.
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.960]  His son is on Fox Susan and tweets saying of course my dad didn't order him to do that,
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.520]  it wouldn't be all ambiguous.
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.560]  If my dad was ordering him to do something, he'd have just done it.
[38:53.560 --> 38:56.840]  But Comey's like well he didn't order me, but I felt like I was and it sounds like
[38:56.840 --> 38:57.840]  that's BS.
[38:57.840 --> 38:58.840]  My dad's incredibly straightforward.
[38:58.840 --> 39:06.040]  Oh, you admitted, did it, you admitted, I mean these people are scum.
[39:06.040 --> 39:11.320]  During the break I went back there and got some more water and I was sitting there watching
[39:11.320 --> 39:15.680]  CNN and it was just like Trump doesn't talk to Obama, he's the first president not to
[39:15.680 --> 39:16.680]  talk to other presidents.
[39:16.680 --> 39:18.280]  He's a horrible person.
[39:18.280 --> 39:20.720]  Just everything hammering, hammering, hammering.
[39:20.720 --> 39:27.320]  Before I get to all this other news, I want to explain to people that may be on the fence
[39:27.320 --> 39:32.160]  why I'm backing Trump so hard, why other conservatives kind of do it halfway or want to ride the fence
[39:32.160 --> 39:36.240]  rather they're all holier than now and well, you know, Trump could have done better here
[39:36.240 --> 39:37.240]  or better there.
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.440]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[39:41.440 --> 39:47.920]  If you look at history, globalists have multinational monopoly combines.
[39:47.920 --> 39:50.520]  That's what globalism is.
[39:50.520 --> 39:57.320]  Multinational tax exempt, diplomatically immune, totally cold-blooded organizations have never
[39:57.320 --> 40:02.000]  been more afraid of anything than they have of Donald John Trump.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.840]  Because he's not just some nationalist in the UK or some nationalist in France, he's
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.800]  a nationalist free market capitalist American system guy that just took over the biggest
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.640]  economy in the world and is exposing that unelected multinationals have come in and
[40:18.640 --> 40:25.640]  taken over and he's turning the economy back on because globalists can't compete with their
[40:25.640 --> 40:27.800]  monopoly economy against a free market economy.
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.640]  So they need America and its free market system to die to bring in their new managed economy.
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.240]  They can't deal with this and there are some people that have been involved in the larger
[40:37.240 --> 40:41.840]  levels of governance like Peter Thiel and others who know this, who's been actively
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.000]  trying to stop the new world order, been trying to explain to people that non-capitalist,
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.160]  non-free market systems are hellish and we can't have a hybrid between communism and
[40:50.160 --> 40:51.160]  free market.
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.360]  It's going to be a disaster.
[40:54.360 --> 40:56.440]  And Trump is another one of those voices.
[40:56.440 --> 41:03.720]  Stephen Bannon is another one of those voices that wants sanity, that want growing economies,
[41:03.720 --> 41:10.720]  that want an upwardly mobile middle class who aren't cold-blooded globalist consolidators,
[41:10.720 --> 41:17.520]  who aren't selfish jerks.
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.680]  And so I look at Trump, three trillion plus in the stock market, 16% added since he was
[41:22.680 --> 41:23.680]  sworn in.
[41:23.680 --> 41:31.920]  Another four or five percent since he was just president-elect, that's 20-something points.
[41:31.920 --> 41:38.000]  I look at hundreds of billions of new jobs, thousands of companies announcing expansion
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  or return.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.360]  And I see our flatline economy going over a cliff, suddenly bouncing back and a good
[41:44.360 --> 41:50.600]  heart rate coming back and the best jobs numbers since 1984 and just on and on and on and new
[41:50.600 --> 41:56.560]  coal plants opening up and coal mines reopening, the cheapest energy, the cleanest in the world
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.200]  with the scrubbers.
[41:58.200 --> 42:03.000]  And I see him standing up to radical Islam and I see him beginning 43% drop in illegals
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.360]  pouring across the border.
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.680]  And I see all of it and I see all the mainstream media and the communist Chinese and the corrupt
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.360]  evil Pope, the globalist anti-Catholic Pope and all these people piled on telling us how
[42:15.360 --> 42:22.720]  evil he is in Hollywood and just people panicked on the streets see me like I'm Satan because
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.640]  I just want lower taxes and to have our own sovereignty when all Trump's doing.
[42:27.640 --> 42:31.520]  I was talking to these people yesterday on the street, we're freaking out, we're business
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.360]  men, we know our 401Ks are doing great and we know our mutual funds are doing great but
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.640]  we're really worried, you know, because on and on and on they just weren't even living
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.800]  in the real world, it was just all this fantasy, this hype by Hollywood and MSM that's lying
[42:45.800 --> 42:46.800]  to them.
[42:46.800 --> 42:54.480]  I mean it's so obvious that Trump's the real deal truly delivering and they're just lying
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.520]  everywhere and only the weak minded are buying into it and folks buying to it be a peer pressure,
[42:59.520 --> 43:05.640]  you name it, it is an example of leaders versus followers but leaders have now come to the
[43:05.640 --> 43:09.080]  fore again to try to dial us back from destruction.
[43:09.080 --> 43:15.080]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[43:15.080 --> 43:16.680]  probiotic.
[43:16.680 --> 43:23.400]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[43:23.400 --> 43:31.080]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[43:31.080 --> 43:36.040]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[43:36.040 --> 43:42.680]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.280]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[43:47.280 --> 43:49.800]  probiotic on the market.
[43:49.800 --> 43:54.840]  Support your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today
[43:54.840 --> 43:58.440]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.560]  We've been testing this formula for years but this is the limited first run to the public
[44:02.560 --> 44:08.480]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.360]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[44:12.360 --> 44:15.280]  it's the air we're breathing especially for our children.
[44:15.280 --> 44:21.320]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[44:21.320 --> 44:26.280]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure ground breaking
[44:26.280 --> 44:31.240]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[44:31.240 --> 44:36.360]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[44:36.360 --> 44:38.080]  you can to purify your air.
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.120]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.120]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.320]  The general public doesn't.
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.280]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.880]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[44:55.880 --> 44:59.440]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older or more
[44:59.440 --> 45:02.640]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[45:02.640 --> 45:13.160]  Look out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com Let's go to
[45:13.160 --> 45:14.160]  Devin in Florida.
[45:14.160 --> 45:16.160]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[45:16.160 --> 45:17.160]  Great.

[45:27.960 --> 45:31.520]  swells, vitamin and infusion, I've got the body armor.
[45:31.520 --> 45:32.520]  Wow.
[45:32.520 --> 45:34.960]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[45:34.960 --> 45:36.600]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[45:36.600 --> 45:40.320]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[45:40.320 --> 45:41.320]  That's amazing.
[45:41.320 --> 45:42.320]  That's really incredible.
[45:42.320 --> 45:44.680]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[45:44.680 --> 45:45.880]  I haven't felt sweet.
[45:45.880 --> 45:52.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info wars true and I just want
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.560]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[45:56.560 --> 45:57.560]  just buy it.
[45:57.560 --> 45:58.560]  You will love it.
[45:58.560 --> 46:01.040]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[46:09.840 --> 46:11.640]  Emdix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[46:11.640 --> 46:17.960]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[46:17.960 --> 46:23.320]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[46:23.320 --> 46:24.320]  and high quality.
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.520]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[46:30.520 --> 46:33.440]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[46:33.440 --> 46:37.960]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[46:37.960 --> 46:38.960]  It is an answer to prayer.
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.000]  And because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.160]  additional 25% off.

[46:56.240 --> 47:02.520]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from infowarstore.com.

[47:06.920 --> 47:13.640]  find the entire line of Emdix Essentials.
[47:13.640 --> 47:35.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:35.960 --> 47:40.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:40.200 --> 47:47.200]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:47.200 --> 47:55.800]  Donald Trump is the man in the arena.
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.040]  You got a bunch of followers, a bunch of cowards, a bunch of idiots who live in a free country
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.360]  and have prosperity because their forebears fought and died for it, believing a bunch
[48:04.360 --> 48:10.880]  of corporate-owned, foreign globalist media that has hijacked this country via modern
[48:10.880 --> 48:12.960]  colonialism.
[48:12.960 --> 48:17.080]  Corporate colonialism is what globalism is and who are using third-world populations
[48:17.080 --> 48:22.200]  to come in and drive down wages and balkanize and break up countries.
[48:22.200 --> 48:27.120]  And the full power of this exploitive globalist system is pointed at Europe and the United
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.200]  States trying to bring us down because if there's no more upper mobility, if there's
[48:31.200 --> 48:36.920]  no more west, then the whole planet can kind of settle into the new dark age of poverty.
[48:36.920 --> 48:41.320]  And that's why I'm supporting Trump because it's so clear you know a man by his enemies
[48:41.320 --> 48:44.840]  and every evil organization on earth is against Trump.
[48:44.840 --> 48:45.840]  Is he perfect?
[48:45.840 --> 48:46.840]  Absolutely not.
[48:46.840 --> 48:50.600]  But he's trying to really bring jobs back and prosperity and empower the individual
[48:50.600 --> 48:55.560]  and build a world based around humanity, not a bunch of global elites.
[48:55.560 --> 49:04.200]  We have a guest coming on just to deal with the state of the union, Jack Basobiak and
[49:04.200 --> 49:09.280]  how the New York Times and others are running around saying that Trump did tell Comey to
[49:09.280 --> 49:11.120]  stop the Russia investigation.
[49:11.120 --> 49:13.920]  That's a whole other fake news story, they keep saying that.
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.400]  And then when we put out the videos of what really happened in the hearings, they just
[49:17.400 --> 49:18.400]  say, no, it's fake.
[49:18.400 --> 49:21.800]  Look at this transcript, it's a fake transcript.
[49:21.800 --> 49:25.400]  I can then play you the exact video word for word, I did it earlier.
[49:25.400 --> 49:30.520]  It's coming up again in the next hour because we call them liars and fake all day.
[49:30.520 --> 49:33.440]  But why do all of us think of mainstream media as deceptive?
[49:33.440 --> 49:40.640]  AP did a study last year, only 6% trust MSM.
[49:40.640 --> 49:43.760]  Our numbers are in the 80s in studies that are out there.
[49:43.760 --> 49:48.680]  And that's why they call us the fake news all day because they're scared.
[49:48.680 --> 49:57.000]  Talk about this, I've never been to Russia, but I read news about what's happening in
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.880]  Russia from our own newspapers and also read some of the Russian news that's in English.
[50:02.880 --> 50:07.960]  I read Chinese news, Japanese news, Brazilian news, Mexican news, Canadian news, you name
[50:07.960 --> 50:08.960]  it.
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.000]  I'm a news junkie.
[50:12.000 --> 50:25.120]  And I know that over 30% of the media in Russia is US owned or Western combined owned.
[50:25.120 --> 50:32.200]  Now imagine if the Russians owned 30% or more, it's like 33% of our media, we would have
[50:32.200 --> 50:35.120]  a Russian problem and I'd be angry about it.
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.240]  The truth is about a third of our media is Spanish speaking and owned by multinationals
[50:39.240 --> 50:43.240]  that are creating a whole Larica and Kisto Latin movement.
[50:43.240 --> 50:45.880]  So again, that's another part of globalism breaking our country up.
[50:45.880 --> 50:48.560]  But it's not the Russians that are doing.
[50:48.560 --> 50:54.280]  There are over 100 known NGOs funded by George Soros, a couple hundred more funded by the
[50:54.280 --> 50:55.280]  State Department.
[50:55.280 --> 51:03.080]  The State Department has spent $5 billion plus dollars four years ago to foment the overthrow
[51:03.080 --> 51:11.480]  of an elected government in Ukraine and then they stole the main Russian gas lines coming
[51:11.480 --> 51:17.720]  in out of Russia into Ukraine in the East.
[51:17.720 --> 51:21.400]  Now that's just facts.
[51:21.400 --> 51:25.840]  And then they go, oh, Russia's anti-free speech.
[51:25.840 --> 51:29.840]  They're starting to not give tax exemption to all these George Soros groups.
[51:29.840 --> 51:34.080]  The same George Soros groups that are funding Black Lives Matter, oh, I didn't even get
[51:34.080 --> 51:35.080]  to that yet.
[51:35.080 --> 51:37.320]  I'll cover some of that in the next hour as well.
[51:37.320 --> 51:44.560]  Our reporters were in downtown Austin and there were communists and Muslims beating
[51:44.560 --> 51:50.520]  up families and folks peacefully protesting against Sharia law that cuts women's genitals
[51:50.520 --> 52:00.080]  off and that doesn't let women, you know, go out without a hood over their head and
[52:00.080 --> 52:02.920]  that kills gays, throws them off buildings.
[52:02.920 --> 52:09.320]  All this is going on and literally we have hours of footage on infowars.com of Trump
[52:09.320 --> 52:13.360]  supporters being beaten up, being hit, being spit on and we got people, even more powerful
[52:13.360 --> 52:18.200]  footage, people with machine guns out there.
[52:18.200 --> 52:24.160]  Now this is the left that openly says, they don't believe anybody should own guns, but
[52:24.160 --> 52:28.000]  they're out there with hammers and sickles and machine guns and weapons threatening
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.760]  everybody and the riot police had to come in.
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.280]  You've got a couple hundred people that happen in every city in an anti-sharia law deal.
[52:36.280 --> 52:38.760]  You can't have our law, they're outside Islamic law.
[52:38.760 --> 52:39.760]  It's incredibly oppressive.
[52:39.760 --> 52:44.160]  It says you got to be a Muslim and women aren't human and all the rest of this.
[52:44.160 --> 52:46.560]  And there is just hours of footage on infowars.com.
[52:46.560 --> 52:50.040]  The most incredible stuff ever of that, but there's so much cussing, we can't really play
[52:50.040 --> 52:55.960]  it here of them screaming, cussing, attacking and it's Muslims with communists funded by
[52:55.960 --> 52:56.960]  George Soros.
[52:56.960 --> 52:59.720]  They admit Soros funded it out there, beating people up.
[52:59.720 --> 53:06.800]  I only swear, got punched repeatedly, got attacked, saying they happen to rob, dude,
[53:06.800 --> 53:08.440]  but I'm digressing.
[53:08.440 --> 53:14.200]  The point is we have George Soros funding these same groups inside Russia.
[53:14.200 --> 53:19.600]  There were hundreds of these guys in black masks with wooden clubs and they had their
[53:19.600 --> 53:23.200]  AK-47s out there on the street, but remember, these are liberals, these are communists.
[53:23.200 --> 53:25.880]  They want the government to take our guns because they're not going to give theirs up
[53:25.880 --> 53:28.520]  during some type of, you know, armed revolt.
[53:28.520 --> 53:34.600]  And they are the most incoherent, mindless, stupid, literally, mentally scrambled.
[53:34.600 --> 53:37.880]  I mean, they just look like they've been put in microwave ovens and it's not just us
[53:37.880 --> 53:38.880]  taking clips out of context.
[53:38.880 --> 53:43.000]  Somebody asked you to try to boil this down because there's like 10 hours of it.
[53:43.000 --> 53:48.000]  I watched it for like an hour last night and about two hours a day, I could not believe
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  it.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.960]  How incoherent, how hateful, how evil, and they would attack men, women and children
[53:56.960 --> 54:02.400]  and they would scream, you're violating my free speech, communism, communism, kill Trump,
[54:02.400 --> 54:08.040]  F. Alex Jones, F. Info Wars, you're a racist and then just slam people in the head and
[54:08.040 --> 54:12.920]  then the riot police would run over because it was at the Capitol and just stop them.
[54:12.920 --> 54:13.920]  They ought to arrest them.
[54:13.920 --> 54:16.200]  They should have beat their brains out because they're attacking people.
[54:16.200 --> 54:18.480]  They should have clubbed them over the head.
[54:18.480 --> 54:25.600]  The cops run over just to stop them and they go, oh, police, oh, police, oh, police, racist,
[54:25.600 --> 54:28.280]  racist, racist, racist.
[54:28.280 --> 54:34.400]  I'm not for a real police state, you're the ones bringing that in.
[54:34.400 --> 54:39.520]  The police were way too lenient and I watched all the patriots that were out there exposing
[54:39.520 --> 54:44.600]  oppressive, incompatible, fascistic, surreal law, anti-woman, anti-freedom.
[54:44.600 --> 54:50.600]  I mean, look, you got guys with clubs and shields threatening to hit the cops.
[54:50.600 --> 54:54.720]  Let me tell you something, a guy walks up to me with a club in his hand and a shield.
[54:54.720 --> 54:59.280]  I'm going to attack him because he's already set up to attack me and I'm showing video.
[54:59.280 --> 55:02.560]  If you're a radio listener, I can't play audio because they'll fit it up for a minute.
[55:02.560 --> 55:05.080]  We'll delay if there's any cussing because there's so much cussing here.
[55:05.080 --> 55:06.080]  Go ahead and fit it up.
[55:06.080 --> 55:12.920]  You know, women's rights, you know, safety for women, you know, domestic violence and
[55:12.920 --> 55:13.920]  all this.
[55:13.920 --> 55:14.920]  We can play this because it's a patriots.
[55:14.920 --> 55:15.920]  You won't cuss.
[55:15.920 --> 55:16.920]  We'll take it.
[55:16.920 --> 55:17.920]  Fastest.
[55:17.920 --> 55:18.920]  Everything.
[55:18.920 --> 55:21.760]  So they changed the narrative and they took it away.
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.000]  They took it away and they're coming out here marching for something that we are not
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  about.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.240]  But the statistics that I got just this week is that there are somewhere between 27 and
[55:32.240 --> 55:40.760]  30 actual honor killings that get discovered and get found out in the US here in the US.
[55:40.760 --> 55:45.560]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, everybody's mixed, whatever, humans, all beautiful crowd
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.160]  of people out there standing saying, Sharia Law is anti-human, Sharia Law kills gays,
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.520]  Sharia Law does honor killings of women, Sharia Law does public executions for people, you
[55:54.520 --> 55:57.840]  know, and the left is out there frothing and see here's the deal.
[55:57.840 --> 55:59.480]  I don't hype my show.
[55:59.480 --> 56:02.360]  I don't do things like other talk shows.
[56:02.360 --> 56:07.640]  I should have started the show and said, we have the most riveting communist and Muslim
[56:07.640 --> 56:09.680]  footage attacking peaceful crowds.
[56:09.680 --> 56:14.720]  Oh, it's so bombshell and oh, we have the New York Times caught in a huge fake story
[56:14.720 --> 56:15.720]  about Trump.
[56:15.720 --> 56:16.720]  Oh, it's coming up.
[56:16.720 --> 56:20.400]  I just go into whatever I think is the biggest story and I'm kind of sitting here going was
[56:20.400 --> 56:26.560]  the biggest story, the New York Times putting out fake news against Trump or is the bigger
[56:26.560 --> 56:30.800]  story on TV, I don't know what is anymore, but to have a limited crew on the week, there's
[56:30.800 --> 56:34.000]  only like three people on and that's so there's they've been up here all day getting ready.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  There's no way they could watch.
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  I'm not kidding.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.960]  We have like five hours ourselves and they're 20 hours of the video.
[56:38.960 --> 56:40.400]  I mean, I can watch it all.
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.840]  Every video on info wars is so riveting when dirty communists are beating men, women and
[56:45.840 --> 56:53.280]  children with clubs and screaming anti free speech racist like mentally ill upside down
[56:53.280 --> 56:58.960]  1984 up is down, down is up and all we're trying to do is secure the free market and
[56:58.960 --> 57:04.120]  cut taxes and get you more money and they're running around the lap of freedom, bitching
[57:04.120 --> 57:05.120]  and complaining.
[57:05.120 --> 57:06.120]  I can't handle it anymore.
[57:06.120 --> 57:07.400]  Jack Basobi acts coming up.
[57:07.400 --> 57:13.720]  I got a bunch of clips of Trump saying he'll testify saying he's 100% ready and the Comey
[57:13.720 --> 57:16.640]  again is a complete liar and a coward.
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.080]  That's all coming up second hour, but do your duty in the fight against the globalist.

[58:59.160 --> 59:04.880]  More than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been called
[59:04.880 --> 59:05.880]  the iodine conspiracy.
[59:05.880 --> 59:10.480]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[59:10.480 --> 59:15.640]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[59:15.640 --> 59:19.400]  adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[59:19.400 --> 59:24.280]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis
[59:24.280 --> 59:29.000]  worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  and your family.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.520]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[59:35.520 --> 59:41.280]  iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[59:41.280 --> 59:42.880]  ever concerning iodine.
[59:42.880 --> 59:44.840]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[59:44.840 --> 59:49.480]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any
[59:49.480 --> 59:51.320]  optimum health regimen.

[1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:52.120]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen I haven't dropped the ball but it's about two weeks ago
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:01:00.280]  I launched the contest $200,000 in prizes to go out with a shirt that says CNN is ISIS.
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:03.880]  Make your own shirts, buy our shirts.
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.640]  Just expose mainstream media as a fraud and we've got a bunch of videos in but the staff
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:14.360]  so limited we're having to plow through those to get the guests on and to cover those issues
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:16.760]  but soon we're going to really be paying up those prizes.
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:21.880]  I've already paid out a few of the guy that caught CNN doing fake newscast to cover up
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:25.920]  for the Muslim attack in Manchester and London Bridge we've done that but we're about to
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.880]  really start having those guests on playing those clips just like we did with the Bill
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:33.400]  Clinton's rapist contest but I see what you're doing it's awesome it's amazing I don't do
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:38.040]  a lot of contests because we bite off more than we can chew it really explodes in a successful
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:43.480]  way it just then it ties down our crew they even be able to deal with it all but that
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:48.360]  ball is really starting to roll so we want to really commend all of you out there great
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:49.360]  job.

[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:54.320]  we're trying as hard as we can.
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:02:00.800]  Jack Wasobiak joining us coming up in a second but first I want to play this clip Trump talks
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:06.040]  about the tapes of the Comey investigation says you're going to be very disappointed
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:11.120]  Trump says he would be a hundred percent testified or oathed a nice Comey claims on flin and loyalty
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:16.280]  Trump's smart he wants to get in there before Congress and tear the hell out of them instead
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:20.040]  they want to bring in Comey and other enemies but despite the fact that they brought Comey
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:25.640]  in he fell flat on his face that's why they want to have him back again here's the clip
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:28.240]  of Trump.
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:32.840]  Who would like to ask should I take one of the killer networks and treat me so badly
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:33.840]  as fake news?
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:34.840]  Go ahead John.
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:35.840]  Thank you.
[1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:36.840]  Be fair John.
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:37.840]  Oh absolutely.
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:46.640]  Remember how nice you used to be before I ran?
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:47.920]  Such a nice man.
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:48.920]  Always fair.
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:53.600]  Mr. President I want to get back to James Comey's testimony you suggested he didn't
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:59.280]  tell the truth and everything he said he did say under oath that you told him to let the
[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:05.200]  Flynn you said you hoped the Flynn investigation you could like he didn't say that so he lied
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:06.200]  about that.
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.200]  Well I didn't say that.
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.960]  I mean I will tell you I didn't say that and did he ask you to pledge and there'd be nothing
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:17.240]  wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today but I did not say that
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:20.880]  and did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you that's another thing he said no he did
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:26.120]  not so he said those things under oath would you be willing to speak under oath to give
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:32.160]  your version of 100% and didn't say under oath I hardly know the man I'm not going to
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:37.080]  say I want you to pledge allegiance who would do that who would ask a man to pledge allegiance
[1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:42.840]  under oath I mean think of it I hardly know the man it doesn't make sense no I didn't
[1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.800]  say that and I didn't say the other.
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:48.000]  So if Robert Mueller wanted to speak with you about that I would be glad to tell him
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.680]  exactly what I just told you Jim.
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:53.680]  Now let's go ahead and play because notice they didn't say in that press conference the
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:54.680]  day after Comey.
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:04:00.080]  Oh Comey said you never ordered him to they just acted like Trump had said that.
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:02.320]  Here is the clip from Thursday.
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:10.120]  Director Comey did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:13.440]  Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections.
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:15.360]  Not to my understanding no.
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:20.840]  Did any individual working for this administration including the Justice Department ask you to
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:23.560]  stop the Russian investigation.
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:26.080]  No.
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:35.600]  After when the president requested that you and I quote let Flynn go.
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:43.160]  General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians which is an offense.
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:46.920]  All right he goes on from there but we're going to play more clips because Jack Busobi
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:53.880]  is coming on and the New York Times said this never happened this is all fake a couple
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:59.160]  months ago last Thursday it never happened the New York Times owned by the Kingpin of
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:04.080]  Mexico Carlos Slim says it never happened and of course Obama said you never built
[1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:11.560]  your business and that Obamacare was free we'll be back.
[1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:21.840]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book and it's about 13 historical women who
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:26.480]  pursued their goals in the face of opposition.
[1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:31.480]  The rebel media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:38.440]  idea of asking her to sign the book titled She Persisted for Juanita Broderick who as
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:44.440]  we all know was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary.
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:49.160]  Can you sign up for my friend Juanita Broderick because she's been silenced by your parents
[1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:53.720]  especially Bill Clinton who's a rapist can you sign up for her?
[1:05:53.720 --> 1:06:00.560]  Naturally Chelsea refused to sign the book but her reaction was priceless and you can
[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:17.880]  watch the video in its entirety right now at infowars.com.
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:22.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:30.760]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:49.680]  I'm not fake news but I am Teleprompter 3 of the same Jack the Subject.
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:53.400]  I've been aware of Jack the Subic for about a year and a half leading one of the biggest
[1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:57.960]  grassroots organizations for Trump doing a great job as a journalist and reporter often
[1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:03.080]  retweeted by the president and others and under massive demonization but that's the
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:07.160]  great part about being Teleprompter 3 is sometimes in the brain you're not reading off a teleprompter
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:08.880]  you butch your names.
[1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:14.480]  So Jack the Subic is our guest citizensfortrump.com the rebel.media he's a writer filmmaker
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:19.040]  recovering political operative 2016 Jack was the special projects director for Citizens

[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:44.280]  the Subic.
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:48.680]  You got my whole life story there I appreciate that.
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:51.880]  You bet I feel like I know you for a year and a half but I'm always reading your name
[1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:56.160]  so I'm sorry you know though I'm famous for butchering names so please forgive me.
[1:07:56.160 --> 1:08:00.880]  No it's okay I understand it's got that weird double letter thing at the end.
[1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:02.960]  Dude I can barely read my last name sometimes.
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:06.800]  Now let's get serious though here.
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:11.680]  You know I snuck into Bohemian Grove 17 years ago they said it wasn't real it was fake footage.
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:18.000]  Now this month you know the new episode kickoff of the season for House of Cards admits Bohemian
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Grove.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.680]  So the point is we're not fake news we're real news and I want to dive into what I covered
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:26.360]  in the last hour for new listeners that tuned in but get your take on it.
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:33.320]  How do you crystallize the magnitude of your story in the New York Times yesterday because
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:37.360]  I'm demonizing it as well so are others Mike Sernovich.
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:41.600]  Because it's cut and dry they had these hearings two hearings where he said Trump or no one
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:46.400]  else ever asked him to stop the investigation the media ignores that but they go further
[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:52.640]  they then say that you made up a tweet quote that we have the damn video of the congressional
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:53.640]  hearing of.
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:55.680]  This is next level BS.
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:58.280]  In what world are they operating Jack Posubic.
[1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:03.200]  Yeah they're actually becoming the thing that they hate they're projecting their version
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:07.480]  of you know they call it alternative reality alternative facts they're actually creating
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:11.800]  fake news they're calling me a conspiracy theorist you know I looked at the definition
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:15.840]  of the word conspiracy that's talking about you know covert agencies and influence.
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:21.560]  I quoted the director of the FBI under oath I quoted his testimony this is not a conspiracy
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:27.040]  but now we're living in a world where to the New York Times to CNN to many of these globalist
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:31.640]  tied organizations we know about the Washington Post ties to CIA we know about New York Times
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:36.560]  to Carlos Slim the billionaire from Mexico they're living in a world where facts just
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:37.560]  don't matter.
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:41.720]  That's right if you just joined us and you're ready or TV listener or if you were already
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:45.360]  on the last hour like yeah we know they lie we got to prove this to people that understand
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:49.840]  this is one of the most blaring cases they say a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist a false
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:55.640]  tweet and a runaway story and then they say oh Posubic put out a fake tweet and then Limbaugh
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:00.520]  picked it up oh my god it was a top story last week that Comey said nobody ever tried
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:04.320]  to influence him and they don't tell you to the end of the story that there is a video
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.080]  and that it was a month ago which doesn't make it deceptive it doesn't matter you were
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:13.240]  being very clear that he's already testified to that and that he said two months before
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:18.560]  from a memo that that he put out that Trump had tried to influence him so he's lying one
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:26.360]  way or the other this is such an important clip so what do you think is happening Jack
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:30.480]  you know it's it's Orwellian in the sense that the today the lies of today don't match
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:34.560]  up to the lies of tomorrow and I'm not even creating anything here I'm really just pointing
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:39.440]  out to them that your narrative today does not match the narrative of one month prior
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:44.720]  the testimony that was given under oath by James Comey all we're doing is putting it
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:48.040]  up and that's what we're doing here in the New York Times realizes this Alex that's
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:51.480]  why he's attacking me that's why people like media matters and David Brock are attacking
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:56.080]  us so much because we're destroying their programming we're breaking the conditioning
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:01.320]  we're taking down their narrative with facts with figures with video with clips because
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:05.800]  we have new media we have platforms like info wars dot com we have the ability to hold their
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:10.400]  feet to the fire and and as the New York Times reports this actually made it to President
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:13.840]  Trump's desk himself actually said Melania was the one that brought it to him which I
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:18.160]  think is amazing so I'm glad to be read by the First Lady absolutely and let's expand
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:22.320]  on this I'm going to read part of this quote I'm going to play the clip because they say
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:28.280]  this is fake this is not real but so big was mad he made this up you can read the article
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:33.920]  folks New York Times titled a pro Trump conspiracy theorist and it says Comey not my experience
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.480]  because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:44.200]  purpose then he goes on so they say this is made up by Jack Busovic they say this and
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:47.800]  and then they go Alex Jones and put it out and everybody else put it out and we're also
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:51.880]  evil we're just these horrible demons here is the clip of what they say doesn't exist
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:57.400]  here it is so if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:08.000]  a specific investigation can they halt that FBI investigation in theory yes has it happened
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.920]  not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:18.560]  that without appropriate purpose we're oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:23.040]  case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it but I'm talking about a situation
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:27.840]  where we were told to stop something for a political reason that would be a very big
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:33.320]  deal it's not happened in my experience not happened in my experience Jack Busovic but
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:37.680]  so that's why it's not happened in my experience he makes no qualifiers about it being about
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:43.560]  one specific official or another he doesn't say you know a lynch he doesn't say Trump
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:48.480]  he doesn't say Obama he says not happened in my experience with no qualifiers whatsoever
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:52.000]  and then of course compounded on the fact and I mentioned this to New York Times in my interview
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:56.560]  they didn't report it but I said you know wouldn't what Loretta when he testified that Loretta
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:02.000]  Lynch later put pressure on him to take back the investigation talk of Hillary Clinton
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.240]  to downplay it call it a matter instead of instead of an investigation I guess he works
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:12.200]  with the federal Bureau of Matters now wouldn't that also constitute something pushing back
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:17.720]  trying to stop an investigation by Loretta Lynch so either way the guy's testimony does
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:22.040]  not match his previous testimony that's all I'm saying but they said I made it up and
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:25.880]  we were all conspiracy theorists when we thought Comey was the main leaker Trump said that
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:29.520]  and now we know Comey was a leaker they know Trump knows so he's just covering his butt
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:34.400]  by by bringing this out now let's play another clip though because you watch CNN you watch
[1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:40.280]  MSNBC you watch ABC NBC they're still saying Comey says that you told him to shut down
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:44.200]  the investigation the truth is Comey had to admit that's not what happened but everyone
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:48.680]  is ignoring this clip and others from Thursday's hearing which again they're trying to say
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:53.640]  it's fake news but here is C-SPAN here is Senator Burr talking to Comey.
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:14:01.240]  Director Comey did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:04.600]  Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:06.520]  Not to my understanding no.
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:12.000]  Did any individual working for this administration including the Justice Department ask you to
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.720]  stop the Russian investigation?
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:15.720]  No.
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:16.720]  That's enough.
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:21.200]  And I have two other clips during the hearing the same thing now if you're a radio listener
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:25.120]  going wait a minute I saw CNN today they said that happened I just played a clip at the
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:29.640]  start of the hour if folks weren't tuned in where they're asking Trump questions that
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:35.440]  are saying you ordered them to stop investigating Flynn and Trump goes no that's a lie not true
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:39.000]  man you're a big liar the tapes are coming out you're not going to be very happy you're
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.920]  going to be disappointed let me ask Jack Mesubic this question the political and animal smart
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:47.800]  guy they've tripled down on lies is there a method of the madness is this desperation
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:54.640]  what do you expect to come Alex what they're trying to do is is keep a grip whatever way
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:59.520]  they can on the on the left the few people that are still reading the New York Times
[1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:03.720]  that are still looking to them for truth they've realized that their credibility is shot it
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:07.120]  was shot at the end of the last election when they said Hillary Clinton 85 percent chance
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:11.240]  to agree they have nothing to lose except their own kool-aid drinking coal so now they're
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:15.880]  just purely speaking to the coal they're purely speaking to the coal everyone else
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:19.960]  that's that's woken up to this everyone else that's under that understands the programming
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:24.840]  understands it's like they live and you've got the glasses on right so everybody knows
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:28.240]  that what they're telling you is not true but they've got to come up with some way to
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:32.720]  keep it going to keep the cognitive dissonance the the the conditioning going for the people
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:36.240]  that have been listening to them but that number is dwindling and dwindling every day
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.520]  you know it's funny I actually was trying to find a copy of the New York Times today
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:43.120]  I said hey I'm in the New York Times want to find a copy Alex I couldn't find it at

[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:56.240]  get mike sernovich on because he's demonized this article too and i want to be clear we're not talking
[1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:02.160]  about this because we're in an article i'm in it's not exaggerate 50 articles a day i know of
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:06.560]  you know all over tv all over everywhere we're lying about me taking stuff out of context
[1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:14.400]  it's just so crazy now that you see these headlines every day that are just totally
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:19.360]  false i mean i see so many now makes my head spin and and jack vasovic author researcher
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:23.680]  political operative patriot is our guest i want to talk some about your book the start of the next
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:27.120]  segment that i didn't know just came out today in fact i want to carry your book i know your
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:31.040]  books are great at info or store.com but you'll tell us about your book at the start of the next
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:38.880]  segment but just i don't want to be overconfident i agree the globalists are crazy i agree uh they're
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:44.240]  out of control i agree they're starting to lose but they've got so much for a vada and they keep
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:48.880]  doubling down they ran their scam during the election saying it was 15 points behind in polls
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:52.400]  we knew the scientific polls show that trump was really ahead i said that over and over again
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:55.520]  we saw the truth on election day we know they had fake polls we know they had fake
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:01.600]  uh you know questions being given out to hillary before uh the whole situation with the debates
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:07.680]  we know that as informed people that are actually have a pulse and have iqs above room temperature
[1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:15.040]  but now it's not like a campaign it just goes on and on and on and conservatives libertarians
[1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:21.680]  aren't used to just fighting 24 seven we have jobs so i'm not i'm not being negative i'm just
[1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:27.040]  saying the wall of lies even though trump's delivering on the economy and doing so many
[1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:32.720]  great things is affecting some people and the globalists are just doubling doubling down so
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:39.120]  where do you see this going you know alex that's exactly right and what you're seeing is they're
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:43.440]  very much on the defensive because they know that their sources of information aren't the only
[1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:47.360]  but not there they don't have the dictatorship of the narrative anymore we control the narrative
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:51.920]  just as much as them we can put out news on our platforms and every time somebody goes
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:56.400]  who's a new york times leader or a reader or a cnn reader every time they go on to social media
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:00.640]  every time they tune in info wars dot com that's someone that that's converted that's someone
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:05.920]  that's lost on their side so where this is going is instead of trying to say hey we should pull
[1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:10.240]  put the brakes on this and actually get back to journalistic integrity researching stories
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:15.200]  interviewing people what they've decided to do is instead turn it into tribalism and run
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:20.400]  psyops against our side psyops on their side to tell them these people are against you these
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:25.440]  people are trying to lie to you and foment that hatred and anger against them it's it's it's
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:29.520]  definitely unchristian to say at the least and what they're doing is is they're they're making
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:33.440]  things worse they're creating more friction that's what's leading to the antifa fights we're seeing
[1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:37.680]  in the street because those people they're on the leading edge of this sine curve because they are
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:43.120]  seeing the violence that's pushed by this type of hatred that's pushed by this type of demonization
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:47.120]  the way they're demonizing you the way they're demonizing me the way they're demonizing president
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:53.040]  trump and it's very very dangerous i have to say and it only makes us bigger but the message of the
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:58.080]  average person is oppose us we will destroy you so they're targeting the weak minded they're
[1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:02.880]  targeting folks on the fence i i saw antifa demonstrations all over the country this weekend
[1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:08.320]  but our own crew was down there for like six hours so i guess six hours times three is like
[1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:14.320]  i can't watch at all they are foaming at the mouth they are horrible people compared to the folks
[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:20.080]  protesting sharia law that's like protesting nazism great-looking white black hispanic asian
[1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:26.160]  protesting sharia law a bunch of goons in black with machine guns beating up people with clubs
[1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:32.560]  not getting in trouble screaming yelling cussing and when they hit a family or a kid in the head
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:37.200]  the cops would just come over and stop them and they would scream oh racist police and i'm not
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:41.680]  kissing the police's butt but the police are angels compared to this and this is all soros
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:48.480]  funded i mean i just cannot believe that they're such horrible horrible horrible people uh you
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:53.440]  know and what they do and they can't ever debate they can't talk they just they're totally tribal
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:59.600]  they just scream f u f america up with islam and they're so-called liberals the feminists are there
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:05.680]  putting hijabs on yeah alex and it's great that you mentioned i caught earlier that you were talking
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:09.600]  about what's going on in eastern europe i'm actually planning a trip there very soon i want to hit
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:16.320]  poland i want to hit romania maybe even belarus to talk about how george soros is pushing these
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:21.120]  through subversive subversive movements like antifa as well as propaganda campaigns in the news
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:25.440]  media over there against them that he was able to get the maydan revolution started in ukraine
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:30.400]  that turned it into the war zone it is today he wants to push that across eastern europe he wants
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:35.680]  to push poland in it's all about migrants it's all about tearing this apart and delegitimizing
[1:25:35.680 --> 1:25:40.000]  governments that's what he wants to end european cultures and then a few eastern countries
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:44.480]  that defeated islam in a hundred wars literally say we're not part of this soros is taking over
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:51.680]  he's the enemy and he declares i'm gonna overthrow you yeah exactly when antifa was created back in
[1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:56.880]  the 20s by leon trotsky believe it or not they were the arm of the communist party that was supposed
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:02.480]  to go into countries before communism to destabilize the government delegitimize the government so the
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:06.320]  communists could then come in and say hey we can we can deal with these guys for you just come listen
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:12.480]  to us jack posseaubeck again we've shown a little bit of the footage for tv viewers radio
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:16.720]  listeners can go to info wars dot com watch last show to see it but tomorrow i'm a compilation
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:22.800]  because there's hours and hours the most vicious hateful people with clubs beating police the police
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:28.640]  do nothing uh they are just attacking families they are screaming and yelling and spitting and
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:34.240]  throwing bags of piss on people they are like wearing muslim helmets with hand with with crescent
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:41.760]  moon uh flags with communist flags i mean who could make this up why don't they go back to the
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:45.840]  collapse islamic countries why don't they go to north korea i mean what is their problem
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:53.120]  you know what it is alexis they they can't stand be uh to live in a country that has freedom like
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:57.840]  the united states they can't debate their ideas you know peacefully they don't have any thoughts
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:03.040]  because it's all emotion with them it's all drummed up hatred it's all programs they're just
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:07.680]  pissed their losers yeah these are all losers in life you don't see any you don't see people that
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.320]  going from like you know the nine to five job with a family of a couple of kids going out into the
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:16.080]  streets and doing the stuff it's all life losers that go they could push into these fringe movements
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:20.800]  i mean i gotta be honest with you i didn't feel powerful seeing how weak our enemy was i felt
[1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:25.840]  as a human pathetic i mean these people are the most pathetic worm-like creatures i've ever seen
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:30.800]  exactly and you've got people on the other side like george soros like hillary clinton
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:36.400]  david barack barack obama that are utilizing them exploiting these kids to youth to further
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:40.960]  their globalistic tendencies to further their totalitarian dreams all in the united states
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:46.080]  and across the world and so a part of me wants to say you know people like that i i wish we could
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:50.880]  take care of them i wish we could help them but they're so far gone that you've just got to have
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:55.600]  honestly the police to come in and at least calm everything down that's right for both of us seeing
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:59.600]  these videos i mean they all look like they've had lobotomies they're like bows of the clown mental
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:04.960]  patients but i'm sorry i can't go to these because if i see some dude that's 300 pounds hit a woman
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:09.040]  with a club i'm gonna stop his guts out i'm not mr tough guy but you guys say that i'm gonna beat
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:13.920]  your ass so i can't even go to these events and then i see the police putting up with it it is
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:18.480]  sickening i saw lauren southern in video having been hit and pissed thrown on her and nothing's
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:23.840]  done i mean what is going on here yeah believe it or not when i was at uh when i was at guantanamo
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:28.640]  bay when i was stationed down there throwing urine on people that's what the al-qaeda detainees used to
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:33.600]  do they they'd mix these little cups up with blood uh and urine whatever they could find and then
[1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:37.520]  when you came by they didn't like it they throw it at you they used to call it splashing so now
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:43.360]  we're seeing antifa literally using al-qaeda tactics in the streets well i'm not mr tough guy
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:46.560]  because i mean i've gone out and battled the communists and it's all on tape and i've battled
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.200]  the mecha people i mean i i just i just can't handle it i mean i see some guy beating a woman
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:55.840]  with a kid over the head with a club i'm gonna beat the living hell out of them lines you can cross
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:00.800]  you know man absolutely well we're beating them intellectually but i just it makes me sick and i
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:04.720]  mean i'm not and i'm not for a police state but the cops should have beat the beat beat them to
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:10.640]  pulp with their clubs we'll be right back stay with us it's not just our water we need to filter

[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:30.240]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own

[1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:04.000]  he said that he has committed himself to any tyranny over the minds of men is and isn't that
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:08.320]  exactly what he said i'm sure on the over of god resistance to any form of tyranny over the mind
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.600]  of men yes sir i thought that looked very virginian where you're at it is it is i'm i'm actually
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:17.120]  right just sort of at the at the foot hill of where monticello is it's right behind me so we
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:21.040]  were just visiting there today it's beautiful if people haven't been there you've got to see it this
[1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:27.600]  is god's country truly it is gorgeous so just just stay to the union they hate you almost as much as

[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:37.040]  book yeah i think they hate jack posovic so much because i i tell the truth because i'm and because
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:40.720]  i'm out there and i organize so the book i've actually got a copy of it right here citizens
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:45.760]  for trump and what it is is so many people write books about donald trump this isn't a book about
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:51.520]  donald trump this is a book about the movement of people that coalesce together to support him to
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:56.320]  take back our country it's an inside look and alex you are in there my friend you are in there the
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:02.000]  historic rally we held at the rnc your speech roger stone speech uh mike sternovich came down
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.200]  all of us are in there because it took so many parts info wars was a huge part of that and this
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:11.200]  also goes through tells him behind the scenes stories tell us some of the organizing stories
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:16.720]  that i did stuff like maga 3x stop the steel all the things that we did across the country that's
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:21.600]  critical jack as you know because whether trump's for real or not which clearly he is whether he
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:27.920]  wins or fails he wins by taking action in the arena we've built the multicultural pro america
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:33.760]  coalition that that rally we had with thousands of people at it half the crowd wasn't white that
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:39.200]  freaks out seeing in that it was black and hispanic and white and asian americans wanting freedom
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:44.880]  not wanting to live in north korea that is revolutionary that's what scares them exactly and
[1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:48.640]  the fact we didn't charge a single cent for admission of that it was open to the public
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:53.040]  everyone could come we only ask that nobody had any violence and people don't remember what it was
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:58.320]  like last summer just about a year ago uh the violence of antifa we were battling communist
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:02.160]  all over the city but thank god they didn't show up at that because they're such cowards they always
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:07.440]  pick up little groups and we had the bikers for trump came out all day they volunteered they
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:11.840]  stood out in the hot sun they protected me they protected you they protected all of us so we could
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:16.960]  be out there we even had lgbt for trump standing right up giant rainbow flag milo came out and
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:22.640]  speak and spoke and it was amazing and so starting with that it goes through and shows how this movement
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:28.080]  built and grew turned into forms and chapters across the country how we ran that and how we
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:32.560]  used that and utilized that to build these organizations that were living as opposed to the
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:37.360]  two-party duopoly that you know roger stone talks about all the time that has for so long so to
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:43.200]  control our system the people rose up we formed up we created a movement we created an army really
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:48.800]  and that's what this book is about that's right let's be clear let's be clear whether you love
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:54.560]  trump or hate trump the point is he's bringing the change we need to a controlled paradigm that's
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:58.480]  stagnant and rotting i think it's beautiful but but but we're focused out there that want to live
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:05.120]  in a paradigm of being controlled and absolutely you know being uh servile that's what's brought us
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:09.440]  to this point and the corrupt the least we know we're out of control hate trump uh jack basabic
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:15.120]  thank you so much for joining us so great to be here alex happy to come back thank you oh we're
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:19.440]  gonna get mike cernovich on the line because uh you know i gotta get him on about all this news
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:26.480]  trump's come out and said fake news media doesn't cover great economic news economics is the most
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:33.920]  base absolute confirmed form of reality it's do you have food do you have water do you have a job
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:40.480]  do you have the supplies you need and free market delivers about a hundred times on average or more
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:48.880]  better than communism and the only problem is it creates such wealth that it creates giant armies
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:54.560]  of decadent people who then bitching and playing because they're not you know hollywood stars or
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:39:00.080]  whatever but the truth is when it comes to resources and innovation free market is the best thing the
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:06.640]  planet's ever seen look that's like state in two plus two equals four you know that that's why you're
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.120]  listening to this broadcast you're the brain trust of america of every race color and creed
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:17.840]  all humans i don't believe in race it's red blood it's wanton freedom we're coming together
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:24.800]  and we know that the left defending sharia law and cutting women's genitals off and putting hoods
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:29.520]  over their heads and throwing gays off buildings is not compatible with america that sharia law
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:34.480]  so we go out and we protest it and all over the country they come out and attack us because they're
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:39.440]  bullies because they're scum but you look at who's out there it's not even really the muslims they
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:45.600]  were like 10 protesting it is the most brain damaged looking lobotomized looking whacked out
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:52.400]  stick your finger in the electric socket nutballs you got to ask yourself what is this well this
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:58.880]  is the scum of the earth that are all on welfare who want to get an extra george soros check for
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:03.040]  five hundred dollars to go out and beat somebody up these are the one to be tough guys that want to
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:12.400]  go out and look at people that actually live their lives and work and then demonize them
[1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:16.880]  mike sardivis joins us at the end of this segment and for the next and we've also got a clip coming
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:22.240]  up dealing with the fact that house of cards is now giving empoors a hat tip mike sardivis what
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:27.840]  do you make of the current state the comey hearing we saw thursday and the article about you myself
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:33.680]  and possebeck saying that nobody in any hearing ever said that trump didn't say hey uh don't stop
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:38.720]  the investigation i mean comey admits that trump never said stop it but the news is saying we're
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:45.680]  liars for publishing the video yeah a lot of people too want to know where are those comey memos
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:51.920]  and why is that columbia university professor in hiding where where is he where the memos i've heard
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:58.080]  from people who are saying that they're having difficulty locating these alleged memos that
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:02.960]  comey had now comey as you know claimed that right after his means for trump he would go outside and
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:08.880]  type up a memo on an fbi laptop and he should have handed that in and they should have that so i'm
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:13.840]  hearing that obstruction on record exactly the word is it's all fake memos go ahead sir yeah
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:18.800]  yeah exactly right that's what people are saying where the memos so if he has these alleged memos
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.920]  people would love to see him and people want to know why he doesn't have memos a loretta lynch
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:28.160]  and these other meetings that he had with people where they were actually telling him to obstruct
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:34.720]  justice so there's a lot going on there what i noticed today though is the the median narrative
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:39.600]  has they're literally saying do not think about comey anymore there have been multiple articles
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:44.480]  today saying forget about comey we need to talk about russia again that's how much of a debacle
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:49.760]  that hearing was and we said that on thursday and friday clearly if you watch it it was a train wreck
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:54.480]  epic disaster but media for a day trying to say oh big victory oh you're spending different points
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:42:00.000]  but as you said by friday and saturday they want to move off of that because it was a spectacular
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:06.800]  defeat give us a breakdown of that defeat yeah so everybody thought they were so hyped that the
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:12.560]  bars in dc were actually opening and serving alcohol at 10 30 in the morning and people were
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:17.280]  ready they thought this was a super bowl for the left and that comey was going to say that trump
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:22.960]  was under investigation that trump obstructed justice that trump told comey that he could
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:27.760]  investigate certain people this was supposed to be trumps waterloo so instead the media wants to
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:34.480]  pretend that everything they thought was not true exactly so not only not only did they not get
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:40.880]  any victory but we found out that one trump was never under investigation personally and interesting
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:44.800]  how that was never leaked to the media even though you and i had said from the beginning
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:51.760]  because of a real news we knew we knew you said it was coming exactly we've always known i can't
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:55.360]  believe how right we are actually cernovich i can't believe how right you are it's amazing
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:58.960]  be me associate with such people like you that's the best part of this fight is i got to know the
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:03.520]  great people like cernovich and paul watson and and persobeck i mean it is and the crew out here
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:09.920]  and you i mean this is awesome we're the people that aren't idiots after being sold out for months

[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:48.400]  on it said it made trump look better at the comey interview and cnn looks so pissed well and that was
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:53.200]  also that new york times article where it was completely fake news and they defamed a good
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:56.960]  friend of mine you know jack posovic and claimed that he made up something which was a complete
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:50:02.320]  fabrication but they they always talk about how many views we're getting now they're mad now that
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:08.080]  jack posovic can do a video of a citizen journalist the new up-and-coming star like jack can do a
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:15.280]  periscope more people are tuning into posovic cernovich roger stone alex jones paul joseph wasan
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:20.800]  stefan malin you lauren southern i mean you name it there's like a talent explosion right now so
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:26.160]  every day there's a new guy he posts a new trump he's the one who actually found those reza aslan
[1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:30.880]  tweets and really we put the pressure on him and been going so he's like rookie the year so
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:36.560]  when i look around i've never my life seen more patriots paying attention and i've never seen a
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:42.240]  deeper talent pool which is why i panicked them is because you can be a college student sort of
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:47.920]  twitter account and make points you'll have more followers and more retweets than anerson cooper
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:54.160]  in a month that's why they're panicking yeah that's exactly right and also a lot of people the big
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:59.120]  old money conservative people have reached out to me and as you know i've never taken outside
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:03.600]  money i don't believe in anything but they said they go you know i'm tired of this cernovich and i go
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:08.800]  what's wrong and they go why is it that my people that i pay tens of millions of dollars in these
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:13.600]  super packs why can't they get people to show up to a rally why can't they get people to show up to
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:18.880]  a flash mob why can't they do what you guys are just doing every day like a lot you know i think
[1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:22.240]  you're getting ripped off but if you think you're gonna control me with money i don't even want it
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.880]  you know i've turned down more money than most people because i don't want them to try to control
[1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:31.680]  me with the globalist power absolutely i've been i've been offered you know 500 million dollars
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:36.480]  but i more and more realize it's not even a payoff they actually want to win and so who knows we
[1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:41.280]  we may make some big announcements very very soon but there's a lot of big stuff going on well and
[1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:46.320]  that's exactly right because i told him i just made it safe for people in the system this isn't a
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:51.120]  sellout folks if we take over and restore the country you're going to see power brokers that
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:56.640]  didn't like what was happening joining us that's not a sellout that's victory get ready to take
[1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:02.640]  over get ready to restore the republic get ready to win yeah and that's exactly right because i told
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:07.040]  him i go look if you think that i'm gonna be another neocon and you're just gonna buy me off
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:10.480]  and i'm gonna show for war some at least you understand they go no no they go you don't get
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:16.320]  it they go we're tired of giving our money to losers who all they can do is maybe run some stupid
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:21.600]  ad or yeah it's existential they know there's a war on free market that's the best system
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:26.640]  they realize it's a threat to even the power structure we and we have to defeat this cancer of
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:33.440]  sharia law and the left and soros and everybody's sick of him and and they're also seeing the
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.640]  terrorism happening in europe and they're telling me now that we thought that we could just be rich
[1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:43.840]  and import slave labor but we realize now that we'll have terrorism in america and right now there
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:49.360]  was a um mall top cocktail in paris like peter deal said the tide is going on on globalism
[1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:54.400]  it's cancer he was against it 20 years ago other globalists are against it now because they realize
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:59.840]  it's bad and we just need to go with human freedom go with go go with free market stop it
[1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:06.000]  yeah and nobody nobody's being safe and then they're also very sick by the the next generation
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:11.520]  like alex soros is posting you know spear cooking pictures and he's revealing all the occult stuff
[1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:16.720]  that they do that you're not supposed to talk about so now when we say that alex soros is a spear
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:22.000]  cooker well we can show pictures where there's a woman laying down on a board like you know like a
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:26.800]  corpse effigy kind of thing and they're performing their pictures they post that to the social media
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:32.480]  people go why do you call soros a luciferian and i go well because i can show you pictures of alex
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:39.600]  soros at a spear cooking party what more evidence do you need no you're right and and and they can't
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:45.040]  help it it's lesser magic they've got to throw it in our face and the sickening photo that i saw
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:54.880]  james once put out of alex soros meeting with uh schumer i mean it's just disgusting we're ruled
[1:53:54.880 --> 1:54:02.720]  by turds like this well and it's changing too i mean the the cnn as ices contest there i didn't
[1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:06.880]  expect somebody you were right like when we talked about it i thought a few people would do it but
[1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:11.360]  right when i told you that night you wanted to draft that night to get it out there because
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:15.440]  there's so many entries now i can even keep track of them we're not 200 and i've got like a limited
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:20.160]  crew so trust me people are going to get on awards are going to happen it's like trying to eat an
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:24.400]  elephant exactly you know it's funny you mentioned devil worship you didn't even know this you didn't
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:30.240]  even know this uh that's what's amazing about our guests right now i wanted to play a clip from the
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:37.280]  new kickoff of the new season of house of cards that shows bohemian grove that 17 years ago infiltrated
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:43.440]  where they do mock human sacrifice and you bring it up without me even telling you it was coming up
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:48.800]  let's play the first minute or two of the new house of cards season kickoff uh here it is
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:58.480]  shows the big owl they say it's a crow they do the mock human sacrifice put all their cares
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:03.920]  their bad karma onto something else it's black magic how do you do evil and get away with it not
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:13.920]  coming back on you that's what this is here it is
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:23.840]  so if you're a radio lister men and torches red rubs come before a giant owl or crow to burn the
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:35.120]  amygdia of a child to put their falsy and evil onto the child we honor thee we honor thee we honor
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:43.600]  no mortal flame can destroy common woe just one fire can conquer fire that burns in the fields of
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:55.040]  aliceum they've never seen the fields of aliceum make brothers one hell fellowship hell crow
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:01.600]  in his verdict kingdom common woe be done
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:09.760]  they burn the avatars of the child
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:16.000]  but then under what it says oh presidents can't go presidents go to this
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:21.760]  they're not blaming everybody that goes it's just an entrance way to this
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:29.840]  yeah look around some of the most powerful men in the world are gathered in this clearing
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:36.720]  members of one of our country's most exclusive clubs invitation only unless of course you invite
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:43.680]  yourself they gather here to see god between the branches of these magnificent trees they eat
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:49.360]  together they piss next to each other and they carve up the world like a sunday roast this is
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:56.560]  where the real power is no women or presidents allowed the former i am not the latter i will be
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:04.240]  again because i have managed to reduce a national election down to one state and while these men
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:13.040]  here can't swing the votes of an entire nation one measly state well that they can all right mr
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:16.880]  sternovich i just wanted to show that because they claimed it was fake when i first videotaped it
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:23.600]  now they admit it this just shows how it's all coming out final comments yeah again the awakening
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:29.200]  is happening we are living in like a time of the revival we've never had more people paying more
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:33.600]  attention it really goes to show the new york times they try to knock us down every time
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:39.760]  and it doesn't really work more money is coming in to the soros website the soros companies but
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:44.880]  the patriots as long as they want themselves to be silenced and share the good news of the truth
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:49.760]  with their friends family neighbors with the internet and everything but we're we're growing
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:56.480]  up we're on the march the empire is on the run and alex uh soros can worship the devil all day
