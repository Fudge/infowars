[00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.466]  June 10, 2017.
[00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:40.267]  Act for America, led by global Islamic terrorism expert Bridget Gabriel, staged roughly 30 anti-sharia rallies in cities across America to bring average Americans face-to-face with those that would support honor killings, female mutilation, and a creeping non-conformist sharia law into the final holdout known as these United States of America.
[00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:49.015]  Why I'm here is if they start violence, if they start attacking people, vandalizing, you know, cops are generally told to back down throughout America.
[00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:54.480]  It's going to take the American people to stand up to these guys and put them in their place.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.221]  You know, they have every right to do this.
[00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:56.922]  I respect that.
[00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:57.662]  I'm a patriot.
[00:00:57.662 --> 00:01:01.185]  And I will not sit by and watch them assault or vandalize people.
[00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:10.174]  So bottom line is these guys have got to know that America's not going to put up with
[00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:35.233]  Lauren Morris, a victim of female mutilation and protected by Oath Keepers after her life was threatened for speaking at the event, spoke in solidarity with the victims of Sharia law already affecting females in the United States.
[00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:40.276]  So what happened was, Act for America put up the Facebook event, right?
[00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:42.877]  You know Islam isn't a race?
[00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:45.778]  You know your sign makes no sense?
[00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:16.464]  If you took a poll with any of these people over here, I'll bet you they could not even tell you what Sharia is.
[00:02:16.464 --> 00:02:18.505]  I don't see any Muslim people out there.
[00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.166]  Do you see any Muslim people out there?
[00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.987]  They don't want to associate with these people.
[00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:34.411]  These people started their own agenda, and they started their own march, and they made it about Trump.
[00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:46.555]  And we're standing out there all day with our signs about women's rights, safety for women, domestic violence, and all this kind of stuff.
[00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:49.116]  And they're out there yelling, bigot, fascist.
[00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:50.736]  Everything.
[00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:54.197]  So they changed the narrative and they took it away.
[00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:59.518]  They took it away and they're coming out here marching for something that we are not about.
[00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:10.560]  But the statistics that I got just this week is that there are somewhere between 27 and 30 actual honor killings that get discovered and get found out in the U.S.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.541]  here in the U.S.
[00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:16.405]  And Texas is a high-risk state for that.
[00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.747]  New York is a high-risk state for that.
[00:03:18.747 --> 00:03:24.374]  You know, the public doesn't see it because these are women who live in the shadows.
[00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:27.959]  You've got to understand, these are women that are not allowed to do anything.
[00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.083]  They're not allowed to go outside without a guardian.
[00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:31.803]  Okay?
[00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:42.853]  And they're bringing a culture like that to the greatest country on the earth that has laws to protect them better than any place they have ever lived, ever.
[00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:45.875]  Our laws protect women.
[00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:49.698]  And the Sharia courts that want to raise up, that's what it's about.
[00:03:49.698 --> 00:03:52.241]  They want to take those rights away from women.
[00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:58.187]  We're standing with white supremacist guys.
[00:03:58.187 --> 00:03:59.309]  Are these guys?
[00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.211]  Am I a white supremacist too?
[00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.635]  Some of them have confederate flags.
[00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.417]  How about we're just Americans?
[00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:08.259]  They think this is a Nazi party.
[00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.442]  There's a lawyer that actually thought that was a Nazi flag.
[00:04:11.442 --> 00:04:25.037]  It's Tekistan and we're going to create our own country of like-minded people that aren't triggered by the minutiae that you focus on every day of your life.
[00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:26.538]  This is a free speech trap.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.622]  They fell for it, and they're caught like rats.
[00:04:30.622 --> 00:04:31.683]  They don't know what to do.
[00:04:31.683 --> 00:04:36.407]  And as soon as I get up here, I get called a fascist Nazi and all this other s***.
[00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:40.531]  This guy's pissed his pants while he's telling me this.
[00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:47.977]  As expected, the Soros shill patrol, known as Antifa, was in full effect, offering zero topics for a rational debate.
[00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:48.918]  Their mind-numbing
[00:04:49.198 --> 00:05:08.680]  Cult-like teenage shrills, a reverse of the intended effect of dividing the Americans that gathered to question Antifa's moronic subversion, actually bringing average taxpaying Americans on their day off together to focus on the tide of extremism threatening the country's future.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.061]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:11.823]  My middle name.
[00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:24.270]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:33.436]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:38.058]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:05:38.058 --> 00:05:40.480]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.161]  20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.321]  It's all there.
[00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:51.742]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:05:51.742 --> 00:06:02.484]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:05.084]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:09.145]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[00:06:10.951 --> 00:06:16.975]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:21.498]  Government is the problem.
[00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:29.204]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:36.329]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.381]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.323]  Because there is a war on.
[00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:43.725]  For your mind.
[00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:44.886]  Hello me.
[00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.688]  Meet the real me.
[00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:48.970]  In my misfits way of life.
[00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.891]  Ladies and gentlemen!
[00:06:50.768 --> 00:06:52.028]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:59.171]  We're broadcasting worldwide and we're live on this Sunday, the 11th day of June 2017.
[00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.831]  Jack Bosobiak will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:07:01.831 --> 00:07:13.375]  His new book came out today, but the reason I called him to come on is I saw a New York Times story that illustrates everything we're dealing with with the fake mainstream news.
[00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:19.577]  It said, well here's the headline, it says in the article that
[00:07:21.112 --> 00:07:42.682]  No one ever said in Congress that Trump was not told that he wasn't under investigation by the Russians.
[00:07:42.682 --> 00:07:46.084]  Or that Trump had ever blocked an investigation into the Russians.
[00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:53.035]  And then I've got the congressional clips of Senator Burr, you name it.
[00:07:53.035 --> 00:08:06.945]  It's all right here and it makes my head spin that they sit there and they lie in the New York Times and say Jack Posobiec put out a fake headline that got picked up by Infowars and then picked up by Rush Limbaugh this week.
[00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:12.690]  And that is that Trump never ordered
[00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:28.093]  These lies are so incredible that Trump never ordered the FBI Director Comey to stop investigating, or that Trump never tried to influence the investigation.
[00:08:28.093 --> 00:08:38.600]  And I've got multiple hearings, including the one last week, where Comey says that's the case, and then they write news articles saying it's fake news.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.304]  They even show a quote Posobiec put out, and they say this is fake.
[00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:54.312]  And we have C-SPAN on May 3rd, and then again this week, whatever date it was.
[00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:55.473]  What was Thursday's date?
[00:08:55.473 --> 00:09:00.775]  If it's the 11th now, the 10th, the 9th, the 8th?
[00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:08.198]  I mean, these lies are so blaring and so incredible, I have trouble even being able to articulate it.
[00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:11.639]  It's so simple, it's complex.
[00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:13.240]  It's so whopper,
[00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:17.016]  That I don't even know what to do at this point.
[00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:19.656]  And of course I'm in the article.
[00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:22.577]  It says I'm fake.
[00:09:22.577 --> 00:09:29.579]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play you the clip of last Thursday in the hearing.
[00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:32.159]  I've been answering the question on national television.
[00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:35.700]  It was on every major news network in the country, probably in the world.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.461]  And they just say it's fake!
[00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:39.761]  Here's the headline of the New York Times.
[00:09:39.761 --> 00:09:43.042]  A pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet, and a
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.203]  Runaway story.
[00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:51.146]  Now, I am getting Posobiec on about this.
[00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:54.810]  I'm not getting into all the other news, but this is huge because it deals with fake news.
[00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.730]  This illustrates everything.
[00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.092]  It's a Rosetta Stone.
[00:09:57.092 --> 00:09:59.014]  It's a skeleton key.
[00:09:59.014 --> 00:10:00.655]  It opens every door.
[00:10:00.655 --> 00:10:07.162]  Because we're going to show you the clip last Thursday.
[00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:09.063]  And we're going to show you the clip from May 3rd.
[00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.051]  When he also previously said it, and then they say it never happened.
[00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:18.893]  Ladies and gentlemen, you don't have to believe me after I play the clips.
[00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:32.017]  You can Google James Comey, Trump did not ask me to drop investigation into Russia election meddling, and you'll get AP, Reuters, London Independent, but none of it makes it on TV.
[00:10:32.017 --> 00:10:37.059]  I mean, look, right here, just type it in, you'll get hundreds of stories, but we have the video.
[00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.380]  I mean, just forget having to read it.
[00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:41.380]  It's not just us saying it.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.985]  James Comey, Trump did not ask me to drop investigation into Russia election meddling.
[00:10:46.985 --> 00:10:48.347]  And then we have the clip.
[00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:51.069]  Senator Burr asking the question, but so did others.
[00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:54.192]  We've got him saying it three times on Thursday.
[00:10:54.192 --> 00:10:55.173]  Three of them.
[00:10:55.173 --> 00:10:56.815]  I was covering it live Thursday.
[00:10:56.815 --> 00:10:57.916]  David Knight was covering it live.
[00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.657]  We played the clips.
[00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:01.039]  We're going to go over all of it for you, but...
[00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:03.033]  Here's the problem.
[00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.154]  I've got a stack of news here today that's just as fake.
[00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:07.615]  I don't even have time to cover all the lies.
[00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:13.357]  That's where they're beating us, is they're lying so much in such a wall of deception that we can't even counter it.
[00:11:13.357 --> 00:11:14.677]  You've just got to know they're lying.
[00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:15.978]  Here's another one.
[00:11:15.978 --> 00:11:22.280]  Trump's son tweeted 80 times in defense of his father.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.162]  And in there, he's saying my dad didn't order him to stop investigating this.
[00:11:28.162 --> 00:11:29.423]  He was saying Steve vindicated.
[00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:30.003]  Comey said,
[00:11:31.144 --> 00:11:34.765]  In the tweet he says, see, Tommy says my dad didn't order him to do it, because he didn't.
[00:11:34.765 --> 00:11:38.626]  If my dad orders you, it's completely clear.
[00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:53.550]  And then that is on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, everywhere, with the headline that Trump's oldest son confirms the testimony
[00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.031]  That Comey gave that he was ordered to stop investigating.
[00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.852]  Now there's a double lie there.
[00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.293]  He didn't tweet that.
[00:12:01.293 --> 00:12:06.835]  He said the opposite and the real video of Comey three times last Thursday.
[00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:08.416]  He says that Trump didn't.
[00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:16.619]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we have... I don't even know how you can lie like this.
[00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:21.001]  I mean, this gives me a headache.
[00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:22.442]  This gives me a headache.
[00:12:24.284 --> 00:12:27.686]  Because it's just so insane!
[00:12:27.686 --> 00:12:28.646]  So let me cover this first.
[00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:32.088]  I'll get into all the other news and then Jack Posobiec is joining us.
[00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:34.989]  They hate Jack Posobiec because he's effective.
[00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:36.710]  Just like we're effective at InfoWars.
[00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.011]  Just like Paul Watson's effective at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:43.833]  Just like people like Mike Cernovich are effective with the great work he's doing.
[00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:47.094]  Because we're in live time battling these people.
[00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:48.355]  And we're pointing out their lies.
[00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:58.782]  And I was on my Twitter this morning, on Real Alex Jones, and I saw Cernovich, who we should probably get on tomorrow, such a great guy.
[00:12:58.782 --> 00:13:02.806]  The only person I know that gets more energy than I do.
[00:13:02.806 --> 00:13:12.814]  And he tweets that, look, the New York Times says that this was never said.
[00:13:12.814 --> 00:13:15.676]  And I clicked it, and I could not believe it.
[00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:16.297]  But you know what?
[00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:19.640]  I should have believed it, because it already happened to me back a few weeks ago.
[00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:21.826]  Let me start going over this.
[00:13:21.826 --> 00:13:23.548]  I'm going to play the clips here for you.
[00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:24.649]  And this is the video.
[00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:32.779]  We're live right now on the radio, hundreds of stations across the country, streaming at InfoWars.com as a television broadcast, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:38.145]  But this is what you should send your so-called liberal friends and just say, do you like being lied to?
[00:13:38.766 --> 00:13:45.929]  Because they say we're the fake news all day and use like the one correction we do a year where we make a mistake and go, look, he admits he's fake.
[00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:48.790]  He, Jones, you know, no, it's because we're not fake.
[00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.550]  Then we make mistakes.
[00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.650]  We come and tell you.
[00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.711]  Our credibility is everything.
[00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:54.992]  And that means when we're wrong, we'll tell you.
[00:13:54.992 --> 00:13:57.433]  This is the media.
[00:13:57.433 --> 00:13:59.594]  That's been caught.
[00:13:59.594 --> 00:14:04.176]  Lying so much and in so many ways, it makes everybody's head spin.
[00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.016]  So here's the facts.
[00:14:07.366 --> 00:14:12.451]  Here's the London Independent, Thursday, June 8th, 2017.
[00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:17.776]  James Comey, Trump did not ask me to drop investigation into Russian election meddling.
[00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:21.120]  And there's a quote of that.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.263]  Now, let's enter the next story.
[00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:31.210]  This is one from the 18th of May, with yours truly, the exact same story.
[00:14:32.481 --> 00:14:37.502]  Stock surge as trading floors watched Breaking Info Wars video.
[00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.703]  It was two weeks old and wrong, okay?
[00:14:39.703 --> 00:14:41.043]  It was two weeks old.
[00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:43.504]  It was not wrong.
[00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:45.504]  It contradicted the Comey memo.
[00:14:45.504 --> 00:14:49.225]  The Comey memo came out the day before.
[00:14:49.225 --> 00:14:51.506]  Which he now admits was the FBI director leaking it.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:15:07.623]  And so now he's saying in a memo, according to the leak, Trump ordered him to stop, but we have him two weeks before at that time, on May 3rd, telling Congress that no one, the AG or anybody else in the administration, he said, no one did.
[00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:09.463]  It'd be a big deal if anybody did.
[00:15:09.463 --> 00:15:18.605]  So we put that out and said, okay, he's either lying about the memo, which he now says the president didn't order him, or
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.103]  He's lying in his testimony.
[00:15:25.103 --> 00:15:27.045]  And that's what my story was about.
[00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:31.549]  They then got pissed off that the stock market that had been plunging shot up.
[00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:35.873]  They talked to the head of the stock market and he said no, it was the Infowars story, Alex Jones.
[00:15:35.873 --> 00:15:39.337]  I then begged listeners, drudged everybody else to make it the number one story.
[00:15:39.337 --> 00:15:45.622]  It did become a huge story because he's saying there's a memo that says Trump ordered him to lie or ordered him to shut down an investigation.
[00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:49.644]  Then he's saying months later, no one ever told me that.
[00:15:49.644 --> 00:15:51.465]  That's incredibly newsworthy.
[00:15:51.465 --> 00:15:55.506]  They just spin the whole thing and go, you know, it's fake, fake, fake.
[00:15:55.506 --> 00:16:03.409]  Now they've done it to Posobiec, but this time it was last Thursday on video three times.
[00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:07.490]  When we come back, we're going to devastate these scumbag liars that think you're stupid.
[00:16:08.948 --> 00:16:14.329]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:17.190]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.171]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:24.192]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.292]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.573]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:16:27.573 --> 00:16:32.694]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:16:32.694 --> 00:16:36.055]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:36.715]  We're good to go!
[00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:08.899]  At Infowarslife.com and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:17.162]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar.
[00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.383]  A 360 win.
[00:17:18.383 --> 00:17:24.945]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at Infowarshore.com.
[00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:32.468]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:17:32.868 --> 00:17:37.952]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:17:37.952 --> 00:17:44.058]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:17:44.058 --> 00:17:51.844]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:17:51.844 --> 00:17:59.070]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.871]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:18:00.011 --> 00:18:02.453]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:18:02.453 --> 00:18:04.435]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:18:04.435 --> 00:18:09.860]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:17.847]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:22.331]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing
[00:18:24.464 --> 00:18:38.917]  The secret to Defender body armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene.
[00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.800]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:48.143]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:18:48.143 --> 00:18:48.923]  It works.
[00:18:48.923 --> 00:18:57.347]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:18:57.347 --> 00:19:07.111]  Defender body armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:07.591]  A total 360 win.
[00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:11.372]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:19:11.372 --> 00:19:13.392]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:19:13.392 --> 00:19:16.294]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:19:16.294 --> 00:19:22.356]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:31.559]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:36.401]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:19:36.621 --> 00:19:39.084]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:19:39.084 --> 00:19:47.112]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:48.073]  The general public doesn't.
[00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:53.235]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:56.797]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:19:56.797 --> 00:20:03.501]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:20:03.501 --> 00:20:12.925]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.547]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:38.833]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:41.375]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:56.707]  So, we have some of the best job numbers since 1984.
[00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:04.888]  We have 3 plus trillion in the stock market, 16 points added since he was sworn in January 20th.
[00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:09.250]  Another 4 points before he even got sworn in, just on anticipation.
[00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:14.913]  We've got big media trying to deep-six the economy everywhere, cheerleading for the fall of Trump.
[00:21:14.913 --> 00:21:16.093]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:21:16.093 --> 00:21:22.717]  But right now, let's get into bonafide, pure, absolute, concerted
[00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:41.728]  Daily Beast, New York Times, and others lying about Infowars, lying about yours truly, lying about Rush Limbaugh, lying about Jack Posobiak, lying about anybody that tells the truth.
[00:21:41.728 --> 00:21:47.911]  So if you just joined us, there is a New York Times article
[00:21:49.431 --> 00:21:51.112]  that came out today.
[00:21:51.112 --> 00:21:53.513]  For TV viewers, I'll put it on screen.
[00:21:53.513 --> 00:21:57.635]  And it's titled, to be technical, I guess it came out last night.
[00:21:57.635 --> 00:21:58.295]  It's June 11th.
[00:21:58.295 --> 00:22:01.456]  This is a June 10th, so it came out on Saturday.
[00:22:01.456 --> 00:22:08.419]  A pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet, and a runaway story.
[00:22:08.419 --> 00:22:14.002]  And you read the article, and it's not till the very end that they tell the truth.
[00:22:14.002 --> 00:22:16.343]  But they know that 90% of people only read the headline,
[00:22:17.998 --> 00:22:25.900]  And then only about half the people out there even read down just a little bit, depending on which demographic you look at.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.000]  But when you come to the internet, a lot of folks just look at the headline.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.341]  When you actually look at it, less than half read to the bottom.
[00:22:31.341 --> 00:22:40.743]  There's different studies, different angles, but they know that most people don't read the majority of the story they look at headlines.
[00:22:40.743 --> 00:22:45.904]  And so you read a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet, and a runaway story.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.363]  And then you read the article.
[00:22:52.363 --> 00:23:04.035]  Jack Posobiec had his Twitter sites on James B. Comey, a pro-Trump activist notorious for his amateur sleuthing into red herrings and they make up stuff.
[00:23:04.035 --> 00:23:09.120]  And then you read in the article, they've got a quote and say, here is the fake tweet.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.563]  Now I'm going to read you the fake tweet and you're going to see the video.
[00:23:18.342 --> 00:23:20.744]  Hirano, that's the congressperson.
[00:23:20.744 --> 00:23:28.730]  Show if the Attorney General or senior officials of the Justice Department opposes a specific investigation, can they halt the FBI investigation?
[00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.512]  Comey.
[00:23:30.512 --> 00:23:33.194]  In theory, yes.
[00:23:33.194 --> 00:23:35.616]  Comey.
[00:23:35.616 --> 00:23:36.757]  Goes on, have any of them done that?
[00:23:36.757 --> 00:23:37.117]  No.
[00:23:37.117 --> 00:23:40.080]  In my experience, because it would be a big deal
[00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:53.256]  To tell the FBI to stop doing something that without an appropriate purpose, I mean, where oftentimes they give us opinions and we don't see a case, there are, you ought to stop investigating resources in it.
[00:23:53.256 --> 00:24:00.840]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for political reasons that would be a very big deal.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.042]  It's not happening in my experience.
[00:24:06.042 --> 00:24:09.724]  And then he goes on to say, no one has done that.
[00:24:09.724 --> 00:24:10.425]  No one ever.
[00:24:11.792 --> 00:24:15.914]  Now, that's very, very, very clear.
[00:24:15.914 --> 00:24:25.059]  But they say, all over the article, he put out a completely fake story in the New York Times.
[00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:27.981]  They're just saying it's fake.
[00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:37.686]  Later at the end of the article, they say, actually, this was back in May, and they weren't talking about the President, they were talking about the AG or the Attorney General's Office in general.
[00:24:38.857 --> 00:24:43.399]  Comey says no, that'd be a big deal if anybody did that, because you don't tell the FBI not to do something.
[00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:44.380]  That would be a big deal.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.461]  Nobody did that.
[00:24:45.461 --> 00:24:48.022]  Now that's clear.
[00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:56.927]  Because I made a big deal out of this clip last month, because that's when Comey came out and released the memo.
[00:24:56.927 --> 00:24:58.047]  We now know he was the leaker.
[00:24:58.047 --> 00:24:58.808]  Trump said that early on.
[00:24:58.808 --> 00:24:59.728]  It's confirmed.
[00:24:59.728 --> 00:25:00.569]  That's the big issue here.
[00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:03.590]  That's so huge, so criminal, so illegal.
[00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.193]  And Comey came out and
[00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:15.564]  Release this memo implying, but not even let you see the memo, that Trump had ordered him to stop the investigation.
[00:25:15.564 --> 00:25:18.166]  So the media for a month ran with that.
[00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.728]  But now it turns out the memo doesn't even actually say that.
[00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:21.768]  So that's the big hoax.
[00:25:21.768 --> 00:25:23.730]  That's the other big fake news.
[00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:24.651]  So how do they fix that?
[00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:28.703]  Well, they just put out articles in the Daily Beast, the New York Times.
[00:25:28.703 --> 00:25:29.844]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[00:25:29.844 --> 00:25:31.565]  How dare him boost the stock market.
[00:25:31.565 --> 00:25:34.468]  This has no pertinent... Why was there a two-week-old clip?
[00:25:34.468 --> 00:25:34.688]  Why?
[00:25:34.688 --> 00:25:36.169]  He said it was new.
[00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.890]  No, I didn't.
[00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:45.997]  In our report that Daniels wrote, I said this is a two-week-old clip of him two months after the memo was written that we now hear of saying no one tried to influence him.
[00:25:45.997 --> 00:25:47.638]  That's totally pertinent.
[00:25:47.638 --> 00:25:53.663]  It absolutely impeaches his testimony 101 Perry Mason style.
[00:25:53.663 --> 00:25:54.544]  So how do they counter it?
[00:25:55.663 --> 00:25:59.987]  They say it's fake, it's misleading, it's not true, hoping you just don't read the story.
[00:25:59.987 --> 00:26:03.189]  But forget the story, we're gonna play the videos for you.
[00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:07.353]  But it gets better.
[00:26:07.353 --> 00:26:11.916]  Let's go to the clip from May, and then let's go to the clip from Thursday with Senator Burr.
[00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:15.620]  Here is the clip, the flashback from May.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:24.307]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.102]  In theory, yes.
[00:26:28.102 --> 00:26:30.024]  Has it happened?
[00:26:30.024 --> 00:26:38.031]  Not in my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[00:26:38.031 --> 00:26:43.795]  Oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there, and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[00:26:43.795 --> 00:26:47.939]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason.
[00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.080]  That would be a very big deal.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.022]  It's not happened in my experience.
[00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:54.077]  It's not happened in my experience.
[00:26:54.077 --> 00:26:56.018]  They went, oh, fake news!
[00:26:56.018 --> 00:26:57.459]  They're saying the Attorney General.
[00:26:57.459 --> 00:26:58.980]  That's the President's office.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.981]  That's the executive.
[00:26:59.981 --> 00:27:03.222]  That's the same thing.
[00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:07.745]  It's very clear that in his experience, it's not happened.
[00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:12.848]  This is two months after the secret memo, February 18th, is written, that they don't give the press.
[00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:16.810]  Somebody leaks it, Comey, now admits it if he were hiding in a cave somewhere.
[00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.673]  This adds great credibility to Trump.
[00:27:20.673 --> 00:27:21.333]  What do they do about it?
[00:27:22.654 --> 00:27:23.355]  They ignore it.
[00:27:23.355 --> 00:27:28.059]  But what do they do when three different senators asked the question last Thursday, and it's in the news?
[00:27:28.059 --> 00:27:28.679]  What do we do?
[00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:29.240]  What do we do?
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.481]  They confirm everything Trump said.
[00:27:31.481 --> 00:27:40.169]  You just come out, and you say Trump's son says that his father ordered him, or you know, ordered Comey to not investigate.
[00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:41.150]  It's not true.
[00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.631]  His son didn't say it.
[00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:45.934]  But CNN just runs the headline, and they don't care.
[00:27:47.307 --> 00:27:51.930]  Same deal, total lies, because they're so scared of this, of Comey being impeached.
[00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.251]  He's being exposed as a liar.
[00:27:54.251 --> 00:27:57.093]  So let's go to Senator Burr.
[00:27:57.093 --> 00:28:01.175]  Very quick clip, headlines everywhere about it.
[00:28:01.175 --> 00:28:07.759]  Ask him about it, and Comey says, no, he did not order me to stop the Russia investigation.
[00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:09.280]  Is this fake news too?
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:09.660]  Here it is.
[00:28:12.526 --> 00:28:21.390]  Did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.291]  Not to my understanding, no.
[00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:31.554]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you to stop the Russian investigation?
[00:28:31.554 --> 00:28:33.875]  No.
[00:28:33.875 --> 00:28:39.358]  Director, when the president requested that you, and I quote, let Flynn go,
[00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:52.088]  General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense.
[00:28:52.088 --> 00:29:01.336]  And if press accounts are right, there might have been discrepancies between facts and his FBI testimony.
[00:29:01.336 --> 00:29:03.679]  In your estimation- All right, folks, we'll be right back.
[00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:06.662]  The point is, Posobiak's tweet is the exact words.
[00:29:09.284 --> 00:29:13.525]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony.
[00:29:13.525 --> 00:29:24.267]  Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:36.470]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation for investigating him.
[00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.036]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his memos to the media.
[00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:46.122]  The memos that further stirred suspicions against Trump for alleged Russian involvement.
[00:29:46.122 --> 00:29:52.150]  However, coincidentally, the fact that Trump wasn't under FBI investigation was never leaked.
[00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.051]  To the media.
[00:29:53.051 --> 00:30:03.899]  Comey's testimony also revealed that our suspicions about Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch's bizarre meeting on the tarmac were valid and may even prompt further investigation.
[00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:06.541]  For more reports go to InfoWars.com.

[00:33:40.587 --> 00:33:42.227]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:42.227 --> 00:34:05.534]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:05.534 --> 00:34:07.915]  What happens to the New York Times and
[00:34:11.328 --> 00:34:28.997]  The Daily Beast and others when they get caught saying Comey never said that Trump did not ask him to drop the Russia investigation.
[00:34:28.997 --> 00:34:34.139]  We just played the clips of last week and then a month before.
[00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:40.743]  In two different hearings, Comey saying that and then they write articles saying I'm lying, Jack Pasowiak's lying.
[00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.541]  Cernovich is lying.
[00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:46.782]  We just played you the clips.
[00:34:46.782 --> 00:34:49.324]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:34:49.324 --> 00:34:51.466]  They're just branding us as the liars.
[00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:52.727]  I figured this out.
[00:34:52.727 --> 00:35:06.437]  They just picked us to say we're the liars because they know full well there are hundreds of headlines like this in the London Independent, AP, Reuters, you name it, where they did still put out the truth but it never hit the nightly news.
[00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:16.714]  James Comey, Trump did not ask me to drop investigation into Russian election meddling, but I just played you the video clips in the last segment.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.800]  And that's it.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.602]  They know not to challenge so-called journalistic groups when they watch C-SPAN and write what we wrote.
[00:35:25.602 --> 00:35:31.184]  They just say, oh, Alex Jones and Jack Posobiak and Mike Cernovich, they're liars.
[00:35:31.184 --> 00:35:31.764]  It's fake.
[00:35:31.764 --> 00:35:34.205]  And then don't even show where we're liars.
[00:35:34.205 --> 00:35:43.568]  Or they show an exact tweet by Posobiak that is the exact words of one of the hearings and say he's a liar and then say I'm a liar in the article.
[00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.845]  I'm asking you a question.
[00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:55.708]  How dumb do you think they think we are?
[00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:59.510]  Or is it true we're this dumb?
[00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.110]  That's the question.
[00:36:02.509 --> 00:36:09.271]  I'm gonna take that clip from right at that point and put it on the front of a Facebook and a YouTube video and just lay all that out later that's gonna go viral.
[00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:12.952]  I mean, New York Times caught red-handed, man!
[00:36:12.952 --> 00:36:15.193]  And the problem is, it's like this every day.
[00:36:15.193 --> 00:36:24.096]  I've got so many articles where I know the facts, I've seen the clips, I've read the bill, and I'm reading it and it's just total lies!
[00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:24.956]  Here's the Daily Beast.
[00:36:24.956 --> 00:36:30.938]  Jones put out the fake story that there were hearings, and Comey said that Trump never asked him to drop the Russia investigation.
[00:36:30.938 --> 00:36:32.178]  Jones is a filthy liar!
[00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.552]  More coming up at five o'clock.
[00:36:37.552 --> 00:36:40.313]  And you're just like, what?
[00:36:40.313 --> 00:36:46.076]  And then I go to any party or any anywhere in public and people walk up and they go, oh, you're all over the news.
[00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:49.618]  You're that guy that you're like known as the ultimate liar.
[00:36:49.618 --> 00:36:52.119]  And I'm like, oh, ultimate liar.
[00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:54.020]  Yeah, sure I am.
[00:36:58.055 --> 00:36:59.135]  But that's the idiots.
[00:36:59.135 --> 00:37:02.637]  I mean, there's a large portion of the public that understands they're being lied to.
[00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:08.239]  Not because I told them, they figured it out for themselves, but I don't see how the New York Times is getting away with this.
[00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:11.260]  I don't see how CNN is getting away with this.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.201]  I don't see how they do this anymore.
[00:37:14.201 --> 00:37:21.184]  Because, I mean, I saw the clip, and I read the tweets that were similar, where Donald Jr.
[00:37:21.184 --> 00:37:23.385]  was live-time tweeting the same stuff we were tweeting.
[00:37:23.385 --> 00:37:25.425]  Not that he was even following us, it's true!
[00:37:25.425 --> 00:37:26.906]  Come on, he says no, he never asked me.
[00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:31.280]  To block the Russian investigation.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.341]  He tweets, total vindication!
[00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:35.942]  Exactly what my dad said.
[00:37:35.942 --> 00:37:39.463]  If my dad told him to do it, it'd be straightforward.
[00:37:39.463 --> 00:37:43.125]  They go, they said if his dad told him that, it'd be straightforward.
[00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:44.726]  That means his dad did do it.
[00:37:44.726 --> 00:37:46.646]  No, Comey said it didn't happen.
[00:37:46.646 --> 00:37:49.288]  They don't care.
[00:37:49.288 --> 00:37:51.829]  They just say that Donald Jr.
[00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:53.550]  admits his dad did it.
[00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.030]  Complete opposite.
[00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.491]  Who cares?
[00:37:57.491 --> 00:37:58.472]  You see, they know Donald Jr.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.881]  He isn't a coward.
[00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:06.131]  He's one of the best people around his father who's got this country's back.
[00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:11.791]  That's why they're out to destroy him as well and slap him down and demonize him and attack him.
[00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:13.291]  Shut up!
[00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:13.691]  Stop it!
[00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:16.652]  You didn't see them say that on C-SPAN.
[00:38:16.652 --> 00:38:18.473]  Word for word he tweets what happened.
[00:38:18.473 --> 00:38:19.774]  Oh, did you see Donald Jr.
[00:38:19.774 --> 00:38:20.874]  lying again?
[00:38:20.874 --> 00:38:25.316]  Why he says that Comey says that Trump never said stop the Russian investigation.
[00:38:25.316 --> 00:38:28.757]  And listen, I've got more news than I can cover in 15 hours.
[00:38:28.757 --> 00:38:30.298]  I've got over 150 articles here, 30 or 40 video clips.
[00:38:35.373 --> 00:38:38.814]  Sometimes you just can't focus on all of it, because there's just too much.
[00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:40.875]  I could spend the next five hours just on this.
[00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:43.376]  This is insane!
[00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:47.957]  His son is on Fox News and tweets saying, of course my dad didn't order him to do that.
[00:38:47.957 --> 00:38:49.477]  It wouldn't be all ambiguous.
[00:38:49.477 --> 00:38:53.479]  If my dad was ordering him to do something, he'd have just done it!
[00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:56.239]  But Comey's like, well, he didn't order me, but I felt like I was.
[00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:57.640]  And his son's like, that's BS.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.361]  My dad's incredibly straightforward.
[00:39:00.361 --> 00:39:01.761]  Oh, you admit he did it!
[00:39:01.761 --> 00:39:04.062]  You admit- I mean, these people are scum!
[00:39:05.851 --> 00:39:10.416]  During the break, I went back there and got some more water.
[00:39:10.416 --> 00:39:14.581]  And I was sitting there watching CNN, and it was just like, Trump doesn't talk to Obama.
[00:39:14.581 --> 00:39:16.424]  He's the first president not to talk to other presidents.
[00:39:16.424 --> 00:39:18.146]  He's a horrible person.
[00:39:18.146 --> 00:39:21.810]  Just everything hammering, hammering, hammering.
[00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.332]  Before I get to all this other news, I want to
[00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:29.198]  Explain to people that may be on the fence why I'm backing Trump so hard.
[00:39:29.198 --> 00:39:32.339]  Why other conservatives kind of do it halfway or want to ride the fence, right?
[00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:33.639]  Like they're all holier than thou.
[00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:37.321]  And well, you know, Trump could have done better here or better there.
[00:39:37.321 --> 00:39:47.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at history, globalists have multinational monopoly combines.
[00:39:47.824 --> 00:39:48.724]  That's what globalism is.
[00:39:49.807 --> 00:40:01.193]  Multinational, tax-exempt, diplomatically immune, totally cold-blooded organizations have never been more afraid of anything than they have of Donald John Trump.
[00:40:01.193 --> 00:40:07.677]  Because he's not just some nationalist in the UK or some nationalist in France.
[00:40:07.677 --> 00:40:19.163]  He's a nationalist, free-market capitalist, American system guy that just took over the biggest economy in the world and is exposing that unelected multinationals have come in and taken over.
[00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:27.713]  And he's turning the economy back on because globalists can't compete with their monopoly economy against a free market economy.
[00:40:27.713 --> 00:40:32.555]  So they need America and its free market system to die to bring in their new managed economy.
[00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:34.896]  They can't deal with this.
[00:40:34.896 --> 00:40:51.004]  And there are some people that have been involved in the larger levels of governance, like Peter Thiel and others who know this, who's been actively trying to stop the New World Order, been trying to explain to people that non-capitalist, non-free market systems are hellish and we can't have a hybrid between communism and free market.
[00:40:51.004 --> 00:40:51.905]  It's going to be a disaster.
[00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:56.391]  And Trump is another one of those voices.
[00:40:56.391 --> 00:41:11.808]  Stephen Bannon is another one of those voices that want sanity, that want growing economies, that want an upwardly mobile middle class who aren't cold-blooded globalist consolidators, who aren't selfish jerks.
[00:41:17.461 --> 00:41:21.602]  And so I look at Trump, 3 trillion plus in the stock market.
[00:41:21.602 --> 00:41:23.182]  16% added since he was sworn in.
[00:41:23.182 --> 00:41:27.123]  Another 4 or 5% since he was just president-elect.
[00:41:27.123 --> 00:41:32.024]  That's 20-something points.
[00:41:32.024 --> 00:41:35.365]  I look at hundreds of billions of new jobs.
[00:41:35.365 --> 00:41:38.966]  Thousands of companies announcing expansion or return.
[00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:42.827]  And I see our flatline economy going over a cliff, suddenly bouncing back.
[00:41:43.993 --> 00:41:56.461]  And a good heart rate coming back, and the best jobs numbers since 1984, and just on and on and on, and new coal plants opening up, and coal mines reopening, the cheapest energy, the cleanest in the world!
[00:41:56.461 --> 00:41:58.143]  With the scrubbers!
[00:41:58.143 --> 00:42:10.271]  And I see him standing up to radical Islam, and I see him beginning 43% drop in illegals pouring across the border, and I see all of it, and I see all the mainstream media, and the communist Chinese, and the corrupt evil Pope,
[00:42:11.206 --> 00:42:22.550]  The globalist anti-Catholic Pope and all these people piled on telling us how evil he is in Hollywood and just people panicked on the streets seeing me like I'm Satan!
[00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.571]  Because I just want lower taxes and to have our own sovereignty.
[00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:30.833]  When all Trump's doing, I was talking to these people yesterday on the street, we're freaking out.
[00:42:30.833 --> 00:42:37.395]  They go, we're businessmen, we know our 401ks are doing great and we know our mutual funds are doing great, but we're really worried
[00:42:38.308 --> 00:42:41.411]  You know, because on and on and on, they just weren't even living in the real world.
[00:42:41.411 --> 00:42:46.277]  It was just all this fantasy, this hype by Hollywood and MSM that's lying to them.
[00:42:46.277 --> 00:42:56.848]  I mean, it's so obvious that Trump's the real deal truly delivering, and they're just lying everywhere, and only the weak-minded are buying into it.
[00:42:57.722 --> 00:42:59.905]  And folks buy into it via peer pressure, you name it.
[00:42:59.905 --> 00:43:03.910]  It is an example of leaders versus followers.
[00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:08.415]  But leaders have now come to the fore again to try to dial us back from destruction.
[00:43:09.136 --> 00:43:16.602]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:43:16.602 --> 00:43:29.811]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:43:30.752 --> 00:43:42.647]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:43:42.647 --> 00:43:48.614]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:43:49.355 --> 00:43:58.384]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:43:58.384 --> 00:44:06.592]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:10.311]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:44:10.311 --> 00:44:12.352]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:44:12.352 --> 00:44:15.254]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:44:15.254 --> 00:44:21.318]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:44:21.318 --> 00:44:30.503]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:44:30.503 --> 00:44:35.366]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:44:35.586 --> 00:44:38.029]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:44:38.029 --> 00:44:46.057]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:44:46.057 --> 00:44:47.038]  The general public doesn't.
[00:44:48.255 --> 00:44:52.177]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:44:52.177 --> 00:44:55.759]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:44:55.759 --> 00:45:02.463]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:45:02.463 --> 00:45:12.589]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:14.030]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.871]  David in Florida.
[00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:15.311]  You're on the air.
[00:45:16.286 --> 00:45:16.706]  Great!
[00:45:16.706 --> 00:45:17.847]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:45:17.847 --> 00:45:22.371]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:45:22.371 --> 00:45:24.072]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:45:24.072 --> 00:45:31.657]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:45:31.657 --> 00:45:32.558]  Wow, thank you.
[00:45:32.558 --> 00:45:34.800]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.441]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:45:36.681 --> 00:45:40.162]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:45:40.162 --> 00:45:40.682]  That's amazing.
[00:45:40.682 --> 00:45:41.442]  That's really incredible.
[00:45:41.442 --> 00:45:44.503]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:45.844]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[00:45:45.844 --> 00:45:47.504]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:45:47.504 --> 00:45:48.765]  And I love you guys.
[00:45:48.765 --> 00:45:50.905]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:57.767]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:45:57.767 --> 00:45:58.807]  You will love it.
[00:45:58.807 --> 00:45:59.308]  I'm telling you.
[00:45:59.308 --> 00:46:00.628]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:46:00.928 --> 00:46:05.371]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:09.774]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:09.774 --> 00:46:11.695]  Embrix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[00:46:11.695 --> 00:46:24.142]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[00:46:24.142 --> 00:46:29.906]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[00:46:30.086 --> 00:46:33.290]  High quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:37.915]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:46:37.915 --> 00:46:45.062]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:46:45.062 --> 00:46:46.204]  It's all there.
[00:46:46.204 --> 00:46:50.108]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it.
[00:46:50.228 --> 00:46:51.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:40.884]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:40.884 --> 00:47:45.588]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:52.839 --> 00:47:54.941]  Donald Trump is the man in the arena.
[00:47:54.941 --> 00:48:12.634]  You've got a bunch of followers, a bunch of cowards, a bunch of idiots, who live in a free country and have prosperity because their forebearers fought and died for it, believing a bunch of corporate-owned, foreign, globalist media that has hijacked this country via modern colonialism.
[00:48:12.634 --> 00:48:20.821]  Corporate colonialism is what globalism is, and who are using third-world populations to come in and drive down wages and balkanize and break up countries.
[00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:28.925]  And the full power of this exploitive globalist system is pointed at Europe and the United States trying to bring us down.
[00:48:28.925 --> 00:48:36.833]  Because if there's no more upward mobility, if there's no more West, then the whole planet can kind of settle into the new dark age of poverty.
[00:48:36.833 --> 00:48:39.956]  And that's why I'm supporting Trump, because it's so clear.
[00:48:39.956 --> 00:48:44.820]  You know a man by his enemies, and every evil organization on Earth is against Trump.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.401]  Is he perfect?
[00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:45.901]  Absolutely not.
[00:48:46.542 --> 00:48:59.107]  But he's trying to really bring jobs back and prosperity and empower the individual and build a world based around humanity, not a bunch of global elites.
[00:48:59.107 --> 00:49:03.229]  We have a guest coming on just to deal with the State of the Union.
[00:49:03.229 --> 00:49:10.992]  Jack Posobiec and how the New York Times and others are running around saying that Trump did tell Comey to stop the Russia investigation.
[00:49:10.992 --> 00:49:12.153]  That's a whole other fake news story.
[00:49:12.153 --> 00:49:12.853]  They keep saying that.
[00:49:13.837 --> 00:49:19.200]  And then when we put out the videos of what really happened in the hearings, they just say, no, it's fake.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.181]  Look at this transcript.
[00:49:20.181 --> 00:49:21.842]  It's a fake transcript.
[00:49:21.842 --> 00:49:24.384]  I can then play you the exact video word for word.
[00:49:24.384 --> 00:49:25.605]  I did it earlier.
[00:49:25.605 --> 00:49:30.428]  It's coming up again in the next hour because we can call them liars and fake all day.
[00:49:30.428 --> 00:49:34.010]  But why do all of us think of mainstream media as deceptive?
[00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:36.011]  AP did a study last year.
[00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:40.614]  Only 6% trust MSM.
[00:49:40.614 --> 00:49:43.196]  Our numbers are in the 80s in studies that are out there.
[00:49:44.935 --> 00:49:48.558]  That's why they call us the fake news all day because they're scared.
[00:49:48.558 --> 00:49:50.159]  Talk about this.
[00:49:50.159 --> 00:49:55.282]  I've never been to Russia.
[00:49:55.282 --> 00:50:00.526]  But I read news about what's happening in Russia from our own newspapers.
[00:50:00.526 --> 00:50:02.968]  And I also read some of the Russian news that's in English.
[00:50:02.968 --> 00:50:08.992]  I read Chinese news, Japanese news, Brazilian news, Mexican news, Canadian news, you name it.
[00:50:08.992 --> 00:50:11.974]  I'm a news junkie.
[00:50:11.974 --> 00:50:12.495]  And I know
[00:50:13.939 --> 00:50:25.085]  That over 30% of the media in Russia is US owned or Western combine owned.
[00:50:25.085 --> 00:50:35.110]  Now imagine if the Russians owned 30% or more, it's like 33% of our media, we would have a Russian problem and I'd be angry about it.
[00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:42.154]  The truth is about a third of our media is Spanish speaking and owned by multinationals that are creating a whole Reconquista Latin movement.
[00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:48.416]  So again, that's another part of globalism breaking our country up, but it's not the Russians that are doing it.
[00:50:48.416 --> 00:50:55.519]  There are over a hundred known NGOs funded by George Soros, a couple hundred more funded by the State Department.
[00:50:55.519 --> 00:51:06.204]  The same State Department that spent five billion plus dollars four years ago to foment the overthrow of an elected government in Ukraine, and then they stole
[00:51:10.031 --> 00:51:16.076]  The main Russian gas lines coming in out of Russia into Ukraine.
[00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:17.657]  In the east.
[00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:21.320]  Now, that's just facts.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.744]  And then they go, oh, Russia's anti-free speech.
[00:51:25.744 --> 00:51:29.847]  They're starting to not give tax exemption to all these George Soros groups.
[00:51:29.847 --> 00:51:32.229]  The same George Soros groups that are funding Black Lives Matter.
[00:51:32.229 --> 00:51:34.871]  Oh, I didn't even get to that yet.
[00:51:34.871 --> 00:51:37.293]  I'll cover some of that in the next hour as well.
[00:51:37.293 --> 00:51:38.955]  Our reporters were in downtown Austin.
[00:51:42.150 --> 00:52:02.875]  And there were communists and Muslims beating up families, and folks peacefully protesting against Sharia law that cuts women's genitals off, and that doesn't let women go out without a hood over their head, and that kills gays, throws them off buildings.
[00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:07.476]  All this is going on, and literally, we have hours of footage on Infowars.com,
[00:52:09.013 --> 00:52:18.126]  Of Trump supporters being beaten up, being hit, being spit on, and we got people, even more powerful footage, people with machine guns out there.
[00:52:18.126 --> 00:52:19.108]  Now this is the left.
[00:52:20.558 --> 00:52:29.363]  That openly says they don't believe anybody should own guns, but they're out there with hammers and sickles and machine guns and weapons, threatening everybody.
[00:52:29.363 --> 00:52:31.644]  And the riot police had to come in.
[00:52:31.644 --> 00:52:36.246]  You've got a couple hundred people, it happened in every city, in an anti-sharia law deal.
[00:52:36.246 --> 00:52:42.450]  You can't have our law, they're an outside Islamic law, that's incredibly oppressive and says you gotta be a Muslim and women aren't human and all the rest of this.
[00:52:44.079 --> 00:52:48.621]  And there is just hours of footage on Infowars.com, the most incredible stuff ever.
[00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:52.343]  But there's so much cussing, we can't really play it here, of them screaming, cussing, attacking.
[00:52:52.343 --> 00:53:00.346]  And it's Muslims, with communists, funded by George Soros, they admit Soros funded it, out there beating people up.
[00:53:00.346 --> 00:53:05.649]  Owen Schreier got punched repeatedly, got attacked.
[00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:08.410]  Same thing happened to Rob Dood, but I'm digressing.
[00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:12.012]  The point is, we have George Soros funding these same groups inside Russia.
[00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:21.385]  There were hundreds of these guys in black masks with wooden clubs, and they had their AK-47s out there on the street.
[00:53:21.385 --> 00:53:23.126]  But remember, these are liberals, these are communists.
[00:53:23.126 --> 00:53:28.469]  They want the government to take our guns, because they're not going to give theirs up during some type of armed revolt.
[00:53:28.469 --> 00:53:32.211]  And they are the most incoherent, mindless, stupid, literally, mentally...
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:34.641]  Scrambled!
[00:53:34.641 --> 00:53:37.123]  I mean, they just look like they've been put in microwave ovens.
[00:53:37.123 --> 00:53:39.204]  And it's not just us taking clips out of context.
[00:53:39.204 --> 00:53:42.827]  Someone asked you to try to boil this down, because there's like 10 hours of it.
[00:53:42.827 --> 00:53:49.972]  I watched it for like an hour last night, and about two hours today, I could not believe it.
[00:53:49.972 --> 00:53:52.334]  How incoherent, how hateful, how evil.
[00:53:52.334 --> 00:53:54.356]  And they would attack men, women, and children.
[00:53:56.874 --> 00:54:13.487]  And they would scream, you're violating my free speech, communism, communism, kill Trump, F Alex Jones, F Infowars, you're a racist, and then just slam people in the head, and then the riot police would run over, because it was at the Capitol, and just stop them, not arrest them.
[00:54:13.487 --> 00:54:16.169]  They should have beat their brains out, because they're attacking people.
[00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:17.350]  They should have clubbed them over the head!
[00:54:18.464 --> 00:54:26.691]  The cops run over just to stop them, and they go, oh, police state, oh, oh, police state, oh, police, racist, racist, racist.
[00:54:26.691 --> 00:54:28.372]  Racist?
[00:54:28.372 --> 00:54:29.773]  I'm not for a real police state.
[00:54:29.773 --> 00:54:34.397]  You're the ones bringing that in.
[00:54:34.397 --> 00:54:36.498]  The police were way too lenient.
[00:54:36.498 --> 00:54:44.825]  And I watched all the patriots that were out there exposing oppressive, incompatible, fascistic, sharia law, anti-woman, anti-freedom.
[00:54:46.039 --> 00:54:51.361]  I mean, look, you got guys with clubs and shields threatening to hit the cops.
[00:54:51.361 --> 00:54:52.081]  Let me tell you something.
[00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:54.782]  A guy walks up to me with a club in his hand and a shield.
[00:54:54.782 --> 00:54:58.323]  I'm going to attack him because he's already set up to attack me.
[00:54:58.323 --> 00:54:59.364]  And I'm showing video.
[00:54:59.364 --> 00:55:02.485]  If you're a radio listener, I can't play audio because there's, well, fade it up for a minute.
[00:55:02.485 --> 00:55:03.865]  We'll delay if there's any cussing.
[00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.446]  Because there's so much cussing here.
[00:55:05.446 --> 00:55:07.206]  Go ahead and fade it up.
[00:55:07.206 --> 00:55:13.368]  Women's rights, you know, safety, safety for women, you know, domestic violence and all this kind of stuff.
[00:55:13.368 --> 00:55:14.769]  We can play this because it's a Patriot.
[00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:15.249]  She won't cuss.
[00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:18.377]  Let's stop right there.
[00:55:40.521 --> 00:55:59.566]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, everybody's mixed, whatever, humans, all beautiful crowd of people out there standing saying Sharia law is anti-human, Sharia law kills gays, Sharia law does honor killings of women, Sharia law does public executions for people, you know, and the left is out there frothing and see here's the deal, I don't hype my show.
[00:55:59.566 --> 00:56:02.447]  I don't do things like other talk show hosts.
[00:56:02.447 --> 00:56:04.788]  I should have started the show and said we have the most riveting
[00:56:06.488 --> 00:56:09.630]  Communist and Muslim footage attacking peaceful crowds.
[00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.131]  Oh, it's so bombshell.
[00:56:12.131 --> 00:56:15.333]  And oh, we have the New York Times caught in a huge fake story about Trump.
[00:56:15.333 --> 00:56:16.573]  Oh, it's coming up.
[00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:19.175]  I just go into whatever I think is the biggest story.
[00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:25.018]  And I'm kind of sitting here going, was the biggest story the New York Times putting out fake news against Trump?
[00:56:26.161 --> 00:56:27.942]  Or is the bigger story Antifa?
[00:56:27.942 --> 00:56:28.843]  I don't know what it is anymore.
[00:56:28.843 --> 00:56:30.304]  But I tell you, I have a limited crew.
[00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:32.465]  On the weekend, there's only like three people on.
[00:56:32.465 --> 00:56:33.906]  So they've been up here all day getting ready.
[00:56:33.906 --> 00:56:34.687]  There's no way they could watch.
[00:56:34.687 --> 00:56:35.407]  I'm not kidding.
[00:56:35.407 --> 00:56:38.970]  We have like five hours ourselves, another 20 hours with a video.
[00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:40.250]  I mean, I can't even watch it all.
[00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:43.573]  Every video on Infowars is so riveting.
[00:56:43.573 --> 00:56:46.755]  When dirty communists are beating men, women, and children with clubs,
[00:56:47.825 --> 00:57:01.669]  And screaming, anti-free speech, racist, like mentally ill, upside down, 1984, up is down, down is up, and all we're trying to do is secure the free market and cut taxes and get you more money.
[00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:06.251]  And they're running around the lap of freedom, bitching and complaining, I can't handle it anymore.
[00:57:06.251 --> 00:57:09.892]  Jack Posobiec's coming up, I got a bunch of clips of Trump saying he'll testify.
[00:57:11.417 --> 00:57:16.541]  Saying he's 100% ready and Comey, again, is a complete liar and a coward.
[00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:18.003]  That's all coming up second hour.
[00:57:18.003 --> 00:57:20.044]  But do your duty in the fight against the globalists.
[00:57:20.044 --> 00:57:21.065]  They want to shut us down.
[00:57:21.065 --> 00:57:21.746]  Spread the word.
[00:57:21.746 --> 00:57:22.606]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:25.806]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:25.806 --> 00:57:44.421]  And the great nutraceuticals, the great products, the water filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the Trump is my president shirts, the great fluoride-free super blue colloidal silver, iodine-based toothpaste, super blue, been sold out, back in stock, 33% off, biotrue selenium out of the gate, 25% off the new line of Embrix Essentials.
[00:57:44.421 --> 00:57:45.161]  Ladies and gentlemen,

[00:57:48.663 --> 00:57:52.905]  It's one of the top nations, the top brands, but we got to private label it.
[00:57:52.905 --> 00:57:54.305]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:54.305 --> 00:57:55.626]  Help fund the Info War.
[00:57:55.626 --> 00:57:57.426]  We're winning, but we need your support.
[00:57:57.426 --> 00:57:58.847]  We're in the enemy's face.
[00:57:58.847 --> 00:58:04.049]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at Infowarstore.com.
[00:58:04.249 --> 00:58:07.091]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:09.093]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:58:09.093 --> 00:58:14.097]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:58:14.097 --> 00:58:16.199]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:58:16.199 --> 00:58:17.480]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.604]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:58:22.604 --> 00:58:25.967]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:58:27.548 --> 00:58:32.469]  Superblue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:58:32.469 --> 00:58:36.171]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:58:36.171 --> 00:58:43.073]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:58:43.073 --> 00:58:50.576]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.

[00:58:59.861 --> 00:59:06.364]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:59:06.364 --> 00:59:19.351]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:59:19.351 --> 00:59:23.013]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:59:23.013 --> 00:59:26.555]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[00:59:26.835 --> 00:59:29.976]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:59:29.976 --> 00:59:42.841]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:59:42.841 --> 00:59:44.402]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:59:44.682 --> 00:59:51.088]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:59:51.088 --> 00:59:56.052]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.052 --> 00:59:58.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:26.886 --> 01:00:30.128]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:45.680]  Yeah, that's more Americana right there.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.622]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:48.622 --> 01:00:54.927]  I haven't dropped the ball, but it's about two weeks ago I launched the contest, $300,000 in prizes.
[01:00:57.082 --> 01:01:00.167]  To go out with the shirts that say CNN is ISIS.
[01:01:00.167 --> 01:01:03.712]  Make your own shirts, buy our shirts.
[01:01:03.712 --> 01:01:06.175]  Just expose mainstream media as a fraud.
[01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:11.803]  And we've gotten a bunch of videos in, but the staff's so limited, we're having to plow through those to get the guest on.
[01:01:13.393 --> 01:01:16.876]  And to cover those issues, but soon we're going to really be paying out those prizes.
[01:01:16.876 --> 01:01:17.776]  I've already paid out a few.
[01:01:17.776 --> 01:01:24.981]  You know, the guy that caught CNN doing fake newscasts to cover up for the Muslim attack in Manchester and London Bridge.
[01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:30.145]  We've done that, but we're about to really start having those guests on, playing those clips, just like we did with the Bill Clinton's rapist contest.
[01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.586]  But I see what you're doing.
[01:01:31.586 --> 01:01:32.147]  It's awesome.
[01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:32.747]  It's amazing.
[01:01:32.747 --> 01:01:36.270]  I don't do a lot of contests because we bite off more than we can chew.
[01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:38.852]  It really explodes in a successful way.
[01:01:38.852 --> 01:01:40.413]  It just, then it ties down our crew.
[01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:41.753]  He's
[01:02:02.406 --> 01:02:06.109]  The tapes of the Comey investigation says you're going to be very disappointed.
[01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:11.212]  Trump says he would be 100% testifying under oath, denies Comey claims on Flynn and loyalty.
[01:02:11.212 --> 01:02:11.793]  Trump's smart.
[01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:15.375]  He wants to get in there before Congress and tear the hell out of them.
[01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:18.598]  Instead, they want to bring in Comey and other enemies.
[01:02:18.598 --> 01:02:22.640]  But despite the fact that they brought Comey in, he fell flat on his face.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.302]  That's why they want to have him back again.
[01:02:25.302 --> 01:02:25.983]  Here's the clip of Trump.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.101]  Who would like to ask?
[01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:33.608]  Should I take one of the killer networks that treat me so badly as fake news?
[01:02:33.608 --> 01:02:34.389]  Go ahead, John.
[01:02:42.202 --> 01:02:43.203]  Be fair, John.
[01:02:43.203 --> 01:02:43.743]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:02:43.743 --> 01:02:46.545]  Remember how nice you used to be before I ran?
[01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:47.746]  Such a nice man.
[01:02:47.746 --> 01:02:49.327]  Always fair.
[01:02:49.327 --> 01:02:52.710]  Mr. President, I want to get back to James Comey's testimony.
[01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:55.952]  You suggested he didn't tell the truth in everything he said.
[01:02:55.952 --> 01:03:04.719]  He did say, under oath, that you told him to let the Flynn... You said you hoped the Flynn investigation... I didn't say that.
[01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:05.900]  So he lied about that?
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.321]  Well, I didn't say that.
[01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:08.842]  I mean, I will tell you, I didn't say that.
[01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:11.429]  And did he ask you to pledge loyalty?
[01:03:11.429 --> 01:03:16.141]  And there'd be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today, but I did not say that.
[01:03:17.196 --> 01:03:19.618]  And did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you?
[01:03:19.618 --> 01:03:20.499]  That's another thing he said.
[01:03:20.499 --> 01:03:21.520]  No, he did not.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.062]  So he said those things under oath.
[01:03:23.062 --> 01:03:27.305]  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events?
[01:03:27.305 --> 01:03:28.827]  One hundred percent.
[01:03:28.827 --> 01:03:30.789]  I didn't say under oath.
[01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:31.830]  I hardly know the man.
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:34.272]  I'm not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance.
[01:03:34.272 --> 01:03:35.273]  Who would do that?
[01:03:35.273 --> 01:03:38.476]  Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
[01:03:38.476 --> 01:03:39.417]  I mean, think of it.
[01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:40.397]  I hardly know the man.
[01:03:41.138 --> 01:03:42.378]  It doesn't make sense.
[01:03:42.378 --> 01:03:44.779]  No, I didn't say that, and I didn't say the other.
[01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:48.060]  So if Robert Mueller wanted to speak with you about that, you would be willing to talk to him?
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.660]  I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, Jim.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:57.042]  Now, let's go ahead and play, because notice they didn't say in that press conference the day after Comey, oh, Comey said you never ordered him to.
[01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.022]  They just acted like Trump had said that.
[01:04:00.022 --> 01:04:01.503]  Here is the clip from Thursday.
[01:04:04.488 --> 01:04:13.351]  Did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:15.272]  Not to my understanding, no.
[01:04:15.272 --> 01:04:23.515]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you to stop the Russian investigation?
[01:04:23.515 --> 01:04:25.856]  No.
[01:04:25.856 --> 01:04:31.338]  Director, when the president requested that you, and I quote, let Flynn go,
[01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:43.098]  General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.361]  A couple months ago, last Thursday, it never happened.
[01:04:56.361 --> 01:05:02.583]  The New York Times, owned by the Kingpin of Mexico, Carlos Slim, says it never happened.
[01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:06.865]  And of course, Obama said you never built your business, and that Obamacare was free.
[01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:11.527]  We'll be back.
[01:05:11.527 --> 01:05:16.349]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book!
[01:05:18.993 --> 01:05:26.478]  And it's about 13 historical women who pursued their goals in the face of opposition.
[01:05:26.478 --> 01:05:45.252]  The rebel media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant idea of asking her to sign the book titled, She Persisted, for Juanita Broderick, who as we all know, was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary.
[01:05:45.592 --> 01:05:47.473]  Can you sign it for my friend Juanita Broderick?
[01:05:47.473 --> 01:05:51.516]  Because she's been silenced by your parents, especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist.
[01:05:51.516 --> 01:05:53.277]  Can you sign it for her?
[01:05:53.277 --> 01:06:00.242]  Naturally, Chelsea refused to sign the book, but her reaction was priceless.
[01:06:00.242 --> 01:06:04.965]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.731 --> 01:06:11.352]  We've got it.
[01:06:11.352 --> 01:06:17.879]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:17.879 --> 01:06:22.265]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:22.265 --> 01:06:27.891]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:43.084 --> 01:06:48.050]  I'm not fake news, but I am teleprompter 3.
[01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:49.712]  I'm the same Jack Posobiec.
[01:06:49.712 --> 01:06:56.359]  I've been aware of Jack Posobiec for about a year and a half, leading one of the biggest grassroots organizations for Trump, doing a great job as a journalist.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.743]  And reporter often retweeted by the president and others and under massive demonization.
[01:07:02.743 --> 01:07:08.827]  But that's the great part about being teleprompter free is sometimes in the brain, you're not reading off a teleprompter, you butcher names.
[01:07:08.827 --> 01:07:13.570]  So Jack Posobiec is our guest, citizensfortrump.com, therebel.media.
[01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:16.552]  He's a writer, filmmaker, recovering political operative.
[01:07:16.552 --> 01:07:21.675]  2016, Jack was the Special Projects Director for Citizens for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organization in the U.S.
[01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.126]  Wow, you got my whole life story there.
[01:07:24.126 --> 01:07:24.727]  I appreciate that.
[01:07:48.624 --> 01:07:49.265]  You bet.
[01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:52.831]  I feel like I know you for a year and a half, but I'm always reading your name, so I'm sorry.
[01:07:52.831 --> 01:07:56.758]  You know, though, I'm famous for butchering names, so please forgive me.
[01:07:56.758 --> 01:07:57.780]  No, it's okay.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.300]  I understand.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.104]  It's got that weird double-letter thing at the end.
[01:08:00.805 --> 01:08:02.926]  Dude, I can barely read my last name sometimes.
[01:08:02.926 --> 01:08:05.107]  Now, let's get serious though here.
[01:08:05.107 --> 01:08:06.767]  Yes.
[01:08:06.767 --> 01:08:09.348]  You know, I snuck into Bohemian Grove 17 years ago.
[01:08:09.348 --> 01:08:11.649]  They said it wasn't real, it was fake footage.
[01:08:11.649 --> 01:08:18.952]  Now, this month, you know, the new episode, kickoff of the season for House of Cards admits Bohemian Grove.
[01:08:18.952 --> 01:08:21.553]  So the point is, we're not fake news, we're real news.
[01:08:21.553 --> 01:08:26.295]  And I want to dive into what I covered in the last hour for new listeners that tuned in, but get your take on it.
[01:08:26.295 --> 01:08:29.076]  How do you crystallize the magnitude
[01:08:30.387 --> 01:08:35.229]  Of your story in the New York Times yesterday, because I'm demonizing it as well, so are others.
[01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:37.170]  Mike Cernovich.
[01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.631]  Because it's cut and dry, they had these hearings.
[01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:43.632]  Two hearings where he said Trump or no one else ever asked him to stop the investigation.
[01:08:43.632 --> 01:08:46.473]  The media ignores that, but they go further.
[01:08:46.473 --> 01:08:53.296]  They then say that you made up a tweet quote that we have the damn video of the congressional hearing of.
[01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:55.617]  This is next level BS.
[01:08:55.617 --> 01:08:57.678]  In what world are they operating, Jack Posobiec?
[01:08:59.119 --> 01:09:01.660]  Yeah, they're actually becoming the thing that they hate.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:06.323]  They're projecting their version of, you know, they call it alternative reality, alternative facts.
[01:09:06.323 --> 01:09:08.564]  They're actually creating fake news.
[01:09:08.564 --> 01:09:10.705]  They're calling me a conspiracy theorist.
[01:09:10.705 --> 01:09:12.926]  You know, I looked up the definition of the word conspiracy.
[01:09:12.926 --> 01:09:15.488]  That's talking about, you know, covert agencies and influence.
[01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:18.429]  I quoted the director of the FBI under oath.
[01:09:18.429 --> 01:09:20.110]  I quoted his testimony.
[01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:21.651]  This is not a conspiracy.
[01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:34.377]  But now we're living in a world where to the New York Times, to CNN, to many of these globalist-tied organizations, we know about the Washington Post ties to the CIA, we know about New York Times host to Carlos Slim, the billionaire from Mexico.
[01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:37.299]  They're living in a world where facts just don't matter.
[01:09:38.072 --> 01:09:38.432]  That's right.
[01:09:38.432 --> 01:09:43.754]  And if you just joined us and you're a radio or TV listener, or if you were already on the last hour, like, yeah, we know they lie.
[01:09:43.754 --> 01:09:45.415]  We've got to prove this to people that don't understand it.
[01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:47.336]  And this is one of the most blaring cases.
[01:09:47.336 --> 01:09:51.537]  They say a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet and a runaway story.
[01:09:51.537 --> 01:09:56.479]  And then they say, oh, Posobiec put out a fake tweet and then Limbaugh picked it up.
[01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:58.300]  Oh, my God, it was a top story last week.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:07.303]  That Comey said nobody ever tried to influence him, and they don't tell you to the end of the story that there is a video, and that it was a month ago, which doesn't make it deceptive.
[01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:07.944]  It doesn't matter.
[01:10:07.944 --> 01:10:17.287]  You were being very clear that he's already testified to that, and that he said two months before, from a memo, that he put out that Trump had tried to influence him.
[01:10:17.287 --> 01:10:19.268]  So, he's lying one way or the other.
[01:10:19.268 --> 01:10:20.749]  This is such an important clip.
[01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:26.412]  So what do you think is happening, Jack?
[01:10:26.412 --> 01:10:32.196]  You know, it's Orwellian in the sense that the lies of today don't match up to the lies of tomorrow.
[01:10:32.196 --> 01:10:33.777]  And I'm not even creating anything here.
[01:10:33.777 --> 01:10:43.664]  I'm really just pointing out to them that your narrative today does not match the narrative of one month prior, the testimony that was given under oath by James Comey.
[01:10:43.664 --> 01:10:44.965]  All we're doing is putting it up.
[01:10:44.965 --> 01:10:46.326]  And that's what we're doing here.
[01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:47.907]  And the New York Times realizes this, Alex.
[01:10:47.907 --> 01:10:49.048]  That's why he's attacking me.
[01:10:49.048 --> 01:10:52.030]  That's why people like Media Matters and David Brock are attacking us so much.
[01:10:52.410 --> 01:11:11.402]  Because we're destroying their programming, we're breaking the conditioning, we're taking down their narrative with facts, with figures, with video, with clips, because we have new media, we have platforms like Infowars.com, we have the ability to hold their feet to the fire, and, and as the New York Times reports, this actually made it to President Trump's desk himself.
[01:11:11.402 --> 01:11:16.045]  They actually said Melania was the one that brought it to him, which I think is amazing, so I'm glad to be read by the First Lady.
[01:11:16.886 --> 01:11:19.489]  Absolutely, and let's expand on this.
[01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:20.931]  I'm going to read part of this quote.
[01:11:20.931 --> 01:11:23.014]  I'm going to play the clip because they say this is fake.
[01:11:24.332 --> 01:11:25.732]  This is not real.
[01:11:25.732 --> 01:11:27.673]  Posobiec was mad he made this up.
[01:11:27.673 --> 01:11:31.794]  You can read the article, folks, New York Times, titled, A Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theorist.
[01:11:31.794 --> 01:11:38.996]  And it says, Comey, not my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[01:11:38.996 --> 01:11:39.836]  Then he goes on.
[01:11:39.836 --> 01:11:42.457]  So they say this is made up by Jack Posobiec.
[01:11:42.457 --> 01:11:43.958]  They say this.
[01:11:43.958 --> 01:11:48.459]  And then they go, Alex Jones and put it out, and everybody else put it out, and we're all so evil.
[01:11:48.459 --> 01:11:49.939]  We're just these horrible demons.
[01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.920]  Here is the clip of what they say doesn't exist.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.220]  Here it is.
[01:11:53.484 --> 01:12:02.207]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[01:12:02.207 --> 01:12:06.129]  In theory, yes.
[01:12:06.129 --> 01:12:06.769]  Has it happened?
[01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:15.608]  Not in my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[01:12:15.608 --> 01:12:21.694]  I mean, oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there, and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[01:12:21.694 --> 01:12:25.818]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason.
[01:12:25.818 --> 01:12:26.959]  That would be a very big deal.
[01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:29.821]  It's not happened in my experience.
[01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:32.484]  Not happened in my experience, Jack Posobiec.
[01:12:33.356 --> 01:12:34.017]  He says it twice.
[01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:35.559]  It doesn't happen in my experience.
[01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:39.704]  He makes no qualifiers about it being about one specific official or another.
[01:12:39.704 --> 01:12:42.068]  He doesn't say, you know, a lynch.
[01:12:42.068 --> 01:12:43.630]  He doesn't say Trump.
[01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.771]  He doesn't say Obama.
[01:12:44.771 --> 01:12:48.356]  He says, not happened in my experience with no qualifiers whatsoever.
[01:12:48.636 --> 01:13:05.805]  And that, of course, compounded on the fact, and I mentioned this to the New York Times in my interview, they didn't report it, but I said, you know, wouldn't what Loretta, what he testified, that Loretta Lynch later put pressure on him to take back the investigation talk of Hillary Clinton, to downplay it, call it a matter, instead of an investigation.
[01:13:05.805 --> 01:13:07.966]  I guess he works for the Federal Bureau of Matters now.
[01:13:08.646 --> 01:13:15.208]  Uh, wouldn't that also constitute something pushing back, trying to stop an investigation by Loretta Lynch?
[01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:19.590]  So either way, the guy's testimony does not match his previous testimony.
[01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:20.650]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:21.950]  He said I made it up.
[01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:24.831]  And we were all conspiracy theorists when we thought Comey was the main leaker.
[01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:25.972]  Trump said that.
[01:13:25.972 --> 01:13:27.232]  And now we know Comey was a leaker.
[01:13:27.232 --> 01:13:31.133]  They know Trump knows, so he's just covering his butt by bringing this out.
[01:13:31.133 --> 01:13:32.234]  Now, let's play another clip, though.
[01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:36.997]  You watch CNN, you watch MSNBC, you watch ABC, NBC.
[01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:41.082]  They're still saying, Comey says that you told him to shut down the investigation.
[01:13:41.082 --> 01:13:49.431]  The truth is Comey had to admit that's not what happened, but everyone is ignoring this clip and others from Thursday's hearing, which again they're trying to say is fake news.
[01:13:49.431 --> 01:13:52.695]  But here is C-SPAN, here is Senator Burr talking to Comey.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:04.489]  Did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[01:14:04.489 --> 01:14:06.391]  Not to my understanding, no.
[01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:14.660]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you to stop the Russian investigation?
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.120]  No.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.661]  That's enough.
[01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:18.732]  And I have two other clips during the hearing the same thing.
[01:14:18.732 --> 01:14:23.717]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you're going, wait a minute, I saw CNN today, they said that happened.
[01:14:23.717 --> 01:14:32.527]  I just played a clip at the start of the hour, if folks weren't tuned in, where they're asking Trump questions and they're saying, you ordered them to stop investigating Flynn.
[01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:33.768]  Alex, what they're trying to do is
[01:14:52.674 --> 01:15:01.424]  ...is keep a grip, whatever way they can, on the left, the few people that are still reading the New York Times, that are still looking to them for truth.
[01:15:01.424 --> 01:15:03.687]  They've realized that their credibility is shot.
[01:15:03.687 --> 01:15:07.291]  It was shot at the end of the last election when they said Hillary Clinton, 85% chance to win.
[01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:07.752]  No, I agree.
[01:15:07.752 --> 01:15:12.638]  They have nothing to lose except their own Kool-Aid drinking cult, so now they're just purely speaking to the cult.
[01:15:13.697 --> 01:15:15.358]  They're purely speaking to the call.
[01:15:15.358 --> 01:15:20.661]  Everyone else that's woken up to this, everyone else that understands the programming understands.
[01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:23.043]  It's like they live, and you've got the glasses on, right?
[01:15:23.043 --> 01:15:34.049]  So, everybody knows that what they're telling you is not true, but they've got to come up with some way to keep it going, to keep the cognitive dissonance, their conditioning going for the people that have been listening to them.
[01:15:34.049 --> 01:15:36.311]  But that number is dwindling and dwindling every day.
[01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:37.051]  You know, it's funny.
[01:15:37.051 --> 01:15:39.633]  I actually was trying to find a copy of the New York Times today.
[01:15:39.633 --> 01:15:40.593]  I said, hey, I'm in the New York Times.
[01:15:40.593 --> 01:15:41.354]  I want to find a copy.
[01:15:42.094 --> 01:15:47.499]  I couldn't find it at any of the stores around where I live, because they don't carry it anymore.
[01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:48.119]  Absolutely.
[01:15:48.119 --> 01:15:49.040]  I mean, they're dead.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:49.380]  It's over.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.761]  They claim, oh, our subscriptions are up.
[01:15:50.761 --> 01:15:52.162]  Well, of course, for the election.
[01:15:52.162 --> 01:15:54.064]  We had three times the listeners during the election.
[01:15:54.064 --> 01:15:55.045]  They go, oh, you're going down.
[01:15:55.045 --> 01:15:56.246]  No, we were going up.
[01:15:56.246 --> 01:15:56.846]  Hit a new peak.
[01:15:56.846 --> 01:15:57.787]  Now we're at a new plateau.
[01:15:57.787 --> 01:15:59.768]  But our audience is the biggest ever.
[01:15:59.768 --> 01:16:02.311]  In the aggregate, they are going straight down.
[01:16:02.311 --> 01:16:03.191]  They are bankrupt.
[01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:05.333]  They are propped up by a kingpin.
[01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:06.554]  Jack Posobiec, straight ahead.
[01:16:06.554 --> 01:16:07.475]  I'll tell you about his new book, too.
[01:16:08.974 --> 01:16:10.575]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:17:17.744 --> 01:17:25.827]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:17:26.147 --> 01:17:31.009]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:17:31.009 --> 01:17:37.812]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[01:17:44.995 --> 01:17:52.017]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:55.759]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be
[01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:56.480]  Disappointed.

[01:18:09.767 --> 01:18:13.749]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:13.749 --> 01:18:15.230]  We've been sold out for months.

[01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:24.454]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.

[01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:32.178]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:18:34.099 --> 01:18:37.582]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:18:37.582 --> 01:18:49.830]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system, to DNA production and eyesight, BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.862]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:19:05.862 --> 01:19:07.363]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:19:07.363 --> 01:19:10.706]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:10.706 --> 01:19:16.190]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:22.455]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:19:22.455 --> 01:19:26.919]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:27.039 --> 01:19:31.682]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:19:31.682 --> 01:19:32.802]  I don't feel good.
[01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:36.565]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:19:36.565 --> 01:19:39.266]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:19:39.266 --> 01:19:45.070]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:48.031]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:19:48.031 --> 01:19:51.553]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:53.795]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:19:53.795 --> 01:19:54.155]  I love it.
[01:19:54.295 --> 01:19:57.097]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:19:57.097 --> 01:19:58.118]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:19:58.118 --> 01:20:04.101]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing, that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:20:04.101 --> 01:20:05.963]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:20:05.963 --> 01:20:13.408]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:16.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.902 --> 01:20:33.348]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.348 --> 01:20:40.494]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[01:20:40.494 --> 01:20:46.759]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:48.925 --> 01:20:52.047]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Jack Posobiec with us a little bit in the next segment.
[01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:55.690]  And I want to get Mike Cernovich on, because he's demonized this article too, and I want to be clear.
[01:20:55.690 --> 01:20:58.112]  We're not talking about this because we're in an article.
[01:20:58.112 --> 01:21:07.359]  I'm in, without exaggerating, 50 articles a day I know of, you know, all over TV, all over everywhere, lying about me, taking stuff out of context.
[01:21:07.359 --> 01:21:09.501]  It's just so crazy now.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.803]  That you see these headlines every day that are just totally false.
[01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:17.445]  I mean, I see so many now, it makes my head spin.
[01:21:17.445 --> 01:21:22.109]  And Jack Posobiec, author, researcher, political operative, patriot, is our guest.
[01:21:22.109 --> 01:21:25.933]  I want to talk some about your book at the start of the next segment that I didn't know just came out today.
[01:21:25.933 --> 01:21:26.974]  In fact, I want to carry your book.
[01:21:26.974 --> 01:21:31.998]  I know your books are great at InfoWarsTore.com, but you'll tell us about your book at the start of the next segment.
[01:21:31.998 --> 01:21:34.040]  But just, I don't want to be overconfident.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.022]  I agree that globalists are crazy.
[01:21:37.547 --> 01:21:40.508]  I agree they're out of control.
[01:21:40.508 --> 01:21:45.389]  I agree they're starting to lose, but they've got so much bravado and they keep doubling down.
[01:21:45.389 --> 01:21:49.130]  They ran their scam during the election saying it was 15 points behind in polls.
[01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:51.231]  We knew the scientific polls show that Trump was really ahead.
[01:21:51.231 --> 01:21:52.611]  I said that over and over again.
[01:21:52.611 --> 01:21:53.831]  We saw the truth on election day.
[01:21:53.831 --> 01:21:54.972]  We know they had fake polls.
[01:21:54.972 --> 01:21:55.592]  We know they had fake...
[01:21:56.953 --> 01:22:01.701]  Questions being given out to Hillary before the whole situation with the debates.
[01:22:01.701 --> 01:22:03.024]  We know that.
[01:22:03.024 --> 01:22:07.732]  As informed people that actually have a pulse and have IQs above room temperature.
[01:22:09.485 --> 01:22:11.386]  But now it's not like a campaign.
[01:22:11.386 --> 01:22:13.408]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:22:13.408 --> 01:22:18.132]  And conservatives and libertarians aren't used to just fighting 24-7.
[01:22:18.132 --> 01:22:19.413]  We have jobs.
[01:22:19.413 --> 01:22:21.454]  So I'm not being negative.
[01:22:21.454 --> 01:22:29.981]  I'm just saying the wall of lies, even though Trump's delivering on the economy and doing so many great things, is affecting some people.
[01:22:29.981 --> 01:22:32.283]  And the globalists are just doubling, doubling down.
[01:22:32.283 --> 01:22:33.864]  So where do you see this going?
[01:22:35.885 --> 01:22:37.986]  You know, Alex, that's exactly right.
[01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:44.049]  And what you're seeing is they're very much on the defensive because they know that their sources of information aren't the only monotony.
[01:22:44.049 --> 01:22:46.390]  They don't have the dictatorship of the narrative anymore.
[01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:48.371]  We control the narrative just as much as them.
[01:22:48.371 --> 01:22:50.191]  We can put out news on our platforms.
[01:22:50.191 --> 01:22:58.435]  And every time somebody goes who's a New York Times leader or a reader or a CNN reader, every time they go on to social media, every time they tune in to InfoWars.com,
[01:22:58.795 --> 01:23:00.356]  That's someone that's converted.
[01:23:00.356 --> 01:23:02.657]  That's someone that's lost on their side.
[01:23:02.657 --> 01:23:14.501]  So where this is going is, instead of trying to say, hey, we should put the brakes on this and actually get back to journalistic integrity, researching stories, interviewing people, what they've decided to do is instead turn it into tribalism.
[01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:25.410]  And run PSYOPs against our side, PSYOPs on their side, to tell them these people are against you, these people are trying to lie to you, and foment that hatred and anger against them.
[01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:31.695]  It's definitely unchristian to say the least, and what they're doing is they're making things worse, they're creating more friction.
[01:23:31.695 --> 01:23:42.824]  That's what's leading to the Antifa fights we're seeing in the streets, because those people, they're on the leading edge of this sine curve, because they're seeing the violence that's pushed by this type of hatred, that's pushed by this type of demonization.
[01:23:43.324 --> 01:23:47.487]  The way they're demonizing you, the way they're demonizing me, the way they're demonizing President Trump.
[01:23:47.487 --> 01:23:50.529]  And it's very, very dangerous, I have to say.
[01:23:50.529 --> 01:23:52.231]  And it only makes us bigger.
[01:23:52.231 --> 01:23:56.674]  But the message of the average person is, oppose us, we will destroy you.
[01:23:56.674 --> 01:24:00.576]  So they're targeting the weak-minded, they're targeting folks on the fence.
[01:24:00.576 --> 01:24:05.640]  I saw Antifa demonstrations all over the country this weekend, but our own crew was down there for like six hours.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.962]  So I guess six hours times three is like...
[01:24:08.542 --> 01:24:09.922]  I can't watch it all.
[01:24:09.922 --> 01:24:11.703]  They are foaming at the mouth.
[01:24:11.703 --> 01:24:15.604]  They are horrible people compared to the folks protesting Sharia law.
[01:24:15.604 --> 01:24:17.644]  That's like protesting Nazism.
[01:24:17.644 --> 01:24:21.645]  Great-looking, white, black, Hispanic, Asian, protesting Sharia law.
[01:24:21.645 --> 01:24:30.648]  A bunch of goons in black with machine guns beating up people with clubs, not getting in trouble, screaming, yelling, cussing.
[01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:34.349]  And when they hit a family or a kid in the head, the cops would just come over and stop them.
[01:24:35.169 --> 01:24:42.132]  And they would scream, oh racist police, and I'm not kissing the police's butt, but the police are angels compared to this, and this is all Soros funded.
[01:24:42.132 --> 01:24:58.460]  I mean, I just cannot believe that they are such horrible, horrible, horrible people, you know, and what they do, and they can't ever debate, they can't talk, they just, they're totally tribal, they just scream F you, F America, up with Islam, and they're so-called liberals.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.801]  The feminists are there putting hijabs on.
[01:25:03.035 --> 01:25:07.418]  Yeah, Alex, and it's great that you mentioned, I caught earlier that you were talking about what's going on in Eastern Europe.
[01:25:07.418 --> 01:25:09.259]  I'm actually planning a trip there very soon.
[01:25:09.259 --> 01:25:22.928]  I want to hit Poland, I want to hit Romania, maybe even Belarus, to talk about how George Soros is pushing these through subversive movements like Antifa, as well as propaganda campaigns in the news media over there against them.
[01:25:22.928 --> 01:25:27.551]  He was able to get the Maidan revolution started in Ukraine that turned it into the war zone it is today.
[01:25:27.551 --> 01:25:30.253]  He wants to push that across Eastern Europe.
[01:25:30.253 --> 01:25:31.413]  He wants to push Poland in.
[01:25:31.413 --> 01:25:32.454]  It's all about migrants.
[01:25:32.754 --> 01:25:36.255]  It's all about tearing this apart and delegitimizing governments.
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:50.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:26:06.770]  When Antifa was created back in the 20s by Leon Trotsky, believe it or not, they were the arm of the Communist Party that was supposed to go into countries before communism to destabilize the government, delegitimize the government, so the communists could then come in and say, hey, we can deal with these guys for you, just come listen to us.
[01:26:08.991 --> 01:26:12.375]  Jack Posobiec, again, we've shown a little bit of the footage for TV viewers.
[01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:15.338]  Radio listeners can go to Infowars.com forward slash show to see it.
[01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:22.485]  But tomorrow, the compilation, because there's hours and hours, the most vicious, hateful people with clubs beating police.
[01:26:22.485 --> 01:26:23.486]  The police do nothing.
[01:26:24.567 --> 01:26:26.668]  They are just attacking families.
[01:26:26.668 --> 01:26:30.829]  They are screaming and yelling and spitting and throwing bags of piss on people.
[01:26:30.829 --> 01:26:38.510]  They are like wearing Muslim helmets with crescent moon flags, with communist flags.
[01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:40.751]  I mean, who could make this up?
[01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:43.431]  Why don't they go back to the collapsed Islamic countries?
[01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:44.652]  Why don't they go to North Korea?
[01:26:44.652 --> 01:26:45.852]  I mean, what is their problem?
[01:26:47.955 --> 01:26:54.277]  You know, what it is, Alex, is they can't stand to live in a country that has freedom like the United States.
[01:26:54.277 --> 01:26:56.937]  They can't debate their ideas, you know, peacefully.
[01:26:56.937 --> 01:26:59.678]  They don't have any thoughts, because it's all emotion with them.
[01:26:59.678 --> 01:27:00.978]  It's all drummed up hatred.
[01:27:00.978 --> 01:27:02.058]  It's all... They're just pissed.
[01:27:02.058 --> 01:27:02.739]  They're losers.
[01:27:02.739 --> 01:27:03.419]  They're just pissed.
[01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:04.559]  They're losers.
[01:27:04.559 --> 01:27:05.879]  Yeah, these are all losers in life.
[01:27:05.879 --> 01:27:13.281]  You don't see any... You don't see people that going from, like, you know, the nine-to-five job with a family of a couple of kids going out into the streets and doing this stuff.
[01:27:13.281 --> 01:27:16.162]  It's all life losers that go... that get pushed into these fringe movements.
[01:27:17.324 --> 01:27:18.305]  I mean, I gotta be honest with you.
[01:27:18.305 --> 01:27:20.567]  I didn't feel powerful seeing how weak our enemy was.
[01:27:20.567 --> 01:27:22.348]  I felt as a human, pathetic.
[01:27:22.348 --> 01:27:27.352]  I mean, these people are the most pathetic, worm-like creatures I've ever seen.
[01:27:27.352 --> 01:27:27.833]  Exactly.
[01:27:27.833 --> 01:27:42.004]  And you've got people on the other side, like George Soros, like Hillary Clinton, David Barack, Barack Obama, that are utilizing them, exploiting these kids to youth, to further their globalistic tendencies, to further their totalitarian dreams on the United States and across the world.
[01:27:42.865 --> 01:27:46.906]  A part of me wants to say, you know, people like that, I wish we could take care of them.
[01:27:46.906 --> 01:27:48.127]  I wish we could help them.
[01:27:48.127 --> 01:27:54.409]  But they're so far gone that you've just got to have, honestly, the police to come in and at least calm everything down.
[01:27:54.409 --> 01:27:54.789]  That's right.
[01:27:54.789 --> 01:27:57.910]  For folks who haven't seen these videos, I mean, they all look like they've had lobotomies.
[01:27:57.910 --> 01:28:00.310]  They're like Bozo the Clown mental patients.
[01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:01.851]  But I'm sorry, I can't go to these.
[01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:07.012]  Because if I see some dude that's 300 pounds hit a woman with a club, I'm going to stomp his guts out.
[01:28:07.012 --> 01:28:09.853]  I'm not Mr. Tough Guy, but I see that, I'm going to beat your ass.
[01:28:09.853 --> 01:28:11.394]  So I can't even go to these events.
[01:28:12.034 --> 01:28:13.635]  And then I see the police putting up with it.
[01:28:13.635 --> 01:28:14.716]  It is sickening!
[01:28:14.716 --> 01:28:18.819]  I saw Lauren Southern in a video being hit and piss thrown on her, and nothing's done.
[01:28:18.819 --> 01:28:21.380]  I mean, what is going on here?
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:28.965]  Yeah, believe it or not, when I was at Guantanamo Bay, when I was stationed down there, throwing urine on people, that's what the Al-Qaeda detainees used to do.
[01:28:28.965 --> 01:28:36.230]  They'd mix these little cups up with blood and urine, whatever they could find, and then when you came by and they didn't like it, they'd throw it at you.
[01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:37.431]  They used to call it splashing.
[01:28:37.431 --> 01:28:41.294]  So now we're seeing Antifa literally using Al-Qaeda tactics in the streets.
[01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:47.555]  Well, I'm not Mr. Tough Guy, because I mean, I've gone out and battled the communists, and it's all on tape, and I've battled the Mecha people.
[01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.877]  I mean, I just can't handle it.
[01:28:49.877 --> 01:28:52.559]  I mean, I see some guy beating a woman with a kid over the head with a club.
[01:28:52.559 --> 01:28:54.661]  I'm going to beat the living hell out of him.
[01:28:54.661 --> 01:28:57.003]  Lines you'd hear across, you know, man.
[01:28:57.003 --> 01:28:57.543]  Absolutely.
[01:28:57.543 --> 01:29:01.587]  Well, we're beating them intellectually, but it makes me sick.
[01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:05.951]  And I'm out for a police state, but the cops should have beat them to a pulp with their clubs.
[01:29:05.951 --> 01:29:06.631]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:06.631 --> 01:29:07.032]  Stay with us.
[01:29:08.894 --> 01:29:10.775]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:29:10.775 --> 01:29:12.795]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:29:12.795 --> 01:29:15.696]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:29:15.696 --> 01:29:21.757]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:30.960]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:35.821]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:38.485]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:46.516]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:29:46.516 --> 01:29:47.497]  The general public doesn't.
[01:29:48.699 --> 01:29:52.061]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:29:52.061 --> 01:29:56.204]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:29:56.204 --> 01:30:02.927]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:30:02.927 --> 01:30:07.010]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[01:30:11.557 --> 01:30:15.340]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:23.065]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:30:23.065 --> 01:30:31.671]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:30:31.671 --> 01:30:36.114]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:30:36.114 --> 01:30:41.357]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:30:41.697 --> 01:30:45.941]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:49.344]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:30:49.344 --> 01:31:00.493]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:31:00.493 --> 01:31:03.396]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:31:03.396 --> 01:31:09.361]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:31:09.981 --> 01:31:10.801]  Embrics Essentials.
[01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:11.902]  That's my middle name.
[01:31:11.902 --> 01:31:24.347]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[01:31:24.347 --> 01:31:30.110]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:33.491]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[01:31:33.491 --> 01:31:38.112]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[01:31:38.112 --> 01:31:45.234]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[01:31:45.234 --> 01:31:46.395]  It's all there.
[01:31:46.395 --> 01:31:47.075]  The Body Wash.
[01:31:47.375 --> 01:31:51.816]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[01:31:51.816 --> 01:32:02.560]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.161]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[01:32:05.161 --> 01:32:09.222]  InfoWarsLife.com where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[01:32:10.323 --> 01:32:11.764]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:11.764 --> 01:32:13.064]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:13.064 --> 01:32:14.285]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:14.285 --> 01:32:19.569]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:19.569 --> 01:32:33.119]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:33.119 --> 01:32:34.480]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.901]  Spreading disease around.
[01:32:36.901 --> 01:32:39.401]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:40.782]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:40.782 --> 01:32:41.882]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:41.882 --> 01:32:43.222]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:43.222 --> 01:32:47.724]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:47.724 --> 01:32:51.025]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:51.025 --> 01:32:54.066]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:54.066 --> 01:32:55.106]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:55.106 --> 01:32:55.926]  Living Defense.
[01:32:55.926 --> 01:32:57.027]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:57.027 --> 01:32:58.067]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:58.067 --> 01:33:00.088]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:33:01.628 --> 01:33:02.670]  You support the broadcast.
[01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:04.032]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:33:04.032 --> 01:33:06.275]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:33:06.275 --> 01:33:13.446]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[01:33:13.446 --> 01:33:16.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:24.861 --> 01:33:31.112]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:49.338 --> 01:33:52.660]  Folks, I just want prosperity and freedom.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:55.262]  I want an open, free society in the West.
[01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:57.343]  It's what's always done that.
[01:33:57.343 --> 01:34:03.447]  And I see folks trying to promote communism and radical Islam and orthodox Islam.
[01:34:03.447 --> 01:34:09.511]  And I see the Muslim population at 1.5 billion, about to go to 3 billion in the next 30 years or less.
[01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:11.152]  And I see the left allied with it.
[01:34:11.152 --> 01:34:16.156]  And I see Trump trying to bring jobs back and trying to bring prosperity back and all the lies about Trump.
[01:34:17.748 --> 01:34:19.550]  Mike Cernovich is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:20.831]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:34:20.831 --> 01:34:23.573]  I want to get some closing comments from him and invite him back on a regular basis.
[01:34:23.573 --> 01:34:24.353]  I'd like to invite him.
[01:34:24.353 --> 01:34:26.775]  I know he's a correspondent for a lot of great groups out there.
[01:34:26.775 --> 01:34:32.400]  CitizensforTrump.com, TheRebel.media does an amazing job, have their host on almost every day.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.784]  But I'd like to encourage you, if you want to do reports for us, or file anything when you're in Eastern Europe,
[01:34:37.731 --> 01:34:40.778]  I would love to have you on, Jack, so don't be shy.
[01:34:40.778 --> 01:34:44.346]  Folks can follow you on Twitter at jackpasobic.com.
[01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:47.472]  But just briefly, closing comments and tell us about your new book.
[01:34:48.902 --> 01:34:54.364]  Well, you know Alex, I'm actually down here in Monticello visiting Thomas Jefferson's homestead.
[01:34:54.364 --> 01:34:58.065]  And a lot of people don't know this, Thomas Jefferson was an early Info Warrior.
[01:34:58.065 --> 01:35:03.026]  He said that he has committed himself to any tyranny over the minds of men.
[01:35:03.026 --> 01:35:05.167]  And isn't that exactly what he was doing before?
[01:35:05.167 --> 01:35:08.748]  He said, I swore on the altar of God, resistance to any form of tyranny over the mind of men.
[01:35:08.748 --> 01:35:09.068]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:09.068 --> 01:35:11.409]  In fact, I thought that looked very Virginian where you're at.
[01:35:12.199 --> 01:35:13.079]  It is, it is.
[01:35:13.079 --> 01:35:16.360]  I'm actually right just sort of at the foothill of where Monticello is.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.061]  It's right behind me.
[01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:18.681]  So we were just visiting there today.
[01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:19.342]  It's beautiful.
[01:35:19.342 --> 01:35:21.022]  If people haven't been there, you've got to see it.
[01:35:21.022 --> 01:35:23.123]  This is God's country, truly.
[01:35:23.123 --> 01:35:23.763]  It is gorgeous.
[01:35:23.763 --> 01:35:25.684]  So just state of the union.
[01:35:25.684 --> 01:35:28.545]  They hate you almost as much as they hate me.
[01:35:28.545 --> 01:35:29.865]  That's a badge of honor.
[01:35:29.865 --> 01:35:31.526]  Why do they hate Jack Masovic so much?
[01:35:31.526 --> 01:35:32.186]  Tell us about your book.
[01:35:33.482 --> 01:35:38.267]  Yeah, I think they hate Jack Posobiec so much because I tell the truth and because I'm out there and I organize.
[01:35:38.267 --> 01:35:41.790]  So the book, I've actually got a copy right here, Citizens for Trump.
[01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:45.173]  And what it is, is so many people write books about Donald Trump.
[01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:46.494]  This isn't a book about Donald Trump.
[01:35:46.494 --> 01:35:52.800]  This is a book about the movement of people that coalesce together to support him, to take back our country.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.861]  It's an inside look.
[01:35:53.861 --> 01:35:55.323]  And Alex, you are in there, my friend.
[01:35:55.603 --> 01:35:58.766]  You were in there at the historic rally we held at the RNC.
[01:35:58.766 --> 01:36:02.009]  Your speech, Roger Stone's speech, Mike Cernovich came down.
[01:36:02.009 --> 01:36:05.172]  All of us are in there because it took so many parts.
[01:36:05.172 --> 01:36:07.074]  InfoWars was a huge part of that.
[01:36:07.074 --> 01:36:16.543]  And this also goes through, tells them behind-the-scenes stories, tells some of the organizing stories that I did, stuff like MAGA 3X, Stop the Steal, all the things that we did across the country.
[01:36:16.783 --> 01:36:24.986]  That's critical, Jack, as you know, because whether Trump's for real or not, which clearly he is, whether he wins or fails, he wins by taking action in the arena.
[01:36:24.986 --> 01:36:31.709]  We've built the multicultural pro-America coalition, that rally we had, with thousands of people at it.
[01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:33.609]  Half the crowd wasn't white!
[01:36:33.609 --> 01:36:41.092]  That freaks out CNN that it was black and Hispanic and white and Asian Americans wanting freedom, not wanting to live in North Korea.
[01:36:41.092 --> 01:36:42.253]  That is revolutionary.
[01:36:42.253 --> 01:36:43.053]  That's what scares them.
[01:36:44.213 --> 01:36:44.874]  Exactly.
[01:36:44.874 --> 01:36:47.576]  And the fact, we didn't charge a single cent for admission of that.
[01:36:47.576 --> 01:36:48.836]  It was open to the public.
[01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:50.237]  Everyone could come.
[01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:51.919]  We only asked that nobody had any violence.
[01:36:51.919 --> 01:36:57.222]  And people don't remember what it was like last summer, just about a year ago, via violence of Antifa.
[01:36:57.222 --> 01:37:01.946]  We were battling communists all over the city, but thank God they didn't show up at that, because they're such cowards.
[01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:03.147]  They always pick on little groups.
[01:37:04.121 --> 01:37:04.561]  We're good to go.
[01:37:23.957 --> 01:37:24.738]  Let's be clear.
[01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:25.238]  Let's be clear.
[01:37:48.444 --> 01:37:56.186]  Whether you love Trump or hate Trump, the point is he's bringing the change we need to a controlled paradigm that's stagnant and rotting.
[01:37:56.186 --> 01:38:08.888]  I think it's beautiful, but for folks out there that want to live in a paradigm of being controlled and absolutely being servile, that's what's brought us to this point and the corrupt elites we know are out of control hate Trump.
[01:38:08.888 --> 01:38:11.809]  Jack Posobiec, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:38:11.809 --> 01:38:12.869]  So great to be here, Alex.
[01:38:12.869 --> 01:38:13.689]  Happy to come back.
[01:38:13.689 --> 01:38:14.009]  Thank you.
[01:38:15.097 --> 01:38:19.601]  Oh, we're going to get Mike Cernovich on the line because, you know, I've got to get him on about all this news.
[01:38:19.601 --> 01:38:25.205]  Trump's come out and said fake news media doesn't cover great economic news.
[01:38:25.205 --> 01:38:30.829]  Economics is the most base, absolute confirmed form of reality.
[01:38:30.829 --> 01:38:32.330]  It's, do you have food?
[01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:33.071]  Do you have water?
[01:38:33.071 --> 01:38:34.072]  Do you have a job?
[01:38:34.072 --> 01:38:36.213]  Do you have the supplies you need?
[01:38:36.213 --> 01:38:42.058]  And free market delivers about a hundred times, on average or more, better than communism.
[01:38:43.792 --> 01:38:56.035]  And the only problem is it creates such wealth that it creates giant armies of decadent people who then bitch and complain because they're not, you know, Hollywood stars or whatever.
[01:38:56.035 --> 01:39:01.577]  But the truth is when it comes to resources and innovation, free market is the best thing the planet's ever seen.
[01:39:01.577 --> 01:39:05.157]  Look, that's like stating two plus two equals four.
[01:39:05.157 --> 01:39:06.278]  You know that.
[01:39:06.278 --> 01:39:08.318]  That's why you're listening to this broadcast.
[01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:11.119]  You're the brain trust of America, of every race, color, and creed.
[01:39:12.392 --> 01:39:13.072]  All humans.
[01:39:13.072 --> 01:39:13.913]  I don't believe in race.
[01:39:13.913 --> 01:39:15.093]  It's red blood.
[01:39:15.093 --> 01:39:16.654]  It's wanting freedom.
[01:39:16.654 --> 01:39:18.935]  We're coming together.
[01:39:18.935 --> 01:39:28.660]  And we know that the left defending Sharia law and cutting women's genitals off and putting hoods over their heads and throwing gays off buildings is not compatible with America.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.721]  That's Sharia law.
[01:39:29.721 --> 01:39:33.183]  So we go out and we protest it and all over the country they come out and attack us.
[01:39:34.178 --> 01:39:35.819]  Because they're bullies.
[01:39:35.819 --> 01:39:37.281]  Because they're scum.
[01:39:37.281 --> 01:39:38.502]  But you look at who's out there.
[01:39:38.502 --> 01:39:39.503]  It's not even really the Muslims.
[01:39:39.503 --> 01:39:41.464]  They were like 10% protesting.
[01:39:41.464 --> 01:39:49.952]  It is the most brain damaged looking, lobotomized looking, whacked out, stick your finger in the electric socket nut balls.
[01:39:49.952 --> 01:39:52.133]  And you gotta ask yourself, what is this?
[01:39:52.133 --> 01:39:55.456]  Well, this is the scum of the earth that are all on welfare.
[01:39:56.474 --> 01:40:01.359]  Who want to get an extra George Soros check for $500 to go out and beat somebody up.
[01:40:01.359 --> 01:40:10.228]  These are the wannabe tough guys that want to go out and look at people that actually live their lives and work.
[01:40:10.228 --> 01:40:12.571]  And then demonize them.
[01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:15.093]  Mike Cernovich joins us at the end of this segment and for the next.
[01:40:15.905 --> 01:40:21.468]  And we've also got a clip coming up dealing with the fact that House of Cards is now giving importers a hat tip.
[01:40:21.468 --> 01:40:34.776]  Mike Cernovich, what do you make of the current state, the Comey hearing we saw Thursday, and the article about you, myself, and Posobiec saying that nobody in any hearing ever said that Trump didn't say, hey, don't stop the investigation.
[01:40:34.776 --> 01:40:40.639]  I mean, Comey admits that Trump never said stop it, but the news is saying we're liars for publishing the video.
[01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:49.928]  Yeah, a lot of people do want to know where are those Comey memos and why is that Columbia University professor in hiding?
[01:40:49.928 --> 01:40:50.828]  Where is he?
[01:40:50.828 --> 01:40:51.669]  Where are the memos?
[01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:58.875]  I've heard from people who are saying that they're having difficulty locating these alleged memos that Comey had.
[01:40:58.875 --> 01:41:05.221]  Now, Comey, as you know, claimed that right after his meetings with Trump, he would go outside and type up a memo on an FBI laptop.
[01:41:05.721 --> 01:41:08.602]  And he should have handed that in, and they should have that.
[01:41:08.602 --> 01:41:11.483]  So I'm hearing... That's obstruction on record, exactly.
[01:41:11.483 --> 01:41:12.744]  The word is it's all fake memos.
[01:41:12.744 --> 01:41:13.764]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:41:13.764 --> 01:41:14.825]  Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
[01:41:14.825 --> 01:41:15.645]  That's what people are saying.
[01:41:15.645 --> 01:41:16.525]  Where are the memos?
[01:41:16.525 --> 01:41:20.647]  So if he has these alleged memos, people would love to see them.
[01:41:20.647 --> 01:41:29.251]  And people want to know why he doesn't have memos of Loretta Lynch and these other meetings that he had with people where they were actually telling him to obstruct justice.
[01:41:29.251 --> 01:41:31.351]  So there's a lot going on there.
[01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:32.572]  What I noticed today, though, is
[01:41:33.152 --> 01:41:38.473]  The media narrative has, they're literally saying, do not think about Comey anymore.
[01:41:38.473 --> 01:41:43.234]  There have been multiple articles today saying, forget about Comey, we need to talk about Russia again.
[01:41:43.234 --> 01:41:45.835]  That's how much of a debacle that hearing was.
[01:41:45.835 --> 01:41:47.715]  And we said that on Thursday and Friday.
[01:41:47.715 --> 01:41:50.536]  Clearly, if you watched it, it was a train wreck, epic disaster.
[01:41:50.536 --> 01:41:53.077]  But media for a day tried to say, oh, big victory.
[01:41:53.077 --> 01:41:54.657]  Oh, you're spinning different points.
[01:41:54.657 --> 01:42:01.039]  But as you said, by Friday and Saturday, they want to move off of that because it was a spectacular defeat.
[01:42:01.039 --> 01:42:02.319]  Give us a breakdown of that defeat.
[01:42:03.393 --> 01:42:07.857]  Yeah, so everybody thought, and they were so hyped, that the bars in D.C.
[01:42:07.857 --> 01:42:13.201]  were actually opening and serving alcohol at 10.30 in the morning, and people were ready.
[01:42:13.201 --> 01:42:24.590]  They thought this was a Super Bowl for the left, and that Comey was going to say that Trump was under investigation, that Trump obstructed justice, that Trump told Comey that he couldn't investigate certain people.
[01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:29.874]  This was supposed to be Trump's Waterloo, so instead the media wants to pretend that everything they thought was not true.
[01:42:31.138 --> 01:42:32.079]  Exactly.
[01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:47.150]  So, not only did they not get any victory, but we found out that, one, Trump was never under investigation personally, and interesting how that was never leaked to the media, even though you and I had said from the beginning, because we're Real News, that he was never- We knew it!
[01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:47.971]  You said it was coming!
[01:42:49.435 --> 01:42:49.995]  Exactly.
[01:42:49.995 --> 01:42:51.656]  We've always known.
[01:42:51.656 --> 01:42:53.537]  I can't believe how right we are, actually, Cernovich.
[01:42:53.537 --> 01:42:54.638]  I can't believe how right you are.
[01:42:54.638 --> 01:42:57.419]  It's amazing to be associated with such people like you.
[01:42:57.419 --> 01:43:02.182]  That's the best part of this fight, is I get to know the great people like Cernovich and Paul Watson and Poselvic.
[01:43:02.182 --> 01:43:04.403]  I mean, and the crew out here and you.
[01:43:04.403 --> 01:43:05.804]  I mean, this is awesome.
[01:43:05.804 --> 01:43:07.205]  We're the people that aren't idiots.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:14.261]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:43:14.261 --> 01:43:17.102]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:43:17.102 --> 01:43:19.103]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:43:19.103 --> 01:43:24.104]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:43:24.104 --> 01:43:26.204]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:43:26.204 --> 01:43:27.505]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:43:27.505 --> 01:43:32.606]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:35.967]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:43:37.568 --> 01:43:46.172]  Superblue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:43:46.172 --> 01:43:53.075]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:43:53.075 --> 01:44:00.599]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[01:44:00.599 --> 01:44:03.560]  Learn more about InfoWars Life's Superblue toothpaste.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:18.782]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:44:18.962 --> 01:44:26.066]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:44:26.066 --> 01:44:30.948]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:44:30.948 --> 01:44:34.610]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:44:35.811 --> 01:44:36.612]  We're good to go.
[01:44:59.807 --> 01:45:06.111]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:45:06.111 --> 01:45:07.772]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:45:09.855 --> 01:45:17.817]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:45:17.817 --> 01:45:24.479]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:45:24.479 --> 01:45:32.761]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:42.051]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:45:42.051 --> 01:45:47.798]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:45:48.138 --> 01:45:48.898]  It works.
[01:45:48.898 --> 01:45:57.221]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:45:57.221 --> 01:46:07.104]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.

[01:46:31.966 --> 01:46:39.809]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[01:46:39.809 --> 01:46:50.013]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:46:50.013 --> 01:46:52.074]  And this part is most important.
[01:46:52.074 --> 01:46:58.517]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:46:58.877 --> 01:47:00.299]  That means it's clean.
[01:47:00.299 --> 01:47:01.440]  That means it's pure.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.324]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowars.
[01:47:04.324 --> 01:47:07.127]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:47:31.894 --> 01:47:37.550]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:39.836]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:42.012 --> 01:47:45.134]  All right, final segment.
[01:47:45.134 --> 01:47:46.654]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:47:46.654 --> 01:47:47.215]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:47.215 --> 01:47:47.575]  Central.
[01:47:47.575 --> 01:47:49.275]  Mike Cernovich is our guest.
[01:47:49.275 --> 01:47:51.796]  Before we go any further, we are Lister-supported.
[01:47:51.796 --> 01:47:53.597]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:47:53.597 --> 01:48:06.183]  We bring you the best supplements, the best fluoride-free toothpaste, Super Blue with colloidal silver and iodine, the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the great pro-gun t-shirts and Infowar shirts to meet like-minded people and promote freedom.
[01:48:06.183 --> 01:48:07.123]  If you believe in what we're doing,
[01:48:08.154 --> 01:48:11.456]  We, your hopes, your prayers, and your financial support.
[01:48:11.456 --> 01:48:16.118]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:48:16.118 --> 01:48:25.764]  We also got one of the top organic makers of personal care products like shampoo, body wash, mouthwash, sunscreen, it's all natural and healthy, and bug spray that's all natural and healthy.
[01:48:26.304 --> 01:48:31.487]  All right, Mike Cernovich, let me give you the floor here for a few minutes and I've got one more item I want to hit.
[01:48:57.119 --> 01:49:02.188]  Other points you want to make, and what is the state of the union for the awakening right now?
[01:49:02.188 --> 01:49:03.190]  I see Trump winning.
[01:49:04.642 --> 01:49:07.043]  Well, the State of the Union is amazing.
[01:49:07.043 --> 01:49:15.607]  It's the greatest time in the world, in my whole time to be alive, because never have more people been paying attention to the world.
[01:49:15.607 --> 01:49:16.908]  Think about this.
[01:49:16.908 --> 01:49:20.510]  The statistic, I think, I retweeted the article on Twitter.
[01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:24.592]  More people were watching James Comey hearings in the NFL, right?
[01:49:24.592 --> 01:49:26.232]  Think about that.
[01:49:26.232 --> 01:49:29.194]  We haven't had more people actually paying attention
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:34.982]  Since maybe the first Gulf War when we had the first time the airstrikes were published.
[01:49:34.982 --> 01:49:38.384]  So now politics are interesting because people know there's a real fight.
[01:49:38.384 --> 01:49:39.124]  It's not all staged.
[01:49:39.124 --> 01:49:46.227]  I was even watching a CNN focus group and everybody on it said it made Trump look better at the Comey interview and CNN looked so pissed.
[01:49:47.546 --> 01:50:01.255]  Well, and that was also in that New York Times article where it was completely fake news and they defamed a good friend of mine, you know, Jack Posobiec, and claimed that he made up something which was a complete fabrication, but they always talk about how many views we're getting now.
[01:50:01.255 --> 01:50:09.161]  They're mad now that Jack Posobiec can do a video of a citizen journalist, a new up-and-coming star like Jack, can do a Periscope.
[01:50:09.161 --> 01:50:16.446]  More people are tuning into Posobiec, Cernovich, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Stefan Molyneux,
[01:50:17.026 --> 01:50:18.627]  Lauren Southern, I mean, you name it.
[01:50:18.627 --> 01:50:20.709]  There's like a talent explosion right now.
[01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:23.851]  So every day, there's a new guy, he posts a new Trump.
[01:50:23.851 --> 01:50:27.013]  He's the one who actually found those Reza Aslan tweets.
[01:50:27.013 --> 01:50:30.336]  And really, we put the pressure on him and been going, so he's like Rookie of the Year.
[01:50:30.336 --> 01:50:35.580]  So when I look around, I've never in my life seen more patriots paying attention.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.962]  And I've never seen a deeper talent pool, which is why you want to
[01:50:39.022 --> 01:50:39.943]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:50:39.943 --> 01:50:42.646]  And also, a lot of people, the big old money conservative people,
[01:50:56.696 --> 01:51:12.263]  Have reached out to me and as you know I've never taken outside money I don't believe in anything but they said they go you know I'm tired of this Cernovich and I go what's wrong and they go why is it that my people that I pay tens of millions of dollars in these super packs why can't they get people to show up to a rally?
[01:51:12.263 --> 01:51:14.584]  Why can't they get people to show up to a flash mob?
[01:51:14.584 --> 01:51:17.385]  Why can't they do what you guys are just doing every day?
[01:51:17.925 --> 01:51:22.368]  I go, well, you know, I think you're getting ripped off, but if you think you're going to control me with money, I don't even want it.
[01:51:22.368 --> 01:51:28.071]  You know, I've turned down more money than most people because I don't want them to try to control me with the globalist public.
[01:51:28.071 --> 01:51:28.872]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:51:28.872 --> 01:51:34.115]  I've been, I've been offered, you know, $500 million, but I more and more realize it's not even a payoff.
[01:51:34.115 --> 01:51:35.616]  They actually want to win.
[01:51:35.616 --> 01:51:36.576]  And so who knows?
[01:51:36.576 --> 01:51:40.439]  We may make some big announcements very, very soon, but there's a lot of big stuff going on.
[01:51:41.092 --> 01:51:42.613]  Well, and that's exactly right.
[01:51:42.613 --> 01:51:45.934]  Trump has made it safe for people in the system.
[01:51:45.934 --> 01:51:47.515]  This isn't a sellout, folks.
[01:51:47.515 --> 01:51:53.417]  If we take over and restore the country, you're going to see power brokers that didn't like what was happening joining us.
[01:51:53.417 --> 01:51:54.618]  That's not a sellout.
[01:51:54.618 --> 01:51:55.718]  That's victory.
[01:51:55.718 --> 01:51:57.279]  Get ready to take over.
[01:51:57.279 --> 01:51:59.060]  Get ready to restore the republic.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:51:59.800]  Get ready to win.
[01:52:00.891 --> 01:52:09.314]  Yeah, and that's exactly right because I told them, I go, look, if you think that I'm going to be another neocon and you're just going to buy me off and I'm going to show for wars in the Middle East, you don't understand.
[01:52:09.314 --> 01:52:11.155]  They go, no, no, they go, you don't get it.
[01:52:11.155 --> 01:52:18.878]  They go, we're tired of giving our money to losers who all they can do is maybe run some stupid ad or existential.
[01:52:18.878 --> 01:52:20.559]  They know there's a war on free market.
[01:52:20.559 --> 01:52:21.819]  That's the best system.
[01:52:21.819 --> 01:52:24.040]  They realize it's a threat to even the power structure.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:31.068]  And we have to defeat this cancer of Sharia law and the left and Soros and everybody's sick of him!
[01:52:32.508 --> 01:52:35.409]  And they're also seeing the terrorism happening in Europe.
[01:52:35.409 --> 01:52:43.112]  And they're telling me now that we thought that we could just be rich and import slave labor, but we realize now that we'll have terrorism in America.
[01:52:43.112 --> 01:52:46.234]  And right now there was a Molotov cocktail in Paris.
[01:52:46.234 --> 01:52:47.414]  It's like Peter Thiel said.
[01:52:47.414 --> 01:52:49.535]  The tide is going out on globalism.
[01:52:49.535 --> 01:52:50.715]  It's cancer.
[01:52:50.715 --> 01:52:52.156]  He was against it 20 years ago.
[01:52:52.156 --> 01:52:55.657]  Other globalists are against it now because they realize it's bad.
[01:52:55.657 --> 01:52:57.838]  We just need to go with human freedom.
[01:52:57.838 --> 01:52:59.439]  Go with free markets.
[01:52:59.439 --> 01:52:59.879]  Stop it.
[01:53:00.836 --> 01:53:02.556]  Yeah, and nobody's being safe.
[01:53:02.556 --> 01:53:14.419]  And then they're also very sick by the next generation like Alex Soros is posting, you know, spirit cooking pictures and he's revealing all the occult stuff that they do that you're not supposed to talk about.
[01:53:14.419 --> 01:53:23.542]  So now when we say that Alex Soros is a spirit cooker, well, we can show pictures where there's a woman laying down on a board like, you know, like a corpse effigy kind of thing.
[01:53:23.542 --> 01:53:25.342]  And they're performing their pictures.
[01:53:25.342 --> 01:53:26.983]  They post that to the social media.
[01:53:26.983 --> 01:53:28.383]  People go, why do you call Soros?
[01:53:28.983 --> 01:53:34.265]  A Luciferian, and I go, well because I can show you pictures of Alex Soros at a spirit cooking party.
[01:53:34.265 --> 01:53:37.826]  What more evidence do you need?
[01:53:37.826 --> 01:53:39.987]  No, you're right, and they can't help it.
[01:53:39.987 --> 01:53:40.867]  It's lesser magic.
[01:53:40.867 --> 01:53:43.268]  They've got to throw it in our face.
[01:53:43.268 --> 01:53:52.271]  The sickening photo that I saw James Woods put out of Alex Soros meeting with Schumer.
[01:53:52.271 --> 01:53:53.811]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:53:53.811 --> 01:53:56.152]  We're ruled by turds like this?
[01:53:57.352 --> 01:53:58.653]  Well, and it's changing, too.
[01:53:58.653 --> 01:54:13.681]  I mean, the CNN ISIS contest, I didn't expect somebody, you were right, like when we talked about it, I thought a few people would do it, but right when I told you that night, you wanted a draft that night to get it out there, because there are so many entries now, I can't even keep track of them.
[01:54:13.681 --> 01:54:21.124]  We've got 200, and I've got like a limited crew, so trust me, people are going to get on, awards are going to happen, it's like trying to eat an elephant.
[01:54:21.124 --> 01:54:21.465]  Exactly.
[01:54:21.465 --> 01:54:23.005]  You know, it's funny you mentioned devil worship.
[01:54:23.005 --> 01:54:23.666]  You didn't even know this.
[01:54:24.266 --> 01:54:25.867]  You didn't even know this.
[01:54:25.867 --> 01:54:29.250]  That's what's amazing about our guest right now.
[01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:40.057]  I wanted to play a clip from the new kickoff of the new season of House of Cards that shows Bohemian Grove that 17 years ago infiltrated where they do mock human sacrifice.
[01:54:40.057 --> 01:54:43.600]  And you bring it up without me even telling you it was coming up.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.484]  Let's play the first minute or two of the new House of Cards season kickoff.
[01:54:48.484 --> 01:54:48.844]  Here it is.
[01:54:52.557 --> 01:54:54.039]  Shows the big owl.
[01:54:54.039 --> 01:54:55.662]  They say it's a crow.
[01:54:55.662 --> 01:54:57.485]  They do the mock human sacrifice.
[01:54:57.485 --> 01:55:01.030]  Put all their cares, their bad karma onto something else.
[01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.232]  It's black magic.
[01:55:02.232 --> 01:55:05.237]  How do you do evil and get away with it not coming back on you?
[01:55:05.237 --> 01:55:05.838]  That's what this is.
[01:55:05.838 --> 01:55:06.118]  Here it is.
[01:55:17.324 --> 01:55:28.492]  So, if you're ready Alistair, men in torches, red robes, come before a giant owl or crow, to burn the effigy of a child, to put their fallacy and evil onto the child.
[01:55:28.492 --> 01:55:30.493]  We honor thee!
[01:55:30.493 --> 01:55:31.854]  We honor thee!
[01:55:31.854 --> 01:55:33.275]  We honor thee!
[01:55:33.275 --> 01:55:34.116]  We honor thee!
[01:55:35.322 --> 01:55:38.885]  No mortal flame can destroy common woe.
[01:55:38.885 --> 01:55:41.507]  Just one fire can conquer.
[01:55:41.507 --> 01:55:44.910]  Fire that burns in the fields of Elysium.
[01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:46.811]  Hail, brothers!
[01:55:46.811 --> 01:55:48.052]  Many brothers!
[01:55:48.052 --> 01:55:49.513]  They've never seen the fields of Elysium.
[01:55:49.513 --> 01:55:52.615]  Brothers many, make brothers one.
[01:55:52.615 --> 01:55:54.097]  Hail Fellowship!
[01:55:54.097 --> 01:55:57.179]  Hail Qrow and his verdant kingdom!
[01:55:57.179 --> 01:55:59.521]  Common woe be done!
[01:56:13.337 --> 01:56:15.219]  Underwood says, oh, presidents can't go.
[01:56:15.219 --> 01:56:16.180]  Presidents go to this.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:20.424]  They're not blaming everybody that goes.
[01:56:20.424 --> 01:56:22.926]  It's just an inference way to this.
[01:56:22.926 --> 01:56:25.188]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.188 --> 01:56:25.629]  Look around.
[01:56:26.716 --> 01:56:30.857]  Some of the most powerful men in the world are gathered in this clearing.
[01:56:30.857 --> 01:56:34.838]  Members of one of our country's most exclusive clubs.
[01:56:34.838 --> 01:56:38.239]  Invitation only, unless of course you invite yourself.
[01:56:38.239 --> 01:56:43.440]  They gather here to seek God between the branches of these magnificent trees.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:49.201]  They eat together, they piss next to each other, and they carve up the world like a Sunday roast.
[01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:51.701]  This is where the real power is.
[01:56:51.701 --> 01:56:53.662]  No women or presidents allowed.
[01:56:54.382 --> 01:56:57.704]  The former I am not, the latter I will be again.
[01:56:57.704 --> 01:57:03.446]  Because I have managed to reduce a national election down to one state.
[01:57:03.446 --> 01:57:11.450]  And while these men here can't swing the votes of an entire nation, one measly state?
[01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:12.650]  Well, that they can.
[01:57:12.650 --> 01:57:17.953]  Alright, Mr. Cernovich, I just wanted to show that because they claimed it was fake when I first videotaped it, now they admit it.
[01:57:17.953 --> 01:57:20.214]  This just shows how it's all coming out.
[01:57:20.214 --> 01:57:20.854]  Final comments.
[01:57:21.912 --> 01:57:24.733]  Yeah, again, the awakening is happening.
[01:57:24.733 --> 01:57:27.455]  We are living in like a time of the revival.
[01:57:27.455 --> 01:57:30.096]  We've never had more people paying more attention.
[01:57:30.096 --> 01:57:35.698]  It really goes to show the New York Times, they try to knock us down every time and it doesn't really work.
[01:57:35.698 --> 01:57:39.760]  More money is coming in to these Soros website, these Soros companies.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:48.644]  But the Patriots, as long as they want themselves to be silenced and share the good news of the truth with their friends, family, neighbors, with the internet and everything.
[01:57:48.644 --> 01:57:49.845]  But we're growing.
[01:57:50.836 --> 01:57:56.663]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, and Alex Soros can worship the devil all day.
[01:57:56.663 --> 01:57:57.644]  He's not the real God.
[01:57:57.644 --> 01:57:58.765]  He will be broken.
[01:57:58.765 --> 01:57:59.326]  Thank you, Mike Sherman.
[01:57:59.326 --> 01:58:09.297]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:58:09.437 --> 01:58:11.500]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:14.365]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:58:14.365 --> 01:58:15.867]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:15.867 --> 01:58:22.698]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:22.698 --> 01:58:23.960]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:58:24.761 --> 01:58:34.468]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:34.468 --> 01:58:51.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:54.442]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:54.582 --> 01:58:59.724]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:59.724 --> 01:59:01.645]  Embrics Essentials, that's my middle name.
[01:59:01.645 --> 01:59:14.090]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[01:59:14.090 --> 01:59:19.132]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.
[01:59:19.332 --> 01:59:19.773]  We're good to go.
[01:59:40.234 --> 01:59:41.576]  It's truly game-changing.
[01:59:41.576 --> 01:59:49.524]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores.
[01:59:49.524 --> 01:59:52.327]  Buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:52.327 --> 01:59:54.930]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[01:59:54.930 --> 01:59:58.995]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
