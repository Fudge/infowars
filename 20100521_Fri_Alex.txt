[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:28.440]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is May 21st Friday 2010 I am Jason
[00:28.440 --> 00:35.160]  Burma's sitting in for Alex Jones let's get to the headlines the two biggest
[00:35.160 --> 00:40.840]  stories today in my opinion are the media attacks on Rand Paul now he's
[00:40.840 --> 00:44.680]  against civil liberties folks he wants to repeal the Civil Liberties Act if
[00:44.680 --> 00:49.400]  you're listening to the mainstream media and of course President Calderon
[00:49.400 --> 00:55.720]  getting a standing oh a standing ovation in front of our Congress after he
[00:55.720 --> 01:01.880]  sits on the White House lawn with our betrayer our supposed President Barry
[01:01.880 --> 01:08.040]  Sotero better known to the American public as Barack H Obama as they go
[01:08.040 --> 01:13.120]  against the wishes of people from Arizona who are just trying to get their
[01:13.120 --> 01:20.080]  federal laws enforced and now everything is going to be about race everything is
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.520]  going to be about race Calderon is just coming out now and saying we are part of
[01:25.520 --> 01:30.840]  North America and Obama is basically agreeing promoting the same idea if you
[01:30.840 --> 01:36.680]  didn't see this coming obviously you didn't see him in Germany in July before
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.680]  he was president talking about global citizenship see this isn't just about a
[01:41.680 --> 01:46.720]  North American Union it's about building a one-world government let's read this
[01:46.720 --> 01:50.680]  from the Huffington Post Mexican president Felipe Calderon spoke before a
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.040]  joint session of Congress Thursday and received resounding applause after
[01:55.040 --> 01:59.280]  condemning Arizona's controversial immigration law and this isn't new to
[01:59.280 --> 02:03.000]  the United States anymore we had Gordon Brown get up in front of our Congress
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.720]  and say you know what we need a global new deal as he was promoting a new world
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.080]  order getting ready for the G20 where they announced their new world order
[02:13.080 --> 02:19.520]  their consolidation of power their IMF World Bank Federal Reserve power grab I
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.520]  am convinced that a comprehensive immigration reform is also crucial to
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.160]  securing our common border however I strongly disagree with the recently
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.600]  adopted law in Arizona it's like we love you Calderon we love Mexico so much
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.760]  folks do you realize what Mexico is gearing up to do they are gearing up to
[02:40.760 --> 02:45.960]  have their general populace give up all of their information and their
[02:45.960 --> 02:50.280]  fingerprints to have what a cell phone not even a license to drive if you
[02:50.280 --> 02:53.440]  don't have your cell phone or if you don't have these things done they're
[02:53.440 --> 02:59.520]  about to shut off 30 million cell phones in Mexico I have that headline here
[02:59.520 --> 03:03.760]  that's being ignored so maybe we should become a part of Mexico where everybody
[03:03.760 --> 03:07.640]  has to be tracked traced and database to have a cell phone openly with your
[03:07.640 --> 03:12.600]  biometric thumb scan that's why we should go with them that's a good idea
[03:12.600 --> 03:17.680]  people need to wake up they need they need to get beyond race and later on
[03:17.680 --> 03:21.720]  we're going to play this video of Wolf Blitzer trying to put Rand Paul into a
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.200]  corner and basically call him a racist but Rand Paul handles himself
[03:25.200 --> 03:29.040]  excellently and says look there were parts of the Civil Rights Act that I
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.520]  don't necessarily agree with and look when I'm talking about the Disabilities
[03:33.520 --> 03:38.720]  Act I'm saying hey if you're a small business you have a two-story building
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.120]  and somebody happens to work with you has a wheelchair maybe you offer them an
[03:43.120 --> 03:47.320]  office on the first floor instead of installing a hundred thousand dollar
[03:47.320 --> 03:51.440]  elevator system just for that one person because you may very well put that
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.680]  small business out on the streets and no longer to give capital to other
[03:56.680 --> 04:01.280]  citizens of the United States very well-spoken lays it directly out but
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.200]  that doesn't stop the LA Times the New York Times the Washington Post CNN all
[04:06.200 --> 04:10.280]  these people trying to make him out to be a racist because he is a threat to the
[04:10.280 --> 04:15.560]  establishment he is going to go up against these globalists and that's what
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.400]  this is about it's about globalization it's about the establishment having
[04:19.400 --> 04:24.200]  these people in their pockets and that's why you're not seeing Arlen Specter out
[04:24.200 --> 04:28.320]  there anymore so when we come back we're gonna have Alex Jones talk about this
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.000]  situation with Calderon again standing ovations for the president of Mexico who
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.080]  are who's condemning condemning Arizona citizens for basically standing up and
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.840]  saying look we've had enough our economies and shambles we're taking back
[04:43.840 --> 04:47.120]  our state and hopefully this country will be back after this it's the Alex

[08:29.960 --> 08:33.160]  of congress that's what foreign leaders do now they come to this country and get

[08:39.040 --> 08:43.520]  people that's the reality of the situation you have barack obama up there
[08:43.520 --> 08:48.400]  talking about this arizona lawn he says well I think it has the potential to be
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.760]  racially motivated and then his wife if you haven't seen it yet she's sitting
[08:52.760 --> 08:56.200]  there with all these young students in this poor little girl says my mommy
[08:56.200 --> 09:00.680]  doesn't have papers is she gonna be taken away no we need to fix that we need

[09:06.400 --> 09:11.080]  who's in this country while they leave the borders wide open why because they
[09:11.080 --> 09:16.280]  are demanding a north american union so let's get to this video right now over
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.880]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv
[09:25.440 --> 09:29.480]  everybody needs to get angry and let these people know that we are not their
[09:29.480 --> 09:38.440]  slaves you hear that colorone but believe me many of these guns are not
[09:38.440 --> 09:46.480]  going to honest american hands instead thousands are ending up in the hands of
[09:46.480 --> 09:52.920]  criminals with all due respect you do not regulate the sale of these weapons in
[09:52.920 --> 10:00.200]  the right way nothing guarantees that criminals here in the united states with
[10:00.200 --> 10:06.880]  access to the same power of weapons will not decided to challenge american
[10:06.880 --> 10:15.200]  authorities and civilians or i will ask congress to help us with respect and to
[10:15.200 --> 10:21.880]  understand how important it is for us that you enforce current laws to stem
[10:21.880 --> 10:27.760]  the supply of these weapons to criminals and consider restating the assault
[10:27.760 --> 10:34.640]  weapons bank just when i think i can't get any more outrage something new
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.600]  happens that makes my temperature rise my blood boil philippe calderone who
[10:39.600 --> 10:43.840]  clearly stole the election to become mexican president who's connected to
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.080]  all sorts of corrupt organizations down in mexico is in the united states
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.040]  traveling around lecturing us about states rights and telling us that police
[10:54.040 --> 10:58.360]  when they have first contact with the legal alien for say drunk driving or
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.560]  some other suspected crime can ask for their id okay while the american people
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.480]  having our rights trampled on a daily basis and john mccain and Lieberman are
[11:07.480 --> 11:11.400]  trying to pass legislation where u.s. citizens can be secretly arrested by
[11:11.400 --> 11:15.840]  the pentagon or justice department and have our rights stripped and literally
[11:15.840 --> 11:19.360]  disappear into a black hole because the government says they think you're a
[11:19.360 --> 11:23.400]  terrorist you no longer have a bill of rights okay but all the government
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.160]  starts crying about civil rights and lying about what's in the legislation
[11:28.160 --> 11:32.560]  and jenna depolitano admits she has even read the bill when she's on the news you
[11:32.560 --> 11:38.640]  had a chance to review the new law that was passed by the state of arizona i've
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.880]  not reviewed it in detail i certainly know of it senator let me just say
[11:44.880 --> 11:50.000]  this as you know and are well aware that's not the kind of law i would have
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.480]  signed because if you've read the bill you know this is all a giant hoax it
[11:54.480 --> 11:58.040]  isn't violating anybody's right and mexico has some of the most draconian
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.400]  laws against people that come into their country out of guatemala from
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.920]  central and south america so the most draconian in the world but that's not
[12:05.920 --> 12:09.200]  why i'm outraged okay that's bad enough to have a foreign president who's a
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.920]  legitimate who runs a failed collapsed state with 20 plus thousand deaths the
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.160]  last two years and crime pouring across our borders ranchers being murdered
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.360]  that's not what's got me mad can you imagine if an american president say
[12:23.360 --> 12:29.520]  went to germany or china and told them what to do can you imagine if the
[12:29.520 --> 12:33.360]  british prime minister came here and said you need to pass
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.200]  anti-second amendment legislation you need to ban assault weapons all
[12:37.200 --> 12:40.960]  semi-automatic rifles and handguns that's what he did
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.440]  that's what he said today to the congress in fact here's the Reuters
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.120]  headline calderon urges us to reinstate assault weapons ban
[12:49.120 --> 12:54.480]  and blames us for what's happening in mexico you do not regulate the sale of
[12:54.480 --> 12:59.120]  these weapons in the right way mexico has a total gun ban for their
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.440]  citizens so all these different gangs some government backed others that aren't
[13:03.440 --> 13:06.880]  can have these big wars with each other and they have kidnappings and people
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.320]  being shaken down every time villagers try to stand up against
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.600]  tyranny they get machine gun i mean mexico is a nightmare police state
[13:15.600 --> 13:18.960]  that is a black hole of corruption that is now sucking
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.520]  the united states into it and philippe calderon this gangster
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.000]  comes to the united states and in fact says i want the american people's guns
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.680]  i want you to be peon slaves like the people of mexico
[13:31.680 --> 13:36.080]  are i want to be your el jefe i'm gonna run your life and obama
[13:36.080 --> 13:40.960]  went further on the white house lawn he said that uh our nations are not uh
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.000]  defined by their borders and that we're all one people
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.200]  in the 21st century we are defined not by our borders
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.440]  but by our bonds so i say to you and to the mexican people
[13:51.440 --> 13:55.280]  let us stand together this is all about the north american union
[13:55.280 --> 13:58.880]  this is all about global government and they're all right folks we're going to
[13:58.880 --> 14:02.400]  cut it right there if you want to see the full video that's about half of it
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.320]  you can go to info wars dot com right now let me let me read you the article
[14:06.320 --> 14:10.560]  mexican president wants to disarm american see it's okay
[14:10.560 --> 14:15.760]  when calderon and his gang of thugs have assault weapons when they run the
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.880]  military they're allowed to have those things
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.120]  we're not we can't defend ourselves and it is absolutely
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.880]  ludicrous to say that criminal elements in mexico
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.000]  and the united states on the borders are getting out of control because there's
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.800]  no assault weapons ban no the violence in most cases is
[14:34.800 --> 14:38.480]  caused by who well black ops and special forces
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.720]  running the drugs in most cases and you know what happens in mexico
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.480]  folks the drug dealers there are the million the multimillionaires and the
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.320]  billionaires and again that's why they want to create this
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.560]  corporate entity of a north american union merging
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.480]  canada the united states and mexico that's why we go
[14:58.480 --> 15:01.840]  over the securities and prosperity documents
[15:01.840 --> 15:05.760]  the spp documents in invisible empire a new world order to find
[15:05.760 --> 15:10.640]  and they want your guns folks let's be real about it let's admit to ourselves
[15:10.640 --> 15:16.480]  this isn't to protect anybody except for the elitists and their agendas
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.480]  mexican president felipe calderon called upon the united states congress to reenact
[15:20.480 --> 15:24.720]  the assault weapons ban in a bid to disarm the american people as they are
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.920]  integrated into the north american union system further
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.360]  he placed blame for fueling drug cartels and gang violence
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.960]  squarely on the united states and their supply of the firearms oh yes it's our
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.480]  fault because we're not regulating the slaves firearms
[15:40.480 --> 15:44.800]  calderon made these outrageous and anti-american remarks from the floor of
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.680]  the u.s congress we just give these people
[15:47.680 --> 15:53.840]  the largest venue possible and then we parrot it on every major media station
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.200]  it's unbelievable during an official visit and also renewed attacks on the
[15:59.200 --> 16:03.200]  immigration legislation passed by arizona president obama joined in his
[16:03.200 --> 16:06.320]  cause president obama is the quintessential
[16:06.320 --> 16:10.640]  globalist he is the guy that sat as the head of the un
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.440]  security council as he told people no world order
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.920]  can rise above another and then he talked about some johnny nonsense
[16:19.920 --> 16:22.480]  that no nation should try to dominate another
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.000]  meanwhile we're in eurasia trying to create a eurasian
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.480]  union with our dominance over afghanistan iraq and let's be real
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.640]  pakistan as well that's the reality it's okay when we do it
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.920]  when it's a globalist agenda but it's not okay when the slaves want to say we

[17:06.240 --> 17:10.080]  information is that what we need in this country is that how we should
[17:10.080 --> 17:14.480]  merge with other nations under a slave grid of tyranny

[24:11.760 --> 24:15.840]  alex congressman mclintock really breaks
[24:15.840 --> 24:18.640]  this down better than i could but we're not going to have time in this segment
[24:18.640 --> 24:23.200]  so we're going to go to it at the top of the next segment but let's review why
[24:23.200 --> 24:26.640]  this is so important for years and years and years the
[24:26.640 --> 24:31.120]  establishment line was we are not working towards a north american union
[24:31.120 --> 24:34.080]  we don't want to merge we would never go for global
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.000]  government but that has really changed in its outward appearance
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.360]  with people even like lewd dobs reporting on this in 2004 and 2005
[24:43.360 --> 24:47.920]  when the spp documents the security and prosperity documents
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.480]  were leaked to i'm sorry the security uh prosperity partnership
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.480]  documents were leaked to the public that was through judicial watch
[24:56.480 --> 25:00.240]  and then the mexican president at the time talked to luke radowski and
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.560]  openly admitted that they were working towards a north american union and he
[25:04.560 --> 25:06.880]  was wished that it was going faster he was actually
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.640]  very upset that it was moving at a snails
[25:10.640 --> 25:16.640]  pace but now with the media fervor with the issue in arizona they are going to
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.640]  raise the issue yet again they give the excuse to calderon
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.200]  the new president of mexico to stand before our congress
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.840]  and tell us how to run our country under a north american
[25:29.840 --> 25:33.360]  union system one where assault weapons are banned
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.000]  where mexico is good where there is no crime in mexico there's no degradation
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.360]  no no no they're not ruining the economy here
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.040]  and folks again if i was a mexican citizen i do the same thing i would come
[25:45.040 --> 25:48.400]  over the border i would look for a better life but if we're going to have them
[25:48.400 --> 25:52.560]  here number one let's secure our borders number two
[25:52.560 --> 25:56.160]  if they're doing something illegal we need to deport them we need to have a real
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.320]  path to citizenship okay now one of these phony paths to citizenship where
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.920]  you got a consulate matricula card and it's blanket amnesty and the borders
[26:03.920 --> 26:06.960]  are left wide open because that's what they want
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.080]  because they've deindustrialized this nation and if they have enough people
[26:10.080 --> 26:14.480]  come in working for six seven eight nine ten dollars an hour under the table
[26:14.480 --> 26:17.760]  guess what those jobs you used to have and you've been seeing at the last five
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.080]  to ten years where you had benefits where you had a decent wage where you
[26:22.080 --> 26:25.680]  could make a living where you could raise a family where you could buy a house
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.000]  are now gone and the people in arizona are fed
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.120]  up with it they're done they're saying look we need to stop this if the
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.440]  federales will not enforce the law let's have
[26:39.440 --> 26:43.520]  our police officers do it if they pull somebody over who happens to be drunk
[26:43.520 --> 26:46.400]  and an illegal immigrant they should be sent back
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.080]  isn't that the thing i've been pulled over on the side of my street
[26:50.080 --> 26:53.680]  in new york not drinking not in a car
[26:53.680 --> 26:57.920]  and demanded my idea my idea was demanded of me when i said hey do you
[26:57.920 --> 27:01.280]  know about the fourth amendment you know the right to uh
[27:01.280 --> 27:04.880]  be secure in your persons and properties the guys literally
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.080]  went to their mace and pulled their mace out and were going to
[27:08.080 --> 27:13.440]  mace me for walking down the street with a cup of coffee at seven thirty in the
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.880]  evening because i supposedly fit the profile of a suspect
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.800]  in a robbery me me in a small town where i graduated with 50 other kids
[27:24.800 --> 27:30.000]  okay a population of an astounding 1,112 people
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  i fit the description of somebody who robbed somebody
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.200]  totally made up totally nonsense but i have to show my idea
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.080]  i've been denied for tobacco and alcohol in the state of texas
[27:44.080 --> 27:48.880]  when i showed my id card but yet it's not okay
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.560]  for arizona to demand somebody's identification to find out if they're
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.480]  an illegal immigrant or not when they break the law
[27:56.480 --> 27:59.680]  no we're just going to keep them in the country it's absolutely ludicrous it's
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.360]  absolutely insane and alex has also made the point
[28:03.360 --> 28:06.960]  that look at all this anti-american legislation that's being passed
[28:06.960 --> 28:11.040]  including the enemy belligerent act forget about being
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.720]  an enemy combatant now if you speak your mind
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.200]  if you stand up to the system if you get out in the streets and scream
[28:19.200 --> 28:22.960]  from the mountaintops you may be an enemy belligerent
[28:22.960 --> 28:26.960]  the first amendment apparently means nothing you're aiding and abetting the
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.120]  terrorists the terrorists they've created and it's on
[28:31.120 --> 28:34.960]  record how many headlines do we need in the past week for people to
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.320]  understand we run the opium we work with car's eyes warlord brother not only
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.440]  under the obama administration but under the bush administration
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.280]  at what as well this is par for the course
[28:47.280 --> 28:51.120]  par for the course and they're trying to bring that tyranny that police state
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.040]  type occupation here to this country to
[28:55.040 --> 28:59.040]  this country that's why they want to establish a north american union they'd
[28:59.040 --> 29:02.000]  love to have united nations troops on the streets
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.840]  they'd love to have mexicans troops patrol our streets
[29:05.840 --> 29:09.680]  because they're gonna have a lot less of a hard time confiscating guns
[29:09.680 --> 29:13.440]  and shooting your kids in the back than american soldiers are
[29:13.440 --> 29:16.720]  and even our american soldiers in some cases have really
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.240]  lost their way i don't think it's a good thing
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.160]  when i watch videos of children getting gunned down and our soldiers laughing
[29:24.160 --> 29:29.200]  and high-fiving about it the moral degradation is unbelievable so on the
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.960]  other side we're gonna have congressman mclintock talk about
[29:32.960 --> 29:38.400]  how the ron betraying us americans and really his own people in front of

[32:59.520 --> 33:12.880]  wage war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[33:12.880 --> 33:18.000]  calderon gets a standing ovation in front of our congress just like when
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.320]  gordon brown came down announced his global new deal
[33:22.320 --> 33:27.760]  and folks it is so disgusting that we are embracing this where
[33:27.760 --> 33:31.760]  in the mainstream media in the establishment mindset it is the alex
[33:31.760 --> 33:35.920]  jones show i am jason bermas sitting and so we're going to go to this video
[33:35.920 --> 33:41.280]  right now of congressman mclintock and of course he has nowhere near the
[33:41.280 --> 33:45.120]  audience that calderon did telling it like it is so let's
[33:45.120 --> 33:49.280]  hit the clip i rise to take strong exception to the
[33:49.280 --> 33:54.000]  speech by the president of mexico here in this chamber today
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.920]  the mexican government has made it very clear for many years
[33:57.920 --> 34:01.040]  that it holds american sovereignty and contempt
[34:01.040 --> 34:05.440]  and president calderon's behavior as a guest of the congress today confirms
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.800]  and underscores this attitude it is highly inappropriate for the president
[34:10.800 --> 34:14.880]  of mexico to lecture americans on american immigration law
[34:14.880 --> 34:18.800]  just as it would be for americans to a lecture mexico
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.280]  on its own laws it is obvious that president calderon does not
[34:23.280 --> 34:28.400]  understand the nature of america or the purpose of our immigration law
[34:28.400 --> 34:33.440]  unlike mexico's immigration law which is brutally exclusionary
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.600]  the purpose of america's law is not to keep people out it is to assure that
[34:37.600 --> 34:42.560]  his people come to the united states they do so with the intention of becoming
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.440]  americans and of raising their children as americans
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.840]  unlike mexico our nation embraces legal immigration
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.000]  and what makes that possible is assimilation
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.240]  a century ago president teddy roosevelt put it this way he said quote
[35:00.240 --> 35:04.320]  in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good
[35:04.320 --> 35:08.400]  faith becomes an american simulates himself to us
[35:08.400 --> 35:12.400]  he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else
[35:12.400 --> 35:17.520]  for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.640]  birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon this
[35:22.640 --> 35:28.000]  person's becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.120]  there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he's an american but
[35:33.120 --> 35:36.320]  something else also isn't an american at all
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.560]  we have room but for one flag the american flag
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.280]  we have room for but one language here and that is the english language
[35:45.280 --> 35:49.920]  and we have room for but one soul loyalty and that is a loyalty to the
[35:49.920 --> 35:54.080]  american people end of quote that's how we've created
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.600]  one great nation from all the nations of the world
[35:57.600 --> 36:00.880]  the largest group of immigrants now comes from mexico
[36:00.880 --> 36:04.560]  a recent rand study discovered that during the 20th century while
[36:04.560 --> 36:08.560]  our immigration laws were actually enforced
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.240]  assimilation worked and it made possible the swift
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.200]  detainment of the american dream for millions of immigrants seeking to escape
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.840]  the conditions of mexico that is the broader meaning of our nation's model
[36:21.840 --> 36:25.440]  e pluribus unum from many people one people
[36:25.440 --> 36:30.320]  the american people but there's now an element in our political structure that
[36:30.320 --> 36:33.840]  seeks to undermine that concept of e pluribus unum
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.160]  it seeks to hyphenate americans to develop linguistic divisions
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.880]  to assign rights and preferences based on race and ethnicity
[36:42.880 --> 36:46.880]  and to elevate devotion to foreign ideologies and traditions while at the
[36:46.880 --> 36:51.600]  same time denigrating american culture american values
[36:51.600 --> 36:56.000]  and american founding principles in order to do so they know that they have to
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.840]  stop the process of assimilation and in order to do that
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.320]  they have to undermine our immigration laws it is an outrage
[37:04.320 --> 37:09.200]  that a foreign head of state would appear in and actively seek to do so
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.600]  and it is a disgrace that he would be cheered on from the left wing of the
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.280]  white house and for many democrats here in congress
[37:17.280 --> 37:20.400]  arizona has not adopted a new immigration law
[37:20.400 --> 37:26.400]  all it has done is to enforce existing law that this president refuses to enforce
[37:26.400 --> 37:31.120]  it's hardly a radical policy to suggest that if an officer on a routine traffic
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.600]  stop encounters a driver with no driver's license no passport and who
[37:35.600 --> 37:41.040]  doesn't speak english that maybe that individual might be here illegally
[37:41.040 --> 37:44.160]  and to those who say we must reform our immigration laws
[37:44.160 --> 37:49.920]  i reply we don't need to reform them we need to enforce them
[37:49.920 --> 37:55.520]  just as every other government does just as mexico does
[37:55.520 --> 37:59.760]  above all this is a debate of by and for the american people
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.040]  if president calderon wishes to participate in that debate
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.600]  i invite him to obey our immigration laws apply for citizenship do what 600
[38:09.600 --> 38:13.280]  thousand legal immigrants to our nation are doing
[38:13.280 --> 38:16.960]  right now learn our history and our customs and become
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.680]  an american and then he will have every right to participate in that debate
[38:21.680 --> 38:26.320]  until then i would politely invite him to have the courtesy while a guest of
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.880]  this congress to abide by the fundamental rules of diplomacy between
[38:30.880 --> 38:35.280]  civilized nations not to meddle in each other's domestic debates
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.520]  are you back and if you missed any of that video you can go see it right now
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.240]  over at info wars dot com that's the congressman out of california
[38:44.240 --> 38:48.400]  mclintock and he said it very very well he said look
[38:48.400 --> 38:53.600]  we had immigration that worked in the vast majority of the 20th century when
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.160]  people came here they learned the language they were assimilated into our
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.800]  constitutional republic and right now they're trying to
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.480]  demonize us for saying look these people aren't coming
[39:06.480 --> 39:11.680]  in the right way they're not applying for citizenship my my favorite neighbor
[39:11.680 --> 39:15.760]  in new york my only neighbor really she's vietnamese
[39:15.760 --> 39:19.920]  she struggles for over a decade a decade to become a citizen
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.080]  she went through the proper channels now what the mainstream media is going to
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.120]  do is they're going to show some horror stories like the one i have
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.280]  in my hand right here and say look how they're trying to go after these good
[39:31.280 --> 39:34.720]  illegal immigrants this young girl she's 21 years old
[39:34.720 --> 39:39.280]  she's attending college her name is jessica collado
[39:39.280 --> 39:42.960]  and she was basically taken out and now they might deport her now this is a
[39:42.960 --> 39:46.160]  girl that's worked very hard she does want to become a citizen of the united
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.160]  states she is in college and what they're just trying to do in arizona is
[39:50.160 --> 39:53.360]  say look if you pull somebody over and they're drunk
[39:53.360 --> 39:56.640]  or if somebody's breaking the law or if somebody's robbing an apartment or
[39:56.640 --> 40:00.160]  somebody assaults somebody and they happen to be an illegal immigrant they
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.640]  don't get to stay they have to go that's the way it should be
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.040]  they're just enforcing the law that's already on the books
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.200]  but there is such a push to get rid of that law
[40:13.200 --> 40:17.920]  then now the establishment is saying no no no that's racism
[40:17.920 --> 40:21.680]  if you win a senate primary like ran paul you're a racist you're against
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.280]  civil rights we're going to go into that in detail
[40:25.280 --> 40:28.960]  with paul joseph watson coming up at the top of the next hour
[40:28.960 --> 40:32.160]  we're going to also take your calls in the next five or ten minutes but i want
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.720]  to hit some of the other headlines here that i haven't been able to
[40:36.720 --> 40:41.280]  especially this seven seven headline where they're now going to probe believe
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.560]  it or not they're going to probe mi5's role
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.080]  in the seven seven attacks of course mi5
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.640]  is one of these spying agencies over in the united kingdom
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.320]  and for years we have documented what really took place
[40:56.320 --> 40:59.440]  on seven seven in fact i want to play this video i don't know if we have it
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.080]  queued up yet of peter powers talking in front of sky news i know that one of
[41:04.080 --> 41:06.560]  the guys has it so we're going to go to that later but
[41:06.560 --> 41:10.320]  peter powers is in front of sky news admitting that he's running a private
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.640]  drill a private drill and he won't say who he's running
[41:14.640 --> 41:19.680]  running the drill for of the same exact train stations being bombed at the
[41:19.680 --> 41:22.480]  same exact time and this didn't really get
[41:22.480 --> 41:25.200]  covered of course anywhere in the mainstream press
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.160]  but years later it was seven seven oh five
[41:30.160 --> 41:33.920]  it's on the headlines of the guardian uh july 7th inquest to investigate role of
[41:33.920 --> 41:37.520]  mi5 and police corner says hearings into deaths of bombers and victims will be
[41:37.520 --> 41:42.960]  heard separately a bus destroyed in the 7th uh of the uh july 7th 2005 attacks
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.960]  in london are now asking about the role of
[41:46.960 --> 41:51.120]  mi5 and police prior to the 2005 terrorist attacks a coroner said
[41:51.120 --> 41:54.400]  lady justice hollett told the royal courts of justice in central london
[41:54.400 --> 41:57.760]  that the hearings into the deaths of the four bombers would not be heard at the
[41:57.760 --> 42:01.520]  same time of those of their 52 victims however some survivors of the blasts
[42:01.520 --> 42:05.280]  were disappointed and much more than disappointed folks i can assure you that
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.200]  when the coroner refused uh their request to be able to cross examine
[42:09.200 --> 42:11.840]  witnesses hollett had been asked to decide
[42:11.840 --> 42:15.120]  what the form in quest would take ahead of the hearings
[42:15.120 --> 42:18.320]  later this year so i'm wondering if we have that
[42:18.320 --> 42:21.040]  clip ready we still don't have that clip ready
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.560]  one second i really want to play this because a lot of you are new listeners
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.600]  you don't understand how false flag terror works and this is how it works
[42:29.600 --> 42:34.160]  private organizations run drills mirroring the actual attacks they set up
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.480]  their patsies who have run these drills you know four five six sometimes a
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.120]  dozen times and nothing's happened and then all the sudden a train blows up
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.960]  and radical islam is to blame so let's hit that clip
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.080]  the issue uh today we were running an exercise
[42:50.080 --> 42:52.880]  for a company bearing in mind i'm now in the private sector
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.160]  and we sat everybody down in the city a thousand people involved in the whole
[42:56.160 --> 43:00.160]  organization but the crisis team and the most particular thing was we based
[43:00.160 --> 43:03.360]  our scenario on the simultaneous attacks from the underground and mainline
[43:03.360 --> 43:06.240]  station so we had to suddenly switch an exercise
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.160]  from fictional to real and one of the first things is
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.120]  get that bureau number when you have a list of people missing
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.440]  tell them and it'll take a long time just to get this right you are actually
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.200]  working today on an exercise that envisioned
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.880]  virtually the scenario almost precisely i was up until two o'clock this morning
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.400]  because it's our job my own company vice of consultants we specialize in
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.520]  helping people to get their crisis management response how do you jump
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.440]  from slow time thinking to quick time doing and we chose a scenario
[43:35.440 --> 43:38.880]  with their assistance which is based on a terrorist attack because they're very
[43:38.880 --> 43:41.600]  close to a property occupied by jewish
[43:41.600 --> 43:44.560]  businessmen they're in the city and there are more american banks in the
[43:44.560 --> 43:47.920]  city than there are in the whole of new york a logical thing to do
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.000]  and it i'm still going to see how extraordinary today must
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.560]  feel for you as it unfolds all right let's pull it right there go there
[43:56.560 --> 44:04.000]  folks again this guy is admitting on fox owned rupert murdoch owned sky news
[44:04.000 --> 44:09.200]  and he did so on bbc radio that visor consultants his firm
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.720]  are running drills of blowing up trains at the same exact time at the same
[44:12.720 --> 44:18.400]  exact place and this is why they want to regulate the internet so bad because
[44:18.400 --> 44:21.520]  you know that's just a clip that somebody's going to forget a week later
[44:21.520 --> 44:25.200]  it's not going to be put into the mainstream media but once it's on youtube
[44:25.200 --> 44:28.400]  oh wow all of a sudden hundreds of thousands and millions of people are
[44:28.400 --> 44:31.920]  seeing that and they're waking up to the system
[44:31.920 --> 44:35.280]  and that's why they're pushing the cyber security act here the cyber bullying
[44:35.280 --> 44:38.720]  act and abroad this one's out of the mail online schoolboy
[44:38.720 --> 44:42.080]  15 hangs himself why because of being plagued by
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.440]  online bullies and we've seen the same thing going on
[44:45.440 --> 44:48.240]  with myspace and now you're not allowed to have freedom of speech on the
[44:48.240 --> 44:51.840]  internet my lee cyrus aka hannah montana says
[44:51.840 --> 44:56.320]  she doesn't like being called fat on her twitter so we need to pass rules
[44:56.320 --> 45:00.880]  so my lee cyrus can feel safe on the internet it's for the children all right
[45:00.880 --> 45:04.720]  i promised i would go to your calls so let's go to annette in west virginia
[45:04.720 --> 45:08.560]  annette what's on your mind uh... good morning
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.240]  uh... actually good afternoon uh... i do have
[45:12.240 --> 45:17.360]  uh... an interesting uh... a comment with regard to
[45:17.360 --> 45:22.880]  the situation about immigration uh... our nation was founded by a group of
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.680]  people that were homogeneously of one race
[45:27.680 --> 45:31.680]  and they constructed a form of government that was suitable
[45:31.680 --> 45:37.200]  to that race i understand well let's stop let's stop let's stop
[45:37.200 --> 45:42.000]  it had nothing to do with race the constitution the bill of rights after
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.560]  the civil rights act has been passed i'm not saying that slavery wasn't a
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.800]  boring thing but it had been taking place across the world
[45:48.800 --> 45:51.360]  the constitution bill of rights is for everybody ma'am
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.520]  i you know i'm not totally and completely anglo-american it still works for
[45:55.520 --> 46:00.240]  me they didn't set up a system to exclude others they set up a
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.880]  system where everybody had the right to pursuit of happiness to freedom of
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.640]  speech to being a part of the system and again
[46:08.640 --> 46:12.240]  i would love to see that come to mexico but that's not the case i would love to
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.320]  see them adopt our constitution and bill of rights but that's not
[46:16.320 --> 46:20.240]  what happens we become more corrupt our economy goes
[46:20.240 --> 46:23.840]  more towards a third world and second world nation when we merge with these
[46:23.840 --> 46:25.760]  so that's just a completely ludicrous statement
[46:25.760 --> 46:29.600]  jeremy in california jeremy you're on the line
[46:29.600 --> 46:34.080]  hey i i actually wanted to make two comments um the first one was actually
[46:34.080 --> 46:37.920]  a guest request um it would be uh pretty cool if you

[46:40.320 --> 46:44.000]  about her theory on all right sir i thank you for the call let's go to caroline
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.080]  in florida it's unbelievable man we're talking about real issues here
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.160]  and people want to talk about the most johnny nonsense stuff you can possibly
[46:52.160 --> 46:54.720]  imagine i'm not even going to get into that call what that caller want to talk
[46:54.720 --> 46:57.280]  about caroline florida you're online
[46:57.280 --> 47:01.840]  hi yes i don't have a message to the president of co of mexico
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.280]  and to our president i always did volunteer work i was had a project
[47:07.280 --> 47:11.600]  self-esteem in southern california school
[47:11.600 --> 47:14.800]  i had a young boy come to me a mexican board
[47:14.800 --> 47:19.760]  he said he was living with his family a lot of people in one apartment
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.720]  and they were drug dealers and he even carried a gun
[47:24.720 --> 47:29.520]  that boy came to me and asked for help he was afraid
[47:29.520 --> 47:35.680]  he gave me the gun i broke it down destroyed it and threw it in a dumpster
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.080]  and i taught that boy myself because he didn't want to be like the rest of the
[47:40.080 --> 47:45.680]  people in his family and i taught him english and i taught him after school
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.040]  i don't want to say there's hope that these people but it has to be done the
[47:49.040 --> 47:53.680]  right way and then say that america
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.680]  discriminate i didn't discriminate against that boy
[47:57.680 --> 48:02.560]  i helped him no i absolutely agree ma'am and that's what we need to do we do need
[48:02.560 --> 48:06.160]  to help our neighbors look the majority of my neighbors right now are
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.240]  illegal immigrants that's just a fact they don't speak english i don't hold any
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.160]  ill will towards these people when the president of mexico comes into
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.720]  my country stands before my congress says that we need an assault weapons
[48:18.720 --> 48:22.880]  ban and what people in arizona are doing is wrong i find that just
[48:22.880 --> 48:26.480]  unbelievable and incomprehensible i think we should
[48:26.480 --> 48:30.560]  be reaching out to our fellow man our fellow human beings out there and just
[48:30.560 --> 48:33.440]  because somebody's an illegal mexican kid you shouldn't shun them i think what
[48:33.440 --> 48:36.320]  you did is great and not everybody who comes from
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.720]  mexico wants to be a gang member or a thug or a drug dealer or take
[48:40.720 --> 48:44.480]  advantage of the system but a lot of people do see it as a free ride has
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.480]  nothing to do with their color or their race it has everything to do with their
[48:48.480 --> 48:52.400]  economic and political situations i appreciate the call let's go to shane
[48:52.400 --> 48:55.680]  in virginia shane you're online

[49:26.960 --> 49:32.080]  yes sir that was an excellent speech by mclinock but i just want i had to
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.120]  point out uh it's kind of ironic coming from commerce
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.400]  smith mclinock someone he endorsed tfr
[49:38.400 --> 49:43.040]  fred thompson for president this past time and refused to endorse ron paul
[49:43.040 --> 49:47.520]  he worked on thompson's campaign uh and this past january mclinock voted to
[49:47.520 --> 49:51.840]  renew the patriot act he also in 2006 he's the one who ran against
[49:51.840 --> 49:56.400]  workshaker for governor and i recall in 2003 and i i was a big supporter of him
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.000]  that's why i followed him that's why i'm upset about what he's doing nowadays
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.120]  in 2006 mclinock endorsed arnold's for governor
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.280]  look it up it's plain admitted knowledge uh after
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.920]  a swordshaker signed an anti-gun bills and numerous other horrible things so
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.640]  mclinock gives great speeches uh he's an establishment man in a phony and i
[50:16.640 --> 50:18.880]  don't trust him and i don't like him and this is coming from a
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.360]  steadfast supporter of mclinock for many years no i hear you look i'm gonna say
[50:23.360 --> 50:27.280]  this right now i don't know enough about his policies especially over the last
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.200]  10 years to say whether or not this guy is a good guy but what he put down
[50:31.200 --> 50:34.640]  in that speech the one we're showing right now at info wars
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.920]  dot com about calderon's visit was spot on and you know sometimes i have to take
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.160]  issue with things say michelle backman does on the war but she's good on other
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.720]  issues so again we have to look for these bits of
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.240]  truth to show other people what's really going on it's the alex joneshow
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.440]  we'll be back after this info wars dot com and prism planet dot tv
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.120]  global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars

[52:05.600 --> 52:09.040]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[52:09.040 --> 52:13.040]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[52:13.040 --> 52:16.320]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[52:16.320 --> 52:18.720]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land

[54:22.800 --> 54:27.680]  well before you do that i want to go back to this rand paul situation he
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.480]  dominates this senate primary he is the face
[54:32.480 --> 54:35.840]  the face of a constitutional republic the face
[54:35.840 --> 54:41.440]  of hope for this patriot movement and what do they say oh he's a racist he's
[54:41.440 --> 54:44.080]  against civil rights and we're going to play this clip
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.000]  of a wolf blitzer talking to ran paul really grilling him
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.720]  trying to get him to admit his guilt oh you're a bad person ran just admit it
[54:52.720 --> 54:56.480]  and we're going to discuss that with paul joseph watson but you can see
[54:56.480 --> 55:01.440]  the headlines tea party candidate faces civil rights controversy
[55:01.440 --> 55:05.040]  oh he's a civil rights controversy he's just saying look
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.560]  people have the right to their private establishments after all the bohemian
[55:08.560 --> 55:13.360]  grove doesn't let women into it no it doesn't that's very odd and
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.680]  their membership is mainly widened 3000 people around the world that really
[55:17.680 --> 55:21.200]  make global decisions how odd they're allowed to have their
[55:21.200 --> 55:24.880]  private organizations but others are not all right let's take a
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.880]  couple more callers before paul joseph watson comes into the top of the hour
[55:28.880 --> 55:31.600]  bill in new york bill you're online
[55:31.600 --> 55:35.040]  uh... let's go to jack in san diego jack you're online
[55:35.040 --> 55:37.760]  i wanted to disagree with something about machete
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.120]  uh... that that's been put out uh... by you guys over the last
[55:41.120 --> 55:44.240]  uh... few days and that is that the film got
[55:44.240 --> 55:47.920]  uh... special credit from the texas government
[55:47.920 --> 55:51.040]  okay let's not be let alone hold on let me i'm gonna let you talk but i'm gonna
[55:51.040 --> 55:54.880]  tell you straight up that rob do called their office
[55:54.880 --> 55:58.080]  said he was a filmmaker was looking for funding
[55:58.080 --> 56:02.000]  asked how he could apply for funding she asked him well what type of a movie is
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.280]  that he said it was an action adventure film she then asked him well
[56:05.280 --> 56:08.560]  could you give me an example of perhaps a film that shot nosa and give you a
[56:08.560 --> 56:11.760]  better idea and he said machete and she said oh yeah
[56:11.760 --> 56:14.800]  they're part of our program i forget what the program was called and she
[56:14.800 --> 56:17.520]  admitted on the phone that they had received funds
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.120]  and then basically our story went viral on drudge and all the sudden
[56:21.120 --> 56:24.960]  uh... her supervisor called us up and we put his comments
[56:24.960 --> 56:28.960]  at the bottom of the article saying hey this guy is denying what's going on but
[56:28.960 --> 56:30.800]  they got the funding and you're gonna tell me
[56:30.800 --> 56:34.400]  these people didn't apply for the austin credits
[56:34.400 --> 56:38.000]  say what i'm saying is you're being disingenuous every every film every
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.040]  state in the south west has a big film commission
[56:41.040 --> 56:44.960]  they're competing to take production out of hollywood i work in film and that's
[56:44.960 --> 56:48.560]  what this is about this is about giving tax credits to bring production into
[56:48.560 --> 56:51.760]  a little bit that's the point sir they're getting tax credits to promote an
[56:51.760 --> 56:55.120]  agenda which is racist it's a racist it listen
[56:55.120 --> 56:58.880]  i like robert rodriguez i'm a fan of the desperado films no matter how
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.440]  ridiculous they are i'm a huge fan of the sin city movies i'm sure that this one
[57:03.440 --> 57:06.720]  is probably going to be a fun romp once you can get past
[57:06.720 --> 57:10.240]  all the racist connotations out there but the fact of the matter is
[57:10.240 --> 57:13.600]  this movie was made in austin and it did receive tax credits
[57:13.600 --> 57:16.640]  that's what we're saying why are we being disingenuous man
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.800]  the point is is that you're basically because they don't review scripts
[57:20.800 --> 57:24.400]  before they approve a production to come in but they should that's the project
[57:24.400 --> 57:27.360]  that's the point they should review these scripts
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.800]  before the productions come in i understand it's all about the money
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.920]  and getting people to shoot here and that's what the tax credits are about
[57:33.920 --> 57:37.840]  but that doesn't stop the fact that these tax this tax money is being
[57:37.840 --> 57:41.040]  used for these types of films and we don't agree with it thank you for the
[57:41.040 --> 57:44.800]  call stan in south dakota stan you're online

[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:26.240]  jason ermas sitting in we're gonna have paul joseph watson up
[1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:30.960]  in just a moment but on the line with me is alex jones alex
[1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:35.440]  hey uh yeah watson's coming up with the news and info i'm taking off today and
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:38.160]  jason the reason you're getting so many crazy calls is what i've tried to
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:41.520]  explain to you we don't screen phone calls unless it's on a
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:45.120]  particular subject and we say we want callers on that subject so people take
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.240]  advantage of that that's why i'm pretty much moving to
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:52.640]  topic-based calls and specific issues because
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:55.840]  uh we went we now reach so many millions of people
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:59.040]  that the haters are the ones that are always going to call in
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:03.360]  uh first and what that does is then distort what we're covering you know
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:06.000]  they're going to call in about cuba cabras they're going to call in about
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.960]  space beams they're going to they're going to call in about
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:13.840]  you know uh saying we're racist whatever to throw us off the issue and
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:16.400]  that's why we mainly just focus on guests and then
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:20.560]  callers on certain topics but the last guy on the whole machete film
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:24.240]  for stations that just joined us uh robert rodriguez is now given an
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.840]  ain't it cool news interview and it's it's it's spun very well but in the
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:32.480]  middle of the article he goes ahead and says you know what
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:36.800]  i have cut a lot of the film out now because it is too real to reality and
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:40.240]  it's going to be on the dvd extra because it could cause some
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:44.240]  some problems uh and uh we do have the script
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:49.680]  and it is a race war film and does uh paint his panics his savages and his
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:53.200]  white people as a bunch of racist it was his spanning members of his crew that
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:57.680]  were concerned we called the texas film commission they said they're funding it
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:02.000]  i live here in austin okay and i've met rodriguez you know friends with the
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.160]  people in the film commission i know all about it and i know he is the
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:09.120]  darling they have different tiers of funding
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:12.800]  that's why we're going to produce wake up it's coming out this year a big film
[1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:16.960]  it didn't get the funding because the state commission said no
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:21.040]  so it's disingenuous to call in and say everyone gets funding
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:27.520]  this is getting multi tiers of funding not just tax breaks and i now
[1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:32.000]  rob do dug this out san antonio express news and other newspapers
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.440]  from last year where the head of the texas film commission
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:39.520]  admitted that they were massively funding and supporting
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:43.280]  with all sorts of funds and location and machete
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:47.040]  and that it was the model in fact we do can bring in the actual quotes
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:53.360]  it was the model of the entire system the the poster child for them
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:58.320]  is machete and so the when the governor press secretary contacted us
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:01.120]  a few days after our story went nationwide on the washington post and
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:05.360]  drudge report everywhere else we put the governor's statement saying well we
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:09.040]  haven't decided whether to fund it will will decide that at the end
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:12.640]  and we went to show how that's a lie they begin authorizing funding
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.160]  at the beginning and so no they refuse fully
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:19.680]  30 plus percent according to the associated press
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:24.160]  of film commission money in texas so to say that everybody gets it
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:29.920]  is a lie and he is disingenuous and again you lose
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:33.200]  you fail caller we're not the ones being disingenuous
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:37.120]  you're the one that's either ignorant or being disingenuous and
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:41.360]  you know quite frankly i don't want to influence this film
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.320]  i was contacting the people that were concerned and if you go read his new
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:47.360]  any cool news interview i'm recovering the sunday
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:50.240]  he admits that he's now going to cut these parts
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:54.720]  and and and put it in the dvd extra uh because it is too
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:59.520]  real to life this is this this film has race war in it
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:04.400]  at a time when this country is on its edge and at a time we have the mexican
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:07.680]  president telling us to ban semi-automatic rifles
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:11.360]  and telling us to open our borders up and the president is a trader
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:14.960]  saying that uh we don't have borders anymore in america
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:19.040]  i mean give me a break america is being swallowed by the new world
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.200]  order by globalist offshore we've all got to come together
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:28.400]  against this and expose this situation and jason you're doing a great job

[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:18.800]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:23.040]  including colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a continuing

[1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:29.280]  am jason bermas sitting in we have paul joseph watson on hold we're going to go
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:33.040]  to him about ran paul's victory and now the vicious media attacks in just a
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:36.320]  moment we also have tommy and scottland who i briefly want to go to about the
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:40.160]  seven seven attacks but just finishing up on the machete point
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:43.680]  okay in my hands and hopefully we're going to go to the document camp for
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:48.080]  prison planet dot tv viewers i have rodriguez with
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:53.040]  the guy signing his incentives program look here's the incentives bill signing
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:56.720]  robert rodriguez reveals his next project as film incentives bill
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:00.640]  signing he is the model this is machete was the model
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:04.240]  for this program and if you don't believe me here's the other
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:07.600]  headline out of uh... san antonio news austin was also the site of the
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:11.040]  production for robert rodriguez directed movie machete
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:15.360]  the project was announced shortly after the film incentives were creative
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:18.400]  oh it was announced right after these film incentives were creative and
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:22.080]  hudgens the head of it said the announcement was symbolic for the
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:27.520]  incentive program so again he is the model there is no
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:31.200]  debating we're not being disingenuous i understand it's about
[1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:34.240]  the bottom line but we're not distorting anything sir so let's go back to
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:38.480]  tommy and scottland very very quickly and you talk to peter power we played the
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:42.560]  clip in the last hour of peter powers talking about the drills
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:47.040]  that visor consultants were running for private organizations of the same exact
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:51.200]  train uh... stations blowing up from buses blowing up at the same exact time
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:55.440]  go ahead tommy yeah but i but i spoke to him i just spoke to him then i'll try to
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.720]  get another interview with him but when i did a few weeks ago
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:03.600]  and he'd all you know but we are you know i said excuse me he was five years ago
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.480]  and then i said well work it's just i've got some concerns you know you're not
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:10.800]  one of these mad conspiracy theorists i said look i'm a journalist
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:14.320]  and then later on he questioned or asked me a few more things he said you know i'm
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.960]  getting really worried i don't think you really are a journalist i said well
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:21.680]  i've got my own website i said alternative media and i've got my own radio station
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:25.760]  and uh and i closed him on it and i said well can you tell me i said because
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:30.560]  it's it's one hell of a coincidence that you could be pulling off drills
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:34.320]  at the same time when you know these these things happened
[1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:38.240]  and he said well look do you think i would seriously have anything to do with
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:41.760]  these attacks and then go on the mainstream media
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:45.520]  and and tell him about it and i well i said to him well
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:48.400]  well of course because it gives you the perfect cover because the people that
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:52.560]  you're dealing with or you were with that day they could come out later on
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:55.680]  and then it looks a whole lot worse because look at his background he worked
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:58.640]  for scotland yard he's on the inside he's probably
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:02.880]  part of the illegitimate illuminati so he's part of the inside job that
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:06.560]  happened on that day and real questions should be answered because i'm going to
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:09.280]  be telling me stop yet let me just let me just stop you and hopefully you can
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:11.920]  call into my sunday show and maybe we can do a half an hour on it i should
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:15.040]  schedule that so maybe we can have you on my sunday show so we can discuss it
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:18.240]  because this is the headline out of the guardian today july 7th inquest to
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:22.720]  investigate role of mi5 and police i now want to go
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.400]  to paul joseph watts we may discuss this later but
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:30.320]  paul i really want to start off with the media attacks now that
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.880]  grand paul has won it looks like he's going to take
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:37.600]  that senate seat now he's against civil rights now he's a racist let's talk
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:39.120]  about it
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.720]  yeah well um it's kind of all summed up by a
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:46.400]  political article headline which i read yesterday
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:50.480]  called activist sees control of politics
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:56.400]  and that describes how establishment office holders in these recent elections
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.640]  have basically been ejected in a kind of retching convulsion
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:06.160]  um after status quo you know as this popular sentiment continues to rise
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:09.520]  now the establishment is in a blind complete
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:16.000]  stupid and panic about what to do over rand paul's success even though you know
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.160]  he's not even senator yet he's still got to be his democratic opponent
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:24.720]  uh jack conway in november but now we see
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:29.680]  rand paul being feathered and tarred about ten times more about a hundred
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:34.880]  times more than elaine kagan i mean on the one hand you have kagan
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:40.720]  who you know her every view on the second amendment free speech you know
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.040]  her office argued to ban books ban political pamphlets
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:49.520]  she wants americans held without trial detained without trial
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:53.920]  her every view is completely abhorrent to the u.s constitution and yet the
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:58.400]  corporate media is giving us such a soft ride compared to
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:04.640]  rand paul who goes on msnbc with rachel madow a couple of days ago
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:10.160]  he intellectually disagrees with one out of the ten titles of the civil rights
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.560]  act about preventing the government from
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:15.600]  regulating the first amendment private businesses
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:18.720]  he's not saying he's going to revoke the civil rights act
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.800]  as the debunkers have all claimed so madow tries to back him into a corner
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.720]  for 20 minutes on this issue and then the day after
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.080]  just about the entire corporate media and today
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:38.560]  the la times from page purely devoted to attacking rand paul and of course
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:43.120]  followed by all the neo-lib george staros blogs
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:49.680]  launch into him and try to insinuate that rand paul is some kind of plan member
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:54.560]  because he holds a position which as an article we posted
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:58.160]  about half an hour ago on prisonplanet.com proves
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.680]  is the mainstream libertarian position on the civil rights act
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:07.840]  um they've interviewed professors and um
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:13.760]  top scholars at universities who have all said that rand paul's position
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:18.400]  is part of the mainstream libertarian viewpoint on this issue
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:23.760]  so you've got that going on msnbc yesterday aired no less than eight
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:30.320]  different segments with guests such as jesse jackson
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:34.000]  james cleiber and all these democratic operatives
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.120]  eight different segments all attacking rand paul not one person did the
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:43.520]  interview who defended rand paul or was even neutral
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:48.160]  but the fact is that all these smear tactics are not having much success
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.320]  because as we've posted also on prisonplanet.com
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:56.800]  rasmussen reports the big polling agency
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:02.160]  that rand paul is 25 points ahead of his democratic parliament jack
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:07.120]  comway in this early stage obviously there's still
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:10.400]  many months to go until the november election but
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:16.560]  he's 25 points ahead even in the aftermath of all these racist smears
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:21.760]  so it proves once again that the establishment media and their operatives
[1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:27.280]  are coming out with this stuff from a kind of virtual reality bubble
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:31.040]  they still think that by launching these um
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.080]  attacks this race spacing can have such a massive impact and the fact is that
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:40.160]  it's not having the same impact that it would have done several years ago because
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:43.440]  people are aware of how these people operate
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:47.920]  and they did similar things to his father while he was running for president
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.760]  saying you know he hated martin luther king jr and they pointed to a
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  a couple newsletters that other people had written and his father was a racist
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:59.120]  and now rand paul is a racist let me read what jack
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:02.320]  conway his uh senate opponent had to say in the
[1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:05.680]  la times promoting a narrow and rigid ideology
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:08.720]  uh and has repeatedly rejected a fundamental provision of the civil
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:12.320]  rights act it no matter how he tries to spin to the contrary the fact that
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:17.040]  paul's ideology has dangerous consequences for who working families
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:20.720]  veterans students the disabled and those without a voice
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:24.560]  in the halls of power it seems to me we're the ones
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:28.320]  without a voice in the halls of power because our congress and our senate
[1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:31.680]  no no longer represent the people we do not have a government
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:35.680]  foreign by the people we do not have checks and balances in our system and
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:38.880]  we certainly don't have a lot of people like rand paul
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:42.160]  that are sticking up for our first amendment rights
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:45.680]  no and that's that's why the establishment hates his gut
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:48.800]  and i mean the quote you just read from conway
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:51.440]  is you know it echoes the rhetoric coming out
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:56.000]  people are basically insinuating that rand paul wants to create restaurants
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.760]  where black people aren't allowed in them they're saying he wants to throw out
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:04.400]  the civil rights act and reinforce segregation which of course
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:09.120]  is complete enough to bologna if anyone tried to set up a business or a
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:12.320]  restaurant that wouldn't serve black people it'd get
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:16.720]  picketed shut down and you know people wouldn't patronize it in
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:20.400]  in an instant so the attacks are completely made up
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:25.120]  but the fact that they're being echoed across every corporate media rag just
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:29.280]  shows you how desperate they are for mere rand paul
[1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:33.840]  and you can you can tell that this was contrived because in the very hours
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:39.360]  after his victory his crushing victory over the neocon stooge that ran against
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:42.960]  him they attacked they tried to attack rand paul
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.040]  because he held his victory celebration in a country club
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:51.680]  and they said that this was some kind of racist elitist thing to do
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:55.680]  so right from the very start they were trying to contrive
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:59.200]  race baiting and attack him on these racial angles
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:02.720]  the country club thing was pathetic it didn't work
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:07.680]  so now you had madow try and push him into a corner on this civil rights thing
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:11.360]  and despite the fact that rand paul has eloquently
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:15.760]  defended his position which again is backed up by mainstream libertarians
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:20.880]  the libertarian icon the late harry brown held the same position
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:25.120]  you have rand paul eloquently defending himself but they're still going with it
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:30.160]  but just like the country club media i think it'll wash away very quickly
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:34.320]  but what i find amazingly hypocritical
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:39.840]  is the fact that this originated from rachel madow of msnbc
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:45.200]  and this is a woman who 80 percent of her paycheck comes from the owners of
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:51.920]  nbc universal general electric whose primary business activity is
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:55.760]  manufacturing bombs to be dropped on brown people in middle east and third
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:18:59.040]  world so she's paid by a contractor whose
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:01.680]  business is to floor the brown people and yet
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:04.960]  rand paul is a big racist because he thinks government shouldn't stick it
[1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:09.760]  nose into private business a little bit hypocritical where i like to say
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:14.560]  i would say so as well and unfortunately the establishment media over at msnbc
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:18.480]  it was okay to criticize the war when it was under the bush administration
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:22.880]  and it was okay to point out all these infractions and civil liberties and our
[1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:26.480]  privacy and our freedom but now that barack obama's in it's okay to be in
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:29.200]  the middle east and we need to attack anybody who
[1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:33.920]  may oppose democratic power paul well that's right and
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:37.600]  i mean you you see it from every angle angle i mean old but then he's terrible
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.680]  now he was really good when bush was in power but as soon as obama got in
[1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:45.360]  as we predicted before what happened they just switched straight away
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:48.080]  and they stopped supporting whoever's in power
[1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:51.680]  we'll be back after this it's the alex joneshow i'm jason bermas sitting in

[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:31.440]  a lot of people are pointing to the rachel madow interview because it was
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:35.120]  the first one out there and everybody needed to piggyback on that to get it
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:39.680]  into the headlines today but wolf blitzer also did a piece basically saying
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:43.120]  you don't like black people do you rand and rand said you know where's my honey
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:46.960]  moon he's like you don't get one in politics but barack obama sure got a
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:50.880]  honey moon even before he was elected paul
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:54.960]  indeed he did and then the people who started to criticize it
[1:25:54.960 --> 1:25:58.080]  they were called racist views and there was socialism
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:01.920]  so they only choose to race fate when it suits their cause
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:06.560]  and you're right i mean it's everywhere the la times from page like you said
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:11.760]  um msnbc no less than eight different segments yesterday on it all
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:16.400]  attacking it and also the obama campaign group
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:21.520]  organizing for america has um sent out a math email
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:25.360]  saying that rand paul supports segregation and that
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:29.280]  this should cause a quote massive public outcry
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:34.640]  which then provoked rand paul to have to have to issue a statement saying
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:38.080]  he doesn't want to repeal the civil rights act just because he
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:43.520]  intellectually disagrees with the scope of one out of the ten titles of it
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:46.560]  i mean it's ridiculous it's transparently
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:51.920]  um a contrived attack and i'm sure that once this comes to life as it
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:57.120]  already is being brought to life that they'll move on to something else
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:03.680]  and they've already floated that um with this david corn character
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:08.880]  which i'm sure that you've come across in the course of your 911 research
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.200]  and this is an ultimate neoliberal establishment
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:19.120]  insider who for every major juncture acts as an apologist for the
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.080]  establishment he denied that there was any
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:25.680]  warning prior to 911 about pre-assacked intelligence
[1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:30.640]  something which has been proven in triplicate you know he attacked gary
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:34.400]  webb for exposing cia drug-running drug-running
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:38.960]  he poses as a liberal and yet he's a neocon light he's a
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:43.280]  statist again he supports whoever's in power on what they do
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:48.720]  so now he's come out with this article out of the nation saying that
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:53.280]  basically rand paul's paranoid delusional and dangerous because he's made some
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:57.440]  appearances on the alex jones show and because
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:01.200]  like six of the ten actual 9-11 commissioners
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:04.480]  we talk about you know 9-11 being a cover-up
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:08.720]  which supposedly in corn's world view
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:12.080]  which is about five or six years past its bell by date
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:15.840]  makes rand paul this paranoid nutcase conspiracy theory
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:20.800]  unfit to be a senator well we know that's absolutely
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:24.720]  unbelievable you look at the evidence they're running drills of planes being
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:28.480]  hijacked and driven into buildings at the same exact time just like the 7-7
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:32.160]  bombings and again the inquest into the 7-7 bombings is now going to look
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.320]  at the mi-5 role expect a whitewash the bottom line is
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:40.640]  the establishment out there has about six months to really try
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:43.920]  to discredit rand paul with their vicious attacks
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:48.240]  with their lies in conjunction with their voting machine fraud i mean they
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:52.080]  better get the die-bold systems in there quick or this guy may be a senator
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.680]  from kentucky in uh before they can blink an eye so they're really going to work
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:59.120]  hard paul over the next five to six months i think they're going to keep
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:02.960]  pounding the pavement pounding the pavement asking the same question again
[1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:06.560]  and again and again until they get a response that they can just
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:10.080]  store in a manner that they can blow it up all over the mainstream like when
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:13.840]  howard dean went yeah and they said wow look at this crazy person
[1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:17.840]  he can't be the president i'm not a fan of howard dean i just saw the media turn
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:20.960]  on somebody with one act and they're going to be
[1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:24.880]  waiting fervently for that act so when we come back it's the alex joneshow

[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:13.680]  i want to give you a chance to explain because there's a lot of confusion
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:18.000]  right now about precisely where you stand i'll ask you a simple
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:21.280]  question if you had been a member of the senate or the house
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:25.520]  back in 1964 would you have voted yay or nay
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:30.320]  for the civil rights act yes i would have voted yes
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:34.000]  so why is there all this confusion emerging right now
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.560]  give me your analysis because it you've had an issue a statement today there
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:42.400]  have been interviews and npr yesterday and msnbc tell us
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.960]  what's going on well first of all well if i thought i was supposed to get a
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:50.800]  honeymoon when does my honeymoon start you know after my victory
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:55.040]  no such thing in politics uh doctor no such thing i think you're right
[1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:59.840]  i think what troubles me is that the news cycle's gotten out of control
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:04.960]  i mean for several hours on a major news network yesterday they reported
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.160]  repeatedly that i was for repealing the civil
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:13.440]  rights act that is not only not true never been my position
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:17.200]  but is an out and out lie and they repeated it all day long
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:20.400]  it started with my democrat opponent asserting this
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:26.240]  but has never been my position you support uh that because the argument
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:29.760]  was the argument was was made that you support the civil
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:33.840]  rights act in terms of federal terms of government responsibilities there
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:37.440]  should be no racism or segregation but if there's a private
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:40.160]  club or a restaurant where they don't want to serve
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:43.280]  african-americans as abhorrent as that is
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:46.640]  you think that they ever you you you suggested correct me if i'm wrong
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:52.160]  they would have a right to do that well what i did suggest was that it was a
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:56.000]  stain on the history of the south and of our country
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  that you know we desegregated in 1840 in boston
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:03.360]  william loyd garrison was up there with frederick douglas being thrown off
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:06.320]  trains and going through what happened in the 1960s
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:10.400]  in 1840 in boston so i think it is a stain on our history
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:13.680]  and something that i am sad for and something that
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:17.680]  if i had been alive at the time would hope that i would have been there
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:22.400]  marching with martin luther king one of our biggest county coordinators
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:26.160]  was there with martin luther king attended the rallies in dc
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:29.040]  and considers himself to be a civil rights activist
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:33.760]  and he takes it as a personal insult that people will say that our movement
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:37.680]  doesn't believe in civil rights but i just want to be precise on this
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:41.920]  dr paul just want to be precise did willworth willworth the the department
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:46.080]  the department store have a right at their lunch counters to segregate blacks
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:50.400]  and whites i think that there was an overriding
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:54.480]  problem in the south with so big that it did require federal intervention in the
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:57.680]  60s and it stemmed from things that i said you know
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:01.920]  i'd been going on really 120 years too long
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:05.600]  and the southern states weren't correcting it and i think there was a
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:08.640]  need for federal intervention all right so you've clarified you would have
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:13.360]  voted yay you would have voted yes in favor of the 1964 civil rights
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:16.320]  yes would you also have voted for the americans for
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:21.600]  with disability with disabilities act well i have some questions about it i
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:23.920]  mean the one question that comes to mind to
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:29.040]  to my thinking is let's say you have a local office and you have a two-story
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:33.120]  office and one of your workers is handicapped
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:37.120]  should you not be allowed maybe to offer them an office on the first floor
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:40.880]  or should you be forced to put in a hundred thousand dollar elevator
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:44.320]  i think that sounds like common sense that you should be allowed maybe to
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:48.480]  give them a first floor office i think sometimes when we have a federal
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:54.400]  solution we make it one size fits all and that we recognize the problem which i
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:57.680]  do also of someone who's handicapped but then we
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:00.880]  don't take into consideration at all the business owner
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.160]  or the property owner so i think it's a balancing act
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:07.680]  and i'd have to look at that legislation to see how they balanced it
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:11.840]  but my understanding is is that small business owners were often forced to
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:14.960]  put in elevators and i think you ought to at least be given the
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:18.160]  choice of can you provide an opportunity
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:22.240]  uh without maybe having to pay for an elevator so the answer is you don't know
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.520]  for sure if you would have voted yes or no on that americans
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:30.160]  for disabilities act yeah i mean i'd have to look at it and see i think you do
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:33.200]  it for it's a balancing act and i am in favor of
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:37.280]  trying to have the workplace open my office is open to the handicapped
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:40.880]  we try very hard but you know it's been open to the handicapped
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:46.000]  for decades so uh you know it doesn't always take government for people to do
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.040]  the right thing sometimes government has to step in
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:53.520]  in extraordinary circumstances but i think a lot of times that the uh the
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:57.520]  private world can step up and do the right things or we can find local
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:01.600]  solutions over federal solutions so it's not always whether you oppose
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:04.960]  something it's about where the solution should arrive
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:08.960]  whether it arrives at the federal government or the local government
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:12.240]  i do think though that there is a big civil rights issue out there and i
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.920]  think the democrats avoid it and that's school choice
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:19.840]  i think the biggest thing holding down our inner city communities
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:23.680]  is a lack of good education and i say give them a choice
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:27.680]  let them choose to go to a school anywhere in the city or outside the city
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:32.560]  and so i think school choice is the civil rights issue of our era and many
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:36.240]  people are saying that there is rand paul taking the
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:41.200]  grilling from wolf blitzer and really breaking it down paul your thoughts
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:47.680]  well people like wolf blitzer know that to um forward an intellectual argument
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:51.840]  about something like the civil rights act would take hours
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:56.480]  you know it's an academic debate he knows that he's got three or four minutes on
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:00.560]  there and that in wolf blitzer's case he needs to
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:04.480]  dumb it down and the overall implication that they're
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:08.640]  trying to keep on rand paul is that he hates black people he's going to
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:12.560]  repeal the civil rights act he's going to discriminate against
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:17.120]  minorities and disabled people and that's what they want to put out there
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:21.520]  i mean you can go and read the fathers of the libertarian movement and
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  professors in universities today who carefully explain
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:29.920]  where rand paul is coming from on this but they know that the majority of
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:33.120]  people watching a three or four minute cnn news
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  segment aren't going to do that so they boil it down they dumb it down
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.040]  and they throw it out as a smear and that's exactly what's happened over the
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:43.600]  past few days and if you listen to what he says
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:48.160]  especially at the end he's actually four minorities being able to
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:52.000]  pick their own schooling if anybody's ever been into the inner city of new
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.520]  york of course it's largely minority based and he's
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:58.320]  saying well those kids should have a choice at a real
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:02.000]  education and the majority do not in talking about that as a real
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.600]  civil rights issue that's not on the headlines paul
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:09.920]  well exactly and i mean he's got nothing to defend himself against that's what
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:14.160]  rand paul said and it's exactly right because this has been contrived
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:17.920]  um by the corporate media they tried it with
[1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:21.840]  you know calling it a racist country called elitist just because he had a
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:26.000]  victory celebration there that didn't work so now they're going at it from
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:30.080]  this angle and the corporate media has lost most of its
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:34.640]  credibility so these kind of smears don't work anymore
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:37.520]  which is what they need to understand which is why
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:40.640]  they're flip-flopping from one to another and now
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:45.520]  it seems to have moved on to this rand paul went on the alex joneshow a few
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:48.320]  times and that supposedly makes him evil now
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:52.560]  so it looks like they're going to try and run with that one next but again
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:56.560]  it's like it's like flogging a dead horse rand paul
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:00.240]  and his father ron paul have repeatedly said that
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:05.600]  a significant amount of bare supporters are alex jones listeners
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:10.080]  or at least they're familiar and embrace the same ideals and the information
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:12.960]  that alex talks about every day on his show
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:19.200]  so to try and you know undermine rand paul's support base by associating him
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:24.400]  with alex jones and the information alex jones puts out when most of rand paul's
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:28.240]  supporters have similar beliefs is just
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:32.880]  completely asinine and it won't work it'll fall flat on its face
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:37.840]  well absolutely but that won't stop them from trying i want to shift gears
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:40.640]  and talk a little bit about what's happening
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:44.720]  with google this one is out of the guardian google keeps street view
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:49.120]  uk wi-fi data as privacy group seeks legal action if you were listening on
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:51.840]  wednesday i stood in for alex for about an hour
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:55.920]  and went over the fact that google over the past several years they're not
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:42:59.360]  saying how many years we're using their street view
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:04.800]  camera devices their little cars there to take all the wireless data and store
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:08.160]  it all they were taking open source information and storing it in their
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.320]  data mining operation but then they said it was an accident paul it was all
[1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:15.520]  accidental but anybody who knows anything about computers knows to take
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:19.520]  information and to store it requires hardware and software and i've had
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:22.720]  people email me and say those are just cameras on the top of the car
[1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:26.880]  yeah they're cameras but they're also admitting to data mining so this article
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:29.840]  right here a google street view car on coronation street
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:33.600]  it's not clear whether the rover's return has wi-fi
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:37.440]  of course it does google is to retain data captured from the uk wireless
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:40.800]  home networks were carrying out its street view mapping until it receives
[1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:44.960]  more specific instructions from the uk information commissioner it said
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:47.440]  today but if you were listening on wednesday they said they
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:51.680]  told them to destroy the data immediately they're not going to do so
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:56.880]  regulation of in vestigatory powers act r.i.p.a for unlawful interception of
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:01.120]  users data and the group may try to go to the police to investigate the
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:05.040]  situation it absolutely should be a criminal investigation into why
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:08.560]  google is taking everybody's information without their permission
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:11.920]  google is already facing criminal investigations in germany over its
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:15.040]  capture of the data from open wi-fi networks and faces further
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:19.040]  investigations from a number of european countries for possible breaches
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:22.640]  of data protection laws and possibly computer hacking
[1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:26.400]  it has deleted it says it has deleted the data that was collected in ireland
[1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:29.920]  denmark and austria according to those countries which it wishes
[1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:33.280]  uh... that means there cannot be any threat of prosecution to those countries
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:37.040]  as any evidence for the court case is unavailable so they saw that they might
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:39.520]  be prosecuted in those countries and apparently
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:42.880]  dumped the data in a statement released on friday the company said
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:45.600]  following requests from the irish danish and austrian data protection
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:47.760]  authorities we can confirm that we have deleted
[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:50.960]  payload data identified as coming in from those
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:54.080]  countries they're also saying that they got rid of their belgium france
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:57.520]  italy spain germany switzerland and check republic information
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:01.680]  notice the united states isn't there and if you read the headline yesterday
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:05.680]  it was the ceo eric schmidt who we have invisible empire
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:09.520]  talking about a new world order saying no harm
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:14.800]  no foul as if this is a basketball uh... game no it's a data mining issue and i'm
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:18.240]  going to close it with this german prosecutors have requested access to one
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:20.400]  of the hard drives used in the data gathering though
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:24.160]  google has so far refused see they won't tell you
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:28.080]  what they're taking paul what's your view on this and why isn't this a huge
[1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:33.360]  story in the united states it isn't a huge story because
[1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:38.640]  google's um reputation as a respecter of privacy which of course
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:45.040]  is a misnomer um they they worked with it was announced
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:48.560]  in 2008 more than two years ago but
[1:45:48.560 --> 1:45:52.160]  google was working with the cia to gather intelligence
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:57.360]  inside the u.s. you know that google was founded with the aid of cia money
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:02.080]  so of course google is a mass depository of data about
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:06.000]  americans and about anyone that uses it and the government's going to use that
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.760]  data and the government's working with google to use that data
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:14.160]  it's like facebook again it's just a math government depository
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:17.360]  anyone who still has a facebook profile but
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:21.760]  they keep any personal information whatsoever on it out of their mind
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:25.600]  you had the instant messages come out last week
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:30.640]  um from the founder and ceo of facebook mark buckerberg
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:35.840]  where he's talking to someone about people on facebook people using
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.920]  facebook and he said quote i have over four
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:43.280]  thousand emails pictures addresses sns and this is
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:46.880]  just after it started and his friend responds
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:51.280]  what how did you manage that one buckerberg people just submitted it i
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:56.960]  don't know why they trust me dumb efforts so that's the ceo and
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:03.200]  founder of facebook laughing about and swearing at people who
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:07.360]  submit their personal information which he now has control of
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:13.120]  and now we learn that again like google facebook is openly working with the cia
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:17.200]  with all this information about people's personal life
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:20.960]  right at their fingertips exactly it's going to create
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:25.760]  a system where they can really database and profile people on another level and
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:29.120]  then sell those databases and profiles to private
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:32.480]  companies so you won't even have to go on facebook to see the little ad on the
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:35.440]  side they're going to match your ip address with your
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:38.400]  facebook account and you'll literally go to any search engine
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:41.440]  or website and you'll see those types of ads and it goes
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:44.240]  much much further than that again in invisible empire
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:48.240]  i go over hepting verses atn t where the largest
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:53.440]  telecommunications companies 99.9 percent of the telecommunication companies
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.840]  in this country are taking all the data and storing them with
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:02.320]  norris insight systems for the federal government and they are
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:05.760]  being keyed up through echelon carnivore and other systems
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.360]  to database you to profile you and this is just another step
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:14.480]  in the cashless society control grid that they're trying to put into place paul
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:18.160]  well exactly and it is it's not just a privacy issue
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:21.920]  it's um it's a harassment issue because
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:25.200]  as we're moving towards this minority report style
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:29.040]  world where advertising and promotional
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:34.080]  media becomes more and more invasive you know now they have magazines that play
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:38.400]  videos when you're opening and reading just the standard magazine
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:42.480]  they have systems whereby if you drive by
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:46.480]  certain um places on the highway where they have
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:50.960]  transmitters they can sense what radio station you're listening to
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:55.760]  and display ads based on those tastes in music or references
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:58.960]  um when you list the bands that you like on your
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:03.760]  facebook page targeted advertising based on that information that you
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:08.720]  submitted is then directed towards you so it's not just a question of
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:12.240]  your personal life being exposed and being known
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:17.360]  it's the harassment that will follow as a result of this minority report style
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:21.760]  invasive advertising which will all run off the information that you gave them
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:24.800]  in the first place and it's not just that
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:28.080]  years ago the fbi announced that they would be
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:32.000]  trolling myspace and facebook with with fake profiles
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.680]  to basically entrap people uh for instance i remember the story
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:41.520]  last year at a high school prom party in new jersey they had some uh just police
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:44.240]  officers infiltrate one of the groups say hey this
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:48.000]  is where the party is going to be and they went and busted a post
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.360]  prom party via facebook people need to realize
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:55.440]  this is already in use by law enforcement
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.400]  well exactly i mean it's no surprise because the the entire internet was a
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.200]  nsa database that's how it began and it hasn't really changed from that in
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:10.080]  2010 so people need to be more aware than ever
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:14.240]  about personal information i still find it amazing
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:18.800]  that people will post photographs of their own children and
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:22.880]  you know photographs of their own personal life completely openly on the
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:26.560]  internet for everyone in the world to view i mean if they value their
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:30.240]  privacy so little then you know they shouldn't be
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:33.360]  surprised when all these scandals emerged about
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:37.040]  how their data was being sold by the government and between different
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:40.640]  corporations so it's a two-way street
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:44.080]  it's the alex joneshow i am jason bermas sitting in we're going to come back
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:48.560]  with one final segment with paul joseph watson of prisonplanet.com
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:54.720]  we're streaming live over at info wars dot com and prisonplanet.tv
[1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:04.560]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:08.320]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you
[1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:11.840]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:14.560]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:17.840]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:20.640]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:23.760]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:27.280]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:30.880]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:34.560]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:37.360]  way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:41.840]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:48.640]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365

[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:58.880]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:03.280]  survivalseedbank.com when you hear the words water purification
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:07.040]  what comes to mind if it's burky water purification systems this

[1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:19.040]  your take on calderone earlier in the week
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:23.040]  getting in front of the white house lawn with president barack obama denouncing
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:26.080]  the arizona law president barack obama getting up there saying
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:30.160]  well i think the law has the potential to be used to
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:35.920]  racially profile and then now getting in front of our congress and receiving a
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:40.320]  standing ovation as he says yeah we're going to ban the guns
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:43.920]  and uh we're just going to make everybody legal here uh it's despicable what
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:46.400]  arizona is doing
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:51.280]  yeah i wrote an article this morning about congressman
[1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:55.840]  mclintock's response to what calderon said and how he was
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:01.360]  cheered on by the democrat in congress and he basically quoted
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:04.960]  president teddy roosevelt from about a hundred years ago
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:10.400]  um on how immigration was originally defined and how immigrants
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:14.640]  um should emigrate into the united states and how it should be done
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:19.840]  and the full quotes in the article and teddy roosevelt basically said
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:23.200]  we only have room for one flag the american flag
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:27.200]  we only have room for one language and that is the english language
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:31.360]  and yet we were forced to witness um a few days ago
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:37.920]  michelle obama the first lady um who visited a school in new hampshire
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:43.840]  dancing around with these children a mexican flag inside a u.s school
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.160]  um while the children told her about how their parents were
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:53.520]  illegal aliens so i find it absolutely abhorrent that you've got
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:59.520]  these um radical racial liberation theology people who are
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:04.160]  hyped up with this la raza coming into the u.s illegally
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:08.560]  um flying the mexican flag tearing down the u.s flag
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:12.720]  and now even you have students on campus getting kicked off wearing
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:16.960]  t-shirts with the american flag on and it's completely
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:22.160]  180 to what the original scope and purpose of what
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:26.960]  uh rational immigration into america was supposed to be about
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:31.120]  um so it's a disgrace that a president calling a president
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:36.160]  lightly he wasn't even he basically lost the election and he got in by hook or
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:41.840]  by crook um so an unelected dictator lecturing
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:45.200]  the united states congress and the american people
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:48.880]  about their own domestic laws and then
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:52.160]  going further and attacking the second amendment
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:56.320]  and calling for the assault weapons ban to be reinstated
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:57:01.280]  um and mclinton called it an outrage and that's exactly what it is
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:05.040]  absolutely an outrage and to go back to what michelle obama did
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:08.400]  they are playing on the dumbed down masses
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:11.680]  heartstrings by showing you this cute little girl and
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:15.920]  my mommy says we don't have papers does that mean i'm going to get taken away
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:18.800]  and then michelle obama says don't worry sweetie
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:22.560]  that's one of the things we have to fix and we're going to fix that don't worry
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:28.640]  i was blown away and you're seeing this all over the news
[1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:32.800]  yeah but then look at what happens if you don't have papers in mexico
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:37.280]  you know you get thrown in jail i mean just look look at the picture at the
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:42.400]  top of my article today um people who visit mexico say
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:45.520]  and we quoted another one who was the resident of arizona
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:50.640]  in the article yesterday but basically you can't travel for 20 minutes without
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:54.560]  getting stopped and searched by goons in military
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:58:00.240]  outfits with guns so that's how uh mexico treats visitors to
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:04.240]  mexico whereas you know you just walk straight across the border into the
[1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:07.280]  united states and you can get a welfare
[1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:10.240]  you can get a job you can get all these civil rights
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.280]  and just for enforcing an immigration policy that's already on the books in
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:19.120]  arizona um suddenly you know everybody's in
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:23.040]  outrage about it and again it's a contrived media spectacle
[1:58:23.040 --> 1:58:26.720]  the key thing about it is according to all the polls
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:30.720]  and i linked to one in the article yesterday the majority
[1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:35.360]  of hispanic african-americans and asian-americans
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:43.120]  the poor enforcing the current immigration laws that are on the book

[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.320]  and i have a couple of questions for bob myself i was only able to scan over the
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:39.120]  news for about an hour today i was out of town
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:43.520]  last night so there are a couple headlines that i'd like to go over
[2:01:43.520 --> 2:01:50.720]  including this one right here fdic problem banks at 775 a
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:56.960]  total of 775 banks or one tenth of all us banks were on the fdic's
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:01.040]  list of problem institutions in the first quarter as bad loans in the
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:04.400]  commercial real estate market weighed on bank
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:07.920]  balance sheets and it's probably much worse than that but of course
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:12.160]  the the one tenth the 10 percent they're talking about are the smaller banks
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:15.520]  that will be consolidated consolidated into
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:21.840]  the big boys what's your take bob well first of all the figures over 2000
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:25.680]  the real figure i know that because i have somebody who attends those meetings
[2:02:25.680 --> 2:02:30.160]  who leaks the stuff to me second of all there's 2000 banks
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:32.720]  that the controller of the currencies office
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:36.400]  has their employees in and they're actually running the banks
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:40.160]  and eventually all of those banks will probably go under
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:43.920]  72 banks officially have gone under this year but they don't count
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:47.920]  how many branches they had many of them have 50 or 300 or
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:52.320]  whatever it is branches so it's been fairly extensive as far as
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:58.240]  job loss is concerned and uh... i think that there's a good possibility
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:00.800]  that two to three hundred will go under this year
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:06.800]  it's hard to tell uh... the which way they're going to go on it as far as
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:10.720]  whether they're going to have submerges uh... and in a very often they don't
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:15.440]  even announce submerges uh... the fdic probably has about 90
[2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:19.760]  billion dollars including the three years that the banks have paid ahead on
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:23.440]  their dues uh... that probably will ask them
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:27.040]  till the end of the year maybe into the first quarter that next year
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:31.280]  and they're going to be broke again and so it's not very good but
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:35.280]  though those are the numbers on that so we're going to see more revolving
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:38.560]  bailouts once this comes out once we have a couple banks go under some more
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:44.000]  consolidation of power they'll say the fdic is broke and needs more help
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:49.040]  well uh... under the bill that was just passed in the senate which must go
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:53.440]  to conference in the house uh... the
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:57.840]  federal reserve instead of being audited like they should be
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:00.960]  is going to have one audit and it's going to be
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:05.200]  uh... uh... uh... it's going to be
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:08.960]  restricted to just one certain area and that's it
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:12.880]  and so uh... what they're doing is throwing the public a bone
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:17.600]  and within that bill the fdic is supposed to
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:21.760]  take over the control of the current currency the fdic
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:28.160]  the fdc the cftc and a new group called
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:33.840]  consumer uh... something or other to protect the consumers
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:37.760]  and then they also have another group that they've
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:40.880]  formed under that hold right there bob we're going to come back to you on the
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:43.040]  other side is the alex joneshow we're going to go
[2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:47.040]  over this new senate bill that passed 59 to 39

[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:24.080]  and we've got bob Chapman on the line i want to read some of this article senate
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:28.800]  passes financial reform bill vote represents a major policy victory for
[2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:31.760]  president obama and i was out of town last night so
[2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:34.640]  i was kind of a late coming in i didn't get to see this until
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:38.480]  last minute bob's gonna break down what this bill is really about but let me
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:41.920]  read the first paragraph for you prodded by national anger at wall street the
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:44.400]  senate and the senate on or i'm sorry the senate on
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:47.600]  thursday passed the most far-reaching restraints on big banks
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:51.280]  since the great depression in its broad sweep the massive bill would touch
[2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:55.520]  wall street ceo's for the first time first time high home buyers high flying
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:00.400]  traders and small town lenders and they're going to pass 59 to 39 but bob
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:07.920]  what does this really mean it makes a monopoly out of the fed reserve
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:14.560]  a private corporation and it will include as i pointed out earlier
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:18.960]  uh... really escaped from audit for all intents and purposes
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:23.200]  and the absorption of the controller of the currency
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:26.480]  and uh... the fdic the scc
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:33.440]  uh... the cftc and uh... this new consumer protection agency and
[2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:37.520]  a stability board that they'll have or something to that effect
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:42.800]  um... and also uh... they want reporting on derivatives
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:45.600]  that trading over the counter market to be
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:50.480]  a transparent like other kinds of derivatives that are now
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:54.480]  traded on exchanges and have been since 1972
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:58.800]  um... wall street doesn't like that uh... they
[2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:03.040]  didn't say anything and there was no discussion
[2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:05.840]  over the after about the uh... of the uh...
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:10.080]  fanny may and freddy mac and their problems and a possible
[2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:14.000]  takeover or something to be done with them
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  they discussed glass steel reintroduction
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.720]  and that went by the wayside now let's talk about glass steel for a moment
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.320]  what would have happened if they had reintroduced glass steel in your
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:29.520]  opinion i think i would have solved a great
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:32.960]  many of the problems that we have today it was probably one of the most
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:36.320]  brilliant pieces of legislation at the right time
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:41.200]  1931 and it stood up all those years
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:45.120]  and what it is essentially is a wall between
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:49.680]  the banks and the brokerage firms and the insurance companies
[2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:53.360]  uh... they used to be all together and they had trusts and things like that
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:56.960]  and when the market went down in the thirties uh... it was a disaster because
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:11:00.480]  of the concentration and the interconnectivity
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:04.960]  of these banks with one another and the brokerage houses and all of that
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:09.920]  and that's why they broke them up and uh... they wanted they wanted to do that
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:12.400]  again they also wanted to address the
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:16.080]  too big to fail they didn't do anything about that
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:20.720]  and uh... the people in the house are very disturbed
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:24.400]  that hr 1207 which was the house bill
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:28.560]  326 members voted for it uh... that was
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:34.800]  decimated in the senate committee and so this bill is not going to easily go
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:39.200]  through the house whether there's a lot of democrats in there or not
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:43.920]  and because of some of the the democrats are fiscally conservative
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:47.680]  and so we haven't heard the end of this yet but i want to add something here
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:52.640]  that you didn't expect and that is on may six we saw the
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:57.440]  the market drop a thousand points and i explained in the forecaster
[2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:03.120]  why that happened and it was these black box trade box traders
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:07.280]  using the algorithms uh... and hedge funds
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:11.280]  that deliberately knocked the market down and they were trying to tell the
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:13.920]  senate if you don't do what we want you to do
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:18.080]  we're going to destroy this market now they've done it again in the last
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:21.760]  five or six days because they wanted to
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:26.720]  again get the senate to do as little as possible about
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:30.000]  the things that the senate was supposed to do
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.560]  and what wall street and banking didn't want now it's going to the house
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:40.080]  and that's why you see what you're seeing going on they're rigging the market
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:43.440]  let me stop you right there we've got alex jones on the line to throw in
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:46.080]  his two cents alex
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:50.160]  yeah how could i uh... how could i miss a day with bob chairman and i was just
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:53.440]  listening to show absolutely they've got to pass this in the house
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:56.240]  this isn't just alex jones or bob chairman telling you this this has been
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:59.600]  on the associated press but they're reporting like it's a good thing in
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:03.680]  the bill it allows the federal government
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:07.920]  to live time track every credit card purchase everything you're doing in
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:12.160]  your bank account you know before they could just randomly dial in or
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:16.240]  you have the bank spy on you this is now everything you do transparent
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:19.360]  uh... to the government and it gives all these goldman sacks jp morgan
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:22.560]  regulators that are all the regulation positions
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:26.960]  the power to come in and uh... takeover regional banks local banks
[2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:30.640]  healthy banks and that's what the head of the texas banking association a
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:34.560]  month ago uh... basically you wrote a big editorial saying this is a takeover
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:38.240]  of healthy banks that aren't involved in the derivative so what bob said is
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:39.200]  absolutely right
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:44.240]  this is a expansion a monopoly of the federal reserve offshore power
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.160]  this is what the bankers always do they create the crisis
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:51.840]  and then they sell something to the public that oh this will get the big
[2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:55.600]  bankers this will just like nineteen thirteen takeover
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:00.560]  was passed as a supposed way to bring the bankers
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:03.760]  uh... to justice when when they were the ones that were engineering it
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:08.160]  so it's problem reaction solution we've got to beat this in the house
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:11.120]  uh... it is just a giant power grab and and
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:13.920]  so i thought bob to speak to that and i'm gonna
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:17.120]  uh... let you guys go but also what bob talk about what's happening in the
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:18.640]  global market
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:20.160]  uh... right now
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:24.480]  uh... and uh... you know what he sees with the uh... serious
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:27.760]  chance of a financial meltdown robini and others are saying
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:31.120]  at least a twenty percent drop in the next month of the stock market
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:34.720]  uh... bobber saying a ninety percent chance china's going to blow which will
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:35.680]  bring us down
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:38.160]  i mean these are crazy times to be alive
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:40.880]  and uh... jason great job bob chatman good hearing it
[2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:43.440]  uh... go ahead and you guys take back over
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:48.400]  we had a senator tom harkin discussing this legislation now he voted for it
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:52.320]  and then he said but i i wish we could have gotten the proposal to reinstate
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:54.400]  the glass deagle act through
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:58.640]  is he being genuine or is he really just playing both sides of the field do you
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:14:59.920]  think bob
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:02.160]  uh... that's hard for me to say
[2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:06.160]  and this is a subjective answer but uh... knowing is a politician he's playing
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:07.680]  both sides
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:10.400]  and you know he did one thing and says another
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:13.120]  you know what's what they do not what they say
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:16.240]  and uh... but they just generally speaking
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:20.080]  uh... well i think we're on our way and this is a side
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:20.880]  note
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:23.600]  uh... with the elections that are being held
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:26.320]  uh... the primaries particularly
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:29.520]  uh... a very positive in our direction
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:32.160]  and uh... i i just hope in
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:37.920]  in november that people stampede to the polls and vote out every incumbent
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:42.720]  but the exception of a handful and if we can do that we get a shot within the
[2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:43.920]  system
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:47.840]  of uh... changing things and changing them dramatically
[2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:51.840]  uh... that doesn't happen uh... it's not going to be easy
[2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:55.280]  uh... getting back to uh... the
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:59.040]  uh... financial experience that we're going through right now
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:01.200]  uh... most people won't come out
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:04.160]  and say what i am and max guys are
[2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:06.880]  uh... in particular say because we both been
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:09.920]  market people so to speak for many years
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:13.280]  and the truth about what these people are up to
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:17.200]  and it uh... it is amazing
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.600]  that the power and the pressure
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:24.000]  that they're uh... the wall street in banking are bringing upon
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.600]  the senate you saw they did they did they did virtually nothing
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:31.040]  and they're gonna try to apply the same for pressure to the house
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:33.600]  and they tell these people that i should see the market
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:36.160]  and you want a couple of thousand point floor
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:38.080]  we'll put it there
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:41.360]  if you don't do what we do it's extortion
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:43.840]  and you think they're just going to continue to do this again and again
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:44.800]  again
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:46.720]  i mean where's the end game when is enough
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:49.520]  power enough as alex talked about this is yet
[2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:53.040]  more consolidation of power for the federal reserve we saw that
[2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:56.480]  consolidation of power over a year ago at the g-20
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:00.320]  when all of a sudden the federal reserve the sec were under the imf and
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:04.640]  world bank i mean how much further can they take this problem
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:07.600]  well they're going to take it as far as they can because they want
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:11.840]  a one-world dictatorial government they want to enslave everybody
[2:17:11.840 --> 2:17:14.640]  and they wanted to do this for a thousand years
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:18.160]  and so they're going to keep on doing it and that's why if we can
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:23.120]  go in and take over congress so to speak for the people
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:26.720]  and instead of these vested interests then we can
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:29.840]  stop them from doing what they're doing i mean
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:35.040]  flash trading which is front-running has always been illegal
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:42.240]  and the sec stands there and allows 17 major firms with black boxes with
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:48.320]  algorithms to beat the public to death
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:53.040]  in nanosecond trading right in the new york stock exchange
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:57.600]  it's incredible second of all they allow naked shooting
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:03.440]  and it's illegal but they still do it and derivatives
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:08.160]  are a disaster waiting to happen they shouldn't be any derivatives
[2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:12.880]  unless they're on a listed exchange they shouldn't be
[2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:17.920]  the chi x exchange which most of you have never even heard of
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:24.080]  which is doing these deep uh i figure what they call them i write about it
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:28.640]  all the time but i can't remember deep pools as they're called
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:33.520]  and they don't report to anybody i mean this is incredible
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.040]  they're trading billions of dollars of shares every day in these dark pools
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:43.520]  and nobody knows what they're doing well i think that's why it's so important
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:47.360]  that we need to get ourselves into a position where we can take
[2:18:47.360 --> 2:18:50.240]  care of ourselves financially if the stock market
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:54.560]  completely dies if the dollar is devalued further on the other side
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:58.640]  i want to talk about uh china revaluation would hurt us world banks and
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:01.840]  that is the i believe chief economist of the world bank
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:05.840]  actually admitting if they revalue uh china's currency it's going to hurt us
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:09.600]  big time i want to get your take on that but i also want to implore people to
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:13.200]  protect themselves to get into gold and silver and hard
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:17.440]  currencies that have retained value for thousands of years over at the

[2:19:28.800 --> 2:19:32.000]  completely incredible to me the way the media

[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:40.960]  we're getting hard on wall street when in fact all they're doing
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:45.200]  is consolidating power into a world dictatorial

[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:17.520]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:20.640]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:23.760]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:08.800]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:12.400]  we are back live it's the alex jones show i am jason bermas sitting in we've
[2:24:12.400 --> 2:24:16.640]  got bob Chapman on the line and before i get
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:20.560]  into china revaluation would hurt us world banks
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:24.080]  lin that's the chief economist for the world bank actually admitting if they
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:27.520]  revalue china's currency it is going to hurt us here
[2:24:27.520 --> 2:24:32.000]  at home i want to talk about solutions and how people can really protect
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:35.760]  themselves from this very faltering economy some of the other
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:40.560]  headlines out there are dow dips below 10 000 points today
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:45.280]  and uh i'm sorry it stocks wobble after dow dips below 10 000 europe's
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:48.000]  debt woes raise concerns that global recovery
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:52.480]  could still be far away and remember we were already supposed to have this
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:56.400]  global recovery and oh the recession is over but now it's a double
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:00.000]  dip recession and we dare not talk depression
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:06.160]  bob how can people protect themselves well i think um the most important
[2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:10.560]  thing is your job and most people uh in the families
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:14.080]  today that are employed have the wife and the husband
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:18.400]  working and you should diligently try your best to keep your job
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:23.600]  and in the meantime you should see to having freeze dried and dehydrated food
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:27.200]  because if you lose your job at least you can eat
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:30.240]  and if there's emergencies you'll have them on hand
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:36.880]  a water filter if eventually we have uh the delivery of a water system breakdown
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:40.240]  and you should have something in your home to protect it
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:43.840]  uh sometimes a lot of bad people running around and
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:50.000]  i don't have to expand on that and um if you have investments we have if you
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:53.840]  have money left over uh then you should be out of the stock
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:57.760]  market except for golden silver shears out of bonds
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:01.280]  out of the commodity market because most people don't
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:04.960]  really shouldn't be there unless they're professionals because 95 percent of the
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:08.160]  people who go into the foreign exchange market in the commodity
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:13.440]  market lose money and uh you should only have in
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:17.440]  of the bank uh three years supply of operating funds
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:21.920]  three months supply of operating funds for business six months
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:26.560]  you should have no cds you should have no cash value
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:30.320]  life insurance policies you should have term policies
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:34.960]  and you should not have annuities they're all invested in the market and in
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:38.720]  bonds interest rates are definitely going to go up sooner or later
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:43.360]  so the value of bonds will go down so it cancels out all of those
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:48.560]  kinds of investments in this kind of an atmosphere the only place to go to
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:52.800]  is golden silver related assets and that's really the
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:57.280]  the package and it's as simple as that and anybody who has
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:00.320]  problems with it all we have to do is email me
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:03.920]  and i'll tell them what to do it doesn't cost them anything
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:07.040]  absolutely why don't you tell people about some of the great deals over at
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:13.200]  mitis resources right now well mitis has been offering off and on
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:19.440]  a special where a few purchase one uh trencher swiss frank
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:23.040]  is usually the coin uh the last price i think i got was

[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:31.280]  something like that and if you buy that coin you get a free
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:34.720]  one year subscription to the international forecaster
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:40.640]  either by email or surface mail and it's the best deal i've ever heard it
[2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:45.040]  heard of a pet pet pays for me for the publication
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:51.280]  and so uh this is a real deal and a lot of people are taking advantage of it
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:56.880]  and i think if you don't uh i think you're sure changing yourself
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:02.640]  this publication tells you everything that you need to know every week
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.840]  well not quite everything uh alex tells you the rest
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:11.520]  but anyway it's a great it's a great offering and you should take advantage
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:14.240]  of it uh do you have a phone number there for them
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:18.240]  yeah i should do it's one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:21.200]  or a two two three seven that's one eight hundred six eight six
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:25.600]  two two three seven you guys also have walking liberty half dollars at nine
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:29.600]  dollars and seventy five cents and of course the british sovereign gold coins
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:32.800]  at three hundred and thirty two dollars and twelve cents
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:36.560]  and gold and silver have been doing especially well in the past few weeks
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:40.640]  haven't they they haven't even though the markets come down
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:44.080]  um i'm telling my subscribers the correction
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:47.680]  uh i think it's almost over in the golden silver area
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:51.040]  because i'm seeing short covering starting yesterday i'm seeing more of it
[2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:55.200]  today my goal is down about eleven dollars right now in the gold stocks
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:28:59.920]  or either even or up a little or down a little and that's an indication
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:03.920]  you've got on a short term an intermediate term probably a sold out
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:08.640]  market but that market was attacked in the same way the other markets
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:10.960]  were i mean they couldn't have gold going up
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:14.880]  well they had the market going down so they bopped it for the last few days
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:20.080]  another thing is the long gold options expire on
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:22.960]  tuesday and the writers of those options are
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:26.640]  commercials which are banks and they don't want them
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:31.760]  options to expire in the money and so they're knocking the market down too
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:36.720]  so it'll be over by Tuesday it's the alex jones show i am jason bermus

[2:30:11.280 --> 2:30:14.960]  which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:18.000]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our

[2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:11.360]  again that number one eight hundred four zero nine five six three three
[2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:14.720]  we are back at the alex jones show i'm jason burma sitting and we're talking
[2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:18.320]  to bob cabin of the international forecaster
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:21.760]  dot com and we're going to take your calls on the topic
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:25.280]  of the economy no chupacabras no spacemen
[2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:29.360]  no johnny nonsense let's keep it to topic but before that
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:34.240]  i want to get your take on the uh chief economist for the world bank
[2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:38.800]  uh lin justin yifu lin saying that if they revalue
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:42.480]  china's currency it's going to hurt this country and we've known this
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:46.480]  but let's talk about the implications if it's actually done
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:53.520]  well since the mid-1990s the preferred method of keeping down inflation
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:33:57.840]  any united states has been the importation of goods from other countries
[2:33:57.840 --> 2:34:01.600]  but can particularly from china i mean you go in the store virtually everything
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:06.400]  indians made in china and these slave labor countries
[2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:10.160]  were able to deliver cheaper products and they all
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.600]  suppress the value of their currencies no matter what they say
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:17.280]  that's what they were up to and that's where i believe we need tariffs and
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:20.960]  goods and services like we used to have in order to set
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:24.400]  a level playing field if they want to do business in the united states
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:30.640]  but the point here is that the chinese currency is way undervalued
[2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:33.920]  and if they raise it the exports to the united states
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:37.440]  will be more expensive and that's coming at a time
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:42.160]  when the dollar is expensive and the dollar shouldn't be trading where it's
[2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:45.920]  at uh whether the euro should be where it's at
[2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:51.440]  is up to debate but the point is the dollar doesn't deserve to be as strong
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:57.040]  as it is on the usdx index it just went from 74 up to 85
[2:34:57.040 --> 2:35:01.920]  in a four month period which is really insanity and that means
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:07.440]  that the balance of payments deficit in the united states is going to skyrocket
[2:35:07.440 --> 2:35:10.480]  because they're not going to be able to sell very easily
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:15.920]  in foreign countries because their currency has gone up in value
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:19.840]  so you put the two of them together and the united states is going to pay
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:27.520]  dearly for a revaluation or a stronger chinese currency
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:31.440]  now what are we talking about here i mean how much of our dollars
[2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:35.280]  purchasing power is going to be lost are we going to see
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:40.560]  uh things raised by 25 30 percent perhaps double in price in this country
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:46.320]  no no i don't think so i would say five to ten percent
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:49.840]  so it'll be gradual they'll hit us up for five to ten percent right now and
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:52.720]  then maybe five to ten percent they really don't want to do that
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:56.320]  okay because they would rather imprison the slaves
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:35:59.440]  and and try to make them work for the same amount of money
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:04.640]  or less and keep the market and that's really what they're all about
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:07.760]  it's a command economy it's a communist economy
[2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:12.480]  and it's a totalitarian economy which everybody seems to forget
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:15.520]  i mean these are the people at least to chase all over the world
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:19.440]  and spy on and kill them and we don't do that anymore
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:23.760]  we play ball with them i mean what an insanity but anyway
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:28.880]  uh china has got terrible problems they have a stock market that's falling
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.160]  25 percent since last september which incidentally we
[2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:36.160]  predicted on this program and the housing market
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:40.000]  is a bubble it's about to blow up and uh
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:44.480]  they still have 30 million unemployed the only thing i can see that the good
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:47.440]  that's happening in china is people are taking
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:50.800]  their foreign exchange and they're trading it in
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:54.800]  for gold and silver however the working conditions
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:59.360]  in china are completely deplorable go check out walmart the high cost of
[2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:01.440]  low prices just to see that but we also have
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:04.560]  new death at iphone factory as chinese worker becomes
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:08.880]  eighth fatality this year and they always keep this hush hush they say the
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:12.160]  people that die are often committing suicide but just a month ago
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:16.880]  we ran the story in which microsoft's subsidiary company there
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:20.560]  everybody was asleep there was about i don't know 30 40
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:24.960]  workers in there and they're working them 14 hour shifts seven days
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:28.640]  a week some of these people just can't handle it i cannot
[2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:33.120]  imagine a system like china coming into the united states
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:38.880]  where we're literally slaves of the political elite the workforce i just
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:41.680]  can't tell you how deplorable it is there and then you have people
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:45.360]  promoting china like it's the best thing since breakfast bob and like you said
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:48.800]  we've been trading with them now openly for 20 plus years and really
[2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:52.720]  encouraging this behavior that's right
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:56.240]  and so what does it say about our government i think we could call it
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:00.960]  corporate as fascist it's just two types of socialism and they seem to be
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:04.320]  getting along fine as long as it lines the park
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:08.640]  pockets of the wealthy transnational conglomerates and
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.760]  the members of congress and the elites who give orders to our government and
[2:38:13.760 --> 2:38:17.680]  most governments in the world and i briefly cover this in my latest film
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:22.080]  invisible empire a new world order defined when i'm going over the bush
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:27.280]  senior era of a quote unquote new world order we go to a senate hearing where
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:31.600]  joe biden chris dodd and others are asking james
[2:38:31.600 --> 2:38:37.120]  baker about china and its role in what oh the new world order because that's
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:40.000]  what george bush was talking about he was talking about china's role in the
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:43.120]  new world order and james baker says look this is a nation
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:46.880]  we're going to have to work with because of their size and because of their
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:50.800]  economy we just don't have a choice we're going to go to some calls for bob
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:54.560]  chapman of the international forecaster dot com right now
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:58.720]  ron in illinois ron online hey how's it going guys good
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:02.880]  i uh invisible empire awesome film just wanted to throw that out there for you
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:05.680]  guys thank you before i get into my question for bob
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:09.120]  i want to also say for any guys out there in florida
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:13.200]  there's a guy by the name of bruce ray riggs i can find my 30 apple sam he's
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:17.600]  running for senate good constitutionalist guys check them out okay about
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:22.480]  my question is you guys do you know any rumors circling around about the
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:25.600]  possibility of you know if everybody finding out about
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:29.200]  uh... what the federal reserves doing and i want to end the fed that there could
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:32.240]  be a shift into a possible split paradigm like
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:36.880]  something under our corporate treasury under the government itself and then
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:40.720]  just shifting power into what's called the united states treasury only a
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:45.120]  corporate body of it i haven't heard that i don't
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:49.520]  think they are attempting to do that as far as i know
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:53.440]  although it would be something that they would consider i would think
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:58.320]  uh... one of the things that i didn't mention today is my sources
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:04.160]  and new york city tell me that a class action suit of one of many
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:09.200]  is coming against jp morgan chase for rigging the silver market
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:12.640]  and uh... that ought to be quite interesting
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:16.000]  uh... because that's exactly what they've been doing and i think the defense
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:19.280]  is going to be uh... we did it for the u.s government
[2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:22.080]  under the working group for financial markets
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:26.640]  and uh... maybe they get off the hook on it but they're going to have to stop it
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:30.880]  so it's going to be a big plus for us and they're an awful lot of other
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:35.200]  lawsuits against them and other uh... big firms
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:39.520]  uh... of different kinds uh... related to fraud
[2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:42.800]  all right let's go to our next caller chris in florida you're on the line with
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:45.040]  bob shabman
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:49.760]  oh yeah jason talking about the archive where they're not accepting cash anymore
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:52.640]  and i wanted to run this by bob and have another question
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:56.320]  on that uh... there's the tender payment government
[2:40:56.320 --> 2:41:01.280]  governed under the uniform commercial code three dash six oh three so that uh
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:04.640]  it seems to specify there in the paragraph two that if you do tender
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:07.280]  payment and they refuse that tender then your
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:11.680]  obligation is discharged and perhaps that could be a way that we could
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:15.040]  use to preserve our rights to uh... take cash
[2:41:15.040 --> 2:41:19.200]  um... now the uh... the definition of lawful money i noticed recently was
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:22.000]  repealed back in january two thousand nine
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:26.720]  it was entitled twelve section 152 that says that the terms lawful money and
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:29.920]  lawful money of the united states shall be construed to mean
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:33.920]  pulled in silver coin of the united states and uh... i was wondering if bob
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:36.800]  had any news on that because it seems like that had something to do with the
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:40.720]  fdrs uh... replacing lawful money
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:44.880]  well i think i think they'd like to do that but i don't under the second
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:47.120]  stance is the world right now
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.440]  i don't see anybody accepting anything that doesn't have some goal backing
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:55.680]  and the fdrs have no goal backing they tried in the late sixties they didn't
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:58.880]  work uh... they've been trying to begin recently
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:02.560]  they're never gonna work uh... the only thing i can see that's workable
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:07.680]  is a g20 has a meeting uh... they index all the currencies
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:12.320]  into a giant index uh... they'll be weighted uh...
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:16.480]  versus the value of the uh... the country involved
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:20.800]  uh... what the rating is and they use that for an international
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:26.000]  currency for international trade only and i i see that is doable
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:29.760]  other than that i i see nothing beyond that i mean
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.000]  these people on the inside are indeed trouble
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:37.680]  before i go to chris in boston bob i want to get your take on the fact that
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:42.400]  apple is refusing cash for their ipad saying it's for security reasons so in
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:45.200]  order to buy one of these devices you have to have
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:50.320]  a credit or debit card further you know promoting this cashless society
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:54.640]  control grid of course and the idea is don't buy their
[2:42:54.640 --> 2:42:57.840]  products i'm with you all hundred and ten percent
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:43:01.600]  and i i am a big fan of apple computers
[2:43:01.600 --> 2:43:04.960]  but this is just too important whether i'll tell you if that's the game they
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:09.040]  want to play will play it don't anybody buy them
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:13.280]  and maybe they might get the message all right let's go to our next caller
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:16.240]  chris in boston chris you're online
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.640]  jason how are you what's up and by the way folks i just got this handed to me
[2:43:20.640 --> 2:43:24.720]  by uh... rob do believe it or not apple changes its tune
[2:43:24.720 --> 2:43:29.200]  it will now accept cash for the ipad at the apple store so i guess
[2:43:29.200 --> 2:43:32.800]  the uprising of the past two or three days of us reporting on this
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.120]  has now caused really an incitement and yes now they are going to take
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:40.800]  cash and that's the kind of thing we have to do we have to force these people
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:44.000]  to take cash when they say no because when they can turn down
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:48.640]  a legal tender they can do just about anything they want go ahead chris
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:51.520]  how you doing jason first of all thank you to you and alex for all you guys do
[2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:55.520]  and uh... all your movies all everything you guys are doing are great
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:43:58.640]  well thank you Bob how you doing this is this is chris i was on the Ralph Evans
[2:43:58.640 --> 2:44:03.920]  show with you from boston a couple weeks ago well no it's water town isn't it
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:08.480]  yeah but basically boston right so
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:14.240]  maybe vermont next yeah exactly too bad for uh too bad for our bruins but who
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:18.720]  cares about sports anyway um yeah so my question bob that that uh
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:22.960]  recently i've had a chance to have come up with some uh some bonus money from
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:26.640]  work and and initially i was thinking about buying some
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:31.120]  a gold coin or two but but uh when you think everything going down i mean how
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:35.200]  much sense does it make to to buy gold coins if it's gonna
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:38.480]  collapse as bad as bad as it seems i mean this is
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:43.680]  where else you're gonna go where else are you gonna go with your money
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:46.880]  that's safe and let me say this too bob when i started
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:51.200]  listening to the alex jones program in 2003 really started to become awake in
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:55.120]  2002 you could purchase an ounce of gold for under
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:58.320]  three hundred dollars we're talking about
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:01.760]  less than seven years ago and i believe it's hovering around
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:04.880]  twelve hundred dollars right now even if it takes a hit
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:09.360]  and dips below a thousand it still has inherent value
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:14.160]  as a fiat currency never will bob absolutely
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:19.360]  go ahead chris yeah i i i i i just i mean i agree with you and i
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:22.720]  mean it's a really good deal is chris you can wait and you can hedge your bets
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:26.320]  or you can invest in something that will have a value a month from now
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:29.680]  six months from now 12 months from now five years from now
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.920]  10 years from now or we can sit here and nitpick and say well it might fall a
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:38.080]  little bit oh it might be manipulated the bottom line is it's a hard currency
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:41.920]  and it has an intrinsic value for thousands of years appreciate the call
[2:45:41.920 --> 2:45:46.560]  gotta jump george in connecticut i believe george online
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:49.760]  so the sort of sort of question but not quite exactly the same i'm
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:53.280]  i'm wondering i mean you can't put everything into gold bullion is there
[2:45:53.280 --> 2:45:56.000]  any fund that has a combination of bullion and
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:01.520]  maybe a gold barric gold or uh mongold mines and things like that
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:05.600]  but but i have a back end question about that uh that
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:09.520]  flash trading how can we hit them with uh with some sort of
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:12.960]  reko act or something like this because this is criminal if they finally are
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:15.920]  being hit from all sides maybe not just in this country but in other
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:19.680]  countries with similar laws maybe we can stop them doing this and then stop
[2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:23.280]  and stop this something the tracks basically but go back to my
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:26.800]  my original question is how is there anything busy it beyond i would say
[2:46:26.800 --> 2:46:30.080]  this before before bob answers the second part as as part of the original
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:32.160]  question and maybe there's some other funds out there too
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:36.880]  i say silver you know i yeah yeah mitis also has gold
[2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:40.400]  in ira's but silver for instance you know i can get the coin
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:43.680]  that says twenty dollars on it that's announced i can get the one that says
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:48.000]  ten dollars on it that's half an ounce that could be used in any kind of daily
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:51.680]  trading as a ten dollar bill a twenty dollar bill so have a few thousand
[2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:57.840]  in that bob well as far as the sec and their
[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:02.400]  uh... non execution of the rules it's simple
[2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:05.840]  you file a class action federal suit
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:11.200]  that leaves everything out and when you have hundreds of thousands of people
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:16.000]  filing this suit or maybe a a multiplicity of suits
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.640]  they have to answer that's number one that's the way to go after them
[2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:24.880]  to stop them and that's what happened is happening to jp mogan chase right now
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:28.560]  they're going after them class action for rigging silver
[2:47:28.560 --> 2:47:31.680]  as far as the fund is concerned you don't have to do that
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:35.600]  you buy gold and silver billion in coins if you want stocks
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:38.880]  all you have to do is email me i'll tell you what to buy it doesn't cost you
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:41.920]  anything and i've been doing this for over fifty years
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:45.200]  and i used to be the largest gold so the stock broke in the world
[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:49.760]  all right let's go to our next caller don in new york don your line
[2:47:49.760 --> 2:47:53.760]  hey how are you good uh... two things actually uh...
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:56.720]  first uh... i just wanted to make the example
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:00.320]  right off the bat before my question that you know i am
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:05.520]  i applied for a uh... or a mortgage from jp morgan chase and everything went
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:09.840]  through everything was fine and uh... then they started getting into
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:14.320]  some very very personal questions they wanted to copy my divorce agreement
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:17.840]  they asked me you know personal questions and i said you have
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:21.920]  there's absolutely no bearing on my personal life
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:25.360]  you know what happened with my family or whatever
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:29.440]  that has anything to do with the bank you know with a mortgage and then uh...
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:32.880]  and then i was denied so you know i think the crux but
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:36.640]  i don't know what happened to collectors and they don't want to make the loans
[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:40.640]  well that that's probably right uh... the question is the data that they
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:44.320]  collect is being turned on it over to the united states government
[2:48:44.320 --> 2:48:47.520]  and they get a dossier on you just like they have everybody else
[2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:51.200]  yeah they're they're going crazy in my area too with it with the uh...
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:54.800]  i actually i'm i live in a suburb of manhattan
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:48:58.400]  uh... in new jersey and they're going crazy with uh... the census too like
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:01.600]  asking ridiculous questions you know even if you filled in the paperwork
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:05.280]  oh we just want to double check you know and they go in door to door
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:10.080]  um... the uh... financial question i had for you was um...
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:13.680]  you know everybody i understand uh... that
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:16.480]  gold is probably your best bet if you can uh...
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:20.400]  if you can get money together and invest in something
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:24.240]  with that the devaluation of of currency uh...
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:28.480]  how does that relate to people who have debt you know like if you own a mortgage
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:32.880]  and it devalues what what is that a good thing is that a bad thing what what can
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:36.400]  possibly happen well it's a bad thing because
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:40.320]  logically you would say if you owe a hundred thousand dollars
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:44.160]  and the dollar is devalued by two-thirds and so
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:48.960]  and you would only have to pay back thirty two thousand five hundred dollars
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:54.080]  on a hundred thousand dollar loan well the government is not interested in that
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:58.080]  they're interested in breaking you they want everybody financially an
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:00.960]  economically on their knees so they're going to tell you
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:03.680]  you're going to pay the old mortgage back i don't know how you're going to do it
[2:50:03.680 --> 2:50:06.080]  but do it if you don't we own your house
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:09.520]  all right let's take one more caller before the break eddie in new hampshire
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:13.680]  quickly hi yes sir yes
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:17.280]  hi good afternoon i just had a quick question bob a couple weeks ago i heard
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:20.160]  you mentioned that uh... you believe at some point that the stock market
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:23.680]  could go down as low as twenty five hundred to three thousand
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:28.400]  i just want to go to thirty two is the number but that's close enough okay
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:32.080]  uh... if you had to guess you believe that the client is going to be gradual
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:35.920]  how do you expect one major event that just said the plot i i think it'll be
[2:50:35.920 --> 2:50:40.880]  gradual because of the uh... ability of the united states government through the
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:44.320]  working group financial markets to manipulate the market

[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:13.440]  we're joined by bob Chapman we've got alex coming up
[2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:17.680]  in the next hour bob's gonna hang over till the five after marker with us and
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:21.120]  you were just finishing up how you don't think that the stock market collapsed
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:25.280]  and you said it could collapse to 2,800 to 3,500
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:28.720]  points will be a gradual one bob
[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:33.360]  well probably uh what is gradual uh we might have it drop three or four
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:37.360]  thousand points and rally and then go down again and so on
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:41.600]  it's hard to say nobody can predict that but it is going lower
[2:54:41.600 --> 2:54:45.120]  and there's a lot of reasons why i mean part of the reason
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:48.400]  uh for the whole world economy to be in the state it's in
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:51.920]  is because it was planned that way and if you can accept that
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:55.840]  you can see why they want the market down eventually
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:55:00.000]  and that's because they want to destroy the value that people have in the
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.880]  market they've already destroyed it in real estate in the
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:06.000]  united states both commercial and residential
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:10.800]  and uh uh this is probably the last pile of money left
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:14.720]  uh they can decimate and so they're going to take it down
[2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:18.560]  and that's why we've discussed before you gotta be in golden silver related
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:22.560]  assets you only protection all right let's go to rob

[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:40.480]  boil down of all the information we're not finding anywhere else
[2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:45.040]  uh and also obviously bob Chapman is a great example of
[2:55:45.040 --> 2:55:49.040]  all of the informed and uh really insightful
[2:55:49.040 --> 2:55:52.160]  uh people who we need to be listening to right now
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:56.160]  uh first of all i want to give a shout out to justin or whatever was his name
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:55:59.920]  yesterday that was the most refreshing thing to hear that call
[2:55:59.920 --> 2:56:03.440]  all right thank you so much sir let's go to ricky in
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:08.080]  florida ricky you're on the line man yeah hi my name is richard keen i'm a
[2:56:08.080 --> 2:56:12.960]  narrated to the movie about naked short-selling called stock shock
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:17.520]  and i had a question as far as goldman sacks
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:22.480]  the fbi put out a report about uh surgei lennikov
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:25.680]  transfer on a thousand secret codes and files
[2:56:25.680 --> 2:56:31.120]  to a german website there's some kind of connection to germany
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:35.840]  with a really don't i really don't know because you know right after that happened
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:40.080]  we got no further information nothing
[2:56:40.080 --> 2:56:43.600]  and bob to be honest i don't even know what this is could you could you go over
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:46.240]  uh basically what the college talking about here quickly because i'm not sure
[2:56:46.240 --> 2:56:48.880]  what the topic is well the color the color
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:53.040]  said that uh a gentleman where for goldman sacks
[2:56:53.040 --> 2:56:56.560]  stop working for them and before he did that
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:00.240]  these algorithms which he created he transferred it
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:06.560]  to a german company and the goldman was saying well you
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:09.920]  can't do that and we're bringing criminal charges against you rather than
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:13.920]  civil and the fbi came and picked him up and then
[2:57:13.920 --> 2:57:17.520]  he was released and we heard nothing further about it
[2:57:17.520 --> 2:57:21.600]  which tells me probably the goldman didn't have a case
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:25.360]  otherwise we would have heard about it all right let's go to our next caller
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:28.880]  jeff in michigan jeff you're on the line
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:36.720]  hey guys how you doing good um i wanted to see if you bob if you agree with my
[2:57:36.720 --> 2:57:40.960]  interpretation of of the situation uh i believe
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:44.800]  that uh we can best find a solution to what what
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:48.640]  the situation we're in by by studying the root
[2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:51.760]  source of of where the pivot point where all
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:56.320]  happened i agree with that but previous caller talking about the ucc law
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:00.160]  and how uh a debt if refused should be discharged
[2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:05.440]  because of the pivot point for me is house joint resolution 192
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:08.160]  because when you take away gold and silver is money
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:12.960]  you take away the constitution it's a contract it's one piece we can't just
[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:17.200]  take away a section of the constitution and expect the rest to be there
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:21.200]  when they set aside the constitution took away gold and silver as money
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:25.280]  they they took away legitimate government as well and legitimate law
[2:58:25.280 --> 2:58:29.200]  all law now is commerce i learned i started learning about this because of
[2:58:29.200 --> 2:58:32.480]  that movie you were in jason hijacking up hijacking
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:36.560]  hijacking humanity paul verge great film we're gonna come back and get bob

[2:59:04.240 --> 2:59:07.520]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:51.920]  you heard what the last president said about any use
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:56.320]  expletives to describe the constitution they don't care
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:00.400]  they're merit members of the illuminati they think they are the masters of the
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:04.640]  universe and they will break every single law
[3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:08.000]  and they'll continue to do so until we stop them
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:11.040]  and that's what throwing everybody out of congress is all about

[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:26.720]  absolutely let's jam in a couple more callers
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:32.160]  set in california set you're on line hey uh first off want to say jason
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:35.200]  invisible empire was awesome oh thank you very much
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:38.560]  thank you um i just thought a quick question about a couple days ago it
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:42.080]  came out the golden sacks bank of america jp morrigan
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:46.720]  and city grave made money it made profit every single day of the first quarter on
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:50.240]  the stock market and i mean i haven't heard too much about it came out of
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:54.480]  bloomberg but why isn't there a whole answer that for you
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:01:58.720]  i was a professional trader for 25 years i own my own firm
[3:01:58.720 --> 3:02:02.560]  and if you can make trades where you're right 55 percent of the time
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:06.560]  you're really a big winner so in order to have
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:10.720]  a net at the end of every day for four major banks
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:16.960]  for three months is absolutely impossible they had to be running on
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:21.600]  inside information and they are doing everything
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:25.600]  that they want to do at these major banking institutions
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:28.720]  used to be called brokerage houses too and
[3:02:28.720 --> 3:02:32.880]  i'll tell you why uh i just got a letter today
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:37.600]  from a friend of mine who attends the fed meetings
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:43.280]  and he says that by the end of the year maybe as
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:48.160]  early as november that the banking system is going to come down
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:52.640]  and he says that they believe that all of the banks will
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:57.360]  be wrapped up in those five or six major banks in the united states
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:03:00.480]  and they will control everything from a banking views
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:05.200]  viewpoint and that's what they're after the international forecaster dot com
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:10.640]  is the website or you can call mitis resources at 1-800-686-2237 and get

[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:19.040]  blue in tennessee blue you're online hello thank you gentlemen
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:23.600]  um one other question what about the possibility of collecting copper for
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:26.800]  those of us that do not have enough money to invest in silver
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:31.200]  and gold well the government if you collect uh
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:35.120]  pennies the government says that it's illegal to destroy them
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:38.800]  but if you go out and collect copper you've got to remember that's a commodity
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:43.840]  in a garage anywhere from 62 a pound to four dollars and
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:48.240]  20 cents a pound so there's a risk factor in there
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:54.080]  uh and if we have a eventually have a deflationary depression the value of
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:58.320]  commodities would it would eventually fall and bob let me say this i refuse to
[3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:02.400]  believe that anybody out there can't get involved in silver
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:07.680]  if you go to mcdonald's uh you're going to spend more money on feeding
[3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:11.200]  yourself and your wife and your kid on a bat on a few value meals then you
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:15.760]  would on one silver ounce coin that's the reality anybody can get into silver
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:19.760]  bob i just don't believe it when you're right
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:24.240]  and it's much easier than copper that's for sure i mean copper 62 by the pound
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:27.440]  at the best is that a joke can you even imagine it
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:31.360]  folks we had a great show we got alex jones coming up in about

[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:38.320]  floor for the balance of this segment layout
[3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:41.840]  where we are what's happening what's going on in europe what's going on with
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:45.920]  brown stepping down merkel and in trouble saying the banks are criminal
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:49.280]  what's happening in the markets a trillion's not enough they need more
[3:09:49.280 --> 3:09:53.280]  what is happening right now all righty well
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:58.960]  let's talk first about greece now george uh pappadreo the leader in greece
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:02.560]  he made a statement yesterday over the weekend that he's now
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:06.160]  going to investigate what role the wall street banks played
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:10.240]  in destabilizing his country his economy
[3:10:10.240 --> 3:10:14.800]  and this is through some back channel communication between myself
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:19.440]  and folks in greece and i've been trying to steer them in the right direction
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:23.120]  telling them this isn't a market problem it's not a market failure but it's
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:27.120]  fraud that's been perpetrated primarily by wall street banks
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:32.480]  and my message got through and he said yesterday that he hears words like a
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:37.520]  need for transparency and there's fraud and now he's going to take a stand
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:42.640]  against the bankers now historically when anybody has taken anyone in politics
[3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:46.000]  has taken a stand against the bankers they immediately put themselves into
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:49.520]  you know quite a bit of danger because the track record if you go
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:53.600]  you know even if you read john perkins book confessions of an economic hitman
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:57.360]  whenever somebody a leader of a country steps up against the bankers
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:00.880]  they put themselves into grave danger now this would be the first time
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:04.800]  really that a major western economy is taking on the wall street banks
[3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:07.840]  but the people in greece are out in the streets
[3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:11.600]  and the leadership is responding so they're he's making a statement so we're
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:15.920]  going to see because there's ample proof that the wall street banks
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:19.440]  purposefully crashed the greece economy the greek economy
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:24.080]  for short term capital gains so uh that that's that's the first thing that's
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:28.320]  happening what's happening in the iceland you know we made a film in iceland
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:32.160]  about the collapse of the corona the collapse of the icelandic economy
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:35.760]  and i've gotten pretty friendly with a lot of the legislators up in iceland
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:39.520]  i'm proposing to them that they introduce some
[3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:44.640]  a new economic citizenship so that anyone in the world who wants to escape
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:48.800]  for example a u.s citizen who wants to escape the tyranny of the u.s
[3:11:48.800 --> 3:11:52.960]  can buy a passport for iceland and to make it competitive
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:56.720]  so it only cost 20 000 bucks right now there's only two territories or
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:12:00.320]  countries that offer economic citizenship nevisane kids and
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:04.720]  uh dominica they're both uh in the in the bahamas
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:08.640]  they cost 200 000 and 75 000 respectively
[3:12:08.640 --> 3:12:12.320]  respectively i'm saying that iceland to be competitive they can offer economic
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:18.240]  citizenship for 20 000 and uh they could get if they get 200 000 or so
[3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:21.680]  or half a million citizens from the u.s to um
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:25.120]  renounce u.s citizenship and move to iceland they could raise 10 billion
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:29.600]  dollars immediately to help recapitalize their country and they are
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:33.440]  talking about uh entry to rewriting their constitution in
[3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:37.440]  ways that are going to favor free speech and freedom of the press
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:39.920]  all right let me stop you and feed them with the press
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:44.080]  would immediately want to emigrate to iceland so they have these pockets of
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:48.160]  resistance and pockets of strength from the work that you're doing
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:52.400]  directly uh and the work i've been doing and now these people are starting to
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:55.200]  respond because the global insurrection against the banking
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:12:59.040]  occupation is on okay the global insurrection is on i want to
[3:12:59.040 --> 3:13:03.040]  interject this and and get your take on it and i want to back you up here and
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:07.120]  have you continue uh this is french news agency bankers jailed
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:11.040]  sued as iceland seeks culprits for crisis
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:14.320]  then a week ago we saw the merkel headline where she called you know a
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:18.640]  criminal banks causing this those she's bought and paid for
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:22.960]  by them so isn't that the danger uh with the greek leader and others is that
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:26.880]  they see the headlights of the train coming the global
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:30.800]  insurrection against the banking cartel they know they can't survive
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:35.200]  unless they put it into a process and then maybe goldman sacks or jp morgan
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:37.840]  will flush down the toilet some mid-level trader
[3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:43.040]  you know on a sub issue like timberwolf uh with goldman sacks i mean isn't
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:45.920]  there a danger of that because i've been all over a greek radio and
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:48.960]  and newspapers as well saying arrest the bankers
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:52.240]  you know arrest goldman sacks and so you've been putting the pressure on many
[3:13:52.240 --> 3:13:54.080]  others have been putting the pressure on
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:58.720]  so that's a great idea uh secondarily how you brought up
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:02.560]  expatriates we have the new york time saying record numbers of wealthy people
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:06.240]  uh who aren't globalists leaving uh because they say this is the last year
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:10.320]  to get your money out just fleeing in mass i'd rather flee to somewhere
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:12.960]  like iceland but i don't even have enough money i don't think like you said if it
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:15.120]  was 200 000 that i think i'm gonna stay here and go
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:17.520]  down with the ship but for people that do want to escape
[3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:21.120]  and be about to be around like-minded people but what about
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:26.080]  the arrest that they're reporting in iceland that's right one of the bankers
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:30.240]  in london uh who they they say uh mightfully so
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:34.080]  was responsible for uh pilfering two billion dollars
[3:14:34.080 --> 3:14:39.040]  from the economy is now uh being prosecuted and um
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:42.320]  you know it's funny because london is where a lot of these guys go
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:45.840]  uh to get because the the hedge fund industry and the banking industry laws
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:48.560]  are very lenient there and you end up with a lot of the international
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:51.760]  banking crooks end up in london which is one of the reasons why the real estate
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:55.120]  market in london on the high end the very expensive
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:15:00.160]  residencies hasn't crashed so much because they're supported by all these
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:02.960]  billionaires from these territories that they've
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:07.120]  absconded with all the wealth so iceland is actively going after
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:12.560]  uh this guy and it's funny because in the indictment they use a very interesting
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:17.200]  word alex they use the word counterfeiting now this is fascinating
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:21.760]  because counterfeiting in the context of financial crime and financial
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:25.920]  terrorism it points to what's what's what the people
[3:15:25.920 --> 3:15:30.480]  know as naked short selling naked short selling
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:34.880]  is is really one of the most common incendiary financial devices used to
[3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:39.120]  blow up an economy and to blow up a a country to blow up a company we saw
[3:15:39.120 --> 3:15:42.480]  with leeman brothers and bare stern naked short selling you're selling
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:46.080]  something you're selling a security that doesn't exist
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:49.520]  which is the same as counterfeiting so now if they bring this whole naked
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:53.040]  short selling scam to the surface and they call it what it is counterfeiting
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:57.040]  that that would point the finger at a lot of the criminality that's going on
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:00.640]  in the last five to ten years and really bring bring in all the banks
[3:16:00.640 --> 3:16:04.000]  because they're all guilty of this naked short selling to a huge degree
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:07.280]  now getting back to your question about well the leaders
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:11.600]  once they take on wall street are they going to be pressured to back down
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:16.720]  and what we saw last thursday on may 6th was the first unequivocal domestic
[3:16:16.720 --> 3:16:20.720]  financial terrorist attack in america you know there was a bill in washington
[3:16:20.720 --> 3:16:25.520]  to break up the big banks they dropped the market by a thousand points
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:29.520]  uh... the lawmakers pulled away they decided not to pass that law to break up
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:32.880]  the big they also dropped the real law at the fed and put a fake one in
[3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:36.640]  according to ron poll yeah so they've got this weapon
[3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:41.120]  which is they can crash a market and i'm looking at today's news
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:44.160]  and you see now that the financial terrorists
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:47.760]  are not shy about threatening to blow up
[3:16:47.760 --> 3:16:51.520]  people's economies and markets for example is produced in today's news
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:55.680]  morgan stanley said that uh... if europe doesn't engage in
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:16:59.520]  in uh... full-blown quantitative easing which means that they
[3:16:59.520 --> 3:17:02.800]  uh... would buy back their own their own bonds which basically would mean to
[3:17:02.800 --> 3:17:07.360]  destroy the europe then morgan stanley threatens
[3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:12.000]  europe with a nineteen eighty seven crash look this up morgan stanley
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:14.080]  full-blown quantitative easing may be needed
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:17.600]  to save europe or else we'll see a nineteen eighty seven style crash
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:20.960]  so they're threatening europe with a nineteen eighty seven that's morgan
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:24.240]  stanley a wall street bank isn't just threatening the entire
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:29.040]  eurozone um... here's another headline about uh...
[3:17:29.040 --> 3:17:32.960]  uh... the kpmg and price warhouse cooper
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:36.480]  are now considering whether or not they should get back into the
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:40.240]  into the business of the rating agency you know the moody's
[3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:44.160]  s&p and fish those rating agencies that gave their blessing to all the
[3:17:44.160 --> 3:17:46.960]  structured products and collateralized debt obligations that turn out to be
[3:17:46.960 --> 3:17:49.920]  phony well now all these consulting firms who are
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:53.600]  also equally uh... culpable in this nightmare
[3:17:53.600 --> 3:17:57.440]  collapse of the economy say well you know those guys aren't good enough at it
[3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:00.480]  we're going to get into business so this is like uh...
[3:18:00.480 --> 3:18:04.320]  really just uh... exactly the same thing the fact that they can with a
[3:18:04.320 --> 3:18:07.840]  strange face say that they're going to get into the rating agency business
[3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:10.320]  when they themselves are some of the most crooked
[3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:13.920]  organizations in the u.s economy kpmg and price waterhouse is
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:17.280]  quite laughable uh... here you have general motors
[3:18:17.280 --> 3:18:21.200]  today saying that they want to get back into the financing business
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:25.360]  because of the shortage of subprime lending is holding back sales
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:29.360]  now general motors getting into the financing business is exactly how the
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:32.560]  economy crashed to begin with because they got out of selling cars and they
[3:18:32.560 --> 3:18:35.680]  got into the loan sharking business then the economy crashed
[3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:40.240]  then the government gave them billions and as a as a thank you to the taxpayer
[3:18:40.240 --> 3:18:43.280]  for getting them out of the hole they're saying now we want to get back into the
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:46.240]  loan sharking business that only took 12 months
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:50.240]  now we're not going to build cars we're going to move our factories to asia
[3:18:50.240 --> 3:18:54.480]  to brazil and to china uh... and to uh... eastern europe
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:57.520]  and then all we're going to do with your bailout money here is loan it back to
[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:01.360]  you the american people at user's rates as a loan shark
[3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:04.720]  and we're trying to get you deeper into debt as we possibly can
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:09.120]  and so they're trying to restart cycle restart the entire
[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:14.160]  uh... cycle of again until they blow up and then they require more of a bailout
[3:19:14.160 --> 3:19:17.040]  and of course this just perpetuates this move
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:20.320]  uh... down into what we would call the casino gulag state
[3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:25.120]  where the uh... value of the you know the purchasing power the the wages and
[3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:29.200]  and the savings and and the purchasing power of everybody in the u.s keeps
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:33.280]  continuously the degrades and drops and disintegrates and you have this but just
[3:19:33.280 --> 3:19:36.720]  an enormous cesspool uh... they used to work where
[3:19:36.720 --> 3:19:42.160]  once a fine country used to uh... reside
[3:19:42.160 --> 3:19:45.760]  well said i've got a bunch of questions for you in the next short segment and
[3:19:45.760 --> 3:19:48.240]  we're going to get into other issues you think are important to cover
[3:19:48.240 --> 3:19:51.120]  and then take phone calls one of my questions is
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:19:55.760]  will the u.s market collapse when will it collapse if it does and how will it
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:19:58.160]  collapse that's all coming up with max keiser

[3:24:10.160 --> 3:24:14.960]  your call's coming up the next segment max i talked to one of my neighbors i
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:17.920]  talked to other people you know that are somewhat successful in business in
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:20.480]  austin and they say well i'm not in the stock
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:24.320]  market so i don't care what these big banks are doing
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:28.000]  and i don't understand this yuppie pre-programmed
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:32.640]  arrogance where you try to warn people that you know
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:37.360]  and they act like it's weak to even care or even be involved in society as long
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:40.720]  as they think they're doing uh... okay
[3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:43.920]  i mean everyone is connected to the stock market everyone is connected to the
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:46.880]  currencies everyone is connected through taxes
[3:24:46.880 --> 3:24:50.880]  with these trillions of dollars of quote bailouts used for bonuses
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:53.760]  i mean what do you call that mindset
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:57.680]  where people don't understand the incredible magnitude
[3:24:57.680 --> 3:25:02.400]  of what's happening in global markets right now and where this is leading us
[3:25:02.400 --> 3:25:05.920]  well you can explain it in the following way
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:10.800]  the the average experience of of the average american
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:15.600]  is masked to a large degree by the fact that most people
[3:25:15.600 --> 3:25:18.800]  in america are unaware of the benefits accrued
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:23.760]  to them because the world reserve currency is the u.s dollar
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:28.560]  so there is no radical currency risk that you see in other countries and the
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:31.360]  currency collapses that you see in other countries
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:34.640]  and it also means that things like gasoline
[3:25:34.640 --> 3:25:38.960]  are incredibly cheap in america relative to other countries now what
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:42.560]  is going to happen what people on your show are talking about
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:46.160]  and what i've been talking about what i see over here in europe
[3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:50.560]  is that the u.s dollar as reserve currency is going to be replaced with a
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:55.440]  new global currency and that at that moment then americans will
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:25:59.200]  experience what everyone else in the world experiences which is
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:04.480]  radical currency risk and uh... all kinds of uh...
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:10.240]  bank shenanigans including paying state local federal
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:14.320]  and world tax because of course the world currency you need a
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:18.000]  global central bank is going to charge a global tax
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:20.960]  and then americans will wake up and they'll say oh my god
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:24.080]  you know it all happened it's happening right now because the special drawing
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:28.000]  rights that are on the that are being used right now as part of this huge
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:31.600]  reconfiguration of the european banking system in the trillion dollar
[3:26:31.600 --> 3:26:36.640]  uh... that the u.s gave uh... uh... europe to unwind their banks
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:41.280]  risky positions the part of that is the introduction of another 300 billion
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:44.080]  in a special drawing right so the special drawing rights
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:48.080]  are creeping into the global currency system
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  at some point they will be comparable to other major currencies in terms of the
[3:26:54.080 --> 3:26:58.560]  amount traded in the scope and the influence and then you'll start to see
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:02.160]  things quoted in special drawing rights and they'll normalize the special
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:05.040]  drawing right and then it'll be announced that
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:09.120]  as part of brendan woods to uh... they're going to reconfigure the global
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:13.200]  currency grid the u.s dollar will be devalued by 50 percent
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:17.600]  like it was in the thirties gold will be upwardly valued to five or ten thousand
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:21.200]  dollars an ounce and then people in the u.s will
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:25.280]  will will have a deferred awakening because since world war two
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:29.520]  they've really had the benefit of they've had the world war two
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:34.320]  dividend which is stretched out for 60 60 and they just expect this incredible
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:39.200]  period of benefit as a result of having this
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:42.720]  incredible system where their government the u.s government can write checks
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:46.240]  that they never have to cash because every time the the check is due
[3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:49.840]  they just write another check and since the world runs on dollars there's always
[3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:52.560]  somebody willing to take a bad american check
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:56.400]  now as soon as that situation ends as it is happening right now
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:27:59.920]  you'll have this incredible you know shock
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:04.800]  uh... and and then it'll be way way way too late to do anything about it so
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:08.800]  i can understand why people are in a coma when it comes to
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:12.880]  understanding the position of the u.s relatives of the rest of the world
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:16.480]  and i can also anticipate that when this thing finally
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:19.760]  makes the break there's going to be an incredible
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:24.480]  uh... gasp of horror that'll just go from coast to coast there will be
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:27.920]  absolute shock how did this happen
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:31.440]  but it's happening for all the reasons you've been talking about for the last
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:34.960]  10 years and the banks will say the big mega banks will say don't worry we're
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:39.600]  going to save you again with s dr's we're transcending
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:43.200]  national currencies and we'll just make up to the power of infinity
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:46.560]  whatever amount of fiat money we want and you're going to pay us
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:50.480]  taxes on the right to use this new global
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:53.920]  cashless society system and they'll just bypass
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:57.440]  the three global regional currencies that the trilateral commission
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:29:01.440]  talked about in the 1970s correct
[3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:04.960]  that is basically correct in other words
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:08.480]  with the introduction of a special drawing right they will have
[3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:13.120]  another way to add another layer to this global ponzi scheme where all of the
[3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.800]  u.s dollar denominated debts will be
[3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:21.280]  re-securitized most of the debt will be off the balance sheet
[3:29:21.280 --> 3:29:25.200]  some of it will be included in the new s dr but the s dr
[3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:28.640]  will be loaded up with more debt than even the u.s dollar
[3:29:28.640 --> 3:29:34.960]  and the result will be this constant downward pressure from above where no
[3:29:34.960 --> 3:29:38.880]  wages ever go up no savers ever get a return
[3:29:38.880 --> 3:29:45.120]  greater than 0.001 on their savings and you end up in this casino gulag
[3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:48.400]  state where the only way anyone can make any more money than
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:53.040]  stay there gotta break stay there we're on the march

[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:49.360]  layman's you know simple terms yes uh do you see asia plunging next or how
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:52.720]  far will europe plunge do you think the eurozone's gonna break up the germans
[3:35:52.720 --> 3:35:56.400]  are saying that uh major german newspapers are calling
[3:35:56.400 --> 3:36:00.640]  for a deutsch reich zone that only has the richest countries
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:05.760]  uh in europe that are part of it so what do you see happening with the euro
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:08.480]  i mean i know you can't guess this exactly but you've been very accurate in
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:12.880]  the past how do you see this unfolding who do you see going down next
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:17.120]  when does this really start to hit the us
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:21.840]  right well uh as you say i i've been pretty good at
[3:36:21.840 --> 3:36:27.600]  at framing this and predicting this um the which i have to understand is

[3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:38.640]  is not bound by any restrictions in terms of the types of bets that they
[3:36:38.640 --> 3:36:41.200]  can make in the leverage that they have at their
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:45.840]  uh availability and what they do is they go from
[3:36:45.840 --> 3:36:51.120]  currency to currency and they and they ferret out which ones are the weakest
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:55.520]  they then scare the bejesus out of the folks they float rumors about the
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:36:59.440]  economic collapse they crash the economy they make a quick
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:02.960]  a hundred billion dollars or so and then they move on
[3:37:02.960 --> 3:37:08.560]  and um from the eurozone i think that they beat up the euro pretty
[3:37:08.560 --> 3:37:12.960]  pretty good here in the last few weeks i think the next stop is the british
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:16.560]  pound the british pound they've got a new government in britain
[3:37:16.560 --> 3:37:20.480]  they're trying to bring in some reforms they're talking about bringing in
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:24.320]  banking reform so i think that if next time we talk
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:30.480]  we'll be talking about the tragic fall of the british pound they'll beat that up
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:33.760]  for a while and then they either will go back
[3:37:33.760 --> 3:37:38.240]  to eurozone and attack the euro or they may
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:41.840]  you know come back to the u.s because the u.s is always
[3:37:41.840 --> 3:37:45.600]  the the currency that these guys know best they know how to
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:48.880]  crash it uh in in the most efficient manner
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:52.480]  and it's always uh in their pocket they could always crash the dollar
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:55.680]  that's something they could always do for a quick buck but you can't do it a
[3:37:55.680 --> 3:37:58.480]  hundred percent of the time you've got to take turns crashing
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:03.360]  different currencies at different times so i think the way i see it the next
[3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:07.920]  is the is the british pound uh the japanese yen
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:12.720]  is the kind of a possibility at some point their their economy has been gone
[3:38:12.720 --> 3:38:16.240]  now 20 straight years of deflation and it's still
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:20.800]  highly problematic uh they import something like you know 100 of their
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:24.400]  energy so it's really at the mercy of the global
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:29.040]  economy economic system so that that's always a nice one to go in there
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:33.040]  occasionally but they use really the yen really is what's called a funding
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:37.920]  currency in other words they borrow in yen because it's so cheap and they use
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:42.720]  that to go attack a country like the uk or the euro zone so it depends on which
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:45.920]  country has a really weak currency they use that
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:49.840]  to borrow and they go attack another country when i was in Reykjavik
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:53.120]  right before that economy collapsed i sat in the 101
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:57.360]  hotel in the sushi bar and i talked to some bankers from galt from
[3:38:57.360 --> 3:39:01.440]  Lehman brothers and Bear Stearns and they said look
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:06.080]  in about six months we're going to attack Iceland and we're going to crash the
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:09.840]  Icelandic corona and they weren't shy about talking about it
[3:39:09.840 --> 3:39:13.600]  and uh this is exactly what they did now a few years later
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:16.320]  they're finally getting around to putting some people in jail
[3:39:16.320 --> 3:39:21.120]  for counterfeiting and security fraud and all kinds of other crimes
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:24.480]  and hopefully they'll put somebody in jail to sit next to Bernie Madoff and
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:29.600]  hopefully Lloyd the blank fine will be there shortly
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:33.680]  and if we just continue to point out the emperors but naked and wearing any
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:37.120]  golden outfit like the little three-year-old in the emperors new
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:40.160]  clothes parable in fact guys print me the emperors new
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:42.400]  clothes parable i want to read that next hour on air
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:46.640]  if we just point out the obvious it's going to implode max did you see fox news
[3:39:46.640 --> 3:39:49.760]  the new york times afp roiders in the last month
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:55.680]  all come out with a scyop and say yes the troops are helping grow the opium
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:39:58.560]  because if we don't grow it al qaeda will get the money
[3:39:58.560 --> 3:40:02.000]  i mean this had been coming out that our government was there for the opium
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:05.840]  500 billion a year and shipping it in the russians had said this
[3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:10.640]  but now they're so arrogant they hide it in plain view it's like
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:14.480]  it'd be like president obama being naked at the podium and saying he wasn't
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:17.200]  naked and we're not supposed to point out he's naked
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:21.120]  so it's it's some kind of mind control thing where they just come out and say
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:25.360]  yeah we grow the opium as we never talked to katherine often fits about this
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:29.280]  yeah the big red button um she's got an excellent
[3:40:29.280 --> 3:40:34.960]  a lot of work on the cia afghani opium crops and also you know a lot of these
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:38.320]  hedge funds that you read about this came out during the savings and loan
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:41.520]  collapse they discovered that many of the hedge funds
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:44.240]  were actually backed by the government and cia and
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:48.720]  other organizations so you and and back in the 2008
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:51.840]  crash over that hang and when hang paulson put the gun to congress's head
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:54.720]  and said give us 700 billion dollars we're going to crash the economy
[3:40:54.720 --> 3:40:58.640]  a lot of people in congress were actually short bank stocks they used an
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:02.720]  exchange traded fund which was making negative bets against bank stocks so
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:06.240]  those congressmen were actually making money as those bank stocks were
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:10.400]  collapsing so these guys are just fully invested in the collapse and well
[3:41:10.400 --> 3:41:13.680]  that's why i call them suicide bankers because they have a
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:17.200]  fundamentalist belief in capitalism as their religion
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:20.720]  and they're willing to blow themselves up in the name of their religious
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:26.320]  belief in fanatical capitalism what is this today let me forget marith
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:29.200]  whitney who's a very popular analyst now
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:33.040]  she's the one who called out city bank a few years ago right before the crash
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:39.760]  she said this quote financial reform will cause quote tragic
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:44.720]  unemployment levels for an extended period of time
[3:41:44.720 --> 3:41:48.400]  you see what you're saying if you try to reform us
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:53.040]  then the unemployment levels will be tragic for an extended period of time
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:56.640]  that's an outright threat that's just an outright threat coming from
[3:41:56.640 --> 3:42:00.640]  wall street if you try to reform us you're never going to get a job again
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:04.480]  you know that's just that's just outright tyranny i mean what else can you
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:08.160]  call it you're absolutely right well said max
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:11.040]  keiser and they just continue to threaten let's talk to tom in
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:16.000]  connecticut you're on the air hi yeah this is perfect what you're talking
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:20.320]  about but they want to comment on something you said yesterday alex
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:24.960]  and that was you said the it was good that they are arresting the bankers
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:30.000]  in iceland but then you said it's okay you know we have the great local bankers
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.880]  down this tree we can get a loan for a car but
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:36.720]  a private bankers a private bankers a private banker no matter how small they
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:40.960]  are how big they are they have the power through fractional reserve lending
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:44.800]  to create money out of nothing and what we need
[3:42:44.800 --> 3:42:49.520]  is a public credit directly through our government we need to take the
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:54.240]  responsibility where let me say this i mean i'm all for state banks
[3:42:54.240 --> 3:42:57.440]  but that's still a bank and it's not going to be able to compete if it
[3:42:57.440 --> 3:43:01.680]  doesn't have the fractional system and this is a very complex issue
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:05.040]  but local banks some are good some are bad the point is
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:08.800]  we don't want the mega six banks in the u.s several others globally
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:13.200]  but there's no more than 10 anyway you slice it so just for simplicity we
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:17.280]  don't want the mega 10 banks to have the regulatory power
[3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:20.400]  to scoop up the smaller banks because then we're really in trouble
[3:43:20.400 --> 3:43:26.000]  max keiser in north dakota they have a banking system
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:29.520]  which is sound because they pass some laws
[3:43:29.520 --> 3:43:33.440]  to get rid of a lot of the abuses and ellen brown
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:37.760]  is a very fine journalist has done a lot of work if you type in ellen brown
[3:43:37.760 --> 3:43:40.640]  in the search engine and search north dakota banks
[3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:45.200]  there it is possible to run banks in an equitable fair way
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:49.360]  and north dakota surprisingly for people probably don't know about this
[3:43:49.360 --> 3:43:53.600]  they actually have some pretty decent banks because they have decided to
[3:43:53.600 --> 3:43:57.680]  um not try to run with the wolves and to simply
[3:43:57.680 --> 3:44:01.600]  get in the very simple business of but it's the same thing with texas banks
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:03.840]  there there's some of the wealthiest in the country
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:06.960]  and the texas banking association has come out and said
[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:11.040]  we're not selling derivatives we're not the big mega banks they are dangerous
[3:44:11.040 --> 3:44:15.280]  and so that's important to be friendly with regional banks
[3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:19.680]  uh to be able to defeat the big banks and then later if we want to change
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:22.560]  something at that level and and fix abuses at the local level
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:25.040]  i think it's great but tom finish your point
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:29.040]  yeah well that is that is excellent that max part of ellen brown in her book the
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:33.440]  web of debt in the bank of north dakota no the bank of north dakota is a state
[3:44:33.440 --> 3:44:37.120]  owned and operated bank it is true sovereign money
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:41.600]  we need a sovereign monetary system not a private debt money system
[3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:45.120]  what we have now where they have the power to create money they are like a
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:48.080]  mafia we have to realize that the private bankers of the
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:52.000]  world are like a global mafia and we have to stand up to them
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:55.520]  like the people of a village stand up to the mafia and run them out of town
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:45:01.040]  i agree tom well said absolutely currency should be a symbol of exchange
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:05.360]  not the actual energy you know it it doesn't have the value it's an agreed
[3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:10.720]  upon mode of exchange and we need to get back to what we had pre-1913 let's
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:14.560]  talk to uh rachel in new york you're on the air
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:19.040]  hi um i just wanted to let you know that one of the things that has been going
[3:45:19.040 --> 3:45:22.640]  on lately um that is not being reported is that many people
[3:45:22.640 --> 3:45:28.800]  appear in new york on wall street are withdrawing there for a one case
[3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:33.920]  actually i have seen that uh in the news the word is getting out but it's not a
[3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:37.680]  big national story because of bloomberg and other reports
[3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:41.680]  that the federal government is ordering private pension funds to quote invest
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:46.400]  in failed banks i mean since when can the government order
[3:45:46.400 --> 3:45:49.520]  because they have regulatory threats if they don't see they can selectively
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:52.480]  enforce max keiser break that down
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:56.480]  right well 401k accounts are the retirement accounts people scroll away
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:46:00.000]  money every month with their employer now if they're liquidating those accounts
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:02.960]  it could it it what's not being clear here is
[3:46:02.960 --> 3:46:05.600]  either it's because of duress and they need that money
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:09.920]  because they're going bankrupt and they have to draw down their savings or two
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:14.240]  they fear tax hikes coming and the tax advantages of the 401k
[3:46:14.240 --> 3:46:18.320]  uh evaporate so why not take that money out and put it somewhere
[3:46:18.320 --> 3:46:21.920]  in another institution that you don't have the same kind of risk now i think
[3:46:21.920 --> 3:46:27.120]  what the caller is referring to is that people are removing money from the 401k
[3:46:27.120 --> 3:46:31.840]  as an offensive measure not a defensive measure as a way to
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:35.680]  understand that they need to take more control of their financial well-being and
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:40.000]  to put what they thought was money safely put away
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.680]  into other alternative investments possibly other currencies other countries
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:48.800]  into gold etc well said max keiser uh anything else
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:52.000]  rachel no that's all i just wanted to say many of the people who were speaking
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:56.320]  to say they rather have their money now than wait there until they're 58 years
[3:46:56.320 --> 3:47:00.240]  old when it won't be there anymore they'll take the tax hit now
[3:47:00.240 --> 3:47:04.240]  yeah i know that's accelerating good point let's talk to steven
[3:47:04.240 --> 3:47:08.240]  uh in california you're on the air that's your job
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:12.720]  yes sir pleasure to be on your show i'm a first time caller and kind of a first
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:17.680]  fine listener and um as a young person dirt living in today uh
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:21.200]  i become educated on your show and you instill the passion
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:26.000]  flash interest in government and i was wondering if you know how to person in
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:30.080]  my position my family has no legacy now that uh how do i get into that sort of
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:34.880]  thing well look in high school in college they make it boring it's
[3:47:34.880 --> 3:47:39.920]  government it's like it's like alcatraz or something or it's like
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:45.040]  some you know island of dr maru it's it's some imaginary thing far off
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:48.800]  you've got to be involved in government because if you don't it's going to get
[3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:52.480]  taken over by shysters and they're going to rob the hell out of you and hire a
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:57.200]  bunch of uniformed thugs to enforce their corruption it's called tyranny
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:01.520]  and so we've became the wealthiest country in the world because we had a
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:04.880]  small government and we were on top of things and we allowed people to keep
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:07.120]  most of their wealth because it was their god given right
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:10.640]  now we're becoming the center of evil because our wealth has been used to
[3:48:10.640 --> 3:48:15.840]  dominate the globe and build an empire and no one is as is as enslaved as
[3:48:15.840 --> 3:48:19.280]  people inside the empire and so people are waking up and deciding i better get
[3:48:19.280 --> 3:48:22.000]  involved in government then they go get involved in government
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:26.160]  and they find that for those that did get involved there's a fake left right
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:29.040]  choice which has meant to further confuse them
[3:48:29.040 --> 3:48:33.040]  okay uh you know they've they follow the yellow brick road they've gotten to the
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:38.240]  emerald uh you know palace they've gone in and there's this big flaming head
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:41.680]  telling him i am a great oz and the next level
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:44.480]  is going no republicans and democrats you're not
[3:48:44.480 --> 3:48:49.200]  todo pulls the curtain back or the two-year-old points out the emperor
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:52.640]  has no clothes same analogy say mark type you pull it back
[3:48:52.640 --> 3:48:56.480]  and it's a potbellied little demon goblin uh back there that's scared to death
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:48:59.840]  of you if we don't pull back the curtain and arrest the goblin
[3:48:59.840 --> 3:49:05.360]  it's over max keiser well if you go back if this is a very interesting question
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:08.080]  because it's a very interesting inflection point
[3:49:08.080 --> 3:49:12.960]  and um especially for a young person now if you remember
[3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:18.400]  ronald reagan said government is the problem and he said this under the
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:22.160]  influence of thinkers like milton freeman who believe that the market
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:26.720]  could solve all problems now in 2010 people are saying you know what the
[3:49:26.720 --> 3:49:30.880]  market is actually the problem and it's creating an incredible amount of
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:35.120]  problems uh on on top of problems so if that's true
[3:49:35.120 --> 3:49:40.720]  then does that mean it we're gonna ask ourselves or look at the possibility
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:44.960]  that there might be some saving grace in the idea of having a government but
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:48.880]  here's the next problem max let me come out of the united states created a
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:51.920]  government that's what they got this country started on they didn't start
[3:49:51.920 --> 3:49:54.640]  with a hedge fund they started with a constitution
[3:49:54.640 --> 3:49:58.400]  now i agree with you but it's again to go to expand on that
[3:49:58.400 --> 3:50:02.880]  under the constitution congress controls the issuance of currency and credit
[3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:05.840]  not private bankers so the confusion is going to be with the public
[3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:08.960]  you're going to have the private bankers posed as a solution
[3:50:08.960 --> 3:50:12.640]  with a type of regulation that is only going to empower them even more
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:17.280]  so how do you get past that well that's the first time so my question is
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:20.960]  and there's a lot of rhetoric and especially in the libertarian camp
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:25.680]  that government has nothing to offer and you know i think that that is a
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:30.240]  self-defeating position there has to be some rule of government first of all
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:34.000]  so the government therefore does not become a dirty word there is a rule
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:37.680]  for government that's step number one step number two is as you say
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:40.800]  yeah well it's all in the constitution they recognize gold and silver is the
[3:50:40.800 --> 3:50:45.360]  only constitutionally recognized form of of money and currency if that's true
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:48.560]  then all of the fiat currency fractional reserve derivative market
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:52.720]  scamming that's going on has to be taken completely out of the yeah we got to go
[3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:55.680]  back to the constitution that's right stay there stay there
[3:50:55.680 --> 3:50:59.680]  we're gonna talk to ian steve kevin and others uh and steven i'm gonna try to

[3:54:18.080 --> 3:54:21.760]  harry france you have restored the republic with don't tread on these
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:25.600]  coming on i want to play miss arizona or miss
[3:54:25.600 --> 3:54:30.000]  oklahoma talking about arizona says she supports arizona law we're gonna talk
[3:54:30.000 --> 3:54:34.480]  about states rides uh coming up but before i go any
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:38.560]  further with max keiser i want to simplify this because this gets confusing
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:41.360]  for people because it is so simple sometimes the simplest things are
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:44.960]  confusing i'm against anything big and monolithic
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:48.640]  whether it's government or hedge funds that are bigger than any government
[3:54:48.640 --> 3:54:52.320]  money wise because they just created themselves as thomas jefferson warned
[3:54:52.320 --> 3:54:55.040]  they would a blank check to take over the planet
[3:54:55.040 --> 3:54:58.880]  you had a paraphrase jefferson he said you know you could take out private
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:02.000]  central bankers but if you ever let them back in within one day
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:06.160]  they'll buy up the whole world with fake credit they produce so
[3:55:06.160 --> 3:55:09.600]  the problem is with a quote free market is it's not free market
[3:55:09.600 --> 3:55:12.880]  when the cia with an inner coterie of private banks
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:16.640]  gives themselves unlimited trillions and uses their own regulatory power to
[3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:19.680]  shut down their competition and so we need government
[3:55:19.680 --> 3:55:24.720]  to protect the true free market and to have rules against counterfeiting as
[3:55:24.720 --> 3:55:27.920]  max keiser said counterfeiting is illegal if i
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:32.160]  opened up a fake company started selling stock claiming it was in gold mines i
[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:36.080]  didn't own it would be a fraud well it's a it's a step past that
[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:39.600]  with the fractional reserve banking with the derivatives with these fake
[3:55:39.600 --> 3:55:43.440]  insurance companies certifying it and then taxpayers having to bail it out
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:47.520]  so that is the issue the quote free markets being demonized
[3:55:47.520 --> 3:55:50.240]  i think by the bankers themselves because they want a global controlled
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:54.240]  market that they control and so it's it's it's until the public becomes educated
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:55:57.440]  on this it's just going to get worse again max keiser
[3:55:57.440 --> 3:56:02.080]  dot com is his website very informative stuff and watch him on rt
[3:56:02.080 --> 3:56:05.360]  as well as press tv does weekly television shows that are
[3:56:05.360 --> 3:56:10.160]  some of the most popular on those channels uh... but uh... let's go back to
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:13.760]  your phone calls uh... briefly answering steve's question
[3:56:13.760 --> 3:56:16.640]  steven i don't know how you get involved quote in government start fighting
[3:56:16.640 --> 3:56:20.640]  tyranny form your own group go to city council speak out start a blog
[3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:24.000]  and you'll learn and get better as you go uh... ian in england you're on the
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:28.240]  air with questions for max keiser
[3:56:28.240 --> 3:56:33.920]  i don't know hello all beyond this is airstrip trip to calling over go ahead
[3:56:33.920 --> 3:56:40.080]  but i don't know it's good i'm good to be on uh... you know it's good to hear max
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:45.440]  keiser i've always been uh... an interest in interested listeners opinions and
[3:56:45.440 --> 3:56:49.120]  of course you're on uh... with regards to the the british
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:52.720]  uh... parliamentary catastrophe that's been going on
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:55.920]  i people think that they can't make a difference but we've demonstrated that
[3:56:55.920 --> 3:57:00.080]  we've effectively created a constitutional crisis here
[3:57:00.080 --> 3:57:05.680]  that there was nobody who was willing to back up the the parliamentary process
[3:57:05.680 --> 3:57:09.440]  and i think that that's that certainly a statement which which people can take a
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:14.960]  little bit of pleasure from if not a great deal of influence from
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:19.760]  so if they demonstrate the fact that these people don't have any kind of
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:23.280]  mandate to to operate the way they have been doing that's right all three of the
[3:57:23.280 --> 3:57:27.120]  big parties are hated your take on what's happening in england max
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:32.000]  yeah they did they triggered a crisis a constitutional crisis as as your caller
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:37.520]  uh... calls it and because in the uk they become very adept at strategic
[3:57:37.520 --> 3:57:42.720]  voting so everybody uh... on on the web kind of shares information
[3:57:42.720 --> 3:57:46.240]  to try to uh... swing the local elections
[3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:49.920]  in a strategic way so they might vote for somebody they don't really want
[3:57:49.920 --> 3:57:53.840]  if it's strategic toward a bigger goal and the people have really organized
[3:57:53.840 --> 3:57:56.400]  themselves in this way now it's interesting when the new coalition
[3:57:56.400 --> 3:57:59.760]  started this uh... tori liberal democrat coalition
[3:57:59.760 --> 3:58:03.600]  it's very interesting because because they uh... what the coalition government
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:06.640]  didn't have a majority they had a problem because in the house of lords
[3:58:06.640 --> 3:58:10.400]  uh... they didn't have enough lords uh... to back up their proposals so what
[3:58:10.400 --> 3:58:13.920]  they did yesterday is they simply uh... with a stroke of a pen
[3:58:13.920 --> 3:58:17.360]  increased the number of lords in the house of lords by one hundred
[3:58:17.360 --> 3:58:21.040]  now for anyone in the u.s. that would send a chill down your spine
[3:58:21.040 --> 3:58:24.560]  because of course we fought a war to get rid of it to get rid to uh...
[3:58:24.560 --> 3:58:27.600]  you know escape the lords uh... in the house of lords
[3:58:27.600 --> 3:58:30.960]  but they're still active and they're still part of a major government the
[3:58:30.960 --> 3:58:33.120]  u.s. ally that's where the bank of england was
[3:58:33.120 --> 3:58:36.640]  established in 1694 which is what they're not hereditary lords
[3:58:36.640 --> 3:58:39.440]  they're not a redditor five more minutes with max geyser straight ahead
[3:58:39.440 --> 3:58:55.440]  more your calls thanks again
