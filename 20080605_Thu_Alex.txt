[00:00.000 --> 00:07.480]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.480 --> 00:16.280]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies
[00:16.280 --> 00:21.760]  and gentlemen welcome it is Thursday June 5th 2008 I am not Alex Jones I am
[00:21.760 --> 00:24.600]  Jason Burmese and I'll be sitting in for the rest of the week I was here with
[00:24.600 --> 00:28.800]  yesterday with a ton of Bilderberg stuff huge breaking news from Bilderberg
[00:28.800 --> 00:33.080]  Alex is out there there's a story posted over at info wars.com he was on
[00:33.080 --> 00:37.320]  coast-to-coast AM last night and after the short segment we'll play that for
[00:37.320 --> 00:41.160]  you Alex should be joining us in about a half an hour but they had some kind of a
[00:41.160 --> 00:44.340]  fire drill last night they kicked everybody out probably did another
[00:44.340 --> 00:51.200]  sweep and just huge news from Bilderberg also we got this email today which I
[00:51.200 --> 00:58.720]  thought was pretty hilarious if true and I think it is true the DOJ placed an
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.800]  order for 125 iPods with Bilderberg 2008 engraved on the backs shipping to
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.920]  Chantilly Virginia they're gonna be late so they are freaking out I just thought
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.560]  it was kind of funny well I think it's not that funny that the Department of
[01:13.560 --> 01:20.280]  Justice is purchasing iPods for the elite and they're engraving it for their
[01:20.280 --> 01:23.560]  little club but of course Bilderberg doesn't even exist Alex must be at
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.280]  some fake meeting right now or making it up because Bilderberg doesn't exist
[01:27.280 --> 01:32.080]  there is no shadow shadowy group of elitists that actually run the country
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.760]  right well that's not what the Washington was at Washington Times or
[01:37.760 --> 01:41.200]  when I was I think it was Washington Post actually did that huge article just
[01:41.200 --> 01:45.920]  a couple weeks ago where they were going through a Roth corp's book Roth
[01:45.920 --> 01:51.280]  Corp's book and you know Bilderberg is one of those organizations in which
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.360]  decisions are made and the vast majority of these guys are white Anglo
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.400]  sacks and males however you know there are there are a few exceptions I think
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.520]  you said something like six percent of them were actually women and that's why
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.640]  Hillary Clinton went in 2006 to the Bilderberg meeting although she denies
[02:08.640 --> 02:11.320]  it denies even knowing what it is we're gonna play that clip later on because
[02:11.320 --> 02:16.040]  we're gonna have a student scholars for 9-11 truth on in the final hour
[02:16.040 --> 02:22.240]  Justin Martell and Justin Martell Mike Jackman Eric Jackman and these guys
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.400]  have confronted every presidential candidate this year Barack Obama John
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.440]  McCain and of course Hillary Clinton and when Hillary Clinton is asked about the
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.120]  Bilderberg group she denies any knowledge of what it is Mike Jackman then
[02:38.120 --> 02:41.080]  says well what about your husband your husband went to Bilderberg and she kind
[02:41.080 --> 02:44.240]  of nods and she's just like I can't help you I don't know what this meeting is
[02:44.240 --> 02:49.600]  well yesterday on the show we played the clip of Clinton actually talking about
[02:49.600 --> 02:53.440]  Bilderberg group and how indeed he did go to Bilderberg group and how indeed
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.680]  they do set policy there and he said something about how he wasn't able to
[02:57.680 --> 03:00.920]  set any policy for NAFTA that already those decisions had already been made
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.400]  before he got there he was just there to sit down with some Europeans to talk
[03:04.400 --> 03:07.800]  about Russia and what was gonna happen there well this is all about
[03:07.800 --> 03:14.640]  globalization and that's why I've got to bring up the fact that Kevin Rudd who I
[03:14.640 --> 03:20.520]  believe is the president of Australia is now calling for an Asia Pacific Union
[03:20.520 --> 03:27.200]  similar to the European Union and he wants this done by 2020 and he has
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.360]  appointed veteran diplomat Richard Wolcott one of his mentors as a
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.960]  very as a special envoy to lobby regional leaders over the body you see
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.720]  we have the European Union we're on the verge of a North American Union the Pan
[03:42.720 --> 03:47.520]  American Union's been around for a while okay they really want this Asia Asia
[03:47.520 --> 03:51.840]  Pacific Union and when our job is done in the Middle East we will have a
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.840]  Eurasian Union and when we have these you know four or five huge bodies of mass
[03:58.840 --> 04:05.280]  then then we can have a global governing body a new world order if you will
[04:05.280 --> 04:12.680]  that is outside of the UN I will be given vast powers I mean the UN has
[04:12.680 --> 04:16.840]  nothing compared to what they want to give it and our Constitution Bill of
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.120]  Rights are done sovereignty is gone and we're gonna have to we're just gonna
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.320]  have to live under this great new tyrannical rule I can't wait sounds like

[10:33.560 --> 10:38.680]  into the interview but again the moment the phone rang with Tom Danhizer the
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.520]  moment the phone rang the guys answered it I'm standing there the alarm goes off

[13:03.720 --> 13:10.440]  who they are Kissinger John Edwards let me try to think about some other guys

[13:16.480 --> 13:21.320]  course David Rockefeller is there every year George Pataki was there in 2006 on

[13:44.760 --> 13:49.400]  Alex but I guess here I go I'm still going I have two comments and her class
[13:49.400 --> 13:56.400]  first comment is who changes my party the best tool of waking so up to the 911

[14:00.280 --> 14:06.640]  man um if this TV show does happen you gotta be in it somehow you gotta be like
[14:06.640 --> 14:15.200]  the Ed McMahon thanks man I appreciate that the third request since I'm going
[14:15.200 --> 14:19.600]  to this Bilderberg thing I'm gonna be alone I'm sure a lot of other people are
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.600]  to and I'm just hoping you can pass word on to Alex maybe to give some advice to
[14:24.600 --> 14:28.160]  those of us traveling there that the first time you know not really know what
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.800]  to do if you just give advice to sure well let me give you let me give you
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.680]  some advice right now um you know I talked to Luke Radowski late last night
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.760]  and there's some breaking news on that Gary Talis arrest they went to court
[14:38.760 --> 14:43.200]  yesterday actually and the prosecutors tried to say that Gary had put personal
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.240]  information of the other man up on the web which is a total lie and they're
[14:47.240 --> 14:51.080]  they're going for me they offered him two years probation yesterday but Luke
[14:51.080 --> 14:55.000]  left last night I mean late night I think I was talking to him something like I
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.760]  don't know 10 30 11 30 Easterings like yeah I'm about take off for an hour here's
[14:58.760 --> 15:02.720]  what's gonna happen the way that that hotel is set up it has a long driveway
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.240]  it's at an intersection of about four streets I believe they're not gonna let
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.440]  you anywhere near anything but that intersection I would imagine that's
[15:09.440 --> 15:14.320]  where Alex and crew will be to try to tape those attending that's your best
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.840]  shot what you're gonna try to do is get the faces of those on camera that are in
[15:19.840 --> 15:23.760]  the cars because that's it's gonna be a a passing moment man you're literally gonna
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.320]  have 30 seconds to try to get these guys on camera and then try to match a
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.240]  face to a name now your only other shot to try to get these guys on camera or
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.240]  see what these elite guys are up to is to troll the local you know aristocratic
[15:37.240 --> 15:41.800]  bar scene I've been down in Virginia before and you would not believe like
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.920]  all these little restaurants bars they have like like little idle ships little
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.360]  pictures of like Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keen and all these Washington
[15:49.360 --> 15:52.320]  insiders when they were younger when they were in college when they were just
[15:52.320 --> 15:56.120]  starting out and that's where these guys tend to like to hang out so I would say
[15:56.120 --> 15:59.880]  go around there try to get as much footage as you possibly can and of
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.160]  course you know try to get them driving in and out of Bilderberg
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.640]  new battery for my camera it's all charged up so yeah hopefully I got a
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.000]  steady hand all right Godspeed Dion we're gonna jump to Bart in Houston Bartie
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.960]  with us you with us Bart oh hey sorry I'm clicking out for a second that's okay
[16:17.960 --> 16:24.200]  yeah you know this Bilderberg conference I really feel is probably one of the
[16:24.200 --> 16:28.520]  most I mean each one has been important for what it's done for world policy and
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.440]  what the elite and the establishment are trying to accomplish but everywhere I
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.120]  turn and I'm a complete info media junkie I mean this is basically what I
[16:38.120 --> 16:45.160]  spend all of my time doing it every corner from every sector everyone feels
[16:45.160 --> 16:49.320]  the acceleration happening right now I mean these last seven years these last
[16:49.320 --> 16:52.720]  eight years have just been this crazy roller coaster ride as we're just
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.720]  accelerating into the new world order but I think everyone can definitely feel
[16:57.720 --> 17:04.840]  that this next 12 months I think that the illusion of normalcy that has been
[17:04.840 --> 17:08.800]  used and controlled so much of the public is really going to start fading away
[17:08.800 --> 17:15.360]  and that it's it's absolutely critical for every one of us in every way possible
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.880]  to accelerate everything that we're doing in the info war I absolutely agree
[17:20.880 --> 17:26.120]  with you I mean we're on the verge of $5 a gallon nationwide expect that in the
[17:26.120 --> 17:28.720]  next couple months I'm pretty sure that's what they're gonna be discussing
[17:28.720 --> 17:31.840]  they're gonna be discussing gas prices they're gonna be discussing how the
[17:31.840 --> 17:34.960]  presidential election is gonna go they're gonna be discussing possibilities
[17:34.960 --> 17:39.520]  and really probabilities for our vice president I my money's still on Edwards
[17:39.520 --> 17:42.960]  just because he's an insider with those guys it'll be almost guaranteed if he
[17:42.960 --> 17:46.200]  actually shows up to the bill that we're meeting this year they tend to like him
[17:46.200 --> 17:51.400]  I believe because he's well-spoken he's a good-looking guy and you know he he
[17:51.400 --> 17:55.200]  fools a lot of people with his rhetoric much like Obama does you know Obama's
[17:55.200 --> 17:58.480]  great speaker he doesn't say much when he speaks but he gets the you know with
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.480]  slogans like you know change you can vote for change you can believe in people
[18:03.480 --> 18:07.600]  love that stuff whether it's change or not they change that's good we need change
[18:07.600 --> 18:11.480]  so you know you we have to keep a close eye on what Bilderberg's gonna do here
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.960]  remember back in 2002 they decided that they were gonna invade Iraq in 2003 I
[18:15.960 --> 18:20.640]  had Estalon yesterday saying that there's no way they're gonna go into Iran you
[18:20.640 --> 18:24.200]  know I'd like to believe him but when you have you know the president of
[18:24.200 --> 18:28.080]  Australia going into how they're about to build an Asian Union you know when
[18:28.080 --> 18:31.000]  they're building a North American Union the European Union's already there the
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.640]  Pan-American Union has been formed you know you've got to wonder if they're
[18:35.640 --> 18:39.360]  really gonna push for this Eurasian Union and it seems like you know the
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.560]  only two countries that are really stopping that Eurasian Union are Iran
[18:43.560 --> 18:47.080]  and possibly Saudi Arabia but we're buddies with Saudi Arabia at this point
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.960]  so we'll see you go ahead well I was gonna say if you look you know there
[18:51.960 --> 18:56.880]  really is a schism within the New World Order right now I had a chance to
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.960]  interview Dr. Joseph Nye a couple months back when he came to Houston I don't
[19:01.960 --> 19:06.800]  not many people know who he is he's the founder of neoliberalism and when I
[19:06.800 --> 19:11.960]  interviewed him you know he talked about how at least their group understood
[19:11.960 --> 19:15.720]  they had pushed it too far and I went back and I've read everything that he's
[19:15.720 --> 19:19.680]  written for the last year and it goes exactly through that about the elite are
[19:19.680 --> 19:26.120]  saying that they need a John F. Kennedy they need an FDR right now to channel the
[19:26.120 --> 19:32.000]  energy back into their system because of the widespread you know the widespread
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.360]  resistance and I think they think that Obama is that guy a lot of people are
[19:35.360 --> 19:38.240]  getting behind him I thank you for the call Bart on the other end I'm gonna
[19:38.240 --> 19:41.960]  talk about Plum Island and how they may be moving that no for those who don't
[19:41.960 --> 19:46.520]  know what Plum Island is well if this bio warfare lab that specializes in foot
[19:46.520 --> 19:49.360]  and mouth and all these other great diseases and they want to expand and
[19:49.360 --> 19:54.840]  move it this is the Alex Jones show we'll be back after these do you know
[19:54.840 --> 19:59.200]  the truth about cancer treatments do you realize that with all presently
[19:59.200 --> 20:04.040]  accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly
[20:04.040 --> 20:09.440]  fighting to survive the treatment do you realize that mutilating surgery burning
[20:09.440 --> 20:15.480]  and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary but now it's
[20:15.480 --> 20:21.160]  cancer's turn to die with lace med inks patented methodology without cutting

[21:48.160 --> 21:53.640]  sharing networks bring down the new world order prison planet TV hello Ted
[21:53.640 --> 21:56.640]  Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[21:56.640 --> 22:00.560]  and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic
[22:00.560 --> 22:04.360]  events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on
[22:04.360 --> 22:07.720]  the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional
[22:07.720 --> 22:11.480]  reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[22:11.480 --> 22:15.400]  for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the
[22:15.400 --> 22:19.280]  government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed
[22:19.280 --> 22:23.480]  economy a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks
[22:23.480 --> 22:27.240]  to increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.440]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.840]  strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.200]  be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently
[22:40.200 --> 22:45.400]  have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for
[22:45.400 --> 22:54.480]  more information call 1-800-686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237 did you know the
[22:54.480 --> 22:58.080]  accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease
[22:58.080 --> 23:02.240]  such as cancer or diabetes acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat
[23:02.240 --> 23:06.680]  what we drink the environment and our high stress lifestyles it's these choices
[23:06.680 --> 23:10.760]  that cause decreased energy weight gain and eventually disease the easiest way
[23:10.760 --> 23:15.240]  to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water at

[24:28.600 --> 24:31.760]  want to get at me and I got like 50 friend requests yesterday and I went
[24:31.760 --> 24:34.440]  through every single one of them folks in fact some of these stories that I'm
[24:34.440 --> 24:38.240]  talking about right now are from those people that contacted me over my space
[24:38.240 --> 24:43.320]  it's myspace.com slash Jason Burmese and I really want to thank our inside
[24:43.320 --> 24:49.120]  source over at MAC.com who scooped this and said yo the Department of Justice
[24:49.120 --> 24:55.400]  just ordered 125 iPods with Bilderberg 2008 engraved on the back shipping to
[24:55.400 --> 25:00.000]  Chantilly Virginia so our tax dollars I mean we're the ones that support the
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.800]  Department of Justice that's me and you folks okay with our federal tax dollars
[25:04.800 --> 25:10.400]  we're buying the elite the scum of the earth the people who can afford an iPod
[25:10.400 --> 25:14.160]  anyway nice little engraved ones to let them know that there are rulers our
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.520]  masters it's really nice it's great I can't wait so I'm so happy we're doing
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.120]  this I got another really big story there's a place called Plum Island in
[25:25.120 --> 25:30.200]  New York okay now this is supposedly an animal disease center it's been around
[25:30.200 --> 25:37.640]  since 1954 it used to be under the Department of Agriculture now in 2002
[25:37.640 --> 25:41.800]  after the 9-11 attacks and after Homeland Security was established Homeland
[25:41.800 --> 25:46.160]  Security took this facility over now this is the foot-and-mouth facility and
[25:46.160 --> 25:53.040]  they do all sorts of biological testing I think it has a biosafety level of
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.760]  three agriculture laboratory facilities we've had whistleblowers in 2003 who
[25:58.760 --> 26:02.600]  voiced concerned about safety at the facility and were fired now this
[26:02.600 --> 26:06.520]  whistleblower actually discussed their concerns with aides of Senator Hillary
[26:06.520 --> 26:10.000]  Clinton so nothing was done you see Senator Hillary Clinton is there to
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.040]  grandstand and try to get elected and not really help anybody or look out for
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.640]  the best interest of the public now Plum Island the reason I'm bringing this up
[26:20.640 --> 26:25.080]  is because they have a new facility and they're trying to make it what's it
[26:25.080 --> 26:28.720]  going to be called it's a replacement facility and it's still not still not
[26:28.720 --> 26:32.520]  operational yet it's going to be the national bio and agro defense facility
[26:32.520 --> 26:39.120]  the NB AF and they want to put this thing remember this is live stock bio
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.440]  warfare foot-and-mouth disease all this other they want to put it next to live
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.840]  stock in the middle of the country sound a little fishy to you well it sounded a
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.400]  little fishy to me and it even sounded a little fishy to the controlled
[26:50.400 --> 26:57.200]  mainstream media the Associated Press let's play the clip at the tip of New
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.040]  York's Long Island is a place reachable only by boat or air this is Plum
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.960]  Island isolated for a reason it's where the government does research on the
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.840]  highly infectious foot-and-mouth virus far from any lifestyle but now a germ
[27:13.840 --> 27:19.680]  so feared it was kept offshore by law may be coming on shore the Bush
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.280]  administration is likely to move the outdated lab at Plum Island to one of
[27:24.280 --> 27:30.080]  five sites around the country a proposal raising questions will a new state of the
[27:30.080 --> 27:35.240]  art lab be safe enough to allow research anywhere near commercial livestock it
[27:35.240 --> 27:40.640]  goes against the main aspect of the safety program for the past 50 years it's
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.040]  gonna have to be in somebody's backyard there's money at stake here with a lab
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.040]  bringing economic development helping university researchers there is fear to
[27:50.040 --> 27:55.480]  of deadly germs escaping and spreading the last us outbreak of foot-and-mouth
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.680]  was in 1929 a more recent outbreak in Britain led to the slaughter of millions
[28:00.680 --> 28:05.680]  of animals if a single cow comes down with foot-and-mouth all agricultural
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.240]  exports from the US could be halted animals slaughter John Studeman is a
[28:11.240 --> 28:16.560]  cattle farmer near Athens Georgia a site for the proposed lab as long as it's a
[28:16.560 --> 28:23.240]  key a secure facility I see no problem with it being right here this husband
[28:23.240 --> 28:29.080]  and wife team of activists doesn't want it our basic concern is that the
[28:29.080 --> 28:35.800]  economic benefit to Athens has been oversold and the safety concerns have
[28:35.800 --> 28:41.280]  been understated the lab could be opened by 2014 Congress wants to know if the
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.640]  movie's safe demanding documents from the Department of Homeland Security some
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.600]  things they do at Plum Island I would not want to see on the main line like
[28:49.600 --> 28:55.080]  hoof and mouth these things right it's just too important very highly
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.800]  contagious homeland security officials say the lab will be safe claiming in a
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.120]  statement studies are being done to evaluate the impacts of hypothetical
[29:04.120 --> 29:09.520]  foot-and-mouth disease releases at each lab site for 10 years Cory Brown worked
[29:09.520 --> 29:13.840]  at Plum Island nowadays with the kinds of technology that we have for bio
[29:13.840 --> 29:18.400]  containment it's no longer necessary to be on an island but the former director
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.480]  of Plum Island worry all right we'll play the rest of that clip on the other

[33:22.400 --> 33:26.640]  know there's a nice little elitist meeting going on right now and it's gonna
[33:26.640 --> 33:32.960]  take place this weekend 125 of the top officials elitist if you will not even
[33:32.960 --> 33:35.840]  so some of our behind-the-scenes officials like Rockefeller there he
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.080]  doesn't really hold a actual government title he just starts all these
[33:39.080 --> 33:45.160]  foundations and overseas operations I guess and Alex is down there getting
[33:45.160 --> 33:50.160]  the scoop meanwhile you and I are paying for expensive in the graved iPods for
[33:50.160 --> 33:54.760]  them isn't that lovely the Department of Justice buys iPods for Bilderberg but
[33:54.760 --> 33:59.400]  they don't set policy it's more a vacation thing right come on no one's
[33:59.400 --> 34:03.200]  buying into that anymore anyway we were playing a clip about Plum Island now
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.320]  this is a bio research facility foot and mouth disease other diseases and we
[34:09.320 --> 34:11.680]  didn't get to play the very end of that so we're gonna play the last minute of
[34:11.680 --> 34:15.800]  that clip and what's interesting is the people that work there aren't even
[34:15.800 --> 34:23.880]  allowed to have pets because they may actually spread disease by breathing on
[34:23.880 --> 34:27.240]  their cat or dog and they're not allowed to go to zoos for like a week within
[34:27.240 --> 34:30.240]  working in the facility but they want to move it right next to a cattle ranch in
[34:30.240 --> 34:33.680]  San Antonio Texas you actually got to see the clip to see the four little
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.520]  places George is one of them Texas is another I want to say Manhattan cat
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.160]  Kansas is another and I'm not sure what the fourth facility is but let's uh let's
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.560]  bring that clip right back in and play it up done to evaluate the impacts of
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.760]  hypothetical foot and mouth disease releases at each lab site for 10 years
[34:53.760 --> 34:58.840]  Cory Brown worked at Plum Island nowadays with the kinds of technology that we
[34:58.840 --> 35:03.080]  have for bio containment it's no longer necessary to be on an island but the
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.960]  former director of Plum Island worries lab workers here carry the virus on
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.600]  their breath meaning they can't have animals and must wait before going to a
[35:12.600 --> 35:18.760]  zoo or circus it seems a little odd to be thinking of locating the lab in a
[35:18.760 --> 35:22.160]  region where there's a lot of agricultural animals for their part
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.680]  cattle growers want a new lab to fight outbreaks do research whether on the
[35:26.680 --> 35:32.400]  mainland or on this dot of land called Plum Island for the Associated Press I'm
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.600]  John Segan so there it is the former director actually saying no dice I don't
[35:37.600 --> 35:40.960]  want it outside of an island what are you crazy they carried on their breath
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.480]  for God's sakes but he's going to be ignored they they want an outbreak they
[35:45.480 --> 35:48.360]  want martial law they'd love to put us in their little FEMA camps that they've
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.840]  built you know Oliver North can sit there all day and say that the continuity
[35:52.840 --> 35:57.880]  of government program or COG is to have a constitutional government but that's
[35:57.880 --> 36:03.520]  just bull man all right I'm told that Alex Jones is on the line so let's just
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.000]  cut right to Alex Alex are you with us Jason yes I'm only on sale I'm outside
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.080]  the Bollardberg Group meeting is it clear yeah yeah you're very clear right now
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.760]  did you hear about what happened on coast to coast I am last night we played
[36:17.760 --> 36:21.800]  the clip in the in the second segment actually Alex okay it got even worse
[36:21.800 --> 36:29.240]  ladies and gentlemen let me give you a basic rundown here we went downstairs
[36:29.240 --> 36:32.200]  we were going around looking at the meeting rooms they were setting up had
[36:32.200 --> 36:35.160]  security harassing us asking us questions we weren't even you know
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.160]  videotaping where they could see they're right we walk in the room the second we
[36:39.160 --> 36:42.960]  walk in the room coast to coast calls about five minutes early the alarm goes
[36:42.960 --> 36:49.640]  off all over the hotel but going back we had been downstairs 10 15 minutes
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.320]  before and the head of security at night walks up and says hey have you ever
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.600]  heard of people pulling fire alarms you ever heard people doing that and trying
[36:57.600 --> 37:03.880]  to rob hotels and I said that's strange and then we walked around about 10
[37:03.880 --> 37:07.520]  more minutes went back upstairs right as we walk in the room the alarm goes off I
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.240]  think they may have been trying to set us up I'm not sure can confirm that but
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.760]  the point is just thank God we were back in the room there was a you know
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.640]  international independent film channel crew there so we're in the room get in
[37:17.640 --> 37:20.920]  the room right as it goes off right as the phone rings the second the phone
[37:20.920 --> 37:24.800]  rings I walk in the room the phone rings and the alarm goes off it's going
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.960]  yeah could you hear it on the radio we could hear it we could hear you when
[37:28.960 --> 37:31.480]  you when you told George that and you put it out into the hall you can
[37:31.480 --> 37:38.480]  absolutely hear the alarm okay so then I realized that after the five minutes I
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.760]  had to get out we go outside there's like 200 guests in the front there were
[37:44.760 --> 37:48.520]  billenberg dropping the people off right now but this was last night at about
[37:48.520 --> 37:59.200]  110 Eastern 12 10 central and as we walk out we don't even have our cameras on
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.080]  but Rob has one in his hand and there's Japanese people taking photos there's
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.240]  like 50 video cameras out you know the guests that they all kicked out this
[38:06.240 --> 38:13.560]  morning and they secure the same guy that brought up the fire alarm before it
[38:13.560 --> 38:18.120]  happened 10 minutes before it runs up to me and says I'm gonna f you both up if
[38:18.120 --> 38:23.400]  you videotape do you hear me Alex and Rob well Rob's name is not on any of the
[38:23.400 --> 38:29.560]  hotel rooms names it's under Aaron's name he knew our names he knew everything
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.160]  and he said I've called the police and they're coming and they're gonna f you
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.240]  up and I said well you just better think about that false charges and I said look
[38:37.240 --> 38:39.720]  all these people videotape and you're not saying anything to them he just said
[38:39.720 --> 38:43.840]  listen I'm gonna f you up and so then the fire trucks show up 20 minutes goes
[38:43.840 --> 38:48.200]  by we go back up in the room in a pen and film channels video taping out the
[38:48.200 --> 38:55.400]  window as all this happens down in the courtyard caught that I mean I've got a
[38:55.400 --> 39:03.120]  bunch of notes here just incredible incredible things happened here then
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.440]  this morning some of the billenbergs arrive always early before they actually
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.280]  locked the hotel down that's what we've experienced the other years covering
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.400]  covering those that have been there and they start playing some national anthem
[39:15.400 --> 39:19.480]  something Spanish national anthem and police cars pull in and in between them
[39:19.480 --> 39:24.080]  pulls in a big black Mercedes and this guy gets out real fast like a $5,000
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.120]  suit he looks like one of the Spanish officials that we've seen at other
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.320]  events then we saw this big computer company owner guru who we've tracked
[39:31.320 --> 39:38.280]  before he shows up but then it's it's it's noon about 35 40 minutes ago we
[39:38.280 --> 39:41.040]  have to get out of the hotel because they've been calling the room and that
[39:41.040 --> 39:43.760]  morning we were walking around the bottom and they came up and said who are
[39:43.760 --> 39:46.960]  you what's your names and then they said they knew our names and they said we
[39:46.960 --> 39:50.680]  can't wait till 12 o'clock and then we're gonna throw you out of here we
[39:50.680 --> 39:55.480]  might just arrest you right now so we're up there getting out right at noon we go
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.560]  down blacks and hands are pulling in right in front of us with huge bees on
[39:59.560 --> 40:03.760]  the window I even got a photo of this we jumped in the car we've got the
[40:03.760 --> 40:07.880]  independent film channel with us and in our big van we drive out a big white
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.440]  dodge today on those new ones maybe blue we got photos of this we have on the
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.200]  web tonight he follows us out makes 10 turns with us following us around a
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.360]  parking lot we get out he runs off in parks starts following us again we
[40:22.360 --> 40:25.320]  follow him again he then goes into restaurants watching us up the window
[40:25.320 --> 40:28.520]  by the way there's guys right now watching me across the street taking
[40:28.520 --> 40:31.760]  photos of us and you know we're like a mile away
[40:31.760 --> 40:37.640]  incidentally there's watered area all around several acres in between the
[40:37.640 --> 40:41.480]  hotel on the road coming up the main entrance we saw about 75 great info
[40:41.480 --> 40:45.280]  warriors out there videotaping police everywhere we're about to go back out
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.960]  there more Bilderberg group people starting to arrive then we drove around
[40:50.960 --> 40:54.360]  the outside of the hotel just getting out of the sky following us you know on
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.200]  the main roads and there are people all at the intersections videotaping any
[40:58.200 --> 41:03.640]  blacks and ends or any cars patriots so there's like just a fog of info warriors
[41:03.640 --> 41:07.760]  out there totally overwhelming and there's all these huge army intelligence

[41:11.040 --> 41:14.600]  pounds running around with earpieces everywhere in suits and in plain clothes
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.800]  watching us following us they're all over the streets I mean this is this this
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.120]  is a complete spectacle that's going on here Rob come here Rob's got a lot of
[41:23.120 --> 41:26.480]  points he wants to make because there's so many I don't know how we're gonna make
[41:26.480 --> 41:30.920]  them all Alex were you aware we just got this thing in from an email earlier
[41:30.920 --> 41:35.360]  today from somebody over at McIntosh emailed us that the Department of
[41:35.360 --> 41:41.720]  Justice actually placed an order for 125 iPods with engraved Bilderberg 2008 on
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.400]  them to ship to Chantilly Virginia and they're gonna be late so our tax dollars
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.720]  pay for their new iPods Alex well listen here's another part of the story I go to
[41:50.720 --> 41:56.320]  the gift shop to get some Gatorade this morning about two hours ago I walk
[41:56.320 --> 41:59.560]  in and there's these big offices behind it and I'm getting Gatorade and I hear
[41:59.560 --> 42:03.880]  bring in that satellite send in those lines that's not how the army does it sir
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.400]  we feed them to the main codex that's QL seven scrambler needs to be fed hold on
[42:08.400 --> 42:10.920]  I'm getting another one of the calls he's moving he's moving out of the room
[42:10.920 --> 42:15.240]  and then they look at me and slam the door and I I'm sitting there you know
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.240]  with a little bitty counter and then I was walking to the hotel every room is
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.880]  just jam packed with Spooks it is just it is just amazing to constant constant
[42:25.880 --> 42:35.080]  harassment Bob where you going okay no no no wow we got people on us just

[42:44.200 --> 42:48.320]  here there's people following us right now and videotaping us we're we're
[42:48.320 --> 42:53.040]  here a little steakhouse just ran in to get something to drink trying to have
[42:53.040 --> 42:58.120]  time to call into you and and Rob just didn't have his camera outside so he
[42:58.120 --> 43:03.680]  ran in to get it to get them okay Rob just go ahead and you give Burma's
[43:03.680 --> 43:07.280]  about a three-minute report on what you've seen hey Jason how are you good
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.880]  man how you doing Rob let's let's hear what's going on right now buddy all
[43:10.880 --> 43:19.920]  right well basically Alex basically summed up up until just now but what
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.680]  happened to me on Wednesday morning when I first arrived it was that morning I
[43:25.680 --> 43:30.680]  got up pretty early started roaming around you know just not much security
[43:30.680 --> 43:35.960]  was there visibly on Wednesday morning until I passed this one office where all
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.280]  these security guards swung their heads around and took a look at me as I passed
[43:40.280 --> 43:46.560]  them by right and then yes then when I went back I heard this one guy saying
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.040]  talking about all these teams of security and he pointed me out he's like
[43:50.040 --> 43:54.320]  who what about that guy I saw that guy roaming around is he part of your team
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.080]  and I kept walking and the guy turns around he's like you come here and I
[43:59.080 --> 44:04.360]  was like no and I kept walking and all these guys it's like this circular area
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.120]  in the lobby filled with restaurants and doors just opened up and these people
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.480]  just came out he's like this morning when she said we're gonna get yeah this
[44:13.480 --> 44:17.760]  morning is the same security guard or of that same like security force all these
[44:17.760 --> 44:21.280]  people came out that day and told me turn the camera up turn the camera off
[44:21.280 --> 44:26.760]  and this one guy said security is gonna be increasingly get worse if days go on
[44:26.760 --> 44:30.960]  well this morning I went downstairs just to get a cup of coffee and have
[44:30.960 --> 44:36.920]  anything on me and this one a security guard this woman who looked at us the
[44:36.920 --> 44:42.800]  day before basically you know comes up to me and starts you know walks right up
[44:42.800 --> 44:49.760]  to me and you know I was like can I help you you know and she says you know I
[44:49.760 --> 44:55.040]  saw you looking at me and I was like well you approached me and she's like
[44:55.040 --> 44:59.600]  well are you a guest here and I'm like well obviously I was here yesterday and
[44:59.600 --> 45:06.880]  basically she said to me you know well I can't wait to throw you out you know
[45:06.880 --> 45:12.720]  12 noon she asked me for my room number and all the time last night and yeah also
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.920]  the alarm last night was extremely unusual just as we walked through the
[45:17.920 --> 45:23.440]  door I mean literally yeah just as we walked through the door this guy starts
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.360]  talking about fire alarms when we were in the restaurant below and yeah it was
[45:30.360 --> 45:34.280]  two security guards and they were talking about they told us yeah they told us
[45:34.280 --> 45:38.920]  a story about somebody pulling a fire alarm well we get back up to the our
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.240]  room and just as Alex opens the door literally turning the knob on the door
[45:43.240 --> 45:47.760]  the fire alarm goes off and this was like one minute before Alex was supposed
[45:47.760 --> 45:52.760]  to be on coast to coast and yeah the phone rang just as the alarm goes off
[45:52.760 --> 45:58.520]  just as we enter the room it was really strange we go outside the I go outside
[45:58.520 --> 46:01.800]  with the camera we're out there for about one or two minutes when this guy
[46:01.800 --> 46:07.800]  slams my slams my camera shut and he says I see you taping one more time the
[46:07.800 --> 46:10.760]  cops are coming I was like you're gonna call the cops we know everybody's
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.160]  taping their fire alarms everybody's taping the guy fire engines fire engines
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.400]  this and that people are like outside everybody's taking snapping pictures
[46:19.400 --> 46:24.360]  taking video but the guy would not leave my foot he wouldn't leave he knew our
[46:24.360 --> 46:29.040]  names he would just would not leave us Alex asked me he's like yo go that way
[46:29.040 --> 46:32.160]  well I would say you guys are lucky that they didn't plant something in your
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.480]  room during this alarm I mean obviously they know who you are obviously you're
[46:35.480 --> 46:38.960]  a target obviously they wanted you out of that room I mean I'm just glad that
[46:38.960 --> 46:42.680]  they didn't plant something in that room well who knows if they did or didn't
[46:42.680 --> 46:46.200]  here here's Alex all right how long do we have to break Burma we got about four
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.200]  minutes Alex okay listen I'm gonna get back in position over in front and I
[46:50.200 --> 46:52.920]  know you're gonna have Bob Chapman on the bottom of the next hour in about 35
[46:52.920 --> 46:57.600]  minutes maybe at the end of that next hour either within 40 minutes or within

[47:02.520 --> 47:05.160]  give you a full report on what's happening when you talk to some of the
[47:05.160 --> 47:07.560]  people that are there on the ground the problem is anywhere on the hotel cell
[47:07.560 --> 47:12.120]  phones don't work they they've definitely got some type of system going I've read
[47:12.120 --> 47:15.280]  that at high security events they do this remember whenever Bush a couple
[47:15.280 --> 47:18.400]  years ago for Thanksgiving flew a bunch of reporters on a secret mission over to
[47:18.400 --> 47:22.040]  Iraq and the Associated Press reported they had to put their batteries in one
[47:22.040 --> 47:26.600]  bag that with the Secret Service and the other phones in another bag because you
[47:26.600 --> 47:29.240]  know they designed it so people can dial in and listen the government can do
[47:29.240 --> 47:32.040]  that they don't want us doing that but I'm telling you man this is like you

[52:17.400 --> 52:23.000]  others and deny the teaching of the book who really knows but he really did it
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.760]  file the lawsuit against God Nebraska state senator longest-serving state
[52:28.760 --> 52:34.280]  senator Ernie Chambers vehemously filed a lawsuit in Douglas County district
[52:34.280 --> 52:40.120]  court alleging God caused and I quote widespread death and destruction and
[52:40.120 --> 52:45.480]  terrorization of millions upon millions of the earth's inhabitants in quote and
[52:45.480 --> 52:50.640]  guess what then happened to him something he wasn't expecting happened he
[52:50.640 --> 52:55.800]  happened to get an answer I now read from an associated press article quote a
[52:55.800 --> 53:00.600]  legislator who filed a lawsuit against God has gotten something he might not
[53:00.600 --> 53:06.360]  have expected a response one of two court filings from God came Wednesday
[53:06.360 --> 53:10.640]  under other worldly circumstances according to John friend clerk of the
[53:10.640 --> 53:16.040]  Douglas County district court in Omaha this one miraculously appeared on the
[53:16.040 --> 53:21.800]  counter it just all of a sudden was here poof friend said in quote and what did
[53:21.800 --> 53:26.800]  the filing from God say well that's another untold story told that website
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.600]  another untold story dot com but maybe we'll tell you tomorrow on another untold
[53:32.600 --> 53:40.220]  story for another untold story go to another untold story dot com another untold
[53:40.220 --> 53:57.220]  Another untold story dot com, another untold story dot com, another untold story dot com.
[53:57.220 --> 54:09.220]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[54:09.220 --> 54:16.220]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool.
[54:16.220 --> 54:26.220]  And he never gives an answer, but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
[54:26.220 --> 54:31.220]  and the eyes in his head see the world straight around him.
[54:31.220 --> 54:35.220]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones show in serious times right now.
[54:35.220 --> 54:39.220]  Alex down in Chantilly, Virginia at the Bilderberg conference.
[54:39.220 --> 54:46.220]  Spooks all around him, obviously tried to set him up somehow with that mock fire drill.
[54:46.220 --> 54:50.220]  I mean, it's not a coincidence that the security guys come up to him, start talking about fire drill robberies,
[54:50.220 --> 54:52.220]  and then all of a sudden it happens.
[54:52.220 --> 54:55.220]  I really wouldn't be surprised if they were looking to plant something in his room,
[54:55.220 --> 55:02.220]  and at least have an excuse to detain him for the entire weekend so he couldn't be a thorn in the elite's side.
[55:02.220 --> 55:08.220]  I just want to let everybody know that the way that you support this program is you support our sponsors,
[55:08.220 --> 55:12.220]  or you give to this InfoWars Moneybomb, it was a huge success, we made over $200,000,
[55:12.220 --> 55:18.220]  we're keeping it open until Friday, tomorrow we should be giving out the grand total, I believe,
[55:18.220 --> 55:23.220]  as long as somebody gives that information to me, because I'm just a low guy on the totem pole,
[55:23.220 --> 55:26.220]  but you can go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and still give,
[55:26.220 --> 55:33.220]  and that's going to be put towards a new TV network to fight the info for another great sponsor we have is EnterFood,
[55:33.220 --> 55:38.220]  and we all know that stress weakens your mind, inhibiting your ability to focus on things that truly matter.
[55:38.220 --> 55:43.220]  Fight back with EnterFood, practically every one of us up here are absolutely addicted to this stuff,
[55:43.220 --> 55:48.220]  and for all the best reasons, EnterFood is nature's 100% all-natural organic superfood,

[56:06.220 --> 56:14.220]  The number is 866-762-9238, that's 866-762-9238.
[56:14.220 --> 56:21.220]  That being said, I'm going to be taking calls on a host of issues, hopefully Bilderberg will be the main one over the next hour,
[56:21.220 --> 56:30.220]  and I'm going to be discussing Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey going around exposing the vaccinations for what they are, death modules.
[56:30.220 --> 56:37.220]  They cause autism, they cause cancer, they're no good, and I guess that Robert Kennedy Jr. is also helping out with that,
[56:37.220 --> 56:42.220]  but we'll read that article, and then we're going to play the YouTube clip where they tell you that mercury is delicious,
[56:42.220 --> 56:48.220]  you know, despite what me and you learned in school when we were little children to stay away from mercury,
[56:48.220 --> 56:54.220]  that it was contained in thermometers, it was poisonous, now they're telling you that mercury's going to help your brain.
[56:54.220 --> 56:57.220]  I know you don't believe me, that's why we're going to play the clip.
[56:57.220 --> 57:01.220]  Alright, let's go to Mike in Indiana. Mike, are you with us?
[57:01.220 --> 57:02.220]  Yes, are you there?
[57:02.220 --> 57:03.220]  Yes.
[57:03.220 --> 57:08.220]  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I've been part of the Truth Movement for two years now,
[57:08.220 --> 57:12.220]  and I think it's great what Alex is doing out there in Virginia,
[57:12.220 --> 57:18.220]  but I'm on another mission of my own, and maybe I'm trying to get some insight from you.
[57:18.220 --> 57:23.220]  I live in Indianapolis, and of course you know that the Marines are in town.
[57:23.220 --> 57:26.220]  This is the Urban War Fair Drill? The Urban War Fair Drill? Okay.
[57:26.220 --> 57:31.220]  Absolutely, but I keep my video camera with me, and I guess my question to you is,
[57:31.220 --> 57:34.220]  you know, I've never done anything like this.
[57:34.220 --> 57:39.220]  I'd love to be where Alex is, but you know, I'm actually here where something else is going on,
[57:39.220 --> 57:43.220]  so I'm just trying to figure out, you know, what's the best, you know...
[57:43.220 --> 57:47.220]  Alright, here are my basic advice points.
[57:47.220 --> 57:50.220]  Number one, stay on public property, okay?
[57:50.220 --> 57:51.220]  Right.
[57:51.220 --> 57:54.220]  When they tell you this is the part of the drill, well, you tell me where the drill ends.
[57:54.220 --> 57:56.220]  You know, where is a sidewalk I can stand in?
[57:56.220 --> 58:00.220]  Two, when they tell you to put your camera down, you need to say,
[58:00.220 --> 58:04.220]  look, it's my first amendment, right? I'm on a public sidewalk, you're a public officer,
[58:04.220 --> 58:06.220]  and you just can't back down, man.
[58:06.220 --> 58:08.220]  Oh no, I'm not going back down at all.
[58:08.220 --> 58:11.220]  That's right, so you've got to get it, you've got to upload it to YouTube.
[58:11.220 --> 58:13.220]  Send it to AaronInfoWars.com.
[58:13.220 --> 58:15.220]  I thank you for the call, Mike. We've got to head out.
[58:15.220 --> 58:19.220]  It's the Alex Jones Show. We'll be back after this at the top of the hour.

[59:46.220 --> 59:58.220]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.220 --> 1:00:07.220]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:13.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:13.220 --> 1:00:21.220]  It's Builderberg 08, and our hero, Alex Jones, is out in Chantilly, Virginia, getting the scoop.
[1:00:21.220 --> 1:00:29.220]  Getting the tough things on camera, showing you the security, trying to show you who the elitists are, who this 125 are,
[1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:33.220]  the people that really run the country and the world, folks.
[1:00:33.220 --> 1:00:38.220]  There's a reason that you've never heard of Builderberg, or you've just heard about it in the past few years,
[1:00:38.220 --> 1:00:43.220]  or if you've been listening to this program, this is about the only program that covers it.
[1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:47.220]  The Patriot movement, sure, they cover it, but there's no one as big as Alex Jones.
[1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:55.220]  So you've probably heard about Builderberg on his program, or maybe on a television special where they said it was nonsense,
[1:00:55.220 --> 1:01:01.220]  or tried to marginalize its importance. Well, it's not marginally important. Watch Endgame, okay?
[1:01:01.220 --> 1:01:05.220]  Endgame really breaks down how these guys are eugenicists. They don't care about you and me.
[1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:13.220]  They really do believe that they are superior, and they're going to stop at nothing, folks, until they get their one-world government,
[1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:19.220]  their new-world order, and that's not my term for it. Again, let's run down some of the names that have used that term.
[1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:26.220]  H.G. Wells, Hitler. Henry Kissinger's been talking about it since the 70s, openly, okay?
[1:01:26.220 --> 1:01:30.220]  George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney back in the 90s, couldn't stop using the phrase.
[1:01:30.220 --> 1:01:37.220]  The mainstream media had to use the phrase. I've got Bill Clinton when he was running for president in his first term talking about the new-world order,
[1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:49.220]  in this new age, okay? Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, is pushing for a new-world order. Just type it in. Just type in those names.
[1:01:49.220 --> 1:01:55.220]  In a little Google search next to New World Order, and you can listen to him say it yourself. This is not our term for it.
[1:01:55.220 --> 1:02:03.220]  It is their nomenclature. It is their great idea, and they want to sell you on the rule of law. It's the rule of their law.
[1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:10.220]  They're going to decide who gets what. They're going to decide where you live. They're going to decide what you eat.
[1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:17.220]  And I'm telling you, they're there to poison you, and if there isn't a better example than vaccinations, I don't know what is.
[1:02:17.220 --> 1:02:22.220]  So I'm going to cover this. Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey's D.C. March that just took place.
[1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:27.220]  Now, I'll admit I'm not too crazy about the shirts they're wearing. They're wearing a shirt that says,
[1:02:27.220 --> 1:02:33.220]  green are vaccines. We all know the green movement is nonsense. It's all about a carbon tax. It's all about getting you into a system
[1:02:33.220 --> 1:02:40.220]  where you pay for the amount of cars you have, where you pay for the amount of garbage you produce, where you pay for the size house you use.
[1:02:40.220 --> 1:02:48.220]  You pay a tax. This is taxing you for how much energy you use, because we're bad. We're human beings. We consume too much.
[1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:54.220]  I mean, we obviously are too much consumers. In fact, last night, I didn't finish it, but I watched a little bit of What Would Jesus Buy,
[1:02:54.220 --> 1:02:57.220]  and maybe I'll bring that up after this, but let's read this article.
[1:02:57.220 --> 1:03:03.220]  Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey led the Green Are Vaccines March rally and press conference at the Capitol Building,
[1:03:03.220 --> 1:03:07.220]  West Capitol Grounds in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.
[1:03:07.220 --> 1:03:14.220]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joined the couple as a keynote speaker at the event aimed at battling to eliminate toxins from children's vaccines
[1:03:14.220 --> 1:03:20.220]  and to encourage national health agencies to reassess mandatory vaccine schedules.
[1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:25.220]  Honestly, Robert Kennedy Jr., although I don't agree with him on a lot, is one of the better politicians out there.
[1:03:25.220 --> 1:03:31.220]  We have been inspired by Mr. Kennedy's support of mothers' positions and vaccines in the groundbreaking article,
[1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:37.220]  Deadly Immunity, McCarthy told Press of Kennedy's appearance. His continued efforts are greatly appreciated.
[1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:45.220]  According to a Sun Herald report, Jim and Jenny have said that they do support immunization like many parents and experts in their medical community,
[1:03:45.220 --> 1:03:54.220]  although they and their many allies feel that the children are receiving too many vaccines, absolutely, too soon, absolutely, many of which are toxic.
[1:03:54.220 --> 1:04:05.220]  Absolutely, thimerosal, bad, SV40, that's simian virus, 40, known to cause cancer in apes and other hominids.
[1:04:05.220 --> 1:04:08.220]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:04:08.220 --> 1:04:12.220]  Their goals demand a safer vaccine supply and schedule for our children,
[1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:16.220]  but that's not the goal in the mainstream media. I can assure you of that.
[1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:21.220]  Let's play this delicious mercury clip that ran all over the country.
[1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:27.220]  I guess we're going to have to play it on the other side, but we're going to play that clip because mercury is good for you. It's delicious.
[1:04:27.220 --> 1:04:50.220]  It's anything but infowars.com, prismplanet.com. We'll be back after the break at the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:01.220]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:05:01.220 --> 1:05:07.220]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:05:07.220 --> 1:05:11.220]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:05:11.220 --> 1:05:16.220]  In the info war, prismplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[1:05:50.220 --> 1:05:52.220]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group.
[1:05:52.220 --> 1:05:53.220]  Let's get real.
[1:05:53.220 --> 1:06:00.220]  Flower is already being rationed. Prices on food are getting so high warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[1:06:00.220 --> 1:06:04.220]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:12.220]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any price.
[1:06:12.220 --> 1:06:16.220]  We can't grow enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash.
[1:06:16.220 --> 1:06:20.220]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[1:06:20.220 --> 1:06:24.220]  They think God didn't get it right so Monsanto had to step in.
[1:06:24.220 --> 1:06:28.220]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[1:06:28.220 --> 1:06:30.220]  We won't tell.
[1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:36.220]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:06:39.220 --> 1:06:42.220]  It may be a little bit crazy. That's okay.
[1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:51.220]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.

[1:07:46.220 --> 1:08:08.220]  Mention GCN live for a free gift.
[1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:22.220]  They were actually rationing rice and wheat to 3 bags per person at Sam's Club and BJ's.
[1:08:22.220 --> 1:08:28.220]  That is unheard of when in this country are they going to put a limitation on how much food you can buy.
[1:08:28.220 --> 1:08:34.220]  You don't have to worry about that if you go through eFoodsDirect and call 1-800-409-5633.

[1:08:42.220 --> 1:08:44.220]  It's our biggest sponsor.
[1:08:44.220 --> 1:08:47.220]  It supports us.
[1:08:47.220 --> 1:08:55.220]  That being said, we need to play this little YouTube clip where they tell you how delicious mercury is for you.
[1:08:55.220 --> 1:09:00.220]  Mercury-containing vaccines are going to be good for your kids. They're not going to cause autism.
[1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:03.220]  It's only up 10,000% for when it first started.
[1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:07.220]  That's just because we didn't know how to diagnose it. That's what the detractors are going to say.
[1:09:07.220 --> 1:09:09.220]  Total bull.
[1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:11.220]  Let's go to this clip.
[1:09:11.220 --> 1:09:16.220]  A life-saving device wins over the counter approval by the FDA.
[1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:21.220]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses, a new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[1:09:21.220 --> 1:09:27.220]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with Medical Watcher Porter, Seema Maverick.
[1:09:27.220 --> 1:09:33.220]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[1:09:33.220 --> 1:09:40.220]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[1:09:40.220 --> 1:09:48.220]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[1:09:48.220 --> 1:09:53.220]  Nonsense. These preservatives are delicious for your kids, please.
[1:09:53.220 --> 1:09:57.220]  All right, so I just want to say, you know, Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, keep it up.
[1:09:57.220 --> 1:10:01.220]  You know, you need to expose this lie. I think Jenny McCarthy might be hip to some other things.
[1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:05.220]  She called her book, Louder Than Words, and that, of course, is our company.
[1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:09.220]  The guys that put together Lose Change, our little company, is Louder Than Words, LLC.
[1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:13.220]  So, big ups to them. We're going to have Luke Rudowski on in about five minutes.
[1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:20.220]  He's outside of Bilderberg. He's got some breaking news for us, not only about Bilderberg, but about the Gary Tallis arrest story.
[1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:27.220]  They tried to frame him up and say that he had actually attacked a crippled girl with cerebral palsy.
[1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:30.220]  You may have heard that interview. It's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:35.220]  Gary Tallis is one of the most gentle human beings that I've ever met in my life, and he would not hurt a fly.
[1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:41.220]  All right, let's take a couple of callers before that. Let us go to Tony in Chicago. Tony, are you still with us?
[1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:43.220]  Yeah.
[1:10:43.220 --> 1:10:44.220]  How are you doing, Tony?
[1:10:44.220 --> 1:10:45.220]  Yes.
[1:10:45.220 --> 1:10:46.220]  Hey, how are you doing, Jason?
[1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:47.220]  Good.
[1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:56.220]  Good. Hey, I just wanted to, first of all, as far as the mercury thing goes, what's really funny is I'm from down around, down in Missouri.
[1:10:56.220 --> 1:11:03.220]  I used to live just west of Mississippi, and they tell you not to eat fish out of the Mississippi River because of the mercury content.
[1:11:03.220 --> 1:11:11.220]  But anyway, there's been a lot of preconditioning going on, and I don't know if y'all have noticed it.
[1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:13.220]  If I can just have a couple minutes, Jason.
[1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:14.220]  Sure.
[1:11:14.220 --> 1:11:19.220]  There's been a lot of preconditioning. I'm from up in Chicago, the Chicago control grid.
[1:11:19.220 --> 1:11:29.220]  Right now, there's a lot of talk about the nuclear thing with Iran and the backpack nukes and the cell and the stuff to the terrorists.
[1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:37.220]  In 1999, a document was given out to the Army.
[1:11:37.220 --> 1:11:40.220]  I had a friend in the Rangers who got out in 2000.
[1:11:40.220 --> 1:11:58.220]  I have the document in my garage stating the threat of backpack nukes in the Midwest.
[1:11:58.220 --> 1:12:04.220]  The thing about that is, when this happens, because I don't know about you, Jason, but I'm really nervous.
[1:12:04.220 --> 1:12:08.220]  I feel there's something in the air fixing to happen right now, and I'm terrified.
[1:12:08.220 --> 1:12:11.220]  I want out of Chicago just desperately.
[1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:17.220]  But anyway, what this document, the preconditioning with that, it's not on us, of course, the citizenry.
[1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:22.220]  It's that we're all going to be awake to false flag by the next time this happens.
[1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:30.220]  The soldiers declare the martial law and the soldiers will not listen to us.
[1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:35.220]  The career guys who are leading the show, they're going to tell us, we heard about this back in 1999.
[1:12:35.220 --> 1:12:37.220]  We knew this was going to happen.
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:44.220]  Of course, it's Iran or whoever, Eurasia or East Asia, whoever they decide to pin it on.
[1:12:44.220 --> 1:12:53.220]  Obviously, we've been totally preconditioned to accept a backpack nuke, some kind of a dirty bomb.
[1:12:53.220 --> 1:12:56.220]  It's been all over television from 24 to Jericho, to a lot of the movies even.
[1:12:56.220 --> 1:12:59.220]  If it's not a nuclear attack, it's a bio warfare attack.
[1:12:59.220 --> 1:13:02.220]  It's all about contaminate, contain control.
[1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:06.220]  You look at 28 days later, 28 weeks later.
[1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:10.220]  Even the Simpsons movie was all about a biocontaminate.
[1:13:10.220 --> 1:13:18.220]  If you were listening earlier, that whole thing in Plum Island, giving Homeland Security the directive over foot and mouth disease
[1:13:18.220 --> 1:13:23.220]  and all these other biological weapon tools, and now they want to put their facility right next to cattle ranches.
[1:13:23.220 --> 1:13:25.220]  That's not good news for us.
[1:13:25.220 --> 1:13:28.220]  Why would they remake Andromeda Strain?
[1:13:28.220 --> 1:13:34.220]  One of Michael Crichton's less popular books that got ripped off in a movie called Outbreak.
[1:13:34.220 --> 1:13:36.220]  Why would they remake that again?
[1:13:36.220 --> 1:13:40.220]  Yeah, it's pretty interesting. I actually just watched the original Andromeda Strain movie.
[1:13:40.220 --> 1:13:42.220]  I know there's a new miniseries. I haven't checked that out.
[1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:44.220]  Yeah, but it's scary stuff. Thanks for the call, man.
[1:13:44.220 --> 1:13:47.220]  Let's jump to Stefan in Oregon.
[1:13:47.220 --> 1:13:49.220]  Stefan, are you with us?
[1:13:49.220 --> 1:13:51.220]  Did you drop? Stefan?
[1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:52.220]  Yeah, I'm here.
[1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:54.220]  What can I do for you today, sir?
[1:13:54.220 --> 1:13:55.220]  Yeah, I got a point about...
[1:13:55.220 --> 1:13:58.220]  I just want to thank Alex for the Amalgam story.
[1:13:58.220 --> 1:14:01.220]  You go to YouTube and we search under poison gas.
[1:14:01.220 --> 1:14:04.220]  You can watch a really good video on it.
[1:14:04.220 --> 1:14:09.220]  And then you can do another search for nerve and mercury.
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:16.220]  It shows how it destroys the protein building when dendrites are growing between nerve cells.
[1:14:16.220 --> 1:14:22.220]  Yeah, plaques in the brain. It creates these plaques, these walls, and it basically gives you brain damage.
[1:14:22.220 --> 1:14:25.220]  Mercury is not nutritious. It is not good for you.
[1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:31.220]  Well, I was watching TSI and I know it's junk science, but they actually killed a guy with selenium.
[1:14:31.220 --> 1:14:35.220]  And what drew them into it was the ridges in the fingernails.
[1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:40.220]  I started looking at my fingernails and I was like, wow.
[1:14:40.220 --> 1:14:42.220]  Wow, I can't believe that.
[1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:46.220]  And then all of a sudden I figured out about Amalgam from that.
[1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:51.220]  Alex now was like, that's it. That's why I've been such a jerk lately.
[1:14:51.220 --> 1:14:55.220]  Because I've been poisoning, early and perpetually poisoning with mercury.
[1:14:55.220 --> 1:14:58.220]  Yeah, I mean, mercury poisoning, it's out there, folks. It's not good.
[1:14:58.220 --> 1:15:02.220]  Thank you for the call. We're going to jump to Luke Radowski out in front of the Bilderberg conference.
[1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:04.220]  Luke, are you with me?
[1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:07.220]  Yeah, I'm here, man. I can't tell you. It's amazing out here, man.
[1:15:07.220 --> 1:15:11.220]  There's about 100 people outside the main entrance to the Bilderberg meeting out here.
[1:15:11.220 --> 1:15:14.220]  And I'm telling you, it's amazing what we just done.
[1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:16.220]  Yeah, it's amazing that 100 people are out there.
[1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:21.220]  I mean, from two years ago when Alex went to Canada, maybe there was 15, 20 people out there.
[1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:24.220]  It's just grown so much. The awareness has grown.
[1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:30.220]  And they brought it to D.C. where they could run a very large-scale security op,
[1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:33.220]  a very large intelligence op on this one.
[1:15:33.220 --> 1:15:37.220]  And as I understand it, you guys are out at the main road, right?
[1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:42.220]  Yeah, we're at the main road. The police and Secret Service tried to bully us
[1:15:42.220 --> 1:15:45.220]  and tried to make us move across the street away from the main entrance.
[1:15:45.220 --> 1:15:51.220]  At first, police officers came. There was no problems. Everything was cool.
[1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:55.220]  Then there was a Secret Service agent who came to the police department afterwards.
[1:15:55.220 --> 1:16:00.220]  They spoke for about a half an hour, and then the police came and they wanted to speak to a leader.
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:03.220]  And I knew they were selecting people so they could isolate them
[1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:07.220]  and then use them to whatever they wanted to move us.
[1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:10.220]  And I told everybody just to gather up, and everybody just said,
[1:16:10.220 --> 1:16:13.220]  we're all leaders, and we all speak for ourselves.
[1:16:13.220 --> 1:16:17.220]  The police department wanted us to move to another side of the street
[1:16:17.220 --> 1:16:19.220]  where there was no crosswalk even.
[1:16:19.220 --> 1:16:22.220]  It was a very dangerous situation in the first place,
[1:16:22.220 --> 1:16:28.220]  but they did not want us in the main entrance right where all the cars were going.
[1:16:28.220 --> 1:16:32.220]  Well, obviously, they don't want you to catch film of these guys, these 125 Alias.
[1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:35.220]  And I don't know if you've been listening in, but get this, Luke.
[1:16:35.220 --> 1:16:42.220]  The Department of Justice with our tax dollars ordered 125 specially engraved iPods
[1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:46.220]  from McIntosh that say Bilderberg 2008 on the back.
[1:16:46.220 --> 1:16:50.220]  And they ordered the Chantilly, Virginia. So our tax dollars pay for their fun.
[1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:52.220]  Isn't that lovely?
[1:16:52.220 --> 1:16:56.220]  It's crazy. I mean, the police were basically trying to bully us
[1:16:56.220 --> 1:16:59.220]  and push us away from the main entrance.
[1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:03.220]  And we just all stood up and we all gathered and we said, we're not leaving anywhere.
[1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:07.220]  And the main spook, the main secret service guy, he just ran away.
[1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:10.220]  All of us just spoke to the police officers.
[1:17:10.220 --> 1:17:12.220]  We just said, we're not going anywhere.
[1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:14.220]  This is our basic freedom. This is America.
[1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:18.220]  We have every right to stand here on this street corner, on this street
[1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:20.220]  where all the elite are going to be coming in.
[1:17:20.220 --> 1:17:23.220]  The police officers then went the way deliberated.
[1:17:23.220 --> 1:17:27.220]  And as they were coming back, I got everybody up and we just started screaming
[1:17:27.220 --> 1:17:29.220]  freedom and USA.
[1:17:29.220 --> 1:17:33.220]  And then they backed off and they apologized and they said, well, yeah, you could be here.
[1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:37.220]  We're sorry for bothering you guys and they let us be there and freedom prevailed today.
[1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:39.220]  They can't bully us. They can't push us.
[1:17:39.220 --> 1:17:41.220]  We're going to be here. We're not moving anyway.
[1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:44.220]  We're not going anywhere. We're going to start a live video feed on
[1:17:44.220 --> 1:17:49.220]  We are changed at or so people could see everything going on at the Bilderberg around five o'clock today.
[1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:52.220]  We are changed at or you'll be able to see live what's going on.
[1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:56.220]  We also have a new conversation video with Hillary and Bill Clinton,
[1:17:56.220 --> 1:17:59.220]  where we talked to them about the Bilderberg is coming out today.
[1:17:59.220 --> 1:18:00.220]  I'm uploading the video.
[1:18:00.220 --> 1:18:01.220]  What did Hillary have to say?
[1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:04.220]  Because she's denied even knowing what Bilderberg was.
[1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:09.220]  Exactly. And I talked to her press secretary and he also denied it.
[1:18:09.220 --> 1:18:13.220]  And then I told her about it in 2006 where she was reported to be there.
[1:18:13.220 --> 1:18:15.220]  And there's eyewitnesses that saw her there.
[1:18:15.220 --> 1:18:17.220]  And then he says, I don't know nothing about it.
[1:18:17.220 --> 1:18:18.220]  I can't talk to you about it.
[1:18:18.220 --> 1:18:19.220]  And he just walked away.
[1:18:19.220 --> 1:18:22.220]  We asked Bill Clinton, how come there's no press?
[1:18:22.220 --> 1:18:23.220]  How come there's no media?
[1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:24.220]  How come it's not public?
[1:18:24.220 --> 1:18:26.220]  What happened to Bilderberg?
[1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:27.220]  He just said, I don't know.
[1:18:27.220 --> 1:18:30.220]  I was in there since 15 years and he just walked away.
[1:18:30.220 --> 1:18:32.220]  For 15 years. Hold on.
[1:18:32.220 --> 1:18:37.220]  Hold on. He's saying now that he only went in 92 with Vernon Jordan.
[1:18:37.220 --> 1:18:39.220]  That's all he said.
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:41.220]  He was there in 99 and he knows it.
[1:18:41.220 --> 1:18:43.220]  He knows he was there in 99.
[1:18:43.220 --> 1:18:44.220]  Come on.
[1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:45.220]  All right.
[1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:47.220]  I want to shift gears really quickly.
[1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:49.220]  The Gary Tallah situation.
[1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:50.220]  You were at court yesterday.
[1:18:50.220 --> 1:18:52.220]  Why don't you fill people in on that?
[1:18:52.220 --> 1:18:58.220]  Yeah, we went to court yesterday and they offered Gary two years probation for everything that happened.
[1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:02.220]  And we declined because Gary's innocent on all charges.
[1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:08.220]  And the first thing the prosecution brought up was how Gary brought up the guy who beat him up,
[1:19:08.220 --> 1:19:11.220]  brought up his personal information all over the internet and harassed him.
[1:19:11.220 --> 1:19:13.220]  That was never the case.
[1:19:13.220 --> 1:19:20.220]  The two lawyers deliberated with the judge and then it came to a circumstance where there was no evidence of that happening.
[1:19:20.220 --> 1:19:21.220]  They made a false claim.
[1:19:21.220 --> 1:19:27.220]  The prosecution made a false claim against Gary saying he's releasing private information of this gentleman who attacked him.
[1:19:27.220 --> 1:19:28.220]  All right, Luke.
[1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:29.220]  Hold over.
[1:19:29.220 --> 1:19:31.220]  Hold over till the next segment.
[1:19:31.220 --> 1:19:33.220]  I want to discuss this because this is a big story.
[1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:36.220]  The Gary Talis arrest, Bilderberg conference.
[1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:38.220]  This is the biggest radio on the planet, folks.
[1:19:38.220 --> 1:19:39.220]  This is where things happen.
[1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:40.220]  This is the real deal.
[1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:42.220]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:19:42.220 --> 1:19:44.220]  Prismplanet.com, infowars.com.
[1:19:44.220 --> 1:19:46.220]  We'll be back after these messages.
[1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:54.220]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:54.220 --> 1:19:59.220]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:19:59.220 --> 1:20:02.220]  It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[1:20:02.220 --> 1:20:05.220]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:08.220]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:08.220 --> 1:20:16.220]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:18.220 --> 1:20:24.220]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:24.220 --> 1:20:28.220]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:31.220]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:32.220]  Most people have no idea.
[1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:33.220]  They're not after money.
[1:20:33.220 --> 1:20:34.220]  They have all the money they need.
[1:20:34.220 --> 1:20:35.220]  They're after power.
[1:20:35.220 --> 1:20:36.220]  That's their after-easy.

[1:20:47.220 --> 1:20:49.220]  You have been warned.
[1:20:51.220 --> 1:20:53.220]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:20:53.220 --> 1:20:59.220]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:00.220]  That's right.
[1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:03.220]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[1:21:03.220 --> 1:21:10.220]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:21:10.220 --> 1:21:18.220]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:21:18.220 --> 1:21:23.220]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[1:21:23.220 --> 1:21:29.220]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:29.220 --> 1:21:34.220]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[1:22:17.220 --> 1:22:20.220]  Elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:22:20.220 --> 1:22:23.220]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:23.220 --> 1:22:26.220]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:22:26.220 --> 1:22:28.220]  Everything they have built over the centuries.
[1:22:28.220 --> 1:22:30.220]  The wealth they have accumulated.
[1:22:30.220 --> 1:22:31.220]  The power they have established.
[1:22:31.220 --> 1:22:33.220]  The poisoning of the masses.
[1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:35.220]  The destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:22:35.220 --> 1:22:39.220]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:22:39.220 --> 1:22:43.220]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.

[1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:48.220]  Call today.
[1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:23.220]  I'm the fact that she parades around as a propagandist pushing her husband.
[1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:25.220]  It's not really his agenda.
[1:24:25.220 --> 1:24:28.220]  It's really an elite agenda that her husband fronts for.
[1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:32.220]  He's viciously attacked by a much larger man.
[1:24:32.220 --> 1:24:37.220]  He's arrested for supposedly attacking his crippled daughter with cerebral palsy.
[1:24:37.220 --> 1:24:40.220]  They won't take the statement from an eyewitness.
[1:24:40.220 --> 1:24:43.220]  He literally sits there for two plus hours in the police station.
[1:24:43.220 --> 1:24:45.220]  They just send her on her way.
[1:24:45.220 --> 1:24:47.220]  The other man was not charged with anything.
[1:24:47.220 --> 1:24:54.220]  Now they want him to bow down to his overlords, his masters, and become part of the system.
[1:24:54.220 --> 1:24:55.220]  Two years of probation.
[1:24:55.220 --> 1:24:56.220]  That's what we're going to give you.
[1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:57.220]  You can report to us.
[1:24:57.220 --> 1:24:59.220]  We're going to be a part of your life now, Gary.
[1:24:59.220 --> 1:25:00.220]  No thanks.
[1:25:00.220 --> 1:25:02.220]  He should fight this all the way through.
[1:25:02.220 --> 1:25:04.220]  He should really sue for malice.
[1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:06.220]  There's going to be a videotape that comes out.
[1:25:06.220 --> 1:25:07.220]  I pray to God.
[1:25:07.220 --> 1:25:09.220]  It's going to show this guy attacking Gary Talis.
[1:25:09.220 --> 1:25:13.220]  I promise you, Gary Talis did not attack a crippled girl with cerebral palsy.
[1:25:13.220 --> 1:25:14.220]  Luke?
[1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:20.220]  Yeah, and the crazy thing is the 92nd Street YMCA, the same place that assaulted Matt,
[1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:25.220]  the same place that I got chased out of, I was beaten up for Zinski,
[1:25:25.220 --> 1:25:33.220]  is not wanting to release the actual surveillance footage of exactly what happened at that particular date.
[1:25:33.220 --> 1:25:36.220]  We're subpoenaing the tapes right now.
[1:25:36.220 --> 1:25:39.220]  We're doing everything legally possible to get those tapes,
[1:25:39.220 --> 1:25:43.220]  but they're denying us the tapes of exactly what happened,
[1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:46.220]  which just shows you that they don't want this to come out.
[1:25:46.220 --> 1:25:49.220]  They don't want the video of what happened that night to come out,
[1:25:49.220 --> 1:25:55.220]  and they offered Gary, again, two years of probation for doing nothing for being assaulted.
[1:25:55.220 --> 1:25:59.220]  I think it's just sick and disgusting that this is happening right now,
[1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:00.220]  but nothing is going to stop us.
[1:26:00.220 --> 1:26:01.220]  We're going to fight them in court.
[1:26:01.220 --> 1:26:02.220]  We're going to sue them.
[1:26:02.220 --> 1:26:04.220]  We need your help.
[1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:06.220]  And nothing can stop us again.
[1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:10.220]  Nothing will ever stop truth from coming out.
[1:26:10.220 --> 1:26:13.220]  Well, Luke, I keep getting emails all the time.
[1:26:13.220 --> 1:26:14.220]  Well, what can I do?
[1:26:14.220 --> 1:26:15.220]  What can I do?
[1:26:15.220 --> 1:26:16.220]  What can I do?
[1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:18.220]  And I always throw those emails to you, these guys.
[1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:20.220]  I'm always like, well, I want to start something.
[1:26:20.220 --> 1:26:22.220]  I want to be part of a new organization, blah, blah, blah.
[1:26:22.220 --> 1:26:24.220]  I'm like, well, we are change.org.
[1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:27.220]  It has chapters all over the country and the world.
[1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:31.220]  And I say, go to that website, contact Luke Radowski.
[1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:33.220]  He's going to give you the information you need.
[1:26:33.220 --> 1:26:37.220]  To start an organization, a we are change in your area.
[1:26:37.220 --> 1:26:42.220]  And I guarantee that there is four, five, maybe 10, 15 people
[1:26:42.220 --> 1:26:44.220]  that want to be part of that organization,
[1:26:44.220 --> 1:26:48.220]  that are only a stone's throw away, literally a 15 or 20 minute drive.
[1:26:48.220 --> 1:26:50.220]  It's all about you becoming active.
[1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:54.220]  You deciding that you're not just going to sit on your duff anymore.
[1:26:54.220 --> 1:26:55.220]  You deciding, you know what?
[1:26:55.220 --> 1:26:58.220]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, that's worth fighting for.
[1:26:58.220 --> 1:26:59.220]  I want to be a part of this.
[1:26:59.220 --> 1:27:01.220]  And you just go to wearchange.org.
[1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:05.220]  You throw Luke an email and Luke, you've been just so good
[1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.220]  about creating these organizations everywhere.
[1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:11.220]  It's about everybody becoming their own leaders.
[1:27:11.220 --> 1:27:13.220]  We don't follow anybody.
[1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:15.220]  We follow an idea of change.
[1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:17.220]  And that's what's beautiful about our organization.
[1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:20.220]  And we proved it today at Bilderberg when the police,
[1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:22.220]  when the Secret Service was bullying us today.
[1:27:22.220 --> 1:27:24.220]  We all gathered up together.
[1:27:24.220 --> 1:27:26.220]  We are our leaderless organization.
[1:27:26.220 --> 1:27:27.220]  We are the people.
[1:27:27.220 --> 1:27:28.220]  We stand together.
[1:27:28.220 --> 1:27:29.220]  We will not fall.
[1:27:29.220 --> 1:27:30.220]  We will not be divided.
[1:27:30.220 --> 1:27:31.220]  And we showed that today.
[1:27:31.220 --> 1:27:33.220]  And we stood up for our rights today.
[1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:34.220]  And freedom prevailed.
[1:27:34.220 --> 1:27:37.220]  And we are able to stand wherever we stand in this country
[1:27:37.220 --> 1:27:40.220]  because the Constitution allows us to do so.
[1:27:40.220 --> 1:27:43.220]  And we don't care what some Secret Service officer says
[1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:44.220]  or some spook says.
[1:27:44.220 --> 1:27:47.220]  It doesn't matter because the Constitution is the Constitution.
[1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:48.220]  Our freedom is our freedom.
[1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:51.220]  And nothing will be able to take that away from us.
[1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:52.220]  Well, the funny thing is, Luke,
[1:27:52.220 --> 1:27:54.220]  it's going to be awful difficult of them to put together,
[1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:56.220]  say, a free speech zone, if you will,
[1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:58.220]  in a meeting that's not supposed to even exist
[1:27:58.220 --> 1:28:01.220]  or, you know, set any policy.
[1:28:01.220 --> 1:28:02.220]  Exactly.
[1:28:02.220 --> 1:28:05.220]  And the amazing thing that also happened today,
[1:28:05.220 --> 1:28:07.220]  whenever the police officers were coming near us,
[1:28:07.220 --> 1:28:09.220]  everybody just seemed to get the cameras out,
[1:28:09.220 --> 1:28:10.220]  get the cameras out.
[1:28:10.220 --> 1:28:14.220]  And we literally had about 50 to about 40 cameras,
[1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:18.220]  police officers, and they looked very nervous talking to us.
[1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:21.220]  And they knew that they couldn't do anything illegal.
[1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:23.220]  They couldn't do anything against the law,
[1:28:23.220 --> 1:28:25.220]  the supreme law of the land, the Constitution.
[1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:28.220]  Because if they did, they would be reprimanded.
[1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:31.220]  They would be put on YouTube and they would be exposed for.
[1:28:31.220 --> 1:28:34.220]  And that's what's beautiful about today's society and the Internet
[1:28:34.220 --> 1:28:38.220]  and YouTube and us being able to document and show everybody
[1:28:38.220 --> 1:28:40.220]  what's really going on.
[1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:41.220]  Absolutely.
[1:28:41.220 --> 1:28:42.220]  Godspeed, Luke.
[1:28:42.220 --> 1:28:43.220]  Keep it up.
[1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:45.220]  Keep calling in with any kind of updates.
[1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:46.220]  Anytime you've got something,
[1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:47.220]  definitely give me a ring.
[1:28:47.220 --> 1:28:48.220]  We'll have you back on the show.
[1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:51.220]  And wearchange.org is going to have a live feed.
[1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:53.220]  We're going to be doing stories about this all over.
[1:28:53.220 --> 1:28:55.220]  www.prisonplan.com, infowars.com.
[1:28:55.220 --> 1:28:56.220]  Get ready, folks.
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:57.220]  All right.
[1:28:57.220 --> 1:28:58.220]  Let's take some callers.
[1:28:58.220 --> 1:29:01.220]  Let's jump to Mitch in California.
[1:29:01.220 --> 1:29:03.220]  Mitch, are you with us?
[1:29:03.220 --> 1:29:05.220]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[1:29:05.220 --> 1:29:08.220]  I'm chomping at the bit and ready to go.
[1:29:08.220 --> 1:29:09.220]  All right.
[1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:13.220]  Have you guys ever thought of taking with you
[1:29:13.220 --> 1:29:15.220]  an old man that will blend in?
[1:29:15.220 --> 1:29:18.220]  An old man that will hold over Mitch.
[1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:19.220]  We'll come back after this.
[1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:21.220]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[1:29:21.220 --> 1:29:26.220]  Remember, you're not free unless you fight for it.
[1:29:26.220 --> 1:29:27.220]  They want your freedoms.
[1:29:27.220 --> 1:29:28.220]  They want your bill of rights.
[1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:29.220]  They want your constitution.
[1:29:29.220 --> 1:29:32.220]  And that's why Alex Jones is at Bilderberg right now.
[1:29:32.220 --> 1:29:33.220]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:29:33.220 --> 1:30:01.220]  We'll be back after this prisonplanet.com.
[1:30:01.220 --> 1:30:08.220]  We'll be back after this show.
[1:30:50.220 --> 1:30:54.220]  World Products now is introducing the new detoxer foot and body pads
[1:30:54.220 --> 1:30:58.220]  that work while you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[1:30:58.220 --> 1:31:01.220]  Detoxer pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain,
[1:31:01.220 --> 1:31:04.220]  and improves the immune system, circulation, and blockages
[1:31:04.220 --> 1:31:05.220]  all while you're sleeping.
[1:31:05.220 --> 1:31:09.220]  Very simply, you put one pad on each foot before bedtime and go to sleep.
[1:31:09.220 --> 1:31:13.220]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[1:31:13.220 --> 1:31:15.220]  You peel them off and throw them away.
[1:31:15.220 --> 1:31:16.220]  It's that simple.

[1:31:27.220 --> 1:31:30.220]  This is one of the many powerful ways to detox the body.
[1:31:30.220 --> 1:31:33.220]  We recommend you try our detoxer foot pads
[1:31:33.220 --> 1:31:35.220]  and see and feel the difference for yourself.

[1:31:49.220 --> 1:31:51.220]  With the hot and muggy season upon us,
[1:31:51.220 --> 1:31:54.220]  most people shut their windows to stay cool.
[1:31:54.220 --> 1:31:57.220]  The problem is, the air you breathe inside your home
[1:31:57.220 --> 1:31:59.220]  is not as clean as outdoor air.
[1:31:59.220 --> 1:32:02.220]  And who wants an ugly plastic noisy air purifier
[1:32:02.220 --> 1:32:04.220]  taking up space in their beautiful home?
[1:32:04.220 --> 1:32:06.220]  Well, there is an alternative.

[1:32:53.220 --> 1:33:15.220]  All right, folks, we are back live Thursday, June 5, 2008.
[1:33:15.220 --> 1:33:20.220]  Everybody, that money bomb over at InfoWars is still open until tomorrow.
[1:33:20.220 --> 1:33:22.220]  We've made over $200,000.
[1:33:22.220 --> 1:33:25.220]  We're trying to put together a new TV-dish network show
[1:33:25.220 --> 1:33:28.220]  to reach the masses really the next step in the InfoWars.
[1:33:28.220 --> 1:33:30.220]  Right now, we're talking to Mitch in California
[1:33:30.220 --> 1:33:32.220]  and he was asking if we ever thought about
[1:33:32.220 --> 1:33:35.220]  bringing an old timer along with us on one of these trips.
[1:33:35.220 --> 1:33:38.220]  Actually, yeah, you would be surprised the crew
[1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:40.220]  that goes on some of these trips.
[1:33:40.220 --> 1:33:42.220]  I'm not saying it's a massive crew.
[1:33:42.220 --> 1:33:44.220]  It's usually a crew of about three or four people,
[1:33:44.220 --> 1:33:47.220]  let's just say that the camera workers, the writers,
[1:33:47.220 --> 1:33:49.220]  they vary from age to age,
[1:33:49.220 --> 1:33:51.220]  and now with over 100 people over at Bilderberg
[1:33:51.220 --> 1:33:53.220]  just showing up on their own, Mitch,
[1:33:53.220 --> 1:33:55.220]  we're going to get a lot of video footage.
[1:33:55.220 --> 1:33:57.220]  I think this is going to be the most extensive coverage
[1:33:57.220 --> 1:34:00.220]  of a Bilderberg meeting to date.
[1:34:00.220 --> 1:34:04.220]  But you know yourself, when you go out with a small crew,
[1:34:04.220 --> 1:34:07.220]  wouldn't you be better off having somebody inconspicuous
[1:34:07.220 --> 1:34:10.220]  that doesn't look like part of your crew
[1:34:10.220 --> 1:34:18.220]  putting audio and video with a small spy camera attached
[1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:21.220]  that would be feeding back and recording all this
[1:34:21.220 --> 1:34:24.220]  just to cover your own butts?
[1:34:24.220 --> 1:34:26.220]  Let me just say without...
[1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:29.220]  Let me just say without the email address off the air.
[1:34:29.220 --> 1:34:31.220]  Sure. Well, I would say send that email address
[1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:33.220]  over to Aaronandinfowars.com.
[1:34:33.220 --> 1:34:35.220]  He does go through all that.
[1:34:35.220 --> 1:34:37.220]  I don't want to give up too much of our setup,
[1:34:37.220 --> 1:34:39.220]  but let's just say we have a lot of bases covered.
[1:34:39.220 --> 1:34:42.220]  Let's jump to Jay in New York.
[1:34:42.220 --> 1:34:45.220]  Jay, are you with me?
[1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:47.220]  Jay, are you with me?
[1:34:47.220 --> 1:34:49.220]  Yeah, I have a couple questions for you.
[1:34:49.220 --> 1:34:51.220]  In your new film, Fabled Enemies,
[1:34:51.220 --> 1:34:53.220]  since you're going to be documenting
[1:34:53.220 --> 1:34:56.220]  the Israeli spy operation during 9-11,
[1:34:56.220 --> 1:34:59.220]  will you also be covering the APAC SPNR scandal?
[1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:01.220]  I'm not going to be covering that in length
[1:35:01.220 --> 1:35:03.220]  just because I'm trying to go through
[1:35:03.220 --> 1:35:05.220]  each country's role in 9-11,
[1:35:05.220 --> 1:35:07.220]  and I'm very well aware that there's been
[1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:09.220]  a couple spies now caught
[1:35:09.220 --> 1:35:11.220]  that were not only Jonathan Pollard
[1:35:11.220 --> 1:35:13.220]  back in the 90s, but back in 2004,
[1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:15.220]  they found another mole.
[1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:17.220]  And just recently, I think this year,
[1:35:17.220 --> 1:35:19.220]  they found yet another Israeli mole
[1:35:19.220 --> 1:35:21.220]  within, I think, the Department of Defense, right?
[1:35:21.220 --> 1:35:23.220]  Yeah.
[1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:25.220]  Benabi Qadish.
[1:35:25.220 --> 1:35:27.220]  And he was working with Pollard back in the day, I believe, right?
[1:35:27.220 --> 1:35:29.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:35:29.220 --> 1:35:31.220]  Now, last year, another question.
[1:35:31.220 --> 1:35:33.220]  Last year, it was reported that a 9-11 up first
[1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:35.220]  responded by the name of Kevin McFadden
[1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:37.220]  and Pollard, an actual demolition countdown
[1:35:37.220 --> 1:35:39.220]  for World Trade Center 7 from the Red Cross.
[1:35:39.220 --> 1:35:41.220]  My question is, is there any way
[1:35:41.220 --> 1:35:43.220]  to get in contact with those 9-11 tapes
[1:35:43.220 --> 1:35:45.220]  from the Red Cross to actually confirm
[1:35:45.220 --> 1:35:47.220]  that there was no countdown?
[1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:49.220]  That's something you probably have to bring up
[1:35:49.220 --> 1:35:51.220]  with the offices at the Red Cross.
[1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:53.220]  I don't know if they would have those tapes.
[1:35:53.220 --> 1:35:55.220]  I think the only tapes that are public
[1:35:55.220 --> 1:35:57.220]  are the actual cop-to-cop responses.
[1:35:57.220 --> 1:35:59.220]  In other words, those audio tapes
[1:35:59.220 --> 1:36:01.220]  are available.
[1:36:01.220 --> 1:36:03.220]  We played a little bit about the vans
[1:36:03.220 --> 1:36:05.220]  yesterday.
[1:36:05.220 --> 1:36:07.220]  Kevin McFadden is going to be featured
[1:36:07.220 --> 1:36:09.220]  in Alex Jones' new film, The 9-11 Chronicles,
[1:36:09.220 --> 1:36:11.220]  Truth Rising, and you're going to get to hear
[1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:13.220]  that whole thing about the countdown
[1:36:13.220 --> 1:36:15.220]  and everything in his interview.
[1:36:15.220 --> 1:36:17.220]  I'm not quite sure if we can get a hold of those tapes.
[1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:19.220]  I'd love them.
[1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:21.220]  Hey, that's why we have these info warriors out there
[1:36:21.220 --> 1:36:23.220]  covering every single different angle, because we can't do it all.
[1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:25.220]  Okay.
[1:36:25.220 --> 1:36:27.220]  All right. Thank you, Jay.
[1:36:27.220 --> 1:36:29.220]  All right, let's go to Don in Texas.
[1:36:29.220 --> 1:36:31.220]  Don, are you with me?
[1:36:31.220 --> 1:36:33.220]  Hi there. You there?
[1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:34.220]  Absolutely.
[1:36:34.220 --> 1:36:36.220]  Good deal.
[1:36:36.220 --> 1:36:38.220]  I was going about something a little bit off the topic,
[1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:40.220]  but it's where they rated the,
[1:36:40.220 --> 1:36:42.220]  because they claimed it was Mormons
[1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:44.220]  in West Texas.
[1:36:44.220 --> 1:36:46.220]  It took all our kids, you know,
[1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:49.220]  450 kids or something to kidnap them.
[1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:51.220]  And I was reading them, you know,
[1:36:51.220 --> 1:36:53.220]  the American Free Press.
[1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:56.220]  I read an article in it that stated that
[1:36:56.220 --> 1:36:59.220]  the reason they did that, the information,
[1:36:59.220 --> 1:37:01.220]  a large part was, you know,
[1:37:01.220 --> 1:37:04.220]  the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL were,
[1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:07.220]  you know, as they did in the, you know, Waco
[1:37:07.220 --> 1:37:11.220]  and Dennis Weaver, you know, some of the other cases
[1:37:11.220 --> 1:37:14.220]  that they, because the law enforcement appears
[1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:17.220]  to give them credibility about
[1:37:17.220 --> 1:37:20.220]  whether they're fanciful or, you know,
[1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:23.220]  just to make, if they make up things.
[1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:26.220]  And the Mormons are famous for
[1:37:26.220 --> 1:37:30.220]  the research and worldwide contacts they had
[1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:33.220]  to have this like Bobby Fisher, you know,
[1:37:33.220 --> 1:37:35.220]  the chess player that was killed.
[1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:40.220]  He was contemplating producing a tell-all
[1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:43.220]  two-volume set, you know,
[1:37:43.220 --> 1:37:46.220]  and he was extinguished.
[1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:49.220]  And that the reason they did that was not
[1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:52.220]  because they wanted to be nice to kids,
[1:37:52.220 --> 1:37:55.220]  which they, you know, you heard about that case, I guess.
[1:37:55.220 --> 1:37:57.220]  A little bit, yes.
[1:37:57.220 --> 1:37:59.220]  Well, they took all these kids
[1:37:59.220 --> 1:38:01.220]  and yanked them away from their mothers
[1:38:01.220 --> 1:38:03.220]  and went around and they were going,
[1:38:03.220 --> 1:38:05.220]  they didn't waterboard them,
[1:38:05.220 --> 1:38:08.220]  but they used pretty heavy-handed techniques
[1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:12.220]  to force them to make false, you know,
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:14.220]  you know, saying they were rape
[1:38:14.220 --> 1:38:16.220]  when they were 12 years old or stuff like that.
[1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:18.220]  And there's no evidence.
[1:38:18.220 --> 1:38:20.220]  They had to take them all back
[1:38:20.220 --> 1:38:22.220]  because there was no concrete evidence at all.
[1:38:22.220 --> 1:38:26.220]  They couldn't even, you couldn't even coerce the children
[1:38:26.220 --> 1:38:28.220]  to make false reports.
[1:38:28.220 --> 1:38:30.220]  You didn't know much about that.
[1:38:30.220 --> 1:38:32.220]  No, I didn't. We'll have to look into that.
[1:38:32.220 --> 1:38:34.220]  Don, I thank you for the call.
[1:38:34.220 --> 1:38:35.220]  I got to jump to the next one.
[1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:37.220]  Let's go to Joseph in Illinois.
[1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:39.220]  Maybe this is another urban warfare drill call.
[1:38:39.220 --> 1:38:40.220]  It could be something different,
[1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:42.220]  but that urban warfare drill going out there,
[1:38:42.220 --> 1:38:45.220]  it's there to train the tubes for a domestic takeover.
[1:38:45.220 --> 1:38:46.220]  Yes, Joseph.
[1:38:46.220 --> 1:38:49.220]  Okay, I have some information pertaining
[1:38:49.220 --> 1:38:51.220]  to a possible war with Iran.
[1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:53.220]  All right, let's hear it.
[1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:55.220]  I am a member of the United States Navy Delight
[1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:56.220]  Entry Program.
[1:38:56.220 --> 1:38:59.220]  I'm going to get out because I don't agree
[1:38:59.220 --> 1:39:00.220]  with what's going on.
[1:39:00.220 --> 1:39:03.220]  But I've been told by numerous National Guardsmen,
[1:39:03.220 --> 1:39:06.220]  reservists, special operations,
[1:39:06.220 --> 1:39:08.220]  that the rest of the National Guardians
[1:39:08.220 --> 1:39:10.220]  are to be activated this month.
[1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:14.220]  And there's already a giant build-up in Afghanistan
[1:39:14.220 --> 1:39:17.220]  with 5,000 Marines going over there.
[1:39:17.220 --> 1:39:20.220]  And the fact that there probably will be a draft
[1:39:20.220 --> 1:39:23.220]  if we decide to go ahead and get the green light.
[1:39:23.220 --> 1:39:25.220]  So we're going to have conscription in this country now.
[1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:26.220]  Huh?
[1:39:26.220 --> 1:39:28.220]  We're going to have conscription again in this country now.
[1:39:28.220 --> 1:39:30.220]  I really wouldn't doubt it.
[1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:33.220]  I was told I'm not supposed to say this information,
[1:39:33.220 --> 1:39:35.220]  but I'm jumping the gun saying it
[1:39:35.220 --> 1:39:37.220]  because it needs to get told.
[1:39:37.220 --> 1:39:39.220]  Absolutely, especially if they're going to send
[1:39:39.220 --> 1:39:40.220]  our National Guardsmen over there.
[1:39:40.220 --> 1:39:42.220]  I mean, that's another thing that has really bothered me
[1:39:42.220 --> 1:39:45.220]  about all this war we've had.
[1:39:45.220 --> 1:39:47.220]  I almost joined the National Guard.
[1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:49.220]  I took the ASVAB test with my buddy.
[1:39:49.220 --> 1:39:51.220]  My buddy did end up joining.
[1:39:51.220 --> 1:39:53.220]  He thought this was going to be to pay for college.
[1:39:53.220 --> 1:39:55.220]  This was way back in 99.
[1:39:55.220 --> 1:39:57.220]  And he ended up having to spend six months in Iraq, folks.
[1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:00.220]  He got blown up in a tank, lost a hearing in one ear.
[1:40:00.220 --> 1:40:03.220]  The experience changed him tremendously.
[1:40:03.220 --> 1:40:07.220]  Before he went to Iraq, he was running duty over at airports.
[1:40:07.220 --> 1:40:10.220]  And if that terrorism threat was real, yeah, I can see that.
[1:40:10.220 --> 1:40:12.220]  The National Guards are there to protect the states,
[1:40:12.220 --> 1:40:15.220]  not to go overseas to fight wars,
[1:40:15.220 --> 1:40:17.220]  but that's what they're changing them into.
[1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:20.220]  Regular military personnel, regular army.
[1:40:20.220 --> 1:40:22.220]  And they want them over there because they need them over there
[1:40:22.220 --> 1:40:25.220]  because they need the numbers because less and less people
[1:40:25.220 --> 1:40:28.220]  are buying into this and the recruiters are having trouble
[1:40:28.220 --> 1:40:30.220]  getting soldiers, correct?
[1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:35.220]  Yes, they're giving away $40,000 bonuses just to get people.
[1:40:35.220 --> 1:40:37.220]  Absolutely, that's what they're telling them,
[1:40:37.220 --> 1:40:39.220]  to sign your entire soul over.
[1:40:39.220 --> 1:40:41.220]  We had a debunker a few weeks back,
[1:40:41.220 --> 1:40:44.220]  one of the guys that hates loose change or whatever.
[1:40:44.220 --> 1:40:48.220]  And he had gotten called into his office for a checkup.
[1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:50.220]  He wasn't due for another checkup for five years.
[1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:52.220]  He was kind of suspicious about it.
[1:40:52.220 --> 1:40:54.220]  He passes the checkup with flying colors,
[1:40:54.220 --> 1:40:57.220]  and then they stamp his paperwork saying RFID,
[1:40:57.220 --> 1:40:59.220]  and they chip him the next week.
[1:40:59.220 --> 1:41:01.220]  And he couldn't do anything about it,
[1:41:01.220 --> 1:41:03.220]  except for if he wanted to leave the military.
[1:41:03.220 --> 1:41:05.220]  I mean, they could have court-martialed him.
[1:41:05.220 --> 1:41:07.220]  They could have thrown him in military prison.
[1:41:07.220 --> 1:41:09.220]  They could have put him in the brig the whole night.
[1:41:09.220 --> 1:41:11.220]  So, you know, they're chipping our military.
[1:41:11.220 --> 1:41:13.220]  That's another incentive not to join, wouldn't you say?
[1:41:13.220 --> 1:41:15.220]  Well, just type it in.
[1:41:15.220 --> 1:41:18.220]  Type in unsecured coins, RFID chip,
[1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:20.220]  or you can go to loosechangeinio1.com.
[1:41:20.220 --> 1:41:22.220]  We did a big story about it.
[1:41:22.220 --> 1:41:24.220]  It's back in the archives about two or three weeks.
[1:41:24.220 --> 1:41:25.220]  You can see his paperwork.
[1:41:25.220 --> 1:41:26.220]  It's unbelievable.
[1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:30.220]  They're chipping military personnel without their consent.
[1:41:30.220 --> 1:41:31.220]  There is no consent.
[1:41:31.220 --> 1:41:34.220]  The military owns you when you sign on the dotted line.
[1:41:34.220 --> 1:41:35.220]  Thank you for that information.
[1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:36.220]  Hey, I've got one more thing to say.
[1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:37.220]  Go ahead.
[1:41:37.220 --> 1:41:39.220]  If you look at the location of where Iran is,
[1:41:39.220 --> 1:41:41.220]  and you see Afghanistan and Israel,
[1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:44.220]  that looks like the prime position for a pincer attack.
[1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:46.220]  You know, and not only that,
[1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:48.220]  but if you look at where Iraq and Afghanistan are
[1:41:48.220 --> 1:41:51.220]  in relation to Iran, it surrounds it.
[1:41:51.220 --> 1:41:53.220]  You know, it's on either side,
[1:41:53.220 --> 1:41:55.220]  and it really looks like they're ready to do this.
[1:41:55.220 --> 1:41:57.220]  You know, I know Daniel Estalon was on yesterday.
[1:41:57.220 --> 1:41:58.220]  He doesn't agree with me,
[1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:01.220]  but I think they want to go into Iran in the worst way.
[1:42:01.220 --> 1:42:02.220]  Thank you, Joseph.
[1:42:02.220 --> 1:42:05.220]  All right, let's jump to Lee in Oklahoma.
[1:42:05.220 --> 1:42:06.220]  Lee, are you with me?
[1:42:06.220 --> 1:42:07.220]  Hi, how are you?
[1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:08.220]  Good.
[1:42:08.220 --> 1:42:12.220]  I misphased you yesterday, telling you that I,
[1:42:12.220 --> 1:42:14.220]  asking to be your friend,
[1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.220]  telling you I had an anti-vaccination, my space.
[1:42:17.220 --> 1:42:22.220]  I am so concerned about this vaccine thing,
[1:42:22.220 --> 1:42:26.220]  and have been against vaccines for about 25 years.
[1:42:26.220 --> 1:42:29.220]  But after hearing Rima Labo and General Stubblebine
[1:42:29.220 --> 1:42:31.220]  on the radio yesterday,
[1:42:31.220 --> 1:42:35.220]  been doing some research into her stuff,
[1:42:35.220 --> 1:42:39.220]  and I would like to encourage everybody to go to her website,
[1:42:39.220 --> 1:42:43.220]  HelpFreedomUSA.org,
[1:42:43.220 --> 1:42:47.220]  because she's fighting CODEX, Alamon Terrace.
[1:42:47.220 --> 1:42:51.220]  But I got an email alert from her today saying that
[1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:56.220]  we only had five days to stop the legislation in New York
[1:42:56.220 --> 1:43:03.220]  that is making vaccination compulsory with no exemptions in New York.
[1:43:03.220 --> 1:43:08.220]  That really upsets me, because I have some unvaccinated family members,
[1:43:08.220 --> 1:43:10.220]  and I want to keep them that way.
[1:43:10.220 --> 1:43:17.220]  And after what they did to New Jersey and Maryland and New York,
[1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:21.220]  it's coming this way.
[1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:25.220]  They're trying to change their color of law to mandatory
[1:43:25.220 --> 1:43:27.220]  so that they can put your parents in prison
[1:43:27.220 --> 1:43:30.220]  if you dare not vaccinate your children.
[1:43:30.220 --> 1:43:32.220]  But why would you want to poison these kids?
[1:43:32.220 --> 1:43:34.220]  Mercury is not good for you.
[1:43:34.220 --> 1:43:36.220]  God knows what else they have.
[1:43:36.220 --> 1:43:38.220]  They've been caught putting SV40 in the vaccine,
[1:43:38.220 --> 1:43:40.220]  Simeon virus 40.
[1:43:40.220 --> 1:43:42.220]  Dr. Sherry Tenpanney says there's over 100,
[1:43:42.220 --> 1:43:45.220]  I'm quoting her, I hope I get this right.
[1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:48.220]  There's over 100 organisms in the vaccines,
[1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:50.220]  including, and Alex says this all the time,
[1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:53.220]  including many cancer organisms.
[1:43:53.220 --> 1:44:00.220]  And if they carry off vaccinating like they say they're going to,
[1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:02.220]  we're not going to have to worry about World War III.
[1:44:02.220 --> 1:44:04.220]  We're all going to be dead.
[1:44:04.220 --> 1:44:10.220]  You cannot inject nothing but animal blood, animal DNA,
[1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:14.220]  heavy metals, poison, formaldehyde.
[1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:16.220]  There's nothing good in vaccines.
[1:44:16.220 --> 1:44:18.220]  They are not fairy dust.
[1:44:18.220 --> 1:44:20.220]  I wish people would get this through their head.
[1:44:20.220 --> 1:44:22.220]  It's not a good thing.
[1:44:22.220 --> 1:44:25.220]  You know, one of the big things for me,
[1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:29.220]  back in the day when I was just on the fringe,
[1:44:29.220 --> 1:44:31.220]  I guess I hadn't made loose change.
[1:44:31.220 --> 1:44:33.220]  I was just working regular jobs.
[1:44:33.220 --> 1:44:35.220]  This is back in O3.
[1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:37.220]  And I was still running my mouth.
[1:44:37.220 --> 1:44:39.220]  One of the people I was working with,
[1:44:39.220 --> 1:44:41.220]  my boss actually, he's like,
[1:44:41.220 --> 1:44:45.220]  yeah, my kids had a terrorism drill at school today.
[1:44:45.220 --> 1:44:47.220]  They were all loaded onto a bus.
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:49.220]  They were taken to the local sheriff's department.
[1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.220]  In other words, that's a local detention center.
[1:44:51.220 --> 1:44:53.220]  It's where they got a little cell
[1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:55.220]  for probably about 100, 150 people.
[1:44:55.220 --> 1:44:57.220]  And they brought them on there.
[1:44:57.220 --> 1:44:59.220]  And as they got off the bus,
[1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:01.220]  they took mock vaccinations.
[1:45:01.220 --> 1:45:03.220]  In other words, yeah, it's great.
[1:45:03.220 --> 1:45:05.220]  They just train you right there.
[1:45:05.220 --> 1:45:07.220]  I mean, literally getting a line,
[1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:09.220]  you're getting off the bus,
[1:45:09.220 --> 1:45:11.220]  and then they would dot you
[1:45:11.220 --> 1:45:13.220]  instead of actually pricking you.
[1:45:13.220 --> 1:45:15.220]  It would be like a little marker dot.
[1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:17.220]  And that was to get you ready
[1:45:17.220 --> 1:45:19.220]  to take a vaccination right off the bus
[1:45:19.220 --> 1:45:21.220]  into your internment camp.
[1:45:21.220 --> 1:45:23.220]  And these are kids that are like,
[1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.220]  I don't know, they're less than 12 years old.
[1:45:25.220 --> 1:45:27.220]  And the thing was that really
[1:45:27.220 --> 1:45:29.220]  worried me about it.
[1:45:29.220 --> 1:45:31.220]  My boss's wife, another person that I had worked with,
[1:45:31.220 --> 1:45:33.220]  she was like, well, it's something
[1:45:33.220 --> 1:45:35.220]  they're going to have to deal with in their lifetime.
[1:45:35.220 --> 1:45:37.220]  And she was telling her kid this, and I'm like,
[1:45:37.220 --> 1:45:39.220]  listen, what you should have told your kid
[1:45:39.220 --> 1:45:41.220]  is don't get on the bus.
[1:45:41.220 --> 1:45:43.220]  Call me, I'm going to come pick you up
[1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:45.220]  and forget about it.
[1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:47.220]  I'm like, you're signing a death sentence
[1:45:47.220 --> 1:45:49.220]  for your child.
[1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:51.220]  You are literally signing a death sentence.
[1:45:51.220 --> 1:45:53.220]  And not a pleasant death either.
[1:45:53.220 --> 1:45:55.220]  It's a long drawn out one.
[1:45:55.220 --> 1:45:57.220]  Thank you for the call.
[1:45:57.220 --> 1:45:59.220]  It's gross. It is just disgusting.
[1:45:59.220 --> 1:46:01.220]  And you don't think they're doing this stuff.
[1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:03.220]  They're doing it.
[1:46:03.220 --> 1:46:05.220]  I got another friend I grew up with.
[1:46:05.220 --> 1:46:07.220]  I'm going to be seeing in a wedding
[1:46:07.220 --> 1:46:09.220]  I'm going to in a couple weeks.
[1:46:09.220 --> 1:46:11.220]  And she's a teacher.
[1:46:11.220 --> 1:46:13.220]  I got a lot of friends that are teachers
[1:46:13.220 --> 1:46:15.220]  that have made the jump into schools.
[1:46:15.220 --> 1:46:17.220]  Her mom was the school nurse.
[1:46:17.220 --> 1:46:19.220]  Her sister was actually a local news reporter.
[1:46:19.220 --> 1:46:21.220]  Anyway, she goes into this new classroom.
[1:46:21.220 --> 1:46:23.220]  For an entire year.
[1:46:23.220 --> 1:46:25.220]  And she decides to do summer school.
[1:46:25.220 --> 1:46:27.220]  It wasn't even summer school time yet.
[1:46:27.220 --> 1:46:29.220]  I don't think I think it was softball season.
[1:46:29.220 --> 1:46:31.220]  So it was just before summer.
[1:46:31.220 --> 1:46:33.220]  And she's sitting there getting
[1:46:33.220 --> 1:46:35.220]  changed and she notices
[1:46:35.220 --> 1:46:37.220]  in like one of these columns
[1:46:37.220 --> 1:46:39.220]  that have those
[1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:41.220]  places where you plug things in
[1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:43.220]  that there was a hollow spot in one of the plugs.
[1:46:43.220 --> 1:46:45.220]  And she looked at the hollow spot
[1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:47.220]  and there was a camera
[1:46:47.220 --> 1:46:49.220]  right there.
[1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:51.220]  And she was like, oh my god, I can't believe this.
[1:46:51.220 --> 1:46:53.220]  So
[1:46:53.220 --> 1:46:55.220]  she got spooked. She brought her mother in.
[1:46:55.220 --> 1:46:57.220]  Her mother came in.
[1:46:57.220 --> 1:46:59.220]  They decided to put a post it
[1:46:59.220 --> 1:47:01.220]  label over the camera.
[1:47:01.220 --> 1:47:03.220]  Now the next day she comes into class.
[1:47:03.220 --> 1:47:05.220]  She takes the post it label off.
[1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:07.220]  Cameras gone.
[1:47:07.220 --> 1:47:09.220]  Now she was very, very concerned about this.
[1:47:09.220 --> 1:47:11.220]  So she brought her mother
[1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:13.220]  into the superintendent's office
[1:47:13.220 --> 1:47:15.220]  with her.
[1:47:15.220 --> 1:47:17.220]  And she said, look, I'm not crazy.
[1:47:17.220 --> 1:47:19.220]  I'm in my classroom
[1:47:19.220 --> 1:47:21.220]  and the superintendent's like, well, you know,
[1:47:21.220 --> 1:47:23.220]  I can explain that. Oh, he knows.
[1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:25.220]  He knows they've been spying on her.
[1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:27.220]  And he said, well,
[1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:29.220]  the thing was that the teacher
[1:47:29.220 --> 1:47:31.220]  who had that classroom last year
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:33.220]  got robbed a couple times.
[1:47:33.220 --> 1:47:35.220]  So we put that camera in
[1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:37.220]  to make sure that nobody was stealing.
[1:47:37.220 --> 1:47:39.220]  And then she's like, well,
[1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:41.220]  why didn't you tell me? And he's like, oh,
[1:47:41.220 --> 1:47:43.220]  we didn't think it was necessary to tell you because we don't
[1:47:43.220 --> 1:47:45.220]  ever have it turned on.
[1:47:45.220 --> 1:47:47.220]  He's like, well, if you don't ever have it
[1:47:47.220 --> 1:47:49.220]  turned on, then how did you know to take it out
[1:47:49.220 --> 1:47:51.220]  when I put a post it note over it?
[1:47:51.220 --> 1:47:53.220]  You didn't have an answer for that.
[1:47:53.220 --> 1:47:55.220]  The truth of the matter is there are hidden
[1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:57.220]  cameras in our schools
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:47:59.220]  for our children right now
[1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:01.220]  right now. A lot of them are in the bathrooms.
[1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:03.220]  There is no privacy anymore.
[1:48:03.220 --> 1:48:05.220]  I mean, this is where she goes
[1:48:05.220 --> 1:48:07.220]  and changes.
[1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:09.220]  And in this classroom after hours
[1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.220]  and they've got a hidden camera on her,
[1:48:11.220 --> 1:48:13.220]  they don't even tell her about.
[1:48:13.220 --> 1:48:15.220]  This thing, is it the superintendent?
[1:48:15.220 --> 1:48:17.220]  Is it his lackey?
[1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:19.220]  Is it the janitorial staff? Is it everybody?
[1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:21.220]  Is everybody getting a big kick out of this?
[1:48:21.220 --> 1:48:23.220]  It's the new surveillance society, folks,
[1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:25.220]  and it makes me sick.
[1:48:25.220 --> 1:48:27.220]  It makes me ill.
[1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:29.220]  And I just thank God
[1:48:29.220 --> 1:48:31.220]  that there are people like Alex Jones out there
[1:48:31.220 --> 1:48:33.220]  that are challenging this system.
[1:48:33.220 --> 1:48:35.220]  There are people like Luke Radowski out there
[1:48:35.220 --> 1:48:37.220]  that literally just drove, you know,
[1:48:37.220 --> 1:48:39.220]  five, six hours from Manhattan, New York City
[1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:41.220]  to get down to Virginia
[1:48:41.220 --> 1:48:43.220]  all of these elitists to let us know
[1:48:43.220 --> 1:48:45.220]  who the builder
[1:48:45.220 --> 1:48:47.220]  Berg group is.
[1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:49.220]  What are they doing in there?
[1:48:49.220 --> 1:48:51.220]  Well, they're setting world policy. They're setting the stage
[1:48:51.220 --> 1:48:53.220]  for a global
[1:48:53.220 --> 1:48:55.220]  government. That's what they're doing over there.
[1:48:57.220 --> 1:48:59.220]  All right, let's jump to one more call before the break.
[1:48:59.220 --> 1:49:01.220]  Let's go to Chris in Kansas.
[1:49:01.220 --> 1:49:03.220]  Chris, are you with us? Yeah, bud. How are you doing, my brother?
[1:49:03.220 --> 1:49:05.220]  Good.
[1:49:05.220 --> 1:49:07.220]  Hey, I'll touch on a couple of things real quick.
[1:49:07.220 --> 1:49:09.220]  I'm a golf war aerobat
[1:49:09.220 --> 1:49:11.220]  after receiving
[1:49:11.220 --> 1:49:13.220]  17 vaccinations
[1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:15.220]  in my fifth day in basic training
[1:49:15.220 --> 1:49:17.220]  at Fort Dix back in February,
[1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:19.220]  1991.
[1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:21.220]  I'd come down with chicken pox.
[1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:23.220]  That's what they said anyway.
[1:49:23.220 --> 1:49:25.220]  Told me I had a 50-50 shot
[1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:27.220]  of living.
[1:49:27.220 --> 1:49:29.220]  Oh, from the chicken pox? That's nice.
[1:49:29.220 --> 1:49:31.220]  I was in quarantine three weeks, high fever.
[1:49:31.220 --> 1:49:33.220]  Now I'm disabled.
[1:49:33.220 --> 1:49:35.220]  I'm 36 now.
[1:49:35.220 --> 1:49:37.220]  And my old body,
[1:49:37.220 --> 1:49:39.220]  I've got a lot of neurological problems
[1:49:39.220 --> 1:49:41.220]  and so forth.
[1:49:41.220 --> 1:49:43.220]  Just to touch on that,
[1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:45.220]  schools, something real interesting
[1:49:45.220 --> 1:49:47.220]  real quick. I'm originally from Dayton, Ohio.
[1:49:47.220 --> 1:49:49.220]  And I'd went home about two years
[1:49:49.220 --> 1:49:51.220]  ago in my middle school, my elementary
[1:49:51.220 --> 1:49:53.220]  school, when part of the high school had been
[1:49:53.220 --> 1:49:55.220]  torn down. That's my dad.
[1:49:55.220 --> 1:49:57.220]  I said, when did they
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:49:59.220]  build new schools?
[1:49:59.220 --> 1:50:01.220]  And he said, oh yeah, the government paid
[1:50:01.220 --> 1:50:03.220]  for it. They got cameras
[1:50:03.220 --> 1:50:05.220]  in every classroom. And I started talking
[1:50:05.220 --> 1:50:07.220]  to one of my friends who had their kids in the school system.
[1:50:07.220 --> 1:50:09.220]  And they can go on the internet
[1:50:09.220 --> 1:50:11.220]  and watch their kids in the classroom.
[1:50:11.220 --> 1:50:13.220]  I mean,
[1:50:13.220 --> 1:50:15.220]  total 1984.
[1:50:15.220 --> 1:50:17.220]  That's totally crazy.
[1:50:17.220 --> 1:50:19.220]  And it's true, we've been acclimated for it, man.
[1:50:19.220 --> 1:50:21.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:50:21.220 --> 1:50:23.220]  I call a local radio show about
[1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:25.220]  all the cameras going up everywhere.
[1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:27.220]  And they act like I'm crazy.
[1:50:27.220 --> 1:50:29.220]  Yeah, you're actually the same one, brother.
[1:50:29.220 --> 1:50:31.220]  One last thing I'd like to tell the American people,
[1:50:31.220 --> 1:50:33.220]  and God bless you
[1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:35.220]  and Alex and everyone else
[1:50:35.220 --> 1:50:37.220]  that's gotten the word out, and I've tried my best.
[1:50:37.220 --> 1:50:39.220]  You know,
[1:50:39.220 --> 1:50:41.220]  3-5% won the Revolutionary War.
[1:50:41.220 --> 1:50:43.220]  All right,
[1:50:43.220 --> 1:50:45.220]  man, we got a job, but I thank you, man.
[1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:47.220]  I thank you for the call. And we're going to be back after this
[1:50:47.220 --> 1:51:11.220]  is the Alex Jones show, infowars.com.

[1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:02.220]  In 1814 we took a little trip
[1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:05.220]  along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[1:54:05.220 --> 1:54:08.220]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
[1:54:08.220 --> 1:54:11.220]  and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:13.220]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[1:54:13.220 --> 1:54:16.220]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[1:54:16.220 --> 1:54:19.220]  We fired once more and they began to run
[1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:22.220]  down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:54:22.220 --> 1:54:25.220]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:25.220 --> 1:54:27.220]  I better put this out there.
[1:54:27.220 --> 1:54:29.220]  During one of the segments,
[1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:32.220]  someone tried calling me from the Westfield Marriott
[1:54:32.220 --> 1:54:34.220]  over at the Bilderberg conference
[1:54:34.220 --> 1:54:36.220]  and I waited until the break.
[1:54:36.220 --> 1:54:39.220]  I waited until about 90 seconds after I got in the call.
[1:54:39.220 --> 1:54:42.220]  I got the front desk and they couldn't help me.
[1:54:42.220 --> 1:54:45.220]  Like I said, our prayers are with Alex right now.
[1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:47.220]  He hasn't been detained.
[1:54:47.220 --> 1:54:50.220]  I tried to get a hold of him through a separate number
[1:54:50.220 --> 1:54:52.220]  and I was unable to.
[1:54:52.220 --> 1:54:54.220]  So God knows what's happening out there.
[1:54:54.220 --> 1:54:56.220]  Let's support him.
[1:54:56.220 --> 1:54:59.220]  I got Bob Chapman coming up at the top of the hour
[1:54:59.220 --> 1:55:02.220]  to talk the economy, but I'm going to take a few more calls
[1:55:02.220 --> 1:55:04.220]  in this little segment I have left.
[1:55:04.220 --> 1:55:07.220]  Alright, let's go to a real scumbag.
[1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:10.220]  Somebody who has sold out humanity time and time again.
[1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:13.220]  Let's go to Troy in West Virginia posing as Mike the EMT.
[1:55:13.220 --> 1:55:16.220]  Yeah, I just tuned in to your old comedy show and when I did,
[1:55:16.220 --> 1:55:19.220]  you had some caller talking about Kevin McFadden
[1:55:19.220 --> 1:55:21.220]  and the countdown.
[1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:23.220]  McFadden is his name.
[1:55:23.220 --> 1:55:25.220]  It actually happened.
[1:55:25.220 --> 1:55:27.220]  It's called reality, actually.
[1:55:27.220 --> 1:55:29.220]  No, there was no countdown.
[1:55:29.220 --> 1:55:31.220]  Was there two people in the building who got blown up, Troy?
[1:55:31.220 --> 1:55:33.220]  Was that a fantasy?
[1:55:33.220 --> 1:55:35.220]  I'm wondering, is that a fantasy too, Troy?
[1:55:35.220 --> 1:55:37.220]  The two people that were blown up in Building 7?
[1:55:37.220 --> 1:55:39.220]  That's a fantasy?
[1:55:39.220 --> 1:55:41.220]  There was no countdown.
[1:55:41.220 --> 1:55:43.220]  You addressed the two people blown up,
[1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:45.220]  but you're just going to say there's no countdown.
[1:55:45.220 --> 1:55:47.220]  You weren't there.
[1:55:47.220 --> 1:55:49.220]  Yeah, two people blown up.
[1:55:49.220 --> 1:55:51.220]  Michael Hess and Barry Jennings.
[1:55:51.220 --> 1:55:53.220]  No, they weren't.
[1:55:53.220 --> 1:55:55.220]  Absolutely were.
[1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:57.220]  It's even in the FEMA report, you dummy.
[1:55:57.220 --> 1:55:59.220]  You know what's so great about you, Troy?
[1:55:59.220 --> 1:56:01.220]  You know what's so great?
[1:56:01.220 --> 1:56:03.220]  You can just deny everything that is reality.
[1:56:03.220 --> 1:56:05.220]  You know, I've tried to reach out to this guy.
[1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:07.220]  You've done so much research, too.
[1:56:07.220 --> 1:56:09.220]  Hold on, how many times you left West Virginia?
[1:56:09.220 --> 1:56:11.220]  Of course there were squibs.
[1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:13.220]  Yeah, you heard me yesterday.
[1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:15.220]  I described it.
[1:56:15.220 --> 1:56:17.220]  And that guy actually called in and apologized
[1:56:17.220 --> 1:56:19.220]  for the way that he's been addressing me.
[1:56:19.220 --> 1:56:21.220]  I think he's foolish for doing that.
[1:56:21.220 --> 1:56:23.220]  How dare he address a human being like another human being?
[1:56:23.220 --> 1:56:25.220]  Listen, I know that you're less than human.
[1:56:25.220 --> 1:56:27.220]  Listen, I get it, man.
[1:56:27.220 --> 1:56:29.220]  The only thing that you're worried about
[1:56:29.220 --> 1:56:31.220]  is you and your own.
[1:56:31.220 --> 1:56:33.220]  The one admirable thing about you
[1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:35.220]  is I believe that you probably take care of your kids,
[1:56:35.220 --> 1:56:37.220]  which is tops.
[1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:39.220]  I mean, family comes first,
[1:56:39.220 --> 1:56:41.220]  but you need to wake up into reality, man.
[1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:43.220]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[1:56:43.220 --> 1:56:45.220]  You just make up whatever you want.
[1:56:45.220 --> 1:56:47.220]  Oh, you do you?
[1:56:47.220 --> 1:56:49.220]  You're part of a demolition squad?
[1:56:49.220 --> 1:56:51.220]  No, no, you're part of a demolition squad now.
[1:56:51.220 --> 1:56:53.220]  Are you a part of a demolition squad?
[1:56:53.220 --> 1:56:55.220]  I don't have to be.
[1:56:55.220 --> 1:56:57.220]  How many people in a demolition squad agree with me?
[1:56:57.220 --> 1:56:59.220]  How many people in a demolition squad agree with you?
[1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:01.220]  Well, I know Jesse Ventura recently.
[1:57:01.220 --> 1:57:03.220]  Okay, Jesse Ventura is one of those people.
[1:57:03.220 --> 1:57:05.220]  Hold on.
[1:57:05.220 --> 1:57:07.220]  We have Danny Jovenko,
[1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:09.220]  who has never recanted.
[1:57:09.220 --> 1:57:11.220]  In fact, he's been called several times afterwards
[1:57:11.220 --> 1:57:13.220]  that says Building 7 is a controlled demolition.
[1:57:13.220 --> 1:57:15.220]  Listen, the molten metal didn't create itself, Troy.
[1:57:15.220 --> 1:57:17.220]  It didn't happen, you know, by itself.
[1:57:17.220 --> 1:57:19.220]  It didn't happen from jeffuel fires.
[1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:21.220]  Okay?
[1:57:21.220 --> 1:57:23.220]  And their official version of
[1:57:23.220 --> 1:57:25.220]  the beams got so hot
[1:57:25.220 --> 1:57:27.220]  that they weakened and it fell
[1:57:27.220 --> 1:57:29.220]  because it was 1500 to 1800 degrees
[1:57:29.220 --> 1:57:31.220]  on those floors is nonsense.
[1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:33.220]  You cannot have a human being
[1:57:33.220 --> 1:57:35.220]  in 1800 degree temperatures.
[1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:37.220]  Can we agree on that?
[1:57:37.220 --> 1:57:39.220]  You know what?
[1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:41.220]  Jump into an 1800 degree fire, Troy.
[1:57:41.220 --> 1:57:43.220]  That'll be great for all of us.
[1:57:43.220 --> 1:57:45.220]  No, that was my side job, big guy.
[1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:47.220]  Listen, I'm sorry if I worked for a living.
[1:57:47.220 --> 1:57:49.220]  I'm sorry if I did put in 60 hours a week
[1:57:49.220 --> 1:57:51.220]  if I had a day job and a night job.
[1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:53.220]  No, excuse me.
[1:57:53.220 --> 1:57:55.220]  Listen, I didn't make 80 hours a week.
[1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:57.220]  I was a graphic designer.
[1:57:57.220 --> 1:57:59.220]  I've been to college. I'm not a dummy.
[1:57:59.220 --> 1:58:01.220]  I know that you and your little southern accent
[1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:03.220]  think you're a smart guy.
[1:58:03.220 --> 1:58:05.220]  We're going to have to let you go
[1:58:05.220 --> 1:58:07.220]  because I have real people to talk to.
[1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:09.220]  But, you know, there he goes.
[1:58:09.220 --> 1:58:11.220]  He's just going to sell out humanity,
[1:58:11.220 --> 1:58:13.220]  deny everything that we've put out there.
[1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:15.220]  It doesn't matter that two people were blown up
[1:58:15.220 --> 1:58:17.220]  in Building 7 as well documented.
[1:58:17.220 --> 1:58:19.220]  It's in loose change, final cut for free.
[1:58:19.220 --> 1:58:21.220]  Troy's going to make up whatever he wants to.

[2:00:10.220 --> 2:00:12.220]  We are at the top of the third hour
[2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:14.220]  of this program.
[2:00:14.220 --> 2:00:16.220]  We've run four hours now
[2:00:16.220 --> 2:00:22.060]  Now it's the Alex Jones show and our prayers are with Alex. Let's hope everything's going down all right over there
[2:00:22.060 --> 2:00:24.060]  Let's hope he hasn't been detained
[2:00:24.220 --> 2:00:30.860]  You can check out that George Norrie interview that I played in the top of the first hour over at info wars calm
[2:00:30.860 --> 2:00:33.860]  And we're gonna be jumping subjects right now
[2:00:33.860 --> 2:00:35.660]  We're still gonna be taking your calls in about a half an hour
[2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:41.980]  We have Bob Chapman on the line of the international forecaster calm and we're gonna be talking
[2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:48.980]  Economy on the latest article up there is the impact of endless liquidity a bunch of great information on the website Bob
[2:00:48.980 --> 2:00:50.340]  How are you?
[2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:52.820]  Fine. Thank you, and it's very nice to be here again
[2:00:53.500 --> 2:00:57.500]  So I'm sure Alex really wishes he was on here rather than there
[2:00:57.540 --> 2:01:00.260]  Yeah, I mean he doesn't want to have to go down to Bilderberg
[2:01:00.260 --> 2:01:03.780]  But when nobody in the mainstream media is gonna cover this
[2:01:04.300 --> 2:01:09.980]  Organization of 125 elitists that are gonna set the course for the next 12 months. Someone's got to do it, right?
[2:01:09.980 --> 2:01:17.180]  Someone's got to do it, and you know, they've been meeting like this since 1952 and I
[2:01:17.900 --> 2:01:19.900]  Would say 15 or 20 major
[2:01:21.180 --> 2:01:27.060]  Periodicals throughout the world attend each time and do not report upon it and
[2:01:28.460 --> 2:01:35.060]  You know you say to yourself well why well obviously it's a closed meeting. It's conspiratorial in nature and
[2:01:35.740 --> 2:01:39.300]  You know the American and European and the world public
[2:01:39.300 --> 2:01:40.180]  but
[2:01:40.180 --> 2:01:44.500]  Generally speaking don't know anything about it and this is where the titans of
[2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:48.540]  Great money and industry the housing for the
[2:01:49.380 --> 2:01:50.500]  Illuminati
[2:01:50.500 --> 2:01:57.900]  This is their big meeting for the year and I'm glad Alex is there along with Jim Tucker who I've known for many years
[2:01:58.740 --> 2:02:03.900]  Going back to the original days when I was contributing financial
[2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:11.740]  Writer for the spotlight along with G. Gordon tether who had the Lombard column in the Financial Times in London
[2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:15.860]  until he mentioned the bankers and what they were doing and they fired him and
[2:02:17.300 --> 2:02:23.540]  Before that in the American Mercury, so I've been in this corner
[2:02:24.620 --> 2:02:26.620]  studying and researching
[2:02:27.100 --> 2:02:32.220]  The Bilderbergers and all the things that surround them for almost 50 years and so
[2:02:32.220 --> 2:02:35.280]  I'm glad I don't have to go there. I don't know where
[2:02:36.340 --> 2:02:41.180]  Jim Tucker gets the energy to do it. Oh god, and he's an old-timer, too
[2:02:41.180 --> 2:02:44.220]  He's been doing this for 30 plus years. We had him on the program
[2:02:44.980 --> 2:02:49.060]  Recently and it's just amazing that he's able to do this and he's you know
[2:02:49.060 --> 2:02:54.220]  He's gonna be a big loss for us when he's gone because he is he is really infiltrated this group
[2:02:54.260 --> 2:02:59.140]  He's been dead spot on every year with the predictions. He only makes about two or three of them
[2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:06.780]  They always come true and I'm just so happy that the awareness of Bilderberg has has spread so much that we actually have a hundred
[2:03:06.940 --> 2:03:09.380]  activists outside of the Bilderberg meeting right now
[2:03:10.180 --> 2:03:12.180]  well, that's really great and
[2:03:12.820 --> 2:03:16.140]  You know, that's why I continue to do what I do as well and
[2:03:16.860 --> 2:03:21.060]  in my own little niche of finance economics and so on and
[2:03:21.060 --> 2:03:29.140]  And like Jim most people who are our age are in geysering out in our rocking chairs
[2:03:29.140 --> 2:03:35.180]  And that's the last thing that I ever want to do and that would be like being in a perpetual jail to me
[2:03:35.700 --> 2:03:42.100]  But anyway, I'm sure they'll come back with a load of information. I see the the FBI was hassling them
[2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:48.340]  Oh, absolutely FBI Secret Service sweeps in the building. They've never seen security like this before
[2:03:48.340 --> 2:03:51.660]  We had Luke Radowski on just about a half an hour ago
[2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:55.020]  And he was confronted by the FBI and Secret Service
[2:03:55.020 --> 2:04:01.860]  They were trying to establish a leader so that they they were probably trying to establish a leader so that they could detain him and try
[2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:05.420]  To break the spirits of everybody else, but everybody just said look there are no leaders here
[2:04:05.420 --> 2:04:10.100]  We all came here on our own accord the media is not covering this so we have to cover it for them and
[2:04:10.740 --> 2:04:16.620]  We're on a we're on a public sidewalk. What are you trying to do to us? We still have a First Amendment right in this country, you know by
[2:04:16.620 --> 2:04:20.480]  By our teeth, I guess by the skin of our teeth. We have a First Amendment, right?
[2:04:20.620 --> 2:04:21.980]  But uh
[2:04:21.980 --> 2:04:25.980]  Officers apologize back off. So hopefully that's the way it's gonna go down all weekend
[2:04:25.980 --> 2:04:32.300]  We're talking to Bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com. We'll be back after this. It is the Alex Jones show

[2:07:54.080 --> 2:08:05.960]  Government cover-ups you want answers? Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  Alex Jones
[2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:13.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back on June 5th
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:19.640]  2008 Builderburg time Alex is out there and like I said, he tried to call me from the hotel
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:21.640]  I tried to call back the hotel and
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:23.640]  No dice, so
[2:08:24.680 --> 2:08:27.960]  People try to get a hold of them pray for him. Let's hope he hasn't been detained
[2:08:29.520 --> 2:08:34.600]  We need him out there giving this report because again this little meeting of
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:37.800]  125 people that you and I didn't elect to anything
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:43.360]  Are gonna make some big decisions. They're probably gonna make the decision to up the price of all oil
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:46.520]  So gas is gonna go up and our food is gonna go up even more
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:50.960]  We're already seeing food rations in New York of all places. I just couldn't believe that
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:55.680]  And the economy is going down the tubes, you know, they blew out the housing market this year
[2:08:55.680 --> 2:09:00.200]  I see a continuance of that, but let's ask somebody who actually knows what he's talking about
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:05.200]  Let's ask Bob Chapman. What what do you see as an economic forecaster for the next six months?
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:07.960]  What kind of economics are these guys gonna be discussing?
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:11.280]  Well, I think
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:16.320]  What they want to do is continue globalization, but it's gonna be very difficult to do that
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:23.760]  when you have these very high prices for grains and beans and energy products and
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:27.040]  What's happening is?
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:31.800]  countries are turning inward by putting controls if they're produces of
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:34.880]  beans and grains and
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:40.440]  To other countries because they're afraid they won't have enough of their own people and with that is starting
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:43.280]  a change and
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:46.960]  I think the avenues that are being discussed
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:49.920]  to solve these problems in
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:54.520]  The House and Senate are ridiculous here. They have George Cirrus
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:57.240]  appearing before a
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:01.200]  Senate panel yesterday and he advocates
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:04.600]  more controls and
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:08.440]  And with that, he's right, but you know, there were so many
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:12.360]  eminent people in that field
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:20.320]  Other than George Soros, they should have had them instead of him and the reason why is that George
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.880]  Soros is a convicted felon
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:31.880]  He was caught manipulating the the market in France and he was tried and convicted and he appealed and he lost his appeal
[2:10:32.040 --> 2:10:34.040]  So I think they had to go find somebody else
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:39.040]  And probably George is probably if they build a bit of a burger meeting for all I know
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:42.880]  Yes, he's certainly one of them. Yeah, absolutely. I believe he's gone there before
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:45.840]  Yes, he has
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:50.000]  But anyway, let's talk about the oil situation first of all
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:55.600]  oil consumption the United States has been trailing off and and that's good and
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:00.680]  We have eighty nine percent of this week this past week of
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:06.120]  of refinery capacity, which is up from about eighty six few weeks ago, which is good
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:11.400]  And but we also have a problem very high prices and
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:14.200]  that's been caused by
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:17.000]  Third world countries as we've known them in the past
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:21.040]  using more energy products among other things and
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:26.260]  That has continued to keep the level of consumption up
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  the
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:32.280]  The crooks of the thing here the investigation
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:38.320]  by Congress and the possibility of legislation is based upon
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:40.760]  manipulation and
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:42.920]  Let me tell you how the speculation works
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:47.280]  I read other writers who say the speculation makes up 60% of
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:50.880]  What's going on in those markets?
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:58.040]  Maybe I don't think so. I think it's more like 30. I'll compromise it at 45
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:00.720]  Now, how does this all happen?
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:07.400]  Well, most of the speculators in those markets and I might preface it by saying I spent 28 years in Wall Street
[2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:10.360]  I own my own brokerage firm for a number of years and
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:13.840]  And so I know about what goes on there
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:19.600]  I had you know, you have to have all these licenses to the run a brokerage firm and I had all them of course
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:21.600]  but anyway
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:24.200]  What's going on is this
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:26.920]  two-thirds of the money that was being made
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:34.200]  by investment banking and brokerage houses and banks was emanating from the
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:37.680]  packaging of
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.680]  mortgages into bonds they were called collateralized debt obligations
[2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:49.880]  And in other types of titles which I won't go into and they package these and they sold them
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:55.440]  And they made lots of money doing that. The only thing is the ratings that were on these packages of AAA
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:59.960]  really should have been triple B, which is a difference between a ten and a four and
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:04.960]  I don't see any in any criminal investigations into the
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:09.000]  investment banks banks and brokerage firms put these packages together
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  and and who were in bed with Moody's Fitch and
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:20.360]  S&P because they should have criminal investigations because they defrauded the buyers
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.360]  Now you say to yourself
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:29.560]  Their business is frozen they can't go any further because nobody wants to buy these things anymore
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:36.160]  So what do they do next well the federally reserve pops in and they they cause the real estate problem in the first place
[2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:42.200]  They pop in because the people in the banks who own the Fed reserve are among these
[2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:47.640]  People who can't make any money anymore because everything's frozen and they're looking at these
[2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:52.920]  Tremendous losses hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. So we got to make some money fast
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:55.560]  So the Fed
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:02.280]  Opens a discount window up doesn't tell anybody who buys so nobody outside can know they have options and
[2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:07.920]  and they give money away for 28 days and purportedly get it back when in fact they're rolling it and
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:13.520]  They're they're dishing out about 300 billion dollars a month and so
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.480]  They can't directly control where the money goes
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:24.440]  So the banks have it the banks use it and the banks lend it to other speculators because banks are speculators
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:28.320]  even though you didn't know that you do now and
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:35.840]  They were using this tremendous amount of money and still are in the commodity markets and
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:43.400]  They are responsible for driving the price of commodities up all of them beyond where they should be and
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:51.640]  Also our Congress which is equally to blame and incidentally in the next issue of the International Forecaster
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.200]  I have an interview on C-SPAN and
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:59.120]  In that interview with the Senate panel
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:06.200]  Is a man who is the former head of the CFTC commodity futures traders corporate trading corporation?
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:12.800]  His name is mr. Greenberger and he spills the beans. He really lays it out and I have that interview
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:18.840]  Available for the people who are subscribers and those who want a free copy anyway
[2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:28.840]  What the Congress did was create a loophole so that the banks could create swaps and actually the swaps were
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:39.040]  Contracts for commodities off exchange. So nobody knew what they were doing and that's how they were able to create this tremendous
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:42.040]  upsurge in the market and
[2:15:42.280 --> 2:15:46.600]  That's what Congress is trying to get to the bottom of but there are
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:54.920]  Essentially things that made oil and soybeans and other things go up such as ethanol
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:01.000]  But the big boom the the the bubble a short-term bubble
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:05.880]  It's a short-term bubble that's been created in all these economy and all of these commodities
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:09.120]  has to be broken and
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:18.680]  The the people who are behind this of the Fed reserve the banks the investment banking houses and the brokerage firms again
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:23.360]  Now do you feel they were happy with comm they weren't happy with real estate?
[2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:30.800]  They weren't have to happy packaging that they only made hundreds of billions or if not trillions of dollars and now they got to do this
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:37.520]  Do you feel that this is being engineered though to try to bring us into a North American Union to try to take down the standard of living in
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:42.760]  This country to possibly foreclose on homes and really try to create a second world nation here at home
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:47.240]  Absolutely, I wrote about it in the American Mercury in 1967
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:54.280]  Why do you elaborate on that with the only way that they could bring America to its knees to force not only America
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:58.160]  But Canada in Europe to accept world government. This was all planned
[2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:04.480]  They try to stop the plans because everything went upside down on them in the Middle East and they couldn't stop them
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:11.720]  And that's when Zavigno Brzezinski came out two years ago and said they've just put world government back
[2:17:11.880 --> 2:17:17.840]  30 years they being the meatballs in Washington and he was furious with them and
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:20.640]  That doesn't mean it's going to change their plans
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:26.720]  But it's going to make trying to get the North American Union set in place extremely difficult
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:29.960]  There's been so much warning over the past two to three years
[2:17:29.960 --> 2:17:38.480]  But when I saw that Ben Steele was transferred from the Royal Society the Royal Institute in London, which is the
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:43.120]  The model on which the Council on Foreign Relations
[2:17:43.840 --> 2:17:49.360]  Was modeled on in 1921 when they were formed when he when he went over on loan
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:54.840]  I knew they were getting serious about this and then they had Robert pastor front for the thing
[2:17:54.840 --> 2:18:02.440]  Not telling everybody what Ben Steele was doing and then I see last week a hard money conference in New York put on by
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:10.240]  Resource consultants had been steel steel as a speaker. I mean, that's the enemy. I couldn't believe it
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:16.600]  And I told them I must subscribe is not to go to their conferences because they're in bed with these people
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:23.240]  But be as it may I think the North American Union is a long ways away
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:29.680]  I think they will go on and do their harmonization as they call it and making laws
[2:18:29.960 --> 2:18:31.960]  Similar in the three countries
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:37.240]  But it's going to be a long time before they get around to it and if they're going to be a long time before they get
[2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:39.240]  They're a marrow although they like to do it
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:47.640]  I've been watching these people for 50 years almost and we had debates about other currencies change and currencies
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:54.120]  back in the early 1980s when I used to do conferences all over the world and
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:19:02.600]  The evolutionary process takes a long time and now we have so many people who understand
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:06.520]  What they're trying to pull off here with this North American Union is a marrow
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:10.880]  Then they're going to have a really hard time trying to implement
[2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:16.280]  I think the only way they could do it is by putting half the people in America and internment camps
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:23.440]  Well, that is very very scary that you said that an incremental incrementalization has really been their most useful tool
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:28.680]  I want to talk about the SPP the Securities and Prosperities Partnership on the other side
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:34.200]  Vicente Vicente Fox's view on this North American Union if you will in world government
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:47.440]  It's Bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com. I'm Jason Burmes in for Alex Jones prisonplanet.com

[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:43.880]  Bill Derbergh Alex apparently she didn't go in 2006 we still have Alex you know oh man well we all know that she knows exactly what bill derbergh is that her husband has attended on several occasions and is now admitted on ABC news it wasn't really a news conference it was more of a
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:58.880]  conference to get his wife elected for president and people taking it upon himself to ask themselves to ask the tough questions where he was forced to admit that he indeed did go to bill derbergh while he was in Europe with Vernon Jordan supposedly to discuss what was going to happen to
[2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:07.880]  Russia with some Europeans we have Bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com on the line Bob what do you think all these developments
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:14.880]  what do I think of what all the all the developments the developments Alex just talked about over at bill derbergh
[2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:34.880]  well it he's right on on everything and it's up to us we have to inform other people we have to let them know that there is a power behind government worldwide for that matter that wants to make the world do what they want to do because they
[2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:49.880]  think that they know better what's good for us and of course we disagree with them these people have been doing this actually for centuries and they've been getting away from away with it and you know back in the
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:35:05.880]  1960s and 70s and 80s we would talk about this there would be a few books that were a few perhaps three or four thousand had been published on the on the subject but most people didn't have access to him and then 15 years ago came the
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:21.880]  internet and it just changed the whole thing and now people are catching on and if we are to save our civilization we've got to stop these people we have to expose them for what they're doing we have to bring them to trial from manipulating
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:36.880]  markets and it and it goes on all the time goodness knows very few people spent 28 years in the brokerage business like I did and know what is going on the rest of them could care less all they are interested in his money
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:49.880]  and unfortunately that's the case of most people particularly in America but the job is to get the word out and I'm sure Alex will have plenty of information for us when he comes back you'll probably have a video and a
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:57.880]  tape and and that would be something you should purchase so that you can hand it to other people to look at these guys are doing
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:08.880]  what do you think they're not for us for themselves and they want to turn our country upside down they want to bring us down to a third world level they want to merges with other countries whether we like it or not
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:14.880]  we have these patriot acts and and all these other things that take away our freedoms it's got to stop
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:32.880]  well I agree with you 100% unfortunately the general mass the public out there is so mesmerized hypnotized by consumerism and you know the latest fashion trend the latest car the biggest house putting their kids through college this stuff isn't even on the radar
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:45.880]  for for guys like me and you this is primary this is this is what drives us we were interested in what's happening to our country because we know that all that takes is for good men to do nothing for evil to prevail
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:58.880]  but most of these people you know their primary thing is their family their secondary thing is you know their sports car their third thing is their sports team and this isn't even on the radar how do we change that how do we flip society
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:07.880]  the empty belly doesn't recession depression and then people are going to say who did this to us how did this happen
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:17.880]  and then we say to them look we've been on radio and making videos and writing about this for years but you didn't know or you weren't listening
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:27.880]  and here here are the people who have been doing this to you and this is what they're after and this is why you don't have any job or house no vehicles anymore and you're living under a bridge
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:37.880]  absolutely and that will get their attention well I hope it doesn't come to that the worst place to operate from but unfortunately that's the way it's going to come down
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:50.880]  well I couldn't agree with you more and I hope that we can save that off I personally want to keep my house I want to live in a first world nation I want to live in a nation where you know we have a constitution we have a bill of rights we have a government
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:38:00.880]  foreign by the people and right now our government is not foreign by the people it's for the corporate interest it's for the special interest it's for the military industrial complex
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:12.880]  it's for the globalist and I don't know if you've seen this breaking article but it was just reported today that Kevin Rudd the president of Australia is trying to spearhead the creation of an Asia Pacific Union
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:22.880]  similar to the European Union because you know you're going to need these large global land masses these unions Pan American Union North American Union European Union
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:30.880]  now the Asia Asia Pacific Union I do believe they're trying to build a Eurasian Union in the Middle East you know going in there all the imperialism that's going on
[2:38:30.880 --> 2:38:41.880]  so that they conform their one world order much easier do you feel that way do you think that they're going to block sections of the world out and then bring in this global governance
[2:38:41.880 --> 2:38:59.880]  well I think they would like to do everything simultaneously but they're going to work now on the most difficult parts and that's the United States and Europe and England and Canada
[2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:13.880]  ostensibly the most prosperous nations in the world and I'm sure that they've got some kind of a plan set up for China as well and and and overall in Asia they've had Japan in their back pockets and second world war
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:28.880]  and so that's no problem for them and but this this is this is war and we've got to stop like you said and if we don't it's not going to be a very nice world
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:35.880]  absolutely not have you have you seen this confrontation with Luke Radowski if we are change with Vicente Fox
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  no I have not I want to play this clip for the audience because in it Luke discusses the North American Union he discusses the Tran Texas corridor he discusses the SPP and Vicente Fox of course acknowledges the SPP
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:40:01.880]  he talks about the agreements he feels like it's not going fast enough he says the governments aren't building the roads and then Luke retorts with well you know it's Giuliani's private company but the roads are being built regardless
[2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  and he's like yes I really want a North American Union and one day I would like to see global government let's play that clip right now
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:21.880]  what I want to see what I want to see cooperation not isolation
[2:40:21.880 --> 2:40:39.880]  yes on CNN's Larry King you acknowledge the fact of NAFTA currency like the Euro can you please talk about how you as president of Mexico president Bush and the prime minister of Canada established working groups towards North American Union with the SPP
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:41:03.880]  without public approval it's there is the original document the original commitment and there is supposed to be follow-up procedures that is supposed to be committed committees to discuss and to advance but that's not happening we're still tied up to the original
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:14.880]  the highways are being built right now the Tran Texas corridor highways are being built as part of the SPP building the NAFTA highways it's happening right now and the working groups are established
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:25.880]  they're being built right now from what I hear you go to Texas right now yes if you go to Texas right now you see land being seized away from people building these highways
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:34.880]  of the North American Union
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:42:03.880]  there is this promotion of this idea of a NAFTA highway even some have said or promoted the idea of that should be a duty free highway or a free zone highway so that you could move the truck without crossing the border because they would have this road
[2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:10.880]  this road to move a plan and else but it's just plans there's nothing to be done with it
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:23.880]  it's happening in Texas right now land is being seized and what they're doing and they're building the highways that are going to be planned are going to go from Mexico
[2:42:23.880 --> 2:42:36.880]  all the way from the United States all the way up to Canada and there's actually a nonprofit organization and it's being built but Centra a private company is building it right now and they're seizing land and they're doing it
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:41.880]  they might be doing it but it's not a project of Mexico but it's welcome I hope they do
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:45.880]  will they be a North American Union do you believe there will be a North American Union
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:55.880]  I would hope so I think it will be very convenient for both but what about American sovereignty and everything we did and our constitution and our bill of rights and everything our forefathers stand for
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:42:58.880]  Germany, Britain have not lost their sovereignty
[2:42:58.880 --> 2:43:06.880]  their constitution is being destroyed over the EU constitution and when you have a North American Union you have one world government this is what David Rockefeller wants with the CFR and Bill de Berg
[2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:15.880]  Germany, France and Britain even though they have a parliament they have not lost their sovereignty they have not lost their constitution
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:17.880]  this is what they're doing David Rockefeller
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:28.880]  that's why I said I said solidarity over selfishness this nation is very selfish
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:42.880]  it's turning against them it would be much better for the United States to have a healthy, successful, profitable neighbor in Mexico than having a poor nation there unemployed
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:44.880]  that's why we have the power
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:49.880]  but then the American economy goes down you have immigration comes in, the constitution is destroyed
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:54.880]  it goes down because you have illegal immigrants going into England and taking the English jobs
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:59.880]  so you have one currency and that's what they do it's policy and then it's unionization
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:03.880]  Britain doesn't have one euro is going to happen
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:22.880]  statement of activities and commitments both from Mexico United States and Canada
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:26.880]  it's a large document, written
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:28.880]  you could say it's for a North American
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:34.880]  we have advanced a lot but right now it's not moving at the pace that it should be moving
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:42.880]  I think it's a great idea because instead of A which is giving away the money
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:57.880]  this is investing money on productive projects, investing money on education, investing money on opportunities for entrepreneurs
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:06.880]  so I think it's a great program and it's a I can say your document the way you give me a call and say your copy of the document
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:10.880]  how would it move forward, how would you like it to move forward?
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:14.880]  well the thing is that we change the administration in Mexico
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:16.880]  I'll walk the other one
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:26.880]  so we change the administration so we need the new administration to retake it
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:30.880]  and here this president Bush administration is about to finish
[2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:34.880]  so we need the next administration to retake the project
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:44.880]  but who will you describe it to?
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:50.880]  well there it is folks there's just a little portion of it it goes on for a little bit longer but he's pro SPP
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:54.880]  he'd like it to go on you know faster
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:45:58.880]  once it's brought up that it's a private organization that's building these super highways
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:02.880]  he's like well I want it to be government organizations what's your take on that clip
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:08.880]  I mean obviously not only is Vicente Fox pro-north American Union but he seems to be pro-world government
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:12.880]  well I had heard the tape before I had forgotten it
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:16.880]  and you're right he is
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:20.880]  if you're spending time in Mexico except among the rich
[2:46:20.880 --> 2:46:23.880]  he's a laughing stock of the country
[2:46:23.880 --> 2:46:27.880]  and as you probably are aware the last election was stolen
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:32.880]  hold on Bob I got to stop you right there because Alex is back with us he just got back on the line
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:34.880]  Alex are you there?
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:38.880]  yeah I didn't even know you had Bob on earlier and the phone cut out when I was bullhorning a more trash
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:43.880]  just drove in I mean just like clear windows the big globalists sitting there totally upset us
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:46.880]  as we bullhorn him and videotape this trash
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:50.880]  so just you know finish up with Bob how long have you done with Bob?
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:55.880]  the top of the hour but I could probably get him just to finish up in this segment and get you back to that
[2:46:55.880 --> 2:46:57.880]  just call back in 10-20 minutes
[2:46:57.880 --> 2:47:00.880]  I mean my main thing is get Bob's take on how important it is to expose these trash
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:04.880]  that how we have exposed it is truly a global elite something the media has denied just 6-7 years ago
[2:47:04.880 --> 2:47:07.880]  8 years ago and now how far we've come
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:10.880]  I mean this is all part of a process of identifying enemies of the republic
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:12.880]  and it's just very very exciting
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:14.880]  so I'm going to let Bob go back I'll call back in later
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:16.880]  alright thanks Alex
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:20.880]  so Bob how important is it to expose this type of behavior?
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:26.880]  well it's by exposing yourself like Alex does and I do some 20 programs a week
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:30.880]  and they get all over the world just like Alex stuff does
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:36.880]  and of course I have my publication and we have subscribers all over the world
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:40.880]  and I encourage them to you know do reprints and send them to other people
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:44.880]  and hopefully wake people up to see what's really going on
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:47.880]  and you know I try to it's like a mosaic
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:52.880]  I try to bring it all together the finance, the economics, the social, political issues
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:57.880]  and then behind it all the power of the fascistic corporate structure
[2:47:57.880 --> 2:48:04.880]  that's been set up in America and Europe and Canada and England as well
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:09.880]  and how they are trying to shape us and bring us into this world government
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:16.880]  and so that's what we both do and I say many many times on the programs
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  I only wish there were another thousand like us to help us
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  because there's not enough of us and if we had more people who would do what we're doing
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  then we could solve the problem everybody would know
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  well I agree with you there and people again you don't have to take orders from headquarters
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:43.880]  you too can start a website you too can be on the mainstream
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  newspapers, websites, television channels, combing for this type of information
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:52.880]  you can put together a blog, you can go door to door, you can burn DVDs
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:58.880]  you can hand them out, you can be the guy at the Bilderberg meeting with a bullhorn
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:03.880]  I mean nothing's stopping you from taking these actions except your own self doubt
[2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:07.880]  and you need to get rid of that because we all have incredible power
[2:49:07.880 --> 2:49:11.880]  it is within each of us that crave freedom, that crave liberty
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:16.880]  that want to be in a free society, a democratic, a constitutional republic
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:20.880]  that's what we want in this country, we don't want our national sovereignty to be taken over
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:27.880]  we don't want a shadowy group of people deciding our lives every 12 months Bob
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:31.880]  now that's right and every day of the week actually
[2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  and they're going to continue to do what they do unless we go out and inform people
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:41.880]  and we're so fortunate to have the internet and the access that we do have
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:49.880]  to shortwave and AM and FM and satellite and of course the computer generated programs as well
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:55.880]  and we just got to keep at it and try to bring more people in as you've just said
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:49:59.880]  to speak out on the issue, you know why we're having these problems
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:02.880]  this is why we're having these problems, is it new?
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:07.880]  it goes back for hundreds of years, you know probably 90% of all the wars
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:12.880]  that we've ever seen were financed on both sides by the same group of people
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:15.880]  these are the people who financed fascism
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:20.880]  Marito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:27.880]  they bankrolled communism in Russia when the natural person that one should have been with
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:34.880]  even though it was a dictatorial monarchy would have been the Russian government
[2:50:34.880 --> 2:50:36.880]  absolutely, it's about the consolidation of power
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:51:05.880]  Bob Chapman on the other side, final segment, Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:10.880]  cocoa pure chocolate tea blends the nutrition of concentrated cocoa with natural green tea

[2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:48.880]  our beloved republic is on her knees
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:52.880]  the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:54.880]  but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope
[2:51:54.880 --> 2:51:57.880]  the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:52:03.880]  it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan
[2:52:03.880 --> 2:52:07.880]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat

[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:21.880]  I am Jason Burmese
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:23.880]  you can get at me at myspace.com
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:24.880]  slash Jason Burmese
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  getting a bunch of friend requests
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:27.880]  I do check out the mail
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:30.880]  it's where I got the Kevin Redd Australia
[2:54:30.880 --> 2:54:34.880]  president calling for a Asia Pacific Union story today
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:36.880]  so keep sending me good stories man
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:37.880]  I check them out
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:38.880]  I'll bring them up on the air
[2:54:38.880 --> 2:54:40.880]  final segment with Bob Chapman
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:43.880]  internationalforecaster.com
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:45.880]  Bob, how can we protect ourselves?
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:48.880]  what advice are you going to give to the Awake American out there
[2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:51.880]  that is listening to this broadcast?
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:53.880]  I think from a financial point of view
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:56.880]  the most important thing they can do is get rid of their revolving debt
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  which is credit cards and cards from different department stores
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:05.880]  and if they can get rid of their vehicle debt
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:08.880]  the economy is worsening
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:10.880]  unemployment is rising
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  and not only that
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:18.880]  unemployment would rise a lot more quickly
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:20.880]  but companies what they're doing now
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:24.880]  is cutting wages 5 or 10 or 15 or 20%
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:26.880]  and that way they don't have to lay people off
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:29.880]  but they're paying them less to remain competitive
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:31.880]  to stay in business
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:35.880]  and so the chances of losing one's job
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:38.880]  is much larger today than it was four or five years ago
[2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  so you want to be financially prepared
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:44.880]  for those of you who have done all those kind of things
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:49.880]  and have money to invest in gold and silver related assets are excellent
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:54.880]  and I think financially that's the best kind of preparation
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:55:57.880]  so for a guy like me
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:55:59.880]  I don't have any credit card debt
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:00.880]  I don't have any vehicle debt
[2:56:00.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  I don't have any homeowners debt
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:04.880]  but I do have student loans around 10 grand
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:06.880]  should I pay those off as soon as possible
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:08.880]  or I've had the advice
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:10.880]  pay off the minimum and buy gold and silver
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:12.880]  with the money that you save
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:13.880]  what do you think?
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:14.880]  The latter
[2:56:14.880 --> 2:56:16.880]  you pay off as you go
[2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:18.880]  and you take any extra money you've got
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:20.880]  and you buy gold and silver
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:21.880]  and that's the way to go
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:22.880]  that's the way to go
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:26.880]  and I see lots of people who are caching
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:28.880]  in insurance policies
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:31.880]  and converting 401 and K's
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:36.880]  in IRAs and others into gold and silver related assets
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:38.880]  and I think it's the proper thing to do
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:40.880]  and we've been right for a long time
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:42.880]  and I think we're going to continue to be right
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:44.880]  about what's going to happen in the future
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:46.880]  particularly financially
[2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:48.880]  and so that's the road that you should take
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:50.880]  Well there is no doubt that
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:53.880]  you know gold, silver, platinum, precious metals in general
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:57.880]  have retained and gained value for thousands of years
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:56:59.880]  this is the one type of currency
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:02.880]  that you know isn't going to go away
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:05.880]  Well it never has in the history of man that we know of
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:08.880]  and I don't think that's going to change
[2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:11.880]  human nature and the capacities and the abilities
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:14.880]  of humankind
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:16.880]  yes we've made lots of advances
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:18.880]  but we're still basically the same creature
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:22.880]  and nothing has been found through the ages
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:25.880]  that has replaced gold
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:28.880]  as the reserve common denominator
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:30.880]  of any kind of a currency
[2:57:30.880 --> 2:57:33.880]  and in today's world all we have is fiat currencies
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:37.880]  currencies that aren't really not worth the paper they're written on
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:40.880]  Absolutely, I mean this paper currency
[2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:43.880]  this fiat currency we have is printed out of nowhere
[2:57:43.880 --> 2:57:45.880]  it has no backing whatsoever
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:47.880]  zero regulation, the Federal Reserve
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:49.880]  I think there's 13 board members
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  we don't elect them
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:53.880]  what do they serve, 8 year terms?
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:55.880]  That's correct
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  and they're all appointed by the people from behind the scenes
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:01.880]  they're all controlled
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:04.880]  and they do exactly as they're told
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:06.880]  even the chairman of the Federal Reserve
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:08.880]  he doesn't make the decisions, he's told what to do
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:10.880]  Well Greenspan was a Bilderberger, right?
[2:58:10.880 --> 2:58:12.880]  He certainly was
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:13.880]  Absolutely
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:16.880]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.com

[2:58:37.880 --> 2:58:39.880]  it is a big idea
[2:58:39.880 --> 2:58:41.880]  a new world order
[2:58:41.880 --> 2:58:43.880]  in the near future
[2:58:43.880 --> 2:58:46.880]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:58:46.880 --> 2:58:49.880]  it's known as the Bilderberg
[2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:52.880]  but their objective being world domination
[2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:55.880]  for thousands of years their dark order grew
[2:58:55.880 --> 2:58:58.880]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:58:58.880 --> 2:59:03.880]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand

[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:21.880]  they have all the money they need

[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:39.880]  I'm having some video issues over here for the stream
[3:00:39.880 --> 3:00:41.880]  so you might just get audio on my pretty little face
[3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:44.880]  when I play these YouTube clips unfortunately
[3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:46.880]  but we're just going to have to deal with that
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:49.880]  but that's okay because I got a hell of a guest on the line
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:52.880]  I have Justin Martell of student scholars for 9-11 Truth
[3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:55.880]  for the next 30 minutes and then we have G. Edward Griffin
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:58.880]  we're going to be playing some YouTube clips including the new
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:01.880]  We Are Change confrontation with the Clintons at least the first half
[3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:04.880]  without the cursing because the second half has a lot of cursing apparently
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:07.880]  and you know I'm just psyched up Justin
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:10.880]  I'm so excited to see so many people
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:12.880]  waking up to the Bilderberg conference

[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:17.880]  of course Alex Jones, Luke Radowski
[3:01:17.880 --> 3:01:20.880]  but they're not going to be able to hide for much longer are they Justin?
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:22.880]  I would say not
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:26.880]  and I think that Alex's new documentary
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:29.880]  Endgame had a lot to do with that
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  absolutely, absolutely
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:34.880]  but let's play, I mean it's only going to be audio
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:37.880]  unfortunately because the video feed for some reason
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:40.880]  isn't taking to my computer as I'd like
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:43.880]  but I'm going to play your confrontation
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:45.880]  the student scholars confrontation
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:47.880]  I believe that's Eric Jackman doing that one
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:50.880]  that's sst911.org by the way folks
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:53.880]  great organization for young folks if you are in college
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:55.880]  and you're not part of a 9-11 Truth group
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:57.880]  this is the group to be a part of
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:02:00.880]  Hillary Clinton about her attendance of a Bilderberg meeting
[3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:02.880]  and she denies even knowing what it is
[3:02:02.880 --> 3:02:04.880]  let's play it
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:08.880]  it's over
[3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:10.880]  we need to be sure that president is going to do
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:12.880]  what is necessary
[3:02:12.880 --> 3:02:14.880]  to take care of our country
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:18.880]  how are you doing?
[3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:20.880]  can I ask you a quick question while you sign that?
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:22.880]  it was reported in June of 2006

[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:26.880]  the Bilderberg group
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:28.880]  what's going on with the Bilderberg meeting
[3:02:28.880 --> 3:02:30.880]  and what do you guys talk about up there?
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:32.880]  I have no idea what you're talking about
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:34.880]  I was reported you were up there and people started you up there
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:36.880]  I just want to know what you guys talk about and meet about up there
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:38.880]  why are there such top secret meetings?
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:40.880]  I have no idea what you're talking about
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:42.880]  your husband went to a Bilderberg meeting too
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:44.880]  I'm just wondering
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:46.880]  I just want to know what happened at this meeting
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:48.880]  well I says I wasn't there
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:50.880]  I have no idea
[3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:52.880]  thank you senator
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:56.880]  do you still have the Nile and Philly members who are still advocating for the investigation?
[3:02:56.880 --> 3:02:58.880]  yes
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:00.880]  and there she is

[3:03:12.880 --> 3:03:14.880]  so I'm not sure what we're in for
[3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:16.880]  folks
[3:03:16.880 --> 3:03:18.880]  do they talk about Bilderberg?
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:20.880]  this is a Bilderberg
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:22.880]  confrontation for Bill and Hill

[3:05:50.880 --> 3:05:53.880]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:56.880]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[3:05:56.880 --> 3:05:58.880]  and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:31.880]  that's correct
[3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:43.880]  let's play this one more time
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:46.880]  he hasn't been there in 15 years he can't tell us
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:51.880]  and I want to play the rest of that clip but unfortunately it may be a little bit too graphic
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:55.880]  so we're just going to have to fold on that
[3:08:55.880 --> 3:08:57.880]  and wait a little bit
[3:08:57.880 --> 3:09:04.880]  let's talk about this
[3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:09.880]  clearly in the video that we did where Eric Jackman asked about Bilderberg
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:12.880]  Hillary Clinton is clearly lying
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:16.880]  and it's apparent when she first denies knowing what Bilderberg is
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:20.880]  and then when Eric says your husband went there
[3:09:20.880 --> 3:09:24.880]  and the viewers can't see the video but she nods and says
[3:09:24.880 --> 3:09:27.880]  and then the next thing she turns again says well
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:31.880]  I couldn't tell you because I wasn't there
[3:09:31.880 --> 3:09:36.880]  I mean she first denies she doesn't know and then she says well I wasn't there
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:39.880]  and she knows damn well what the conference is
[3:09:39.880 --> 3:09:41.880]  and she knows damn well it's elitist
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:46.880]  actually choosing what we're going to be subjected to in the next 12 months
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:48.880]  this is a real meeting right here
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:50.880]  this is where policy is set
[3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:52.880]  what did you think? I don't know if you've been listening
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:57.880]  did you hear the Department of Justice actually ordered 125 Bilderberg
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:00.880]  2008 engraved iPods from Apple
[3:10:00.880 --> 3:10:03.880]  and they're upset because they're not going to be there on time
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:04.880]  what?
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:07.880]  yeah no somebody from within Apple sent us an email this morning
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:11.880]  because they had to fill out the order over at Mac.com
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:13.880]  and they were like yeah I thought you'd get a kick out of this
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:16.880]  so you know our tax dollars that fund the Department of Justice
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:19.880]  are put towards little toys for the elite
[3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:22.880]  it's not like they can't afford their own iPod
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:24.880]  but they want their little they want their ice
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:28.880]  they want their bling they want their Bilderberg 2008 iPod Justin
[3:10:32.880 --> 3:10:33.880]  how ridiculous
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:37.880]  we're in some tough times brother when that is the case
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:41.880]  now you've really gotten a lot of people over the years
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:44.880]  really it's only been what two years since your inception
[3:10:44.880 --> 3:10:46.880]  yeah two years
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:49.880]  I've been active for about two years but we
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:54.880]  student scholars started in February of 2007
[3:10:54.880 --> 3:10:56.880]  so a little over a year
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:10:58.880]  I've been a year and a half yeah
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:01.880]  and you've got in all the presidential candidates
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  that are still in the race you know Hillary just dropped out
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:06.880]  but she's still up for VP possibly
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:09.880]  she's thrown out the idea that maybe Obama's going to be assassinated
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:10.880]  that's lovely
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:15.880]  you talk to Obama you talk to McCain I think on several occasions
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:18.880]  and you guys just keep pumping out the hits correct
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:21.880]  that's correct we haven't had a new one in a while
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:24.880]  the most recent one with the Dana Perino video
[3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:27.880]  which was excellent by the way she's the White House press secretary
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:32.880]  and she tried to say that your facts were in fact spin from the media
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:35.880]  no your facts were what I like to call facts
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:40.880]  I yeah I you know and I took her advice I went back and I checked my facts
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:45.880]  if people watch the video Dana Perino meets the student scholars from 9-11 Truth
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:48.880]  we just go into YouTube and type in Dana Perino 9-11
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:50.880]  that's the first video that comes up
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:54.880]  and you'll see that I did indeed
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:56.880]  he had her advice went back check my facts
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:12:00.880]  and you'll see that I posted every single thing
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:03.880]  as I'm asking her my question I sourced every single thing
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:05.880]  you see the source as I say it
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:11.880]  and you know I think it's definitely her needs to go back and do the fact checking
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:14.880]  it's funny how she lectured me about spin
[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:16.880]  she goes you know some of the things that you said
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:19.880]  that I know to be spin from the other side
[3:12:19.880 --> 3:12:21.880]  from the other side like there's another side right
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:23.880]  first of all we're not right and left
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:26.880]  well exactly there's that and then also
[3:12:26.880 --> 3:12:31.880]  I mean who is she to be lecturing me about spin it's her job to spin
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:35.880]  look at him and he comes out and writes a book and says he had the life of the
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:37.880]  White House that they lied about the Iraq war
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:40.880]  I mean it's unbelievable the last guy to hold her job
[3:12:40.880 --> 3:12:44.880]  I will actually the guy before Tony Snow let's get it right
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:47.880]  Tony Snow ex Fox News reporter by the way folks
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:51.880]  yeah that's a good transition from Fox News to White House Press Secretary
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:12:53.880]  he's going to be honest to us
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:13:00.880]  exactly and she was apparently so shaken up by my question
[3:13:00.880 --> 3:13:05.880]  that she accused the event organizers of setting her up to be sandbagged
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:07.880]  and said that she wanted to leave the campus
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:10.880]  she was on my college campus she said that she wanted to leave the campus
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  immediately she didn't but that was her like immediate reaction
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:14.880]  Wow
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:16.880]  Justin let's take some phone calls
[3:13:16.880 --> 3:13:18.880]  I got a bunch of callers on the line
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:20.880]  I got G Edward Griffin coming up at 2.30
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:24.880]  and I know you're a smark I know I've got one debunker on the line
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:26.880]  so hopefully we'll get to him while you're on
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:29.880]  let's start with Tim in Wisconsin Tim are you with us
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:35.880]  after one guy one caller quite a lot earlier
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:44.880]  calling in and mentioning about you know the beauty of the internet
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:48.880]  you know being able to put all this information on YouTube and stuff
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:54.880]  that it just came to my mind about something that Dave Van Cleis on the power
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:14:01.880]  was telling you know a news story about how the corporations you know are
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:05.880]  are feeling so threatened about all this kind of information
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:09.880]  you know being able to travel as freely as it is you know over the internet
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:12.880]  that you know he was talking about them willing to
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:16.880]  in the future wanting to package you know all the you know airing up in
[3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:18.880]  separate packages
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:20.880]  well what they're trying to do you're talking about internet too correct
[3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:23.880]  we're talking about internet too and what they're trying to do with internet too
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:27.880]  is alright they already have the IBM think-pads now where you literally do a
[3:14:27.880 --> 3:14:31.880]  biometric thumb scan and unless it's your thumb you can't log on to the computer
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:34.880]  now they want to put that on every keyboard in this country
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:38.880]  and I'll tell you why because they want to control the internet through a select few
[3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:42.880]  corporations and universities and you and I if we want a website
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:47.880]  we'll be able to purchase a subdomain from these corporations
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:51.880]  slash universities and if they don't like our content they're going to be able to pull it
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:54.880]  it's fascism in every sense in the world word
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:58.880]  it is total and complete censorship and we have to fight it before
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:01.880]  it really gets moving I thank you for the call
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:06.880]  alright let's jump to Rick in Arizona Rick are you with us
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:11.880]  alright Rick drop let's go to Justin in Texas Justin how's it going
[3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:12.880]  how's it going guys
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:13.880]  alright man
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:18.880]  alright it's awesome that I actually got in right now because I just got an email a little while ago
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:23.880]  we're actually last night from Justin Martel to cancel a debate I had scheduled with him today
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:27.880]  at 7 p.m. but I'm sure he'll find time to reschedule that
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:29.880]  and I believe he will
[3:15:29.880 --> 3:15:33.880]  and Dan excuse me and Dan what did I say in that email
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:36.880]  I said can we reschedule for Monday so don't come on here
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:39.880]  he's going to be good he's been pretty good the past couple days absolutely
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:42.880]  I mean don't try and make it look like you know I ran away after that
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:45.880]  I've got a personal engagement that I have to take care of this evening
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:48.880]  that is a little more you know important than that
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:51.880]  and we all have lives outside of this so go ahead and make your point
[3:15:51.880 --> 3:15:54.880]  alright my question relates to my question I asked you yesterday
[3:15:54.880 --> 3:15:58.880]  and I noticed I do have a couple of quotes here from you
[3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:00.880]  one is from the Abby Scott video
[3:16:00.880 --> 3:16:01.880]  oh here we go
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:04.880]  where you do bring up aside from the firemen
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:08.880]  you do bring up in particular controlled demolitions incorporated
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:12.880]  and also when you follow up apology to some of the statements that you made that day
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:16.880]  you said I was discussing how if a government job
[3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:18.880]  if you have a government job you want to keep it
[3:16:18.880 --> 3:16:21.880]  aka controlled demolition incorporated
[3:16:21.880 --> 3:16:23.880]  you keep your mouth shut
[3:16:23.880 --> 3:16:26.880]  hold on my thing with that quote yeah no that is a quote
[3:16:26.880 --> 3:16:31.880]  but for instance CDI workers for CDI are going to know
[3:16:31.880 --> 3:16:34.880]  what the signatures of a demolished building look like
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:37.880]  so when they wait when they go and clean it up
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:40.880]  and they're told not to talk about debt cords if they find them
[3:16:40.880 --> 3:16:42.880]  they're told not to talk about the molten metal they're not going to
[3:16:42.880 --> 3:16:44.880]  I mean LaZoe
[3:16:44.880 --> 3:16:46.880]  I forget what his first name is
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:48.880]  but LaZoe is really a mouthpiece
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:50.880]  yeah Mark LaZoe is just a mouthpiece
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:53.880]  for the administration and as far as the firefighter comments
[3:16:53.880 --> 3:16:55.880]  you know
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:16:57.880]  I just want to put this out there
[3:16:57.880 --> 3:16:59.880]  sure but I just want to put it out there
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:03.880]  that a lot of these firefighters that did lose people did sign
[3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  agreements not to sue the government
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:07.880]  not to go to court
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:09.880]  and just take the victims compensation fund
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:11.880]  that is human nature man
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:13.880]  I mean a disaster happens
[3:17:13.880 --> 3:17:15.880]  they're offered this money and they're told well
[3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:17.880]  you have to sign this agreement form
[3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:19.880]  otherwise you're not going to get the money
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:21.880]  90% of the people sign the agreement
[3:17:21.880 --> 3:17:24.880]  and I think about 10% ended up going with lawsuits
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:27.880]  but some of those lawsuits actually ended about three months ago
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:30.880]  and they weren't even allowed to disclose the terms I believe
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:33.880]  sure and that is something I'm aware of
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:36.880]  but I just want to clear up because I'm sure you're very familiar with
[3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:39.880]  law against slander and libel and on the Info Wars forum
[3:17:39.880 --> 3:17:42.880]  there's a lot of anonymous slander going on
[3:17:42.880 --> 3:17:44.880]  in particular about controlled demolitions
[3:17:44.880 --> 3:17:47.880]  but hold on there's a lot of anonymous slander going on
[3:17:47.880 --> 3:17:49.880]  on every forum
[3:17:49.880 --> 3:17:52.880]  I wanted you to clear up for the listeners
[3:17:52.880 --> 3:17:55.880]  that you do not think controlled demolition incorporated
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:17:58.880]  knew anything or was an accessory after the fact
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:00.880]  anything related to 9-11
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:02.880]  well I can't say that after the fact
[3:18:02.880 --> 3:18:04.880]  and I know I think that they were an accessory after the fact
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:07.880]  absolutely before the fact I have no evidence of that
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:09.880]  but these guys know what a demolition looks like
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:12.880]  they were commissioned to come in there
[3:18:12.880 --> 3:18:15.880]  and clean it up I think they knew damn well what happened
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:18.880]  I'll disagree with you there and I'll be the first to say
[3:18:18.880 --> 3:18:20.880]  I think they're an accessory after fact
[3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:22.880]  I think there's a lot of accessories after the fact man
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:24.880]  for instance I don't think Giuliani
[3:18:24.880 --> 3:18:27.880]  was in any way shape or form part of the planning
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:30.880]  or the actual operation but afterwards
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:33.880]  there's no way that he couldn't have known something was up
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:36.880]  he was getting phone calls from Dick Cheney on that morning
[3:18:36.880 --> 3:18:38.880]  to get out of the building because it was going to collapse
[3:18:38.880 --> 3:18:40.880]  he went on Peter Jennings said he got a phone call
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:42.880]  later on you find out that Dick Cheney called him
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:45.880]  he got on what was it Barbara Walters 2020
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:47.880]  and discussed this on the 16th
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:49.880]  and then on top of all that
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:52.880]  he was in World Trade Center Building 7 on the morning of 9-11
[3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:55.880]  he was part of that initial crew absolutely was
[3:18:55.880 --> 3:18:58.880]  I just think that what a lot of people don't understand
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:01.880]  is how hurtful it can be when you even insinuate
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:04.880]  that the firemen were had to sign something
[3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:06.880]  that would then exchange in exchange
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:08.880]  but that's not insinuation man that happened
[3:19:08.880 --> 3:19:10.880]  344 firemen died if I'm not mistaken
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:13.880]  43 but yeah no no you're right 343 firefighters died
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:16.880]  and I'm not trying to disgrace them at all
[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:19.880]  for anybody to say that they for any reason
[3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:22.880]  would keep silent about absolutely anything
[3:19:22.880 --> 3:19:25.880]  that they know whether that be from penalty of lawsuit
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:27.880]  or whether that be from penalty of life or death
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:29.880]  because he's a fireman
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:32.880]  alright Dan hey hey I do think that a lot of those guys
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:34.880]  just went around and told the party line
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:36.880]  I mean their audio tapes were out there
[3:19:36.880 --> 3:19:38.880]  their recollections were out there
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:39.880]  secondary explosions everywhere
[3:19:39.880 --> 3:19:41.880]  I thank you for the call I hope you call in tomorrow
[3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:44.880]  we're with Justin Martell student scholars

[3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:44.880]  to take the fight back to Big Brother
[3:20:44.880 --> 3:20:46.880]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer
[3:20:46.880 --> 3:20:50.880]  and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:52.880]  but as you know most people are overly acidic
[3:20:52.880 --> 3:20:55.880]  due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:20:57.880]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[3:20:57.880 --> 3:21:00.880]  and perfect health as well as prevention of disease
[3:21:00.880 --> 3:21:02.880]  people who alkalize the water they drink
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:05.880]  experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity,
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:06.880]  and loss of weight
[3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:09.880]  it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water
[3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:10.880]  but due to modern way of life
[3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:12.880]  most people are overly acidic
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:14.880]  the fact is that disease simply cannot exist
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:16.880]  in an alkaline environment
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:18.880]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:21.880]  on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it
[3:21:21.880 --> 3:21:24.880]  do your part, alkalize, and supercharge your body now

[3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:44.880]  Hello Ted Anderson
[3:21:44.880 --> 3:21:47.880]  listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:49.880]  and understand the risks of deficit spending
[3:21:49.880 --> 3:21:52.880]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise
[3:21:52.880 --> 3:21:54.880]  that some banks have currently placed limits
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:57.880]  on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:00.880]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion
[3:22:00.880 --> 3:22:03.880]  of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[3:22:03.880 --> 3:22:05.880]  deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC
[3:22:05.880 --> 3:22:07.880]  if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:10.880]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:12.880]  a current effort is underway by the Fed
[3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:15.880]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[3:22:15.880 --> 3:22:17.880]  however an increase in money supply
[3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:19.880]  without equal expansion and productivity
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:22.880]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[3:22:22.880 --> 3:22:25.880]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:28.880]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:31.880]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[3:22:31.880 --> 3:22:35.880]  gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:39.880]  for more information call 1-800-686-2237
[3:22:39.880 --> 3:22:42.880]  that's 1-800-686-2237
[3:22:42.880 --> 3:22:45.880]  if you're an adult male you need to listen to this information
[3:22:45.880 --> 3:22:49.880]  by the age of 60 half of all men have a prostate-related problem
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:52.880]  in the past many men have turned to sa pometo
[3:22:52.880 --> 3:22:54.880]  to support prostate health
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:22:56.880]  but now there's something much better
[3:22:56.880 --> 3:22:58.880]  it's called beta prostate
[3:22:58.880 --> 3:23:01.880]  beta prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols
[3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:03.880]  than ordinary sa pometo
[3:23:03.880 --> 3:23:06.880]  in fact you'd have to take 100 sa pometo capsules
[3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:09.880]  to get the same benefits of one dose of beta prostate
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:12.880]  it's guaranteed to provide noticeable support
[3:23:12.880 --> 3:23:15.880]  even if you're already having prostate-related health issues
[3:23:15.880 --> 3:23:18.880]  now you can get Roger Mason's beta prostate formula
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:20.880]  through this special offer
[3:23:20.880 --> 3:23:23.880]  and if you call now you'll learn how to get a free bottle of beta prostate
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:24.880]  with your order
[3:23:24.880 --> 3:23:26.880]  feel a difference or your money back
[3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:27.880]  here's how to order
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:29.880]  call now to order beta prostate
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:32.880]  dial 1-800-457-9914
[3:23:32.880 --> 3:23:35.880]  support your prostate with safe all natural ingredients
[3:23:35.880 --> 3:23:38.880]  dial 1-800-457-9914
[3:23:38.880 --> 3:23:42.880]  that's 1-800-457-9914
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:53.880]  woo! it feels good
[3:23:53.880 --> 3:23:55.880]  feels good fighting New World Order
[3:23:55.880 --> 3:23:56.880]  I'm not gonna lie
[3:23:56.880 --> 3:23:59.880]  I hate these globalists with every essence of my being
[3:23:59.880 --> 3:24:03.880]  and it is an honor to be subbing in for Alex Jones
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:05.880]  the man in the myth, the legend
[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:07.880]  for these days while he calls in
[3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:10.880]  from Chantilly, Virginia, while these globalists, you know
[3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:13.880]  plot out the next big oil crisis
[3:24:13.880 --> 3:24:16.880]  the next big invasion, the next big false flag attack
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:18.880]  last time they were in Chantilly was of course
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:21.880]  2002, the first Bilderberg meeting
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:23.880]  since 9-11 that's where they made the decision
[3:24:23.880 --> 3:24:25.880]  to go into Iraq in 2003
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:27.880]  spread it out a little bit
[3:24:27.880 --> 3:24:29.880]  and you know Justin
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:30.880]  how do we fight these guys?
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:32.880]  do we just continue going full-on
[3:24:32.880 --> 3:24:35.880]  organizations like yours always give me hope bro
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:37.880]  well I think that
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:39.880]  I mean
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:41.880]  obviously
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:43.880]  I think that you know visibility
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:45.880]  making it clear because
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:47.880]  I mean until the last couple years
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:49.880]  with you know the internet
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:51.880]  and everything really surging on there
[3:24:51.880 --> 3:24:54.880]  and you haven't had a lot of people aware of what the Bilderberg is
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:56.880]  when I tell people about the Bilderberg
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:24:58.880]  you know like wow that's messed up
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:00.880]  I mean awareness is the main thing
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:02.880]  because no one with a straight
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:04.880]  you know with like a straight face can possibly defend
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:06.880]  what's going on you know with the Bilderberg
[3:25:06.880 --> 3:25:08.880]  let me interrupt you there
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:10.880]  there is a guy out there that loves to defend
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:12.880]  the Bilderberg group knows that they're
[3:25:12.880 --> 3:25:14.880]  globalists he did the
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:16.880]  my adventures with Extremis special
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:18.880]  the one where he helped Alex Jones infiltrate
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:20.880]  the Bohemian Grove he followed Jim Tucker
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:22.880]  around and this is back in
[3:25:22.880 --> 3:25:24.880]  I want to say 99-2000
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:26.880]  is when he did this whole series
[3:25:26.880 --> 3:25:28.880]  his name is John Ronson
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:30.880]  and he went on CNN International
[3:25:30.880 --> 3:25:32.880]  talking about the Bilderberg group talking about
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:34.880]  the new world order how they want this global order
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:36.880]  but he thinks it's a good thing man
[3:25:36.880 --> 3:25:38.880]  he sees all positive about it
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:40.880]  it's unbelievable
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:42.880]  I mean with a straight face
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:44.880]  he's got a straight face
[3:25:44.880 --> 3:25:46.880]  he's dead serious
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:48.880]  all I'm saying is it's ridiculous
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:50.880]  obviously
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:52.880]  what he's doing is ridiculous
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:54.880]  and it will appear ridiculous to most
[3:25:54.880 --> 3:25:56.880]  fair-minded viewers of his material
[3:25:58.880 --> 3:26:00.880]  and you know it's funny because
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:02.880]  all the comments I see on the Hillary Clinton
[3:26:02.880 --> 3:26:04.880]  Bilderberg group the only negative ones I see
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:06.880]  is well she just said she didn't know
[3:26:06.880 --> 3:26:08.880]  what it was because she didn't
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:10.880]  feel like dealing with you guys
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:12.880]  because you always just disrupt events
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:14.880]  well it looks like you went up to her
[3:26:14.880 --> 3:26:16.880]  you approached her in a civil manner
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:18.880]  you asked her a real question
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:20.880]  and she didn't want to answer it
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:22.880]  because she couldn't
[3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:24.880]  yeah
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:26.880]  you know especially because
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:28.880]  she wasn't on the official guest list
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:30.880]  and she was spotted there
[3:26:30.880 --> 3:26:32.880]  I believe
[3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:34.880]  she was just there for some kind of a meeting
[3:26:34.880 --> 3:26:36.880]  probably like Rumsfeld was in 2002
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:38.880]  let's keep taking callers before I gotta let you go
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:40.880]  Justin and taking G Edward Griffin
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:42.880]  who's just an amazing author and speaker
[3:26:42.880 --> 3:26:44.880]  I've been lucky enough to have dinner with him
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:46.880]  a couple times and watch
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:48.880]  his lectures on both the New World Order
[3:26:48.880 --> 3:26:50.880]  and the Federal Reserve an amazing fellow
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:52.880]  let's go to Dave in California
[3:26:52.880 --> 3:26:54.880]  Dave are you with us?
[3:26:54.880 --> 3:26:56.880]  yes I am hi guys
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:26:58.880]  this is something they can put in their iPods
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:00.880]  and it's for all the info warriors
[3:27:00.880 --> 3:27:02.880]  and especially the ones there at Chantilly
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:04.880]  freedom
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:06.880]  freedom
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:08.880]  freedom
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:10.880]  freedom
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:12.880]  freedom
[3:27:12.880 --> 3:27:14.880]  freedom
[3:27:14.880 --> 3:27:16.880]  I'm with you man 110% brother
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:18.880]  absolutely
[3:27:18.880 --> 3:27:20.880]  I hope that you're out there
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:22.880]  telling your friends about this stuff
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:24.880]  copying videos holding movie night
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:26.880]  we're gonna defeat these globalists
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:28.880]  all right let's jump to Joe in California
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:30.880]  Joe you're on the air
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:32.880]  hi how are you doing Jason
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:34.880]  yes absolutely
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:36.880]  look the reason why I'm calling is
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:38.880]  you're talking about the Clintons
[3:27:38.880 --> 3:27:40.880]  and their constant
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:42.880]  twisting and lying
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:44.880]  and Alex
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:46.880]  posted I don't know if you have a chance to read
[3:27:46.880 --> 3:27:48.880]  the article that I wrote on Dr. Quidu
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:50.880]  tragedy and hope revealing a call by Cesar
[3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:52.880]  Rhodes for American Union
[3:27:52.880 --> 3:27:54.880]  I know all about
[3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:56.880]  you that is in one of the lectures
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:27:58.880]  we're gonna get into that in about 10 minutes
[3:27:58.880 --> 3:28:00.880]  with G. Edward Griffin
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:02.880]  but yeah the Rhodes group
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:04.880]  it's a round table group
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:06.880]  and they said if they were ever figured out
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:08.880]  they would just change the name of their organization
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:10.880]  well not only that they also called for an American Union
[3:28:10.880 --> 3:28:12.880]  and it's on infowords.com
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:14.880]  and Carol Quigley by the way
[3:28:14.880 --> 3:28:16.880]  is Bill Clinton's mentor
[3:28:16.880 --> 3:28:18.880]  for those that don't know he was mentioned
[3:28:18.880 --> 3:28:20.880]  on both his inauguration speech
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:22.880]  a separate speech after that
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:24.880]  but yeah Quigley and Clinton were big time
[3:28:24.880 --> 3:28:26.880]  absolutely and the article covers that also
[3:28:26.880 --> 3:28:28.880]  but the reason why I'm following up on that
[3:28:28.880 --> 3:28:30.880]  and bringing it up to your attention is because
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:32.880]  in my article I talk about
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:34.880]  1968 stroke Talbot
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:36.880]  1968
[3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:38.880]  received the Rhodes Scholarship
[3:28:38.880 --> 3:28:40.880]  along with Bill Clinton
[3:28:40.880 --> 3:28:42.880]  and somebody after the article was posted
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:44.880]  on infowords.com
[3:28:44.880 --> 3:28:46.880]  someone went ahead and tagged on
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:48.880]  a letter
[3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:50.880]  in the White House stationery
[3:28:50.880 --> 3:28:52.880]  written by Bill Clinton
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:28:54.880]  dated June 22nd, 1993
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:56.880]  they scanned a copy of the letter
[3:28:56.880 --> 3:28:58.880]  and guess what it says above all things
[3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:00.880]  it's a letter and I'm quoting from it
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:02.880]  Daniel Norman Cousins Global Governance Award
[3:29:02.880 --> 3:29:04.880]  and Clinton writes
[3:29:04.880 --> 3:29:06.880]  I am pleased to extend my warmest congratulations
[3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:08.880]  to my good friend stroke Talbot

[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:16.880]  they are globalist Joe you know that

[3:29:24.880 --> 3:29:26.880]  we're on the march
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:28.880]  the empire's on the run
[3:29:28.880 --> 3:29:30.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN

[3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:42.880]  radio network
[3:29:44.880 --> 3:29:46.880]  have you ever thought about what's in your
[3:29:46.880 --> 3:29:48.880]  shampoo, soap or detergent
[3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:50.880]  how about chlorides, dyes, ethanol
[3:29:50.880 --> 3:29:52.880]  sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes
[3:29:52.880 --> 3:29:54.880]  and more
[3:29:54.880 --> 3:29:56.880]  even fragrance can indicate the presence of some
[3:29:56.880 --> 3:29:58.880]  4000 separate ingredients
[3:29:58.880 --> 3:30:00.880]  most of which are synthetic
[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:02.880]  hi this is Alex Jones
[3:30:02.880 --> 3:30:04.880]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling
[3:30:04.880 --> 3:30:06.880]  these additives that can lead to coughing
[3:30:06.880 --> 3:30:08.880]  wheezing and shortness of breath
[3:30:08.880 --> 3:30:10.880]  headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin
[3:30:10.880 --> 3:30:12.880]  and mucous membranes

[3:33:36.880 --> 3:33:42.160]  times. He is a true patriot and a scholar working on a new book right now. Mr. Griffin,
[3:33:42.160 --> 3:33:48.360]  how are you, sir? I'm very well, Jason. How are you? I'm very well. So let's just get
[3:33:48.360 --> 3:33:52.800]  right into it. It's Bilderberg time. What do you think is going to be on the table in
[3:33:52.800 --> 3:33:59.000]  this elitist meeting with 125 people? Oh, boy, you know, I've never even thought about
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:04.360]  that, but it doesn't take much of a genius to figure out what they're working on. They've
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:10.800]  got two agendas. This is all coming to mind as I speak, so I think they're two basic agendas.
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:17.000]  One is how to push the final closure on the New World Order as fast as possible. And the
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:22.120]  other agenda is how to keep people like you and me from messing up their plans. Well, it's
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:27.320]  becoming ever-increasingly difficult with the Internet and the widespread popularity
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:31.920]  of the Patriot movement, especially after Ron Paul's run for the presidency. Yes, it's
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:37.320]  getting difficult. Of course, they've anticipated that. We know that. They knew that there would
[3:34:37.320 --> 3:34:42.040]  be opposition. I don't think in the long range they really anticipated how much impact the
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:48.920]  Internet would have in being able to give people a means of running around the major
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:53.240]  controlled media, but they certainly have the picture now, which is, I think, why they're
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:34:59.560]  almost at a frenzy speed to control the Internet and to turn it over to international monitoring
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:07.280]  and international control at the UN, because they want to prevent political dissent. They
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:12.680]  want to prevent distribution of information and facts. And they want to do it, of course,
[3:35:12.680 --> 3:35:17.280]  in the name of protecting the people. So they'll always be talking about stopping pornography
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:24.320]  or terrorism or crime or something like that, so the people will say, oh, good for you.
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:28.280]  I'm glad you're doing that. But meanwhile, the real motive we know is just to get control
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:32.080]  over the flow of information so that they can control the Internet just the way they
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:35.080]  now control radio and television and print media.
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:39.800]  Absolutely. And you know they love to pose as our saviors when they are anything but
[3:35:39.800 --> 3:35:45.120]  our saviors. They are working towards eroding our sovereignty, destroying our economy, and
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:49.880]  bringing us into a North American Union so that they can get their new world order. And
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:55.600]  this is really their term for it, Mr. Griffin. I mean, we have people like George H.W. Bush,
[3:35:55.600 --> 3:36:04.880]  Dick Cheney, Blair, Gordon Brown, Henry Kissinger, all on tape using this ambiguous term for
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:06.680]  global governance.
[3:36:06.680 --> 3:36:11.480]  Well it is an ambiguous term, and of course they're masters at using words so that they
[3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:15.000]  sound good and people don't really know what they mean. But as long as they sound good
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:20.520]  and give you that nice feeling inside, they accomplish their mission. There's been quite
[3:36:20.520 --> 3:36:27.800]  a science built up in the last five or six decades since the introduction of psychology
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:35.480]  as a social science, as you call it. People have been perfecting means by which they can
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:42.040]  create impressions using words not as a means of communication, but as a means of obfuscation,
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:47.520]  and as a means of bewildering and confusing people rather than informing people. And they're
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:52.240]  quite good at that now. It's a new science, and you have to admire the skill with which
[3:36:52.240 --> 3:36:56.160]  they apply that science. And of course the average person who's not aware that he's the
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:03.040]  target of that is pretty easily influenced. He's like putty in their hands. So yeah, that's
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:08.000]  what's going on right now. It's control for the mind. And as your show says, it's an
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:13.520]  info war. That's really what it is because people are computers, our minds are like computers.
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:17.840]  The smarter we are, the more high powered the computer is, which means the more easily
[3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:24.040]  it can be programmed with garbage. Computers are not inherently smart. They're inherently
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:29.280]  fast perhaps, or inherently complex and can do all kinds of things. But if you put false
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:34.560]  information, false data into a computer, it's going to come up with false solutions. In
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:40.760]  the same way with the human mind, if you put false data, false news, false information
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:46.040]  into the human mind, you can program the human mind just like you can program a computer.
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:50.480]  And of course that's what I was talking about a moment ago. That's the science of mind control.
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:51.480]  It's far advanced today.
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:56.680]  Yeah, it is very far advanced. And there's a guy out there. His name is Darren Brown.
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:02.280]  And he's big over in the UK, but he really exposes how fragile the human mind really
[3:38:02.280 --> 3:38:08.040]  is and how easily we really are influenced through subliminals and other techniques.
[3:38:08.040 --> 3:38:13.640]  And I recently watched this National Geographic special on US mind control. And of course
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:19.400]  they admit to MKUltra. They even bring up Sir Han Sir Han as a possible Manchurian candidate.
[3:38:19.400 --> 3:38:23.320]  But overall at the end, of course, they say, well, they haven't done this in years, and
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:27.160]  it wasn't really useful, and they weren't able to program everybody. So it's time to
[3:38:27.160 --> 3:38:30.360]  go back to sleep. Why don't you speak to that?
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:36.160]  Well, naturally, if people are catching on to something that you want to hide, and the
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:41.280]  facts are out there in the open, you cannot deny it forever. So the next best move, say,
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:45.400]  oh, yeah, well, it's true. Actually, it's true. And isn't it terrible? I agree with you.
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:50.440]  It's terrible, and I'm glad they put an end to it.
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:51.880]  And stop asking questions.
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:58.960]  Yeah, but you know, this whole issue of mind control came up. And at least in my mind, during
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:03.240]  the commercial before you introduced me to the show, we heard Alex talking about the
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:09.920]  New World Order. And then you mentioned it again, because it was George Bush Sr. that
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:15.880]  introduced the phrase into popular usage. And that brought up the issue of how nice that
[3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:22.160]  sounds, the New World Order. And even global government or world government may sound pretty
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:30.320]  nice to people. And I think it's time to stop fighting it on the basis of global government,
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:34.000]  because you might say, well, what is wrong with world government? And the answer really,
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:40.040]  well, nothing is wrong with world government until you decide what kind of world government
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:45.320]  we're talking about. If it was a world government based on the principles of freedom force,
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:51.240]  for example, with individual liberty and freedom and respect for everybody's culture, and
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:57.320]  the use of non-coercion in social activities and political activities, it might be a pretty
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:03.000]  good world to live in. But believe me, folks, this is not the kind of world government that
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:07.920]  these guys are talking about. The model they're using is not the model of freedom force. They're
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:12.560]  using the model of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. They're using the collectivist model
[3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:17.280]  of total control over the lives of every human being. So the issue is not really whether
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:23.160]  it's global government or not, or national government. The issue is what kind of government.
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:27.400]  And I wish more people would start talking about that, because even if we retain our
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:32.640]  sovereignty and stay out of global government, we can still be in pretty deep trouble if
[3:40:32.640 --> 3:40:37.240]  we adopt the philosophy of collectivism as we have done right here in our nation.
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:40.760]  Well, that's what I was about to say. I mean, our Constitution and Bill of Rights are virtually
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:45.360]  gone. We barely have a First Amendment. Now that the Patriot Acts 1 and 2 and parts of
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:51.020]  3 have been signed into law, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which got rid of
[3:40:51.020 --> 3:40:55.440]  the habeas corpus effectively for you and me. And now we don't even have the rights to face
[3:40:55.440 --> 3:41:00.400]  our accusers. It doesn't seem like we have a government that is just a government foreign
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:05.040]  by the people as it was originally designed. A government with three branches that ran
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:09.160]  checks and balances on one another. It seems like anything that they don't want you to
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:13.360]  know about can now just be said up. National security can't talk about it.
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:18.680]  That's right. So it's all over. The system of government that we had as beautiful as
[3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:25.520]  it was and as much as we cherished it and defended it, it's been pretty well whittled
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:31.400]  away today. And it's time for people to wake up to that fact. And even having woken up,
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:34.760]  haven't awakened to it, then they have to deal with the question, what are we going
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:41.480]  to do about it? Just being informed is not enough. And so words, we're back to words.
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:49.120]  They can be used to communicate or they can be used to obfuscate and manipulate. Absolutely.
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:52.280]  But you know what? I am seeing people step up. For instance, you know, Alex went out
[3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:57.480]  to the Bilderberg meeting in 2006. There were about 15 people out there that knew what was
[3:41:57.480 --> 3:42:03.360]  going on that were by Alex's side that realized that these globalists don't have their best
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:09.880]  interest at heart. Well, the report today is between one and 200 people outside of Chantilly,
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:14.240]  Virginia, outside of the Marriott, protesting. Even the police seem to know what's going
[3:42:14.240 --> 3:42:18.400]  on. They're getting orders from the FBI and Secret Service to move these people. But the
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:21.560]  police are standing up for the protestors and saying, look, they have a First Amendment
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:24.600]  right. They're on a public sidewalk. You're going to have to leave them alone, which is
[3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:30.160]  very encouraging to me. That is very encouraging. I'm surprised to hear it, but boy, that's
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:36.640]  good news, yes. It's amazing news. And I know that we have it in us to step up and defeat
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:41.640]  this system. I remember you were on the show not so long ago, and you were talking about
[3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:48.480]  how in times of great peril, things are often switched. They don't usually get what they
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:53.960]  want, especially tyrannical governments. A lot of time at the darkest hour, we are able
[3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:58.440]  to turn this around. And I hope we can do that. I hope that we're waking up the masses.
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:04.440]  I hope that people are taking it upon themselves to write stories, start blogs, copy videos,
[3:43:04.440 --> 3:43:09.960]  spread G. Edward Griffin's books. The creature from Jekyll Island is just an amazing account
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:15.640]  about how our economy truly works now. Well, you're certainly on target there, I think,
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:20.120]  Jason. We can have all these wonderful plans of what should be done, what must be done,
[3:43:20.120 --> 3:43:24.720]  and all these essays that we write about. This is how we're going to solve the problem.
[3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:28.840]  But unless we've got the manpower, unless we have the American people well enough informed
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:33.400]  that they understand what we're talking about, and therefore support these reforms, then
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:37.960]  we're just wasting our time. So as much as we'd like to say, you know, it's no longer
[3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:43.080]  time for education, let's get busy and solve these problems, we still have a big educational
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:48.360]  job ahead of us. Because it's almost like guerrilla warfare. You know, the guerrillas
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:53.760]  can never succeed unless they have the support of the general population. So that's pretty
[3:43:53.760 --> 3:43:58.840]  much where we stand today. We've got to awaken our fellow citizens to the reality, and we
[3:43:58.840 --> 3:44:03.360]  need their support. Even if they're not going to do much about it, we need them to understand
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:08.240]  what it is we're talking about, and support us when we bring about the reforms.
[3:44:08.240 --> 3:44:13.440]  Absolutely. And you helped support us this weekend when we did the Info Wars money bomb.
[3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:18.000]  We made over $200,000. We left it open until tomorrow, folks. And we're going to give out
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:23.840]  the grand total to start a new television show, a new network, hopefully on Dish TV, where
[3:44:23.840 --> 3:44:29.400]  we do an hour long show, you know, like a 60 minutes, like a 2020 without the spin,
[3:44:29.400 --> 3:44:35.520]  with the real story, with the true grit, the reality that the American people need to see.
[3:44:35.520 --> 3:44:41.640]  They need to understand just because Obama is a great speaker and his logo is change
[3:44:41.640 --> 3:44:46.280]  you can vote for. Doesn't mean there's going to be any real change. The man behind the
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:44:53.080]  man is Zignu Brzezinski, you know, a trilateral commission, CFR, top level globalist. Why
[3:44:53.080 --> 3:44:54.720]  don't you speak to that?
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:44:59.280]  Well, that's what we were just talking about before, how words can be used to outfuscate
[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:04.000]  change. Well, that's wonderful, I suppose. But what change? Nobody's talking about what
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:09.800]  the change is. The change only is in the change of the name, the change of the candidate,
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:15.720]  and they replace Bush with Obama, I suppose. That's change. Well, it is, in a way. But
[3:45:15.720 --> 3:45:20.080]  when you get down to the nitty gritties of the policies that they support, you're quite
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:26.600]  right. They're part of the CFR agenda. They're totally locked into it. And so nothing is
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:28.760]  really going to change at a fundamental level.
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:34.640]  Wow, isn't it time that the American people pick up on this? You know, it's like, I'm
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:39.600]  not a tennis player, but I understand that tennis players, if they're up against an
[3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:45.080]  opponent, they better study their opponents' serve very carefully so they don't fall for
[3:45:45.080 --> 3:45:50.040]  it, time and time and time again. And yet, the American voters are falling for the same
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:57.440]  serve, the same sliced serve, every two or every four years. And I don't know how they
[3:45:57.440 --> 3:46:01.160]  expect to win the game. They're not going to unless they wake up to the tricks of their
[3:46:01.160 --> 3:46:02.160]  opponent.
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:05.840]  Well, that's why the Internet is so powerful. And I think that some of these YouTube videos
[3:46:05.840 --> 3:46:11.960]  that only have, you know, two or 15,000 hits need two or 15 million hits, especially the
[3:46:11.960 --> 3:46:16.960]  ones where Bill Clinton recently admits that he indeed did attend the Bilderberg conference
[3:46:16.960 --> 3:46:20.720]  when he was out in Europe. He denies that he was there to set up a North American Union
[3:46:20.720 --> 3:46:25.800]  or even discuss any U.S. policy at all. He said, well, I was there and I talked to some
[3:46:25.800 --> 3:46:30.360]  Europeans about what was going to happen in Russia. And then I played a clip earlier of
[3:46:30.360 --> 3:46:34.880]  the student scholars for 9-11 Truth asking Hillary Clinton if she attended the conference
[3:46:34.880 --> 3:46:38.640]  in 2006. And she's like, what conference? I don't even know what it is. And then they
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:43.040]  say, well, your husband attended and she kind of nods. Oh, I really can't tell you. I just
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:46:48.720]  don't know. All right, thanks. And we are changed just confronted both of them. I could
[3:46:48.720 --> 3:46:52.560]  only play half the clip because, you know, these rabid Clinton supporters start to get
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:56.040]  violent. They start to curse at them. They start to grab the camera. But when they ask
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:00.240]  Bill Clinton, you know, why doesn't the media cover Bilderberg? I don't know. I haven't
[3:47:00.240 --> 3:47:05.360]  been there in 15 years. Well, I think he went in 99. So it was a little, a little sooner
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:10.440]  than 15 years ago. And he knows damn well why the media is not outside reporting on
[3:47:10.440 --> 3:47:14.960]  us because they're on the inside helping the agenda. Yeah, that's right. They're very
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:21.280]  much a part of the mechanism. So, well, yeah, but it's encouraging to see that gradually,
[3:47:21.280 --> 3:47:28.080]  ever so gradually, like water slowly coming up inside the well, the water level is rising,
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:32.960]  the level of understanding is rising. I wish we would come up a little faster, but heck,
[3:47:32.960 --> 3:47:38.640]  it's coming up and that's what's important. Absolutely. And, you know, we have to keep
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:43.700]  informing people. We have to spread the message. And again, G Edward Griffin's books are top
[3:47:43.700 --> 3:47:48.280]  notch folks. Now you're working on a new, new book. I've talked to you about a little
[3:47:48.280 --> 3:47:52.160]  bit about this. Why don't you tell the audience about your new project? Well, it's an embarrassing
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:57.680]  in a way because I've been working on it now, technically, ever since 9 11. A couple of
[3:47:57.680 --> 3:48:02.960]  days after 9 11, I decided, Oh, I've got to, I've got to pull together this topic and produce
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:06.800]  a book. And I thought I would do it in the body, you know, maybe a year and a half. And
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:13.320]  I'm still struggling along on it because not that I'm failing to get the information down
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:19.000]  on paper so much as that I'm crowded with other things that take up my day. But anyway,
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:25.580]  that I'm still working on it. And I'm going to say it's probably about 65 to 70% done.
[3:48:25.580 --> 3:48:30.320]  And the title of it, the tentative title is the freedom manifesto. That was the title.
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:36.280]  I jotted down a couple of days after 9 11. And I still think it's a good title, but now
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:43.040]  we see that Congressman Paul's book uses the word manifesto. So I, I may not, I may not
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:47.280]  stick with that title. But did you ever think in America, we were going to have a New York
[3:48:47.280 --> 3:48:53.640]  Times number one bestselling book with manifesto in the title, which isn't fiction, you know,
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:48:58.720]  maybe a fiction book, but not, not something written by a congressman who, you know, raised
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:49:04.200]  more money than anybody else in the Republican candidacy president. And not by anybody that's
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  speaking the truth. That's for sure. But there it is. And so it just proves that miracles
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:13.120]  can happen. Absolutely. But look at the media blackout on that. I mean, anybody with a number
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:19.960]  one bestseller on the New York Times list is on Oprah. They're on every night talk show.
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:24.320]  They've got a dedicated hour on Larry King live, but we haven't seen that with Mr. Paul.
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:28.480]  We've seen some sparse media appearances where he seems to be attacked, even though he's
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:32.640]  a bestselling author. Yeah. Well, it just proves what we've, what we've been saying
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:37.320]  about the, the bias in the media. And, but anyway, that's wonderful news. And as far
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:41.880]  as my own book is concerned, it's, it would be quite, it is going to be quite different
[3:49:41.880 --> 3:49:49.160]  than Paul's book. Paul is the focusing correctly, I think focusing on political issues and themes
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:55.000]  which are of particular interest to people who are kind of new to the movement, want
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:50:00.480]  to know how to vote and what's going on in the political arena. Whereas mine, you know,
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:05.440]  how I do the things. I, I can't start with today. I've got to get a run on it. And so
[3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:06.760]  I go back in history.
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:08.240]  You like to peel back the layers.
[3:50:08.240 --> 3:50:13.560]  I have to go back. Yeah. Peel back the layers, dig down to the roots and, uh, because otherwise
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:17.560]  I don't think you can understand today if you don't really understand yesterday. It's
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:21.600]  a continuity, you know, and you certainly won't understand tomorrow if you don't see
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:23.080]  where today came from.
[3:50:23.080 --> 3:50:26.960]  Well, if you don't know their past or doomed to repeat it in the future, we have one more
[3:50:26.960 --> 3:50:32.120]  segment with G. Edward Griffin. After this, it's the Alex Jones show. I'm Jason Burmes,

[3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:09.280]  All right, folks. It's the final segment of the Alex Jones show. I just want to remind
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.920]  everybody out there, if you missed any of this four-hour broadcast, and it was a powerful
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:19.920]  four-hour broadcast with Rob Jacobson, Alex Jones, and Luke Rudowsky, all calling in from
[3:54:19.920 --> 3:54:25.040]  Bilderberg. You can go to infowars.com, and the refeed starts in about six minutes. That's
[3:54:25.040 --> 3:54:30.840]  infowars.com. If you want to get at me, myspace.com slash Jason Bermas. We're on the line with
[3:54:30.840 --> 3:54:37.000]  G. Edward Griffin, an accomplished author and speaker. Before you go, Mr. Griffin, I'd
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:40.560]  like to get your take on Iran. In the last couple of days, I've been doing a lot of interviews.
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:44.840]  I talked to Daniel Estalon. He thinks that Iran is off the table. He feels like the European
[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:49.680]  sect of this elite doesn't want to go in there. I'm of a little bit different opinion.
[3:54:49.680 --> 3:54:53.320]  I really feel like they want Iran, that that could be their crowning jewel in the Middle
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:54:58.240]  East, until they take over Saudi Arabia and really build this new Eurasian Union. What
[3:54:58.240 --> 3:55:02.840]  do you think? I have to start off by saying I'm certainly
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:10.400]  not a Middle East expert. I haven't really studied that part of the puzzle as deeply
[3:55:10.400 --> 3:55:15.000]  as I have other parts, but I think I have to agree with you, Jason, that it looks to
[3:55:15.000 --> 3:55:21.800]  me like for many, many years, if not decades. The master planning for this has gone back
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:25.880]  many, many years, and it looks to me like they've always wanted to have that military
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:33.080]  dominance in the Middle East. They wanted Iran, and it just seems to be that the people
[3:55:33.080 --> 3:55:36.760]  who are running the show, now we're not talking about the average American, we're talking
[3:55:36.760 --> 3:55:42.880]  about the CFR people and the people with that pretty ear making the decisions. They want
[3:55:42.880 --> 3:55:47.160]  that, and they keep talking about it, and they keep trying to stimulate some kind of
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:53.360]  an international incident to justify our attack, make it look like it was retaliation and so
[3:55:53.360 --> 3:55:58.440]  forth. I see no reason to believe that the people making the decisions have backed off
[3:55:58.440 --> 3:56:02.360]  at all. I'm with you on that, and what really scared
[3:56:02.360 --> 3:56:09.080]  me probably like four or five months ago, when I saw this supposed Iranian speedboat
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:16.520]  alongside a US Navy craft, and they were reporting, oh, these guys were threatening to blow it
[3:56:16.520 --> 3:56:20.200]  up, and this and that. I saw it all over the media, and they were speaking in English,
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:23.720]  and I remember I was over at my buddy's house watching this live, and I go, you watch. I
[3:56:23.720 --> 3:56:26.960]  go three or four days from now, it's going to come out that that whole thing was staged,
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:31.400]  and it was totally fake, and sure enough it did, and it looked to me again like they were
[3:56:31.400 --> 3:56:34.320]  trying to provocate another Gulf of Tonkin type incident.
[3:56:34.320 --> 3:56:40.840]  Yes, it's very clear. I also know that these people are flexible. They've always got a
[3:56:40.840 --> 3:56:47.720]  plan B and maybe a plan C. If for some reason their European counterparts decide that they
[3:56:47.720 --> 3:56:53.200]  don't want the US in Iran at this time, you know, they might postpone it, they might try
[3:56:53.200 --> 3:56:58.080]  something else, but anyway, having said, I don't really consider myself to be an expert,
[3:56:58.080 --> 3:57:02.000]  and certainly don't have any inside information, but I will answer the question by saying my
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:05.320]  opinion is that I think they're still determined to go in there.
[3:57:05.320 --> 3:57:11.560]  Yeah, I'd have to agree with you there. We've seen such a brutalization really of the US
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:16.840]  economy from the housing market going under to the fact that the dollar has been devalued
[3:57:16.840 --> 3:57:22.200]  to the point that it's below Canadian currency now, and the fact that we don't seem to be
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:27.360]  producing anything in this country. We're a nation of consumers and not producers. Where
[3:57:27.360 --> 3:57:29.880]  do you see the economy going in the next six months?
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:35.920]  Well, I'm certainly not, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see, to look at
[3:57:35.920 --> 3:57:41.600]  a graph, and if you look at the economy, it's the way we're a graph, let's say the value
[3:57:41.600 --> 3:57:47.360]  of the dollar, make a graph on it, and it's going down, down, down, down, down, down.
[3:57:47.360 --> 3:57:53.200]  It's been doing that for a long, long time, and so you have to conclude that unless something
[3:57:53.200 --> 3:57:56.840]  changes, that line is going to continue to go down.
[3:57:56.840 --> 3:58:00.880]  I have to agree with you there too. G-Ed Rippon, thank you so much for spending a half an hour
[3:58:00.880 --> 3:58:01.880]  with us. This is the Alex Jones show.

[3:58:03.880 --> 3:58:04.880]  You're very welcome.
[3:58:04.880 --> 3:58:07.360]  And remember, if you missed any of it, you can catch the whole thing over again over
