[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time. We're here live and
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.320]  restreamed on the web at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com. Well, my guest really needs no
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.560]  introduction. She's a more modern feminist, you could say. I agree with the report she's put out,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.120]  the analysis she's done about how destructive pornography is for both men and women, and her
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.560]  analysis fits with the scientific reports I've seen, which of course she covered, where this is
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.320]  what we have her on about today, but I'm saying she's very accomplished, about how it doesn't
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.120]  turn men into these raving rapists like people thought it would 50 years ago. It actually turns
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.840]  them into men who don't interface with the women in their lives and who live in a fantasy land.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.840]  It's very destructive for men, not just women, but that's some of the stuff she's written about.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.800]  She's written multiple best-selling books, as I'm sure many of you know, and now she has
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:11.520]  valiantly come out and put out a new book, The End of America, and she also has written a essay
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.040]  called Fascist America in 10 Easy Steps, and we have links to Amazon.com where you can get her
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.960]  book and a lot more up on InfoWars.com. Naomi Wolf, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.640]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.280]  When did you start to wake up to the police state that's really accelerated its expansion
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.560]  under the Bush administration in the last seven years?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.040]  Yeah, it was definitely not something I wanted to think about, but I have a friend who's the
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.560]  daughter of Holocaust survivors, and she kept insisting when we talked about news events
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.080]  that they did this in Germany, they did this in Germany, and I was sure that this was,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.960]  you know, very extreme, irrational talk, but she finally forced me to sit down and start reading,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.920]  and of course I discovered that she wasn't talking about national socialist outcomes,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.440]  you know, 38, 39, 40. She was talking about 1930, 31, 32, when Germany was a parliamentary
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.560]  democracy, yes, a fragile one. The Weimar Republic.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.760]  Exactly, but a small group of people began very systematically to use the law and dismantle the
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.480]  Constitution and put pressure on citizens to subvert the law, and that opened the door
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.240]  for everything to follow, and then when I started reading this, I saw that not only
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.800]  were tactics and strategies being reproduced exactly right now by the Bush administration,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.320]  but that actual sound bites and language and images and scenarios and sort of film moments
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.080]  are being reproduced, and then to summarize quickly, I looked at other times and places
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.760]  where a would-be dictator, whether on the left or the right, wanted to close down a democracy
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.920]  or crush a pro-democracy movement, and I looked at Italy in the 20s, I mentioned Germany in the 30s,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.600]  Russia in the 30s, East Germany in the 50s, Czechoslovakia in the 60s, China's crackdown
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.800]  on the democracy movement in the 80s, Pinochet's coup in Chile in 1973, and what I saw, Alex,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.680]  was that there is a blueprint, I mean, that everybody who wants to close down a democracy
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.240]  does the exact ten things, the ten classic steps, and that unfortunately, I'm sorry to say,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.000]  we're seeing each of these ten steps being put in place in the United States today.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.760]  And you've pointed out, and I've interviewed actual special forces colonel commanders from
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.360]  Vietnam and other places where this has been carried out, and people who are involved in
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.240]  death squads in Latin America, that our own government, not just the School of Americas
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.680]  for Latin America in Fort Benning, Georgia, but other military bases and other spy schools
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.280]  and other officer training schools for foreign cadets are actually training the world. The
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.800]  U.S. for the last 50 years has been covertly, but now it's accelerating, training the world
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.840]  how to carry out these very policies, this very blueprint.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.240]  Yeah, it's very, very distressing, especially if you're a patriot, and we can live in this bubble,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.280]  as I did until I was 43 and started researching this, where you really think we are a force for
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.000]  good in the world, and we should be, and often we are, but what you've just said is horrifically
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.640]  true, I'm sorry to say, that the great dictators, you know, Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, developed this
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.400]  practice that is so effective, and then what happened was petty dictators in the second half
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.920]  of the 20th century and up until the present learn it, study it, transmit it, and unfortunately,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.080]  you're 100% right, the School for the Americas under our auspices teaches would-be dictators,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.200]  especially in Latin American countries, how to set up their own death squads to press,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.800]  defend in their own countries, crack down, round up journalists in their own countries,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.520]  the same blueprint, the same 10 steps, so in a way it's a miracle, sorry, I was just going to say,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.480]  it's kind of this really incredible lesson that since we turned a blind eye as citizens to how we
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.920]  were exporting this all over the world, paradoxically, we don't recognize, because we're
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.520]  not in practice, we don't recognize these blinking red warning lights happening right now at home
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.240]  that democracy activists all over the world can recognize, and they're going, oh my god, no,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.880]  you know, don't let the executives have more power to declare martial law, don't let the executives
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.280]  have more power to round up his political opponents and put them in solitary confinement for three
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.480]  years. Now, going back to the roots of this with Hitler, and he was of course expanding on other
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.520]  systems of control, going back to the Romans, he adopted a lot of the, and I've read Heinz
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.480]  Hobel's Order of the Death said, a lot of the Jesuits systems for controlling countries,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.480]  and so Hitler was building on a lot of sciences that had been developed before he came along,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.880]  but I'm sure you know this, and I haven't finished your book yet, and I'm wondering if it's in there,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.200]  that Prescott Bush was actually the head Nazi agent, the U.S., the McCormick-Dixit committees
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.760]  exposed this, the guy that was about to be the Marine Corps Commandant, Brigadier General Smedley
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.240]  Butler, they tried to hire him to overthrow the government and set up a fascist dictatorship,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.040]  so to see Bush even calling it homeland security, it was fatherland security there,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.680]  setting up a homeland security, which is the Gestapo slash SS, I mean, they're really going
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.840]  down the line, and then when you learn, and I'm asking, did you know this, that the Bushes
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.160]  actually got their first seed money from Fritz Thiessen, the man who bankrolled Hitler, yeah.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.320]  Well, I have to say, as you're speaking, you know, I'm very rarely at a loss for words, Alex,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.280]  but I'm so kind of overwhelmed with emotion from what you just said, because you're the first
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.080]  mainstream talker to say this truth, which is, you know, historically a hundred percent
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.280]  accurate and profoundly important for people to understand. There was an attempted coup,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.200]  are you there? Oh yes, I'm here, Naomi. Okay, there was, as you just said very bravely,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.040]  to, you know, thousands of listeners, there was a scheme in the 30s, and Prescott Bush
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.080]  was one of the leaders of this scheme, industrialists who admired fascism and who thought
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.360]  it was a good idea to have a coup in the United States along the lines of the coup that they
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.760]  saw taking place so profitably for corporations in Italy and in Germany, and you are a hundred
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.480]  percent right that Smedley Butler, and actually I have a good friend who's reporting this out and
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.400]  has access to the original document, so he's telling me about Smedley Butler, even as you're
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.280]  speaking, so it's like this, you know, truth is just like coming out all over the place. Smedley
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.280]  Butler had gone along with violent regime change for much of his career, but he was approached by
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.680]  these conspirators, including Prescott Bush, and he outed them, and he testified to Congress,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.040]  and, you know, that these people were planning a coup in the United States. It's in the
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.160]  congressional record, and you are a hundred percent right that Prescott Bush was in alliance
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.000]  with Thyssen, the great industrialist, the Nazi industrialist, and made millions and millions of
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.080]  dollars, basically the Bush family fortune, and then what is amazing to me and resonant to me
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.520]  is that when the Nuremberg trials finally were put in place and these Nazi industrialists,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.840]  some of whom had colluded with Americans, including, by the way, IBM, were about to be
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.480]  brought to trial and sent to prison, there was a moment at which they were going to look into
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.200]  turning the spotlight on their American partners, and that's why when I look at the laws that the
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.600]  Bush White House has drafted, like the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which are so consciously
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.440]  designed to protect Bush and his co-conspirators from being indicted for war crimes, just as the
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.080]  Nuremberg conspirators were indicted for war crimes, that seems to me to resonate from the
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:55.600]  family history. The family history is you can make so much money uniting corporate interests
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.680]  with a fascist state that violently represses people, and that's why when I saw the recycling
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.520]  of so much Nazi language, Nazi tactics, Nazi strategies, Nazi imagery in the Bush White House,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.880]  and then finally, belatedly, people brought to me this history of the Prescott Bush attempted coup
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.200]  and Smedley Butler's revelations, it just gave me absolute chills, and it gives me chills to hear
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:27.760]  you say it out loud. Is this the first time you've spoken about it? I have sort of skirted the issue
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.960]  as I've been waiting to get enough research that is sound to have a public conversation about it,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.160]  but you have very bravely sort of dragged the subject out into a public conversation. I'm now
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.400]  confident enough of the data to confirm exactly what you're saying. Well, I mean, just so you know,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.880]  I've been covering this ever since I got on air 13 years ago, and I've had a lot of the historians
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:58.560]  on who really first codified this and put this together, but just so you know, if you go to Google
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.760]  Video, no need to buy the DVD from Infowars.com. That would be nice. I'll send you one, but for
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.960]  listeners, it's nice to have the high-quality digital DVD. If you go to Google and type
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.560]  Marshall Law in and click Video, Naomi, I made a three-hour film about this. The last hour is
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.360]  about it, and so no need to watch the first two hours. It's about other things, but you can fast
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.800]  forward to the last hour, and we have, but since we brought this out, the London Guardian's reported,
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:33.200]  the BBC is reported, and BBC Radio and TV, so it's now... You're the guy who brought it out
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.840]  that the BBC picked it up from? That's amazing. Well, no, no. Let me give credit where credit
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:44.480]  is due. Webster Tarpley, I already read this and talked about it, but Tarpley about 12 years ago
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:52.080]  did the main research, and then Mr. Buchanan, who I interviewed for the film with John Buchanan,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:11:00.160]  he actually went to verify, and we went with him to the National Archives. Oh my God. And then
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:08.080]  since then, we've gotten the actual clips of newsreel, 18-millimeter footage from the
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.920]  McCormick-Dickstein Committee. No, you're kidding. Oh my God, I've got to see this material.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.520]  I mean, we've got to bring this out. I've got a friend who is standing by to make a viral film
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.920]  about this to get the word out to Americans, because it's one thing to put the pieces together
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.160]  theoretically, as I've done in my book, but when you realize that there is a family history...
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.920]  And again, you can't point fingers at a grandson or a great-grandson and say,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.840]  you know, the taint of the ancestors on the grandson, but it just... But now he's doing
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.720]  it. It's kind of like saying... Now he's doing it. That's right. And it adds a dimensionality
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.240]  of plausibility to something that is, until you have this kind of personal history confirmation,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.520]  is circumstantial evidence. Oh my gosh. Now I want to... Yeah, but for your research,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:05.360]  London Guardian, and then you can expand out from there to BBC. And it was also picked up by
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:15.840]  three US newspapers, but they're local dailies. So it's all been vetted out. And Prescott Bush
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.880]  was the main bag man on the board of directors of Fritz Thyssen's Union Carbide and Brown Brother
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:30.240]  Harriman. And then after the war, he was the bag man. And then it gets into Texas history and even
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.880]  family that I talked to who didn't know what they were seeing in Midland after World War II,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.400]  but was telling me about this when I was a little kid and how all this comes out,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.160]  about how there were all these Nazis everywhere. And it just... No, Alex, you're kidding me. Can
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.960]  we talk afterwards and follow up more about this? Absolutely. I get off at about three Eastern. I
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.840]  don't know what time zone you're in. This is really important because, truly, what is so
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.960]  disturbing about the research that I found isn't the broad breast jokes. And that's bad enough.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.920]  But what is really disturbing are these minute fingerprints. You look at, they unloaded coffins
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.080]  at night in Germany. We unload coffins at night. They pioneered the embedding of reporters. We
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.880]  pioneering the embedding... Stop right there. Let's go through the 10 steps while we have time.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.600]  Go ahead. You've got the floor. Yeah. Thank you. So the first... I'm sorry. I'm just still reeling
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.040]  from what you're saying. I understand. Yeah. It's big. Also, I'm not putting these pieces together.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.600]  I want to be super clear about this, but I just got off an interview where, for the first time,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:41.360]  I also said in public that citizens should be able to ask any questions they want about 9-11
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.160]  and that it's not a good sign in a democracy when there are some questions that are off limits.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.400]  And I made it super clear that I'm not drawing any kinds of conclusions, but that in a strong
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.200]  democracy, if citizens call for more investigation of a major crime, there's more investigation.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.840]  Well, did you know that Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly have said that Ron Paul supporters are
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.560]  working for Al Qaeda and Glenn Beck called for the military to be used against citizens last week?
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.320]  Oh my God. No, I did not know that. You can actually watch the video. Yeah, it's on...
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.240]  Why? Now Ron Paul supporters because they're for the Constitution?
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.840]  They're calling us domestic enemies. I had the Congressman on last week about it,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.720]  and in fact, we can play the clips, but we're running out of time. But yes, they're now saying
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.360]  this. That's really scary. And they called out the military against them? Well, they said,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.800]  we need to consider using the military. And then if you read, yes, against citizens,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.080]  and then if you're saying we're a domestic threat, and then if you read the John Warner
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.320]  Defense Authorization Act, it says it funds martial law for domestic insurrection by the
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.320]  citizenry. And then in PDD 51, Bush says that he's above continuity of government, not Congress.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.760]  Yes, that's right. Well, that is super scary because I know that they're training FBI agents
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.840]  right now to identify people who are critical of the administration as terrorists, which is
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.720]  something right out of the Stalinist playbook. And in fact, Norman Potthorpe's new book identifies
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.920]  people like me and you, obviously, as quote unquote domestic insurgents. And in a fascist
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.640]  shift, what I call a fascist shift, that's step eight and nine, which is to start identifying
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.840]  critics of the regime, or critics of the cadre in power. But here's the good news, Naomi. Yes,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.800]  sir. Here's the good news. Hitler did it and was popular. They're doing it and totally
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.000]  blowing their cover. That, I think, is the good news. That is good news, but until there was a
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.280]  revolution, like starting yesterday, of American patriots across the political spectrum to
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.320]  investigate, identify these crimes, prosecute, and put these people in jail because impeachment,
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.960]  the historical record shows, is not safe enough for people who are this kind of-
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:51.040]  I agree. No, no, this is life and death. Invoke a terrifying internal or external enemy in 9-11.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.680]  Let's go through them.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.720]  Yes, let me go through the 10 steps. Sure. All would-be dictators, left or right,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.600]  invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy, often a real one that they will hype and manipulate.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.160]  The second thing they always do is create a secret prison system that is outside the rule of
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.560]  law. By secret, I mean unaccountable, where torture takes place, and they often create
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.200]  military commissions. There's always a blurring of the line where they start by torturing people
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.080]  seen as at the margins of society, and then inevitably move into directing state abuse
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.280]  against people at the heart of civil society, journalists, editors, opposition leaders,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.280]  outspoken clergy, and labor leaders. At that point, people start to self-censor.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.720]  That's why the enemy combatant thing scares me to death. The president can say,
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.760]  Naomi Wolf, you're an enemy combatant. Joe Blow, you're an enemy combatant. Innocent American
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.400]  citizens, once he says this, can be put in a 10-by-12-foot cell in a Navy brig and kept
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.640]  there in isolation for three years.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.680]  They're now trying to introduce that idea as a White House talking point we got,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.360]  that anti-war libertarians, liberals are aiding terrorists and should be banned.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.480]  Lovely. I mean, this is just predictable. The blueprint is predictable. You could tell
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.800]  six months ago that this was ahead. What's interesting to me, also historically predictable,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.240]  is as people start to wake up, the regime is starting to ramp down, because it is a race
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.920]  against time. Who's going to win? Are we going to wake up in time and put them in prison,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.720]  or are they going to get us and push us past the point of no return, which is very quick.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.480]  Boy, you are certainly on the same page as I am. Oh, my goodness.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.840]  All right. Well, let's hope we win. The third thing they always do is create a paramilitary
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.560]  force that is not answerable to the citizens. Blackwater. Blackwater, exactly. They are
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.120]  operating in the United States right now. They're hand-selected torturers and murderers
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:42.240]  from regimes like Chile, Pinochet's guys, El Salvador, Nigeria, where they torture their
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.280]  own citizens. They're opening training grounds in Illinois and California.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.960]  Naomi, we'll stay there. We're going to come right back. We're going to keep her five minutes
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.760]  in the next hour. Then we have a guest coming on with the secret history of education and
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:03.680]  the big foundations. We'll be right back. It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.200]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.240]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.920]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.440]  new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.840]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.440]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.800]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:52.240]  athelesia. Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.320]  at PrisonPlanet.tv. Endgame, full prep for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.640]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.600]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.040]  atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body. Medical course potassium iodate gives
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.240]  you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.600]  radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.440]  thyroid with good iodine. This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:37.280]  radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:44.000]  to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets. Order the official potassium

[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.760]  the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flax seed with the detoxification of
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.960]  bentonite clay. In a perfect world, we would eat natural healthy foods, but the foods we eat today
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.480]  are not the foods nature intended for us. Fast food is toxic food. I've been producing MetaCleanse
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.360]  for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S. say that MetaCleanse helps your body detoxify
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.320]  from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons, such as heavy metals and pesticides in
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.840]  the intestinal tract. For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood. Even the FDA says
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.960]  flax seed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome,
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.320]  and constipation. A one-month supply of MetaCleanse is available online at MetaCleanse.com.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:49.120]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E.com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling. Or call me today at

[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.720]  Alex Jones here back live. Don't forget my new film,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.160]  Endgame. Blueprint for global enslavement is out on DVD. It's gone as high as, what,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.280]  18 on the Amazon video charts. Number one documentary for a week straight,
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.360]  and Loose Change Final Cut, which I'm the executive producer of. Totally new film,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.160]  ladies and gentlemen. Just been out for two weeks. Available on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:35.920]  Not on Amazon. One place to get it. PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.120]  Well, I mean, she's an amazing lady and just very well versed in so many subjects.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.320]  Remember, for five minutes into the next hour, it's clear I'm going to have to get her back up
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:50.400]  for a full hour if she'll grace us with that much time in the near future. Naomi, continuing with
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.480]  the steps. Sure. So paramilitary force outside the rule of law of Blackwater. They can show up
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.680]  tomorrow outside our doors to crack down on civil society with, as you mentioned,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.160]  the Defense Authorization Act of 2007, which gives the president the power to declare a
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.120]  public emergency, federalize the National Guard over the objections of governors.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.800]  And it says for insurrection. It says for the American people.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:21.200]  Yep. Yeah, he can do that tomorrow because he says so. The fourth thing you need to close
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.960]  down an open society is to direct a surveillance apparatus at ordinary citizens. And by the way,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.080]  there's a huge profit incentive because in the wake of the Cold War, the third of the economy
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.120]  that was making Cold War weapons, like Boeing and Raytheon, they were looking at declining
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.360]  market share unless they could find a new enemy. That's right. First they have the Soviets. Now
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.200]  they have the Arabs. Now it's going to be us. Rand and others have said this. And then it
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:52.080]  integrates it, just like many of your new student packages that the students get,
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:59.120]  scholarships are for this whole apparatus. Exactly. And they've got, so now there's
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.800]  billions of profits to be made if we hype a global enemy, if we turn the, quote unquote,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.840]  war on terror into something much bigger than it really is. And if we turn the enemy into us,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.280]  because then they're creating the surveillance and security technologies now, they have lobbyists
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.760]  who sit down with Homeland Security and write the laws and the policies. So that's why when
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.200]  our organization tried, the American Freedom Campaign, tried to get the presidential candidates
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.160]  to stand up for the constitution, the people who were not front runners on the left did so right
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.440]  away, but the front runners hesitated. And only Ron Paul has pledged it on the right. Why is that?
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.560]  Because it is now expensive to stand up for the rights of American citizens, if you're a front
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.880]  runner, because there are billions to be made for major donors who are the telecommunications and
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.200]  the surveillance and security technologies industries. And by the way, this only accelerates
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.720]  once you go into this paradigm of the predatory economy, it only gets bigger. Yeah, that's really
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.920]  scary. I mean, what we saw the model in Italy and Germany, someone just pointed out in their right,
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:09.040]  that now there are technologies that can amplify control and terror of civilians massively,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.160]  or that can be used to liberate civilians. Have you heard they're now putting in cameras all over
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.640]  first in England that shout orders at you and they have police cars that scan everyone's plates?
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.720]  Oh my Lord. I knew about the scanning of the plates. I didn't know about the shouting orders.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.120]  That's very disturbing. Number five, because I know you want me to get through these quickly
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.640]  if I can, is infiltrate citizens groups. Oh, by the way, the surveillance, the TSA
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.080]  watch list and the no-fly list started out 45,000 US citizens. I'm one of them.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:45.520]  Many critics of the administration are on the watch list, but it's gone up to 775,000 American
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.520]  citizens, 20,000 names added every month. And these are people who are environmental activists,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.640]  anti-war activists, decorated war heroes who are critical of the Iraq war. Unbelievable.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.160]  Alex is that people come up to me in tears after I speak about this because
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.760]  they wrote a letter to their local newspaper critical of Bush. Their kids get put on the
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.600]  watch list. Now, again, folks, if we give, and this is admitted, we always knew they had lists.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:20.000]  Now they're public. This is the intimidation. If we give in, they win. The only problem is they put
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.080]  so many people on it. Now they're not, they're letting you fly most of the time. So they put
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.000]  too many on it. Stay there. No, I mean, Wolf. Oh, I wish we had you longer. Five more minutes
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.920]  after the 62nd break. We'll get into the other four points. Her new book is the end of America.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.440]  Folks, this is it. They're making their move. It's not a joke. It's not a game.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.640]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.880]  So what do you do? Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.160]  biological or chemical attacks? With a little know-how, it's not that difficult. Sheltering in

[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.840]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:11.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:20.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.800]  Well, we're clearly going to get her back up for a full hour in the next few weeks,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:39.040]  and she is hot on the trail. She's learned a lot of stuff I didn't know. I've got a lot of
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.680]  stuff she didn't know. This is so big, no one person can know it all. She's a great person,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.360]  and put out a great book. You can get it at Amazon.com. Bookstores everywhere. The End of
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.640]  America. And Naomi, I'm going to send you a lot of these documents and news articles and video
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:00.160]  clips for yourself today so you can burrow deeply into the whole Nazi angle, but also send you all
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.000]  the martial law info. But it looks like you already know more than I do on that. Naomi,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.160]  continue with the other four steps. Yes, sir. Well, first of all, I'm very great. I mean,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.000]  this is just something I want to say about democracy. In a living democracy, this is exactly
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.040]  what should be happening. Citizens bring to one another the information they need to put all the
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.640]  pieces together, and don't just trust the elites or trust the regime in power to spoonfeed them
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.240]  the information. Okay, so then, infiltrate and harass citizens groups. The ACLU has many lawsuits
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.520]  noting that people are doing that right now. Every time I speak or you speak, they're likely to be
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.760]  state infiltrators, dressed like audience members, basically taking everything you're
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.120]  saying and ready to get you in trouble if they can. The seventh step is to target key
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.440]  individuals. Now, this is when you see people like Dan Rather going down because of White House
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.160]  pressure on his employer when he criticizes Bush, when you see Bill Maher lose his job,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:58.800]  when you see Valerie Plame get outed, smearing punitive retributions against people like Jessica
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.000]  Rakoff, a senior lawyer at the Justice Department who said, don't torture John Walker Linde.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.840]  She found that she was referred to the Bar Association. You've seen people in Alabama
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.440]  put in prison. They ratchet up the targeting of key individuals. Then you get restricting the
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.480]  press. You see things like Greg Palast, the author, being investigated by Homeland Security.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.160]  Oh, they put out an arrest warrant. They put out an arrest warrant until ABC got on it.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.080]  They were trying to arrest, oh yeah, whenever he went and filmed the camps down in Louisiana. Oh
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.960]  yeah, that was in the news. Homeland Security said he had exposed key infrastructure until the press
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.920]  got on it and they dropped it. Right. Well, that's super scary because at this point,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.720]  one or two or three, there can be an outcry, but when the state starts to issue arrests for
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.280]  journalists and you hear of 30 or 40 or 50, that's one of those tipping points where it's very
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:56.080]  difficult to push back. What I'm trying to stress is that a democracy doesn't close down overnight.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.800]  It closes down in a series of these tipping points. For me personally, when I read, and this
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:08.080]  is step number eight, recast criticism of espionage and dissent as treason, Bill Keller,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.320]  the executive editor of the New York Times, exposed the Swift banking story, which showed
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.360]  that the government was spying on our emails and on our phone conversations illegally. So there
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.480]  was this White House drumbeat, treason, treason, treason, prosecuted under the Espionage Act.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.680]  Well, the penalty for treason is execution. I was reading Goebbels when I read this and I got,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:35.280]  again, chills because the publisher of Izvestia in the 30s was charged with treason by Stalin
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.640]  in the third Moscow show trial and was executed for treason.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.800]  And then the last two, the last two, we got one minute.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:47.760]  Okay, okay. The last two are that you, okay, recast espionage, restrict the press,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.880]  use subvert the rule of law, and you make it easier to declare martial law. So that's where
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.800]  you get things like signing statements. The White House basically saying, I don't care that you're
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.800]  Congress. I don't care there are two other branches of government. And you get things
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.480]  like the Defense Authorization Act, which we discussed, that make it easier to declare martial
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.800]  law. You try to purge the civil service, as Goebbels did in 1933, the U.S.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.160]  And Naomi, in closing, in closing, and if you can hold over, that's fine. If you can't,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.960]  I know you probably got to go. The problem is...
