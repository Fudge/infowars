[00:00.000 --> 00:28.400]  We are now only 22 days out from the midterms.
[00:28.400 --> 00:42.080]  And the amount of disinformation in globalist psychological warfare is simply mind blowing.
[00:42.080 --> 00:44.480]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:44.480 --> 00:52.120]  You know, Variety told the truth, 60 minutes was outmatched by Trump.
[00:52.120 --> 00:57.000]  Trump bulldozed his enemies.
[00:57.000 --> 01:07.680]  And that's because they didn't heavily edit him because they know he has a pulpit to counter
[01:07.680 --> 01:08.680]  them.
[01:08.680 --> 01:14.360]  And that's why they want to censor everybody else so that when they lie about other conservatives,
[01:14.360 --> 01:17.280]  Christians, nationals, and patriots, we can't respond back.
[01:17.280 --> 01:20.840]  That's the big secret of why they wanted media platforms.
[01:20.840 --> 01:25.560]  And when enough people didn't stand up like Congress, the president stood up and said
[01:25.560 --> 01:27.920]  that was wrong.
[01:27.920 --> 01:32.880]  But when the Congress and other conservatives didn't stand up, Drudge did, Tucker Carlson
[01:32.880 --> 01:33.880]  did.
[01:33.880 --> 01:35.960]  But when others didn't stand up, it was green-lighted.
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.400]  So thousands and thousands and thousands of prominent conservative and Christian and
[01:40.400 --> 01:42.760]  nationalist groups banned off Twitter and Facebook.
[01:42.760 --> 01:45.560]  It was 800 on Thursday, thousands on Tuesday.
[01:45.560 --> 01:52.000]  But you see, the president, if you edit his comments out of context, he comes after you
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.800]  in press conferences and on Twitter.
[01:55.800 --> 02:02.200]  So now in multiple articles I saw today without even looking, so it must be a lot of criticism,
[02:02.200 --> 02:07.880]  they're mad at 60 Minutes for not showing more negative comments in association with
[02:07.880 --> 02:09.880]  what Trump had to say.
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.640]  Don't let him actually be heard, heavily edit him, and then only have him be heard when
[02:14.640 --> 02:16.520]  someone else is on there attacking him.
[02:16.520 --> 02:23.560]  You know, national studies say 93% of media coverage of the president is negative.
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.120]  When Kanye quotes that, they call him a dumb Negro on CNN.
[02:28.120 --> 02:31.320]  That's right, they said, oh, he's dumb.
[02:31.320 --> 02:32.320]  That's not true.
[02:32.320 --> 02:35.600]  Yeah, he said 90%.
[02:35.600 --> 02:37.600]  He said over 90%, it's 93.
[02:37.600 --> 02:40.640]  But so you think your audience is dumb.
[02:40.640 --> 02:43.760]  You know Kanye's not dumb, he's self-made.
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.120]  Don Lemon and other jerks, they have to work in the system and then sit there and say how
[02:48.120 --> 02:49.120]  Kanye's wrong.
[02:49.120 --> 02:51.240]  But see, Kanye has a platform too.
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.360]  He can respond back, not as much as the president.
[02:54.360 --> 02:57.560]  And I have a platform, even though they try to censor me, because if you get in the word
[02:57.560 --> 02:59.760]  out, it's blown up in their face.
[02:59.760 --> 03:00.760]  So what's going to happen next?
[03:00.760 --> 03:06.160]  Well, this right to respond is critical to everything, to be able to punch back.
[03:06.160 --> 03:10.280]  When he punches back, they say, oh, he's trying to censor us, he's going to get us killed,
[03:10.280 --> 03:11.720]  he wants the press shut down.
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.760]  He never said that.
[03:12.760 --> 03:16.600]  He said, you're fake news.
[03:16.600 --> 03:20.200]  When you lie about him every day and he responded back and you claim that's an attack on the
[03:20.200 --> 03:23.480]  First Amendment when it's mainstream corporate media pushing all the censorship.
[03:23.480 --> 03:31.960]  But again, NBC backtracks on Trump, Robert E. Lee comments, we're going to cover that
[03:31.960 --> 03:33.840]  when we come back after the first break.
[03:33.840 --> 03:40.840]  They came out and they said, yeah, he attacked Ulysses S. Grant and he sided with the South
[03:40.840 --> 03:48.400]  and anybody with half a brain could actually watch the video and see that he did the opposite.
[03:48.400 --> 03:55.640]  And so NBC had to retract because they don't have air superiority because we have the president.
[03:55.640 --> 04:03.080]  The only person to completely punch through their wall of lies become mythical like Hercules
[04:03.080 --> 04:05.760]  politically and now to be our champion.
[04:05.760 --> 04:07.080]  And that's why they want to bring him down.
[04:07.080 --> 04:09.360]  It's why there's new assassination threats.
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.000]  That's why they are so upset and lining up more fake women to come forward, more Jane
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.480]  does to lie after the midterms and the Democrats are panicking because a lot of internal polls
[04:19.480 --> 04:25.160]  show they're going to lose the midterms despite people voting in the names of dead people.
[04:25.160 --> 04:26.920]  And so they're in full panic mode right now.
[04:26.920 --> 04:32.280]  But you see, if Trump couldn't respond back, they would continue to say that he attacked
[04:32.280 --> 04:36.720]  the North and loves the South when he was transcending that.
[04:36.720 --> 04:40.880]  This is what they do, but because he could respond, they don't know what to do.
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.640]  And that's the secret of Trump getting into the White House.
[04:43.640 --> 04:45.280]  And that's why they're so scared.
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.720]  That's why they want info wars.com shutdown by the one drug report.com shutdown because
[04:49.720 --> 04:52.440]  they don't want us to be able to point out their lies.
[04:52.440 --> 04:55.240]  I know that's simple, but it's profound.
[04:55.240 --> 04:56.240]  We'll be back.
[04:56.240 --> 04:57.240]  Stay with us.
[04:57.240 --> 05:05.880]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.360]  Info wars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[05:10.360 --> 05:14.520]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.520]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[05:16.520 --> 05:19.880]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[05:19.880 --> 05:22.120]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[05:22.120 --> 05:24.840]  So we've already had incredible success.
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.720]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[05:29.720 --> 05:34.560]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you spread
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.840]  the word about our articles and videos, info wars.com, we won't just continue to stand
[05:39.840 --> 05:42.080]  up against these brutal scum bags.
[05:42.080 --> 05:43.080]  We'll win.
[05:43.080 --> 05:47.880]  We have huge sales at info wars.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping
[05:47.880 --> 05:51.360]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[05:51.360 --> 05:53.320]  and you're right to the market.
[05:53.320 --> 05:57.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the global Spain win.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  This is info wars.
[05:58.000 --> 06:26.960]  I'm Howard, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[06:26.960 --> 06:30.920]  It is Monday, the 15th day of October, 2018.
[06:30.920 --> 06:36.800]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and we are in your hands, listeners and viewers, without
[06:36.800 --> 06:42.960]  your support in the broadcast, info wars will not thrive, info wars will implode, info wars
[06:42.960 --> 06:47.720]  will be destroyed by George Soros and the giant globalist combine led by Hillary Clinton
[06:47.720 --> 06:48.720]  and Barack Obama.
[06:48.720 --> 06:53.040]  But because of your continued support and your prayers, we are here and in many ways
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.280]  we're stronger and more battle tested and battle hardened than ever.
[06:57.280 --> 07:01.440]  So I salute you all across the United States, across the world, whether you have black skin
[07:01.440 --> 07:05.800]  or white skin, whether you're Asian, whether you're in Latin America, it doesn't matter.
[07:05.800 --> 07:09.160]  If you love liberty and you love freedom, I salute you.
[07:09.160 --> 07:14.160]  Now, here's the really good news up front.
[07:14.160 --> 07:22.760]  Every election in the last two years, in France and in Germany and in Italy and in the
[07:22.760 --> 07:31.120]  Netherlands and in Sweden and in England and in Brazil and the list goes on and on, has
[07:31.120 --> 07:36.640]  gone against the globalist and against leftist and against people that want open borders
[07:36.640 --> 07:38.400]  and that want massive tax increases.
[07:38.400 --> 07:47.080]  And they had another parliamentary election and an election in Bavaria, arguably the most
[07:47.080 --> 07:52.280]  important state in Deutschland and Merkel's party completely lost.
[07:52.280 --> 07:58.280]  Now, you say she's been losing every election for two years constantly.
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.800]  Why is she still the chancellor?
[07:59.800 --> 08:06.400]  She's holding on by one little string, the globalist champion, Angela Merkel.
[08:06.400 --> 08:09.000]  Because they have more than 15 parties.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.160]  She's able with government power to buy off other parties every time she loses.
[08:14.160 --> 08:17.920]  But now her coalition is so small, this is it.
[08:17.920 --> 08:23.160]  And CNN says it might be time for Angela Merkel to go.
[08:23.160 --> 08:25.360]  They put her on the cover of Time, the cover of Newsweek.
[08:25.360 --> 08:31.120]  They worshiped her as the anti-Trump, as the woman that would vanquish him, as the woman
[08:31.120 --> 08:35.360]  that would prop up unelected globalism.
[08:35.360 --> 08:40.880]  But she just lost yesterday in Sunday's elections massively.
[08:40.880 --> 08:45.600]  Every election and the margins get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.840]  She's losing state elections.
[08:47.840 --> 08:50.080]  She's losing federal elections.
[08:50.080 --> 08:54.480]  But every time she's got government power, she's able to go buy off another party or
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.240]  buy off another coalition of smaller parties to join her coalition.
[08:59.240 --> 09:03.760]  But now she's out of gas.
[09:03.760 --> 09:06.960]  And the next federal election they have, she's gone.
[09:06.960 --> 09:13.480]  And now all there is is a giant conservative and nationalist coalition with, wait for it,
[09:13.480 --> 09:22.200]  three of the liberal and socialist and communist parties joining the conservatives and nationalists
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.360]  in wanting to keep their own pensions and not have the socialism they set up taken from
[09:27.360 --> 09:28.360]  them.
[09:28.360 --> 09:30.080]  Because globalism is beyond even socialism.
[09:30.080 --> 09:32.840]  It's taking everything from you in the final phases.
[09:32.840 --> 09:39.920]  And then bankrupting you by design to bring in full control and collapse while the EU
[09:39.920 --> 09:42.080]  bureaucracy's tax exempt.
[09:42.080 --> 09:43.080]  Think about that.
[09:43.080 --> 09:50.560]  So, and what's happened in other countries like Italy, communist and socialist voting
[09:50.560 --> 09:56.800]  with the conservatives and the right wing and the nationalist parties for a new grand
[09:56.800 --> 10:00.400]  coalition, the strongest Italy seen in 50 years.
[10:00.400 --> 10:04.040]  Oh, and it's, again, anti-New World Order.
[10:04.040 --> 10:10.240]  And you've got the president and major members of parliament quoting infowars.com.
[10:10.240 --> 10:17.320]  Let's look at Brazil, Brazil in its first round of elections out of a field of more
[10:17.320 --> 10:20.920]  than 20 people.
[10:20.920 --> 10:27.120]  The conservative nationalist Trump type pro-second amendment individual who got stabbed and almost
[10:27.120 --> 10:33.120]  murdered a month ago, won by a huge margin and is set to be winning the presidency.
[10:33.120 --> 10:35.360]  Should I continue here?
[10:35.360 --> 10:37.840]  I have a stack of this.
[10:37.840 --> 10:45.240]  So, the globalist said two years ago on the eve of the 2016 election in the Financial Times
[10:45.240 --> 10:52.600]  of London and the New York Times and Atlantic Monthly and other establishment organs that
[10:52.600 --> 10:54.240]  put out the talking points.
[10:54.240 --> 11:01.800]  They said, if Hillary loses, globalism is done.
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.960]  The authoritarian system of globalism unelected mega banks working with authoritarian regimes.
[11:05.960 --> 11:10.640]  And when she lost, they went from selling us out to China to the stay behind networks
[11:10.640 --> 11:16.920]  and the deep state groups in the Western world, literally completely rolling over to China
[11:16.920 --> 11:19.720]  and relocating there in a panic.
[11:19.720 --> 11:21.360]  They already believe they've lost.
[11:21.360 --> 11:27.200]  They're in a rearguard action, moving officially to China, Google, Apple, but hundreds of other
[11:27.200 --> 11:28.200]  big companies.
[11:28.200 --> 11:30.760]  They have just said, we want authoritarianism.
[11:30.760 --> 11:31.760]  That's it.
[11:31.760 --> 11:33.520]  You'll never have America come back.
[11:33.520 --> 11:36.160]  We're just going to China.
[11:36.160 --> 11:42.280]  And China opened up for big, evil, stinking, buzzard wings, carrion wings, and said, come
[11:42.280 --> 11:43.280]  under mommy.
[11:43.280 --> 11:53.160]  So, they're all sitting under her wings, her black wings, right now.
[11:53.160 --> 11:54.440]  And we're at war with China.
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.000]  Trump can't tell you that officially.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.480]  Coming up next segment, I'll play part of the 60 minutes interview.
[11:59.480 --> 12:05.480]  He can't tell you that because it would destroy confidence, but we're in a shooting war.
[12:05.480 --> 12:06.840]  We're in a space war.
[12:06.840 --> 12:08.120]  They're blowing up our satellites.
[12:08.120 --> 12:09.120]  We're blowing up their satellites.
[12:09.120 --> 12:11.960]  I can tell you right now, we're destroying their satellites a lot better than they're
[12:11.960 --> 12:13.560]  destroying ours.
[12:13.560 --> 12:15.720]  Space Force has been around for decades.
[12:15.720 --> 12:16.720]  Trump's just giving it a name.
[12:16.720 --> 12:23.840]  It's the military arm of NASA and Space Command and the Air Force.
[12:23.840 --> 12:25.920]  And we're in an economic war.
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.640]  And all the idiots that don't side with Trump, you're crazy.
[12:29.640 --> 12:32.560]  You see the corporate media hitting him every day.
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.880]  They said that he came out and attacked the South and hates Robert E. Lee.
[12:35.880 --> 12:36.880]  Never said it.
[12:36.880 --> 12:39.960]  Totally not true.
[12:39.960 --> 12:40.960]  That was months ago.
[12:40.960 --> 12:42.560]  They said he hated the South and hated Robert E. Lee.
[12:42.560 --> 12:45.480]  I was going back to that, memory wise, all about the free.
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.200]  Remember when they said that he secretly was recorded in the White House and that leaker
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.760]  said that he hates the South and hates dumb Southerners and thinks that the attorney
[12:55.760 --> 12:57.640]  general is a moron.
[12:57.640 --> 12:58.640]  That wasn't true.
[12:58.640 --> 12:59.640]  Turn out that was a hoax.
[12:59.640 --> 13:01.880]  Well, now they've done the opposite.
[13:01.880 --> 13:07.880]  Now they say that he is attacking Ulysses S. Grant and hates him.
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.840]  They're hitting every demographic hot button they can, but NBC had to come out because
[13:13.840 --> 13:20.120]  the president has a platform, NBC had to come out and go, okay, it's not true.
[13:20.120 --> 13:22.200]  It was praising Ulysses S. Grant.
[13:22.200 --> 13:23.360]  None of it's true folks.
[13:23.360 --> 13:24.360]  He hates black people.
[13:24.360 --> 13:25.360]  He hates women.
[13:25.360 --> 13:26.360]  He hates Jews.
[13:26.360 --> 13:27.360]  He hates the South.
[13:27.360 --> 13:28.360]  He hates the North.
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.720]  He hates the, no, he hates globalist and control freaks and anti-American scum.
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.760]  Now we're going to go to break with a fun little piece that Millie Weaver put together.
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.040]  And then when we come back, I'm going to plunge into the 60 minutes interview where
[13:42.040 --> 13:45.600]  he bulldozed over the globalist.
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.920]  And then we're also going to get into what's really happening in Saudi Arabia.
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.760]  You noticed on Friday and on Sunday, I said, evidence shows this is a false flag to embarrass
[13:54.760 --> 13:59.240]  Trump's peace deal with Saudi Arabia and keep them from reforming from the Clintons and
[13:59.240 --> 14:01.360]  from Obama.
[14:01.360 --> 14:08.600]  Trump came out today and he said that he talked to the king and the king believes it was a
[14:08.600 --> 14:12.480]  rogue killer group, not his government trying to set them up.
[14:12.480 --> 14:13.480]  Yeah.
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.360]  Why would you do that in somebody else's country on video knowing what was going on?
[14:17.360 --> 14:19.360]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.
[14:19.360 --> 14:20.360]  Please don't forget.

[18:03.580 --> 18:07.620]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[18:07.620 --> 18:10.820]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.820 --> 18:14.380]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[18:14.380 --> 18:18.900]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[18:18.900 --> 18:22.940]  researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:22.940 --> 18:26.700]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[18:26.700 --> 18:30.740]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[18:30.740 --> 18:33.860]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[18:33.860 --> 18:37.660]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:37.660 --> 18:42.020]  pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine
[18:42.020 --> 18:45.900]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[18:45.900 --> 18:47.300]  activity of triptase
[18:47.300 --> 18:51.180]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses

[20:06.380 --> 20:13.380]  the
[20:16.580 --> 20:21.420]  answer to 1984 is 1776
[20:21.420 --> 20:28.420]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:42.500 --> 20:46.300]  now I'm gonna get into Elizabeth Warren and her supposed Native American
[20:46.300 --> 20:49.780]  heritage in the next segment but the Boston
[20:49.780 --> 20:53.780]  Globe has put out a major
[20:53.780 --> 20:59.020]  retraction it turns out that she's got the lowest level of Native American blood
[20:59.020 --> 21:01.220]  probably ever found in the United States
[21:01.220 --> 21:04.620]  the average American who has any ancestry going back
[21:04.620 --> 21:09.060]  is about 1.6% Native American in DNA test but
[21:09.060 --> 21:13.300]  it turns out that she is a tiny fraction of that
[21:13.300 --> 21:17.340]  one in one comma
[21:17.340 --> 21:21.540]  024 due to a math error
[21:21.540 --> 21:24.820]  the story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestral percentage
[21:24.820 --> 21:29.140]  of a potential 10th generation relative it should be so now it's gotta be
[21:29.140 --> 21:33.540]  10th generation and now let's track back and see if her ancestors go back
[21:33.540 --> 21:37.500]  10 generations then you know it's a lie now let me explain something
[21:37.500 --> 21:40.780]  things like ancestry.com and 23andMe
[21:40.780 --> 21:44.460]  see I said I'd cover this next segment I'm already doing it
[21:44.460 --> 21:48.620]  they just for political correctness I don't know why add 6%
[21:48.620 --> 21:51.300]  African on there because they're saying the
[21:51.300 --> 21:54.660]  antecedent or the precursor or the fount of humanities
[21:54.660 --> 21:58.900]  in Africa more and more studies show that that's not
[21:58.900 --> 22:03.100]  really true but that messes up their whole model there are large groups of
[22:03.100 --> 22:05.700]  people in Asia and other places that have no connection
[22:05.700 --> 22:09.140]  to Africa being the supposed seat of humanity
[22:09.140 --> 22:12.740]  it is true that a lot of the genetics one of the Middle East and other areas are
[22:12.740 --> 22:13.700]  out of Africa but
[22:13.700 --> 22:17.020]  what I'm getting at is these boilerplate type deals
[22:17.020 --> 22:22.900]  are are are very politically correct Elizabeth Warren ladies and gentlemen
[22:22.900 --> 22:26.380]  you have to understand anyone with Asian blood
[22:26.380 --> 22:31.020]  is also a match for Native American you don't see the average Mexican walking
[22:31.020 --> 22:33.220]  around saying I'm a native tribes person
[22:33.220 --> 22:36.860]  okay but again they are
[22:36.860 --> 22:41.100]  have large percentages of what you call Native American blood
[22:41.100 --> 22:44.420]  which is exactly the same as Japanese
[22:44.420 --> 22:48.020]  or Chinese or Korean. It's the same blood
[22:48.020 --> 22:52.620]  it's the same people that came across they believe the land bridge
[22:52.620 --> 22:56.580]  when at times when all of the North Poles completely frozen
[22:56.580 --> 22:59.740]  across which it still does sometimes today
[22:59.740 --> 23:02.980]  and it's it's regardless DNA
[23:02.980 --> 23:06.900]  it's let me just cover it now I'll get to it next segment I'll get into Trump
[23:06.900 --> 23:11.060]  bulldozing his enemies next segment but this is just insane
[23:11.060 --> 23:14.300]  now she's demanding that drudge
[23:14.300 --> 23:17.180]  pay up stories on drudge
[23:17.180 --> 23:20.860]  great great great grandmother Warren tells
[23:20.860 --> 23:24.060]  Trump to pay up yes Matt drudge is not Native American either
[23:24.060 --> 23:27.580]  he needs to pay up or Elizabeth Warren wants him to pay up I'm teleprompter for
[23:27.580 --> 23:28.100]  you folks
[23:28.100 --> 23:32.620]  great great great grandmother Warren tells Trump to pay up drudgereport.com
[23:32.620 --> 23:35.980]  and then it links through the article right there but I have
[23:35.980 --> 23:39.460]  the Boston Globe here and I have the last minute
[23:39.460 --> 23:44.020]  of the five-minute little propaganda piece they put out
[23:44.020 --> 23:47.020]  making front of Trump and then we've got President Trump
[23:47.020 --> 23:50.060]  responding to that but but now they're saying
[23:50.060 --> 23:53.540]  I do the math right here that she has
[23:53.540 --> 23:59.140]  10 times less the Native American blood than she'd previously said in the
[23:59.140 --> 23:59.660]  report
[23:59.660 --> 24:04.980]  and they've got this leftist professor DNA expert that says that she's
[24:04.980 --> 24:08.460]  looking at the DNA
[24:08.460 --> 24:12.500]  and that it's an eighth generation back but now they're saying
[24:12.500 --> 24:17.940]  oh we're sorry tenth generation back so for all intents and purposes ladies and
[24:17.940 --> 24:18.500]  gentlemen
[24:18.500 --> 24:22.260]  President Trump is correct that this woman
[24:22.260 --> 24:26.620]  is not Native American she could not be in one of the Native American tribes
[24:26.620 --> 24:30.860]  you've got to be what like 16 percent and
[24:30.860 --> 24:33.980]  she's been caught in another galactic level fraud
[24:33.980 --> 24:37.100]  but let's go ahead and see the last minute of Warren's little
[24:37.100 --> 24:40.540]  propaganda piece. I'm not enrolled in a tribe
[24:40.540 --> 24:44.460]  and only tribes determine tribal citizenship I understand
[24:44.460 --> 24:47.540]  and respect that distinction but my family history
[24:47.540 --> 24:50.900]  is my family history. Who Pocahontas?
[24:50.900 --> 24:55.820]  This isn't just about casual racism war hoops and tomahawk chops
[24:55.820 --> 24:59.460]  Native communities have faced discrimination, neglect
[24:59.460 --> 25:04.500]  and violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants about me
[25:04.500 --> 25:07.940]  but mocking Native Americans or any group
[25:07.940 --> 25:12.620]  in order to try to get at me that's not what America stands for
[25:12.620 --> 25:16.820]  some people have questioned my heritage and my family history
[25:16.820 --> 25:21.300]  maybe they do it to insult me maybe they do it to distract from the kinds of
[25:21.300 --> 25:22.860]  changes I'm fighting for
[25:22.860 --> 25:25.740]  and the kind of change I'm trying to bring to Washington
[25:25.740 --> 25:29.900]  maybe they do it because they think politics is a blood sport
[25:29.900 --> 25:34.340]  but my parents were real people the love they shared
[25:34.340 --> 25:38.660]  the struggles they endured the family they built the story they lived
[25:38.660 --> 25:42.580]  will always be etched on my heart and no one
[25:42.580 --> 25:46.300]  not even the president of the United States will ever
[25:46.300 --> 25:51.860]  take it away from me
[25:51.860 --> 25:56.020]  so this is a sick joke from geneticists because they know
[25:56.020 --> 26:00.340]  that most Europeans you can go to Europe and go find a German family
[26:00.340 --> 26:03.580]  that has nothing but German ancestry going back thousands of years
[26:03.580 --> 26:06.340]  you test their blood they're gonna have more Native American blood
[26:06.340 --> 26:10.220]  and Elizabeth Warren because Asiatic blood came into the area
[26:10.220 --> 26:15.220]  the Muslims invaded who are part Asian on average Arabs are part African
[26:15.220 --> 26:19.660]  part Anglo and part Asian that's that's what Arabs
[26:19.660 --> 26:23.980]  basic genetic background is generally and some people are white or some people
[26:23.980 --> 26:24.580]  are darker
[26:24.580 --> 26:27.540]  you look at the Saudi royal family some people look like they're black
[26:27.540 --> 26:31.460]  because they are they're like half African some look like they're
[26:31.460 --> 26:34.980]  as white as I am that's how the genetics work
[26:34.980 --> 26:39.020]  with the East and the South the South being Africa the East being Asia
[26:39.020 --> 26:42.940]  meeting the Ice Age populations of Anglos
[26:42.940 --> 26:46.500]  Caucasians the Caucasus Mountains is where the
[26:46.500 --> 26:50.060]  Caucasians basically start and end so
[26:50.060 --> 26:54.580]  you can go test anybody and they're gonna have little genetic
[26:54.580 --> 27:00.660]  pieces of this and that unless they are a Sub-Saharan African
[27:00.660 --> 27:04.540]  like the pygmy tribe they've tested pygmies blood
[27:04.540 --> 27:09.140]  and it's 100% African and it's even that tribe
[27:09.140 --> 27:12.820]  only because they've been isolated for eons in that area
[27:12.820 --> 27:17.140]  and because they've been isolated and inbreeding in things they're also very
[27:17.140 --> 27:17.660]  short
[27:17.660 --> 27:22.180]  very little I've read the books about that very very interesting but the whole
[27:22.180 --> 27:22.780]  point is
[27:22.780 --> 27:26.860]  is that this is absolute
[27:26.860 --> 27:30.980]  pure bull total complete hoax as usual
[27:30.980 --> 27:35.660]  and now they're saying oh sorry we estimated that she was way more Native
[27:35.660 --> 27:37.580]  American where she had one drop
[27:37.580 --> 27:42.180]  of Native American blood basically now it's one tenth of that or one
[27:42.180 --> 27:48.620]  one twenty four thousands is that how you say it? So here it should be
[27:48.620 --> 27:53.700]  this is the Boston Globe document cam shot please
[27:53.700 --> 27:57.980]  it should be one one
[27:57.980 --> 28:01.780]  zero two four one in one thousand twenty-fourths
[28:01.780 --> 28:06.620]  my goodness Shetze that'd be like saying yeah my dog's a pit bull
[28:06.620 --> 28:10.300]  it's one one twenty four thousandth and you're like
[28:10.300 --> 28:12.980]  your dog's a chihuahua you're like no that's a pit bull
[28:12.980 --> 28:18.100]  I mean you've got Elizabeth Warren's cracker
[28:18.100 --> 28:23.020]  ass leftist butt that is obsessed with being something other than white
[28:23.020 --> 28:25.940]  she gets into major colleges she gets all these
[28:25.940 --> 28:29.100]  scholarships saying that she's Pocahontas
[28:29.100 --> 28:32.820]  and the fact is she's a fraud and the fact is she made it up
[28:32.820 --> 28:38.740]  I mean she dances around the fire at night and gets the peace pipe and smokes it
[28:38.740 --> 28:42.700]  it's unbelievable

[31:56.380 --> 32:03.380]  change our bodies with Z Shield InfoWarsLive.com living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[32:03.380 --> 32:08.020]  the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the
[32:08.020 --> 32:12.860]  Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[32:12.860 --> 32:18.380]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[32:18.380 --> 32:23.380]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[32:23.380 --> 32:28.980]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[32:28.980 --> 32:34.100]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[32:34.100 --> 32:38.380]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[32:38.380 --> 32:43.660]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[32:43.660 --> 32:49.660]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[32:49.660 --> 32:53.900]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[32:53.900 --> 33:00.940]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[33:00.940 --> 33:19.620]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:30.940 --> 33:47.100]  I'm a little bit late getting into the studio and I apologize we're just
[33:47.100 --> 33:52.300]  laughing our butts off at Elizabeth Warren if you just joined us can we put
[33:52.300 --> 33:58.340]  her tweet back up on screen please for viewers she is now challenged President
[33:58.340 --> 34:03.380]  Trump to pay up the one million dollars that he promised if she could prove that
[34:03.380 --> 34:09.020]  she was an Indian well Trump knows full well you've got to be 16% for the tribes
[34:09.020 --> 34:15.180]  to accept you some tribes will do it for for something like 13% and so she came
[34:15.180 --> 34:21.140]  out and she said I am ready I am a Native American it has been proven and so
[34:21.140 --> 34:26.860]  they had this liberal genetics professor say that they looked at her DNA and that
[34:26.860 --> 34:32.780]  eight generations ago she may have had a grandparent that had some Native
[34:32.780 --> 34:38.940]  American there it is by the way at real Donald Trump remember saying on 75 that
[34:38.940 --> 34:42.580]  you give a million to charity of my choice in my DNA showed Native American
[34:42.580 --> 34:47.900]  ancestry I remember and here's the verdict please send the check to the
[34:47.900 --> 34:54.820]  National Indigenous Women's Resource Center N I W R C dot org Warren reveals
[34:54.820 --> 35:00.140]  test confirming ancestry well that was the Boston Globe this morning a few
[35:00.140 --> 35:09.540]  hours later they had to retract and it goes on to say ladies and gentlemen that
[35:09.540 --> 35:15.060]  it's 10 generations ago and due to a math error a story about Elizabeth Warren
[35:15.060 --> 35:20.220]  misstated the ancestral percentage of a potential 10th generation relative it
[35:20.220 --> 35:31.340]  should be one in 1024 so it's less than a drop of blood out of the 192 ounces
[35:31.340 --> 35:34.780]  that are in the human body and we've done the math here ladies and gentlemen a
[35:34.780 --> 35:43.340]  world-exclusive 192 ounces of blood in the average body Warren's blood according
[35:43.340 --> 35:46.260]  to what the Boston Globe is now saying with you Dennis this has changed their
[35:46.260 --> 35:57.500]  story 0.1875 less than half a drop oh man that's funny and it gets even more
[35:57.500 --> 36:04.900]  funny there aren't any Europeans in all of the hunn invasions and Islamic
[36:04.900 --> 36:08.900]  invasions that are called mongrels that that's what they call themselves but it
[36:08.900 --> 36:15.220]  means half white half Asian that we get the term that person's a mongrel it's
[36:15.220 --> 36:20.220]  become a insult a pejorative it's not you know the Huns and all that some were
[36:20.220 --> 36:24.140]  mongrels and they invaded the Chinese and they invaded they tried to invade
[36:24.140 --> 36:27.780]  Japan and they invaded the Middle East and they invaded Rome and they invaded
[36:27.780 --> 36:33.420]  Eastern Europe and Western Europe they invaded invaded and they raped and also
[36:33.420 --> 36:37.340]  there were people that came there as tradesmen and there was the spice trade
[36:37.340 --> 36:42.540]  going back thousands of years so there aren't any Europeans that don't have a
[36:42.540 --> 36:47.100]  fraction of Native American blood because Asian is the same as Native
[36:47.100 --> 36:53.100]  American it's Asian but it has this mystique to be part Native American
[36:53.100 --> 37:01.460]  because then you get to be a victim and feel sorry for yourself even though I
[37:01.460 --> 37:05.860]  had ancestors there wasn't just one trail of tears there were a bunch with
[37:05.860 --> 37:11.060]  Midwestern Native Americans being taken out of Texas out of Oklahoma out of the
[37:11.060 --> 37:16.500]  Dakotas and shipped to military camps shipped to Florida and my dad's like
[37:16.500 --> 37:21.180]  yeah you know and then my grandmother you know when they she came back from
[37:21.180 --> 37:26.100]  from the camps out in Florida when she was a little girl when she was a young
[37:26.100 --> 37:31.100]  woman and then I'm like oh really let's go look at the ancestry here dad and then
[37:31.100 --> 37:37.180]  there it is but it's still a tiny amount because his grandmother was half
[37:37.180 --> 37:44.940]  Native American so that made his father 25 percent so that made him 13 percent so
[37:44.940 --> 37:49.220]  that makes me and I'm gonna go ahead and get my DNA done I did it once but I
[37:49.220 --> 37:52.660]  misunderstood at the medical office it was a DNA test about what I absorb and
[37:52.660 --> 37:57.460]  what I don't absorb in a really complex big long report so I just said okay
[37:57.460 --> 38:00.540]  you're taking my blood doing my liver work you know a few years ago you know
[38:00.540 --> 38:03.580]  checking all my other stuff my heart and all that go ahead you know do the
[38:03.580 --> 38:07.260]  thousand dollar complex test I thought well that's expensive always send to a
[38:07.260 --> 38:11.100]  special lab then I get the report and it's all about what I absorb what I don't
[38:11.100 --> 38:14.500]  absorb the doctor thought with my northern European genetics that I would
[38:14.500 --> 38:18.540]  have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 it was true it was all this you know crazy
[38:18.540 --> 38:25.340]  stuff my DNA my RNA RNA is a virus my mitochondrial activities at a hundred
[38:25.340 --> 38:29.580]  percent that's very rare very high-level energy there in the cells but they
[38:29.580 --> 38:35.540]  predicted that as well but it was all there in the testing so I'm gonna take
[38:35.540 --> 38:41.380]  the quickest most respected test and again that's kind of a misnomer the
[38:41.380 --> 38:46.100]  quicker the test the least clear they are but I'm gonna get a good test that's
[38:46.100 --> 38:49.940]  the quickest at the same time I'm gonna find the kind of a happy medium between
[38:49.940 --> 38:54.580]  those and I'm gonna do a test to see how much more Pocahontas than I am than
[38:54.580 --> 38:58.140]  Pocahontas because I mean I know I'm part Pocahontas I mean I know that for a
[38:58.140 --> 39:04.140]  fact but it's just crazy to see the levels that she's gone through to do
[39:04.140 --> 39:07.700]  this but it also illustrates how these people operate I mean they could get a
[39:07.700 --> 39:12.300]  bunch of women they go falsely accused Kavanaugh and all the witnesses said
[39:12.300 --> 39:17.300]  there was no evidence and none of it ever happened what are they gonna do now
[39:17.300 --> 39:22.820]  to try to give Trump a black eye and make him look stupid make him look bad
[39:22.820 --> 39:29.460]  they'll do anything but here's the big takeaway we've done the math it's all
[39:29.460 --> 39:37.220]  admitted that Pocahontas is not Pocahontas and that she has less than
[39:37.220 --> 39:44.820]  half a drop of her 192 ounces you use that non-technical situation and again
[39:44.820 --> 39:50.220]  ladies and gentlemen here's another article Warren mocked over DNA test
[39:50.220 --> 39:56.660]  showing at least point zero zero one Native American heritage average
[39:56.660 --> 40:00.540]  American European has double the Native American genome as Warner according to
[40:00.540 --> 40:09.060]  New York Times so she is a thoroughbred white person she is the opposite this is
[40:09.060 --> 40:17.620]  Pocahontas this is not this this is not this is what Pocahontas looks like very
[40:17.620 --> 40:21.380]  very pretty by the way you know Savannah looks like Pocahontas never thought of
[40:21.380 --> 40:25.540]  that one of the great folks that works here at the office but she does not look
[40:25.540 --> 40:31.180]  like Elizabeth Warren also known as Cracker Butt because there's nothing
[40:31.180 --> 40:37.620]  weirder than a leftist virtue signaling that they are a minority when they aren't
[40:37.620 --> 40:44.380]  so let's continue here wow this is a big article on infowars.com I'm
[40:44.380 --> 40:49.060]  glad that the crew is working on this as fast as I am or faster samples from
[40:49.060 --> 40:53.940]  Mexico Peru and Columbia to stand in for Native American Hollywood actor James
[40:53.940 --> 40:57.820]  Woods noted an important paragraph in the Boston Globe story which said the
[40:57.820 --> 41:04.100]  professor who conducted the test use samples from Mexico Peru Columbia to
[41:04.100 --> 41:10.140]  stand in for Native American oh because you see it is all the same thing the
[41:10.140 --> 41:16.620]  actual facts are that a non-commercial tester Carlos Bustamante deduced that
[41:16.620 --> 41:26.940]  Warren was between 1 32 to 1 512 Colombian Peruvian or Mexican the death
[41:26.940 --> 41:32.500]  of Native American DNA prompted the examiner to use those national markers
[41:32.500 --> 41:38.940]  based on migration theory so this actually holds up what I'm saying because
[41:38.940 --> 41:45.660]  that's that's where everybody came from it's not a theory it's a fact that they've
[41:45.660 --> 41:51.060]  dug up dead Eskimos in Alaska and they've tested them right next to Chinese
[41:51.060 --> 41:57.300]  blood and they're most related to ancient Chinese which are really a
[41:57.300 --> 42:03.900]  different group in the Chinese today because civilization makes you get
[42:03.900 --> 42:08.340]  weak the but but that's a whole other side of you I'm gonna stop now I've
[42:08.340 --> 42:12.180]  already spent too much time on this it's very interesting Elizabeth Warren is a
[42:12.180 --> 42:15.300]  complete liar we're gonna come back and get right into Trump bulldozing him on
[42:15.300 --> 42:19.260]  60 minutes how they're panicking what really happened in Saudi Arabia why is
[42:19.260 --> 42:22.140]  it the biggest story in the world what's the news behind the news Steve
[42:22.140 --> 42:26.540]  Pachinic formerly in psychological operations the Pentagon the CIA and the
[42:26.540 --> 42:30.580]  State Department high-level he's run regime change he's run camp David
[42:30.580 --> 42:35.180]  Accords he's helped found Delta Force he's a smart cookie I don't know his view
[42:35.180 --> 42:38.580]  on this yet but we'll get his take I think everything points towards a false
[42:38.580 --> 42:42.980]  flag that he stabilized the peace deal Trump's trying to form with the kingdom
[42:42.980 --> 42:47.620]  of Saudi Arabia for the reforms we've seen and that it's a blatant deep-state
[42:47.620 --> 42:52.300]  operation but we'll get his take on that and more stay with us info wars.com

[47:00.980 --> 47:11.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:30.980 --> 47:49.340]  my head is spinning ladies and gentlemen the Boston Globe less than six
[47:49.340 --> 47:53.260]  hours after publishing their Elizabeth Warren piece saying that she is part
[47:53.260 --> 47:58.380]  Native American confirming her ancestry has retracted it and said that she has
[47:58.380 --> 48:04.380]  amongst the lowest level of non-white blood of anyone in the United States in
[48:04.380 --> 48:09.900]  fact she's so pure-blooded that they're actually now reporting a lot of major
[48:09.900 --> 48:16.180]  ancestry sites other places that whoever put out these results is being
[48:16.180 --> 48:20.900]  deceptive and didn't know what they were doing in fact it's also being pointed
[48:20.900 --> 48:25.500]  out that anybody can spit in a Petri dish or in one of these collection boxes
[48:25.500 --> 48:29.180]  in mail it in I mean I could get somebody's Native American to do it and
[48:29.180 --> 48:35.100]  show them you know a hundred percent Native American but instead the numbers
[48:35.100 --> 48:39.740]  are simply incredible so we've got chain of custody here but then we've got the
[48:39.740 --> 48:43.180]  fact that they're saying she's part Native American when the test results
[48:43.180 --> 48:52.060]  itself show that it's one out of 1,000 point zero two four and that this lady
[48:52.060 --> 48:59.340]  is more white than Hitler I mean this woman is more white than Dolph Lundgren
[48:59.340 --> 49:04.220]  Arnold Schwarzenegger she's more white than somebody from Iceland from Raikia
[49:04.220 --> 49:12.020]  vet by the way I'm gonna get my DNA test out I'm gonna get I had it done I
[49:12.020 --> 49:15.500]  thought it was for my background shows how busy I am they're like hey what a
[49:15.500 --> 49:19.780]  DNA test yeah sure yeah we're doing with blood these are the really
[49:19.780 --> 49:24.180]  sophisticated ones and then it turns out it's this total genetic typing which is
[49:24.180 --> 49:30.380]  useful information a 45 page report I have but still it's just crazy so I'm
[49:30.380 --> 49:34.660]  gonna get the regular one done because I can't wait to publish that because we
[49:34.660 --> 49:40.220]  did the math we just joined us there's a hundred ninety two ounces of blood in the
[49:40.220 --> 49:45.140]  average person's body and we published the results on infowars.com that she
[49:45.140 --> 49:51.300]  has less than half a drop if you equated it to just the amount of blood in her
[49:51.300 --> 49:57.260]  body so there you go she could pass a German racial purity test that almost
[49:57.260 --> 50:00.860]  no one could pass she could have been the head of the SS she could have been
[50:00.860 --> 50:05.740]  Heinrich Himmler.
[50:05.740 --> 50:16.860]  Only the most superior pure blood can be in charge of the operations did you notice she looks surprisingly like a Hitler the truth is she is the
[50:16.860 --> 50:23.780]  granddaughter of the Fuhrer as is Merkel they are working together to return the
[50:23.780 --> 50:29.300]  Reich to its proper place in global domination through the plan of the
[50:29.300 --> 50:36.180]  Fuhrer the European Union a project hatched by his superior intellect that will soon be
[50:36.180 --> 50:42.860]  revisited upon America. Now I'm being sarcastic this is called satire but this
[50:42.860 --> 50:49.220]  scenario has a better chance of her actually being related to Pocahontas.
[50:49.300 --> 50:53.820]  Think about the magnitude of that okay I am blowing the whole show here on this
[50:53.820 --> 51:03.780]  but it is fine I'm sorry the articles on infowars.com Jamie White did it we
[51:03.780 --> 51:11.380]  should really add the point here that evidence is mounting this whole thing
[51:11.380 --> 51:15.460]  is a fraud because they put out one number and it turns out she's got ten
[51:15.460 --> 51:20.140]  times less than that incredibly tiny number
[51:20.140 --> 51:25.580]  and this is what it boils down to my buddy sent me a text right as I was
[51:25.580 --> 51:30.820]  thinking it Liz Warren's DNA test likely a hoax no controlled custody of us alive
[51:30.820 --> 51:37.180]  a test anybody can spit in a tube and mail it off absurdly easy to fake oh but
[51:37.180 --> 51:41.340]  the Democrats they wouldn't fake anything they're just the biggest pack of
[51:41.340 --> 51:47.860]  liars the planet's ever seen okay I'm gonna stop right there I have Trump
[51:47.860 --> 51:51.300]  destroying them on 60 minutes a bunch of clips I want to get to where he says
[51:51.300 --> 51:58.500]  China is the main threat I've got incredible news out of Europe and really
[51:58.500 --> 52:05.100]  good news I want to get to I've got the latest almost really happening in Saudi
[52:05.100 --> 52:09.940]  Arabia how the secret service fold an assassination plot against Trump by
[52:09.940 --> 52:15.020]  ISIS I want to get into that ISIS has ordered more truck attack and more
[52:15.020 --> 52:18.300]  stabbing attacks last month where seeing so many and the media then covers up
[52:18.300 --> 52:24.500]  who's doing it even even they take credit they're also planning more mass
[52:24.500 --> 52:29.940]  shooting attacks what they did in Vegas but that got covered up they tried to
[52:29.940 --> 52:33.860]  blame it on the American people you also have Alec Baldwin saying we need to
[52:33.860 --> 52:39.860]  overthrow the government that's out of the union leader so this is the hype and
[52:39.860 --> 52:45.780]  this is the lawlessness and this is the level of danger that we're dealing with
[52:45.780 --> 52:51.620]  here as they try to bring this country into a civil emergency and then when
[52:51.620 --> 52:55.100]  their minions go out and shoot and kill and stab people and block traffic and
[52:55.100 --> 53:02.380]  bomb people they have the mayor of Portland Ted Wheeler comes out and
[53:02.380 --> 53:10.900]  stands by decision to quote allow Antifa to block traffic burn American flags
[53:10.900 --> 53:21.100]  and then on top of it attack the pet the fourth prayer rally they just had this
[53:21.100 --> 53:36.340]  weekend so that's the level of
[53:40.180 --> 53:48.420]  rioting and unlawfulness that we see coming out of these individuals but the
[53:48.420 --> 53:59.900]  goodness is humanity is waking up to all of it very very very very very quickly so
[53:59.900 --> 54:03.060]  that's just some of what we're going to be covering in the next hour we have
[54:03.060 --> 54:08.500]  Dr. Steve Pacinic joining us who always has a lot of really really thought
[54:08.500 --> 54:12.940]  provoking inside intel because I'm like you I'm like who cares what happens in
[54:12.940 --> 54:17.420]  Saudi Arabia or Turkey well all this movement deals with a plan to destabilize
[54:17.420 --> 54:23.060]  the Middle East and derail President Trump's attempts to reform the Middle
[54:23.060 --> 54:28.340]  East and in the strategy of tension in the strategy of conflict and actually
[54:28.340 --> 54:33.300]  bring real peace to the area and the way this was all done points towards a
[54:33.300 --> 54:37.700]  false flag in my view to set up the Saudi royal family and keep them from
[54:37.700 --> 54:42.660]  reforming but we'll get Steve Pacinic's take on that I said yesterday and on
[54:42.660 --> 54:46.420]  Friday that I thought Evans pointed towards it being a false flag now the
[54:46.420 --> 54:52.780]  president says he talked to the king this morning and he said that he he
[54:52.780 --> 55:01.460]  absolutely does not take responsibility and that they believe that rogue groups
[55:01.460 --> 55:09.980]  rogue killers were involved and not the government so we will get to all of that
[55:09.980 --> 55:13.860]  when we start the next hour and a ton of other clips I've not gotten to yet please
[55:13.860 --> 55:18.060]  remember the globalists are doing everything they can to shut this
[55:18.060 --> 55:21.860]  broadcast down to kick us off the internet to demonize us to sue us to lie
[55:21.860 --> 55:27.580]  about us but because you've stood with us we're still here and reaching a lot of
[55:27.580 --> 55:31.460]  new people on TV and radio and the broadcast is expanded there so they
[55:31.460 --> 55:34.980]  censor is one place it only spreads to another so thank you all for what

[55:55.300 --> 55:58.380]  payment processors they go look at who we're using then they call them they
[55:58.380 --> 56:02.400]  harass them they threaten them they lie about us and they claim that we're
[56:02.400 --> 56:06.780]  harassing people online so that's why George Soros Democrat groups then say
[56:06.780 --> 56:12.060]  I must be taken off the internet well as soon as they get sued here very soon
[56:12.060 --> 56:15.060]  we'll get all the discovery and you will be able to prove who's doing the real

[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.580]  all right coming up I'm gonna be judicious I'm gonna be focused I'm gonna
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:31.100]  be fast-moving I've got it 20 clips or more I want to get to NBC's had to
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:35.020]  retract admit that Trump did not demonize Robert E. Lee he praised him
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.700]  that's a big retraction they've had to retract that Warren is even has any
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.420]  Native American blood I mean she has the lowest amount ever discovered I mean
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:48.060]  it's like everyone has some reportedly and but then and none can be found and
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.060]  we're gonna get into him bulldozing 60 minutes that's coming up but first
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:56.580]  freedom of the press is on death watch freedom of the press is taking a beating
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:01.140]  worldwide in 2018 while American independent media is under a full-on
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.100]  attack the likes of which has never been seen before in American history the
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.900]  vague moniker of fake news is being used to imprison and even murder journalists
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:17.700]  Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud he's a 33 year old crime prince that
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:23.300]  they are pushing to the limit he's cleaning up that country because that
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.300]  country is despicable that country has had some major problems and he's made it
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:32.060]  clear that he's gonna clean it up so what better thing to do is then just throw
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:38.700]  a wrench into the works it's sabotage it's a problem it has a lot to do with
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:43.420]  the mid-term elections we're not happy about it we're really not happy about
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:51.380]  it what could be said about Jamal Ahmed cash Shoghi that hasn't already been
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:57.100]  said about Seth Rich it's it's a big problem the story he was working on
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:01.300]  proves the motivation these these are the type of stories that gets info
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:05.420]  wars deep platform in Myanmar while investigating a massacre of Rohingya
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.940]  Muslims two Reuters journalists while loan and kiosk so we're imprisoned for
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.380]  seven years under an ancient law known as the official secrets act now revamped
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:21.860]  under the guise of fake news under section 505 B of the Myanmar penal code a
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.660]  colonial era law banning publication of incorrect information that could cause
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.140]  fear or alarm to the public the Myanmar government is attempting to cover up
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.060]  evidence of ethnic cleansing and severe human rights abuses so you do agree that
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.140]  there were more Republicans and Democrats I didn't say that but I I do I do
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:46.140]  well you can't have it both ways sir it's either 5050 or one side is
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.300]  disproportionately affected and the allegation is that that more Republicans
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.700]  were affected well we don't always have the best methods to determine who is a
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:01.820]  Republican who is a Democrat do you discriminate more on philosophy like
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:09.260]  anti-conservative versus pro-liberal no our policies and our algorithms don't
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:14.540]  take into consideration any affiliation philosophy or viewpoint that's hard to
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:20.620]  stomach I'm not I just there wouldn't we wouldn't be having this discussion if
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:27.220]  there wasn't a general agreement that that your company has discriminated
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:34.660]  against conservatives most of whom happen to be Republic but I believe that we
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.700]  have found impartial outcomes and those are what we intend to fix and continue
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:43.620]  to measure and back in America social media overlords Jack Dorsey and Mark

[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:28.700]  dr. Steve Pachennick joins us on what's really happening in Saudi Arabia to give
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.860]  us his expert take on that a lot of evidence points towards this being a
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:40.580]  false flag an inside job and the president has come out and said that he
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:44.380]  talked to the king this morning he did want to elaborate on what he said but
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.940]  that basically he said that he believed that this was a rogue group of killers
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.460]  clearly meant to set up the Saudi regime while they're trying to reform and fix
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:56.260]  things and who doesn't want peace in the area the globalist the deep staters
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:00.760]  they want the strategy of tension just spoke the king of Saudi Arabia who
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:06.260]  denies any knowledge whatsoever may have happened to our Saudi Arabian
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.660]  citizen he said that they are working closely with Turkey to find an answer I
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:15.420]  am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with the king who's buying
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.220]  hundreds of billions of dollars of equipment from us but more importantly
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:23.700]  who's liberalizing for women to be able to drive women to be able to be have
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.580]  jobs they're really moving in the right direction and they've promised to stop
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:32.020]  arming al-qaeda and ISIS we'll break it down next hour but here's the president
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:37.340]  before he took off and in the helicopter this morning I just spoke with the king
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:43.980]  of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of what took place with regard to as he
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:51.860]  said his Saudi Arabian citizen I've asked and he firmly denied that I've
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:57.420]  asked the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately get on a plane go to
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:04.380]  Saudi Arabia go to other places if necessary which he probably will but
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:10.140]  with regard to this go to Turkey if necessary the king told me that Turkey
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:16.900]  and Saudi Arabia are working hand-in-hand very closely on getting to the bottom of
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:24.020]  what happens so we'll see what happens but Mike Pompeo excuse me Mike Pompeo is
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:31.940]  leaving literally within an hour or so he's heading to Saudi Arabia we are
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:37.100]  going to leave nothing uncovered with that being said the king firmly denied
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:43.660]  any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get into his
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:49.500]  mind but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers who
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.900]  knows we're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon but his was a
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:10:00.220]  flat denial so there you go and the word I got from high-level Pentagon sources
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:04.460]  last week and then the guest we had on yesterday separately called me and
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.540]  confirmed from his sources and and he had lunch and play golf with some top
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.180]  generals who were actively involved in intelligence that they're saying this
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:17.100]  is a way to derail Trump and the peace deal because Obama doesn't want to have
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:22.220]  a peace deal with Iran terminated basically so he wants to get the peace
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.340]  deal with Saudi Arabia to stop the stabilizing they want to have that shut
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:33.540]  down so that the region stays in massive turmoil so there is the key report on
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.340]  that front
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:47.500]  but the first thing I want to go ahead and get to here now before I go to
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.380]  break and come back and I'm gonna do the whole 16 minutes pieces from the
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:58.460]  president no critical those are the first thing I'm gonna get to here is this
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:05.660]  piece dims third string defeated by make America great again another key John
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:09.260]  bound report we're gonna go to this report here in just a moment we're gonna

[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:18.900]  told you would because what Trump says coming up is so critical for Americans
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.020]  to understand it if we can't get this and if we can't understand what he's
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:28.380]  saying about China we don't have a hope in hell but if we do we have a very good
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.660]  shot at turning this around and defeating the globalist so I'm gonna get
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:36.060]  focused again and I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna cover these key clips stay
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:41.380]  with us President Trump spoke to a sea of red hats on the campus of Eastern
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.340]  Kentucky University in Richmond Kentucky combating these words from former
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:53.620]  vice president Joe Biden this time they not you have an ally in the White House
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:59.420]  this time they have an ally there are small percentage of the American people
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:07.380]  virulent people some of them the dregs of society and instead of using a full
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:13.860]  might of the executive branch to secure justice dignity safety for all the
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:20.820]  president uses the White House as a literal literal bully pulpit and to
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:26.460]  make sure that America's extraordinary come back we want to make sure it
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:34.580]  continues full speed ahead we don't want Democrats that are coming from a
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:39.020]  different place we don't want them getting an office all they'll do is
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:47.340]  obstruct under Republican leadership America is booming it's thriving
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:57.860]  America is winning again because we are finally putting America first
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:08.420]  simultaneously Biden was in Indiana stumping as the last resort for the
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.860]  Democratic Party Hillary and Barack seemed to have disappeared from the
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:16.580]  campaign trail as Hillary is promoting incivility and Barack had been
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:21.860]  promoting himself as usual falsely claiming the current economic boom was
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.980]  all his own doing but there was Biden pushing the same propaganda the rest of
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:46.980]  the party had been clinging to
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:05.060]  they see a president who has debased the values in seated global leadership to
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:11.900]  tireless and thugs taking the word taking the word of a dictator like
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:18.740]  Putin over our intelligence services exchanging exchange what he calls love
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:24.340]  letters with a murderer Kim Jong-un in North Korea praising dictators and
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.660]  autocrats heads of state in China Turkey the Philippines but the same time
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:37.580]  castigating our allies the Democratic Party is clearly on its last leg
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:42.500]  placing their hopes on unscathed newcomers their socialist message
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:47.500]  soldiering on blind to Trump's achievements and death to the average
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:54.420]  Americans demands I want people to come into our country on a merit based

[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:38.720]  coming up next segment. Macron says that Africa is now the epicenter of France and the French
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:45.800]  speaking world. They should accept 200 million African migrants in the next 20 years to France.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:53.960]  That would mean that France was two-thirds African. It's called economic cultural domination using
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.840]  Third World Weapon. That's an M4s.com story next segment. We're covering it. Then speak of the
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.240]  devil. Maybe I'll just immigrate to Africa. Well, the communist leader there vows to take
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:12.560]  more white farmers land. Even people that recently bought their land. They're just gonna take it.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.160]  But that's okay because only white people can be racist or tribal. Of course, that's a total lie.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.120]  And when they're led by multinational corporations, any group becomes lawless and evil when they're
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.400]  told to behave like that. Very, very deadly, dangerous what the globalists are doing. That's
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.400]  the start of the next segment. Right now, I've been talking about it, but here's the video.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:39.080]  Even Variety magazine got it right. 60 Minutes was outmatched by Trump. And the article goes on
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:48.160]  to say that Leslie Stahl's interview with Trump was an undeniable get. He'd been scarce at
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.280]  mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape with NBC's Lester Holt. And then it just
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:00.480]  goes on from there to say that he bulldozed his enemy in chief, the mainstream media. Now,
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.120]  why is that? Because I know for a fact, Trump says you're not gonna substantively edit me. And if
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.680]  you do, I'm gonna counter you. Just like NBC got caught lying saying he hated the North and hated
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:16.080]  Ulysses S. Grant. Was it true? Just like they said, Oh, leaks have him saying he hates the South
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.080]  and Southerners. It's not true either. They say he hates every group hoping you believe it. None of
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:28.200]  it's true. But because he's able to counter their lies, he got a straight interview. She asked him
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:34.520]  a bunch of hard questions, but still he dominated her because they know he can punch back if they
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.080]  edited it. For everybody else, though, you can't do interviews with mainstream because they will
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:45.920]  edit you until it's unrecognizable. The full interviews on info wars.com. I'm not president.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:53.000]  You're not president. But President Trump is president. And he told her I'm president and
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.600]  you're not. Trump mocks CBS anchor intense 60 minutes interview. Let's go ahead and go to the
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.960]  first clip that is the most important. And then I've got some very important words to say after
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:14.520]  it. Here it is. Putin. Yeah. Okay. People don't understand why you never have a harsh word for
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:19.680]  Vladimir Putin. I don't understand. You don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.480]  prior to the press conference. I mean, publicly, you never say anything harsh. Excuse me. I didn't.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:30.880]  I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers. Obama didn't. You know what he
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:39.400]  said? He said, and blankets. I'm the one and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:46.440]  Russia now has this personally. I think I'm very tough with him personally. I had a meeting with
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:51.600]  him. The two of us. Yeah, it was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting. Do you
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:58.600]  agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations in poisonings? Probably he is. Yeah,
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:04.200]  probably. I mean, I don't probably, but I rely on them. It's not in our country. Okay. Why not?
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.800]  They shouldn't do it. This is a terrible thing. They shouldn't do it. Do you believe that the
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:17.040]  Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election? Well, they meddled, but I think China meddled,
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:23.240]  too. Why do you say China meddled? Why don't you just say that the Russians meddled? Because I
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:30.480]  think China meddled also. And I think, frankly, China, this is a bigger problem. You're diverting
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:36.960]  the whole Russian thing. I'm not doing anything. I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China. Now,
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:43.320]  China has a billion 350-something million people. They put spy chips on all the Apple and other
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.640]  platforms. They're openly bought Hollywood and our debt. They're trying to overthrow our country.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:54.160]  They censor everything. Google and others are helping them censor. And then President Trump
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.800]  talks about it and he's the traitor. Russia is the red herring. Russia wants an alliance with us.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:08.360]  They would take the alliance. Then we would control Central Asia all the way out to East Asia. They
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.080]  have borders with North Korea, South Korea. We would control into Eastern Europe. It's the
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.480]  perfect alliance. The globalists don't want that. They want destabilization. Google's CEO tells
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:24.040]  senators that censored Chinese search engine could provide broad benefits. That was testimony last
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:31.600]  week. They say the head of Google contradicting the person that testified a week before for Google,
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.440]  their spokesperson, their head of global policy and privacy, said, yes, we are building a censor
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:43.640]  sub engine and it's good and you want it too. So see, this is getting sick. And there's another
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:51.120]  one. China is low-key taking over the world. Bloomberg, the rare earth minerals, the ports,
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:58.200]  the infrastructure and our elite have allowed them to do it on purpose. It's called treason. The
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:03.440]  big hack, how China used a tiny chip to infiltrate U.S. companies, the U.S. government and your home
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.320]  with the other chips they put in Chinese appliances, all coordinating, tracking you, stealing the data.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.080]  And big U.S. companies use China as the fence so they can move there and become Chinese companies
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:23.160]  and get away with the illegal activity. Europe banned spying on you, the U.S. bans it, you just moved
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:31.920]  to China. See, it's the base of operations of all this criminal activity now. And that's why what
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:37.720]  Trump is saying is so central and so important. He's pointing out the elephant in the room and not
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:43.560]  the red herring of Russia. Now let's go to this next clip. Trump, I never knew how dishonest the
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.640]  media was. He tells Leslie Stahl, I'm president and you're not. The other thing I've really learned
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:56.240]  is I never knew how dishonest the media was. I really mean it. I'm not saying that as a sound bite.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.720]  I never knew how dishonest. I'm going to change the subject again. Well, no. But even the way you
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:05.200]  asked me a question like about separation. Yeah. When I say Obama did it, you don't want to talk
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.440]  about it. No. When I say I did it, let's make a big deal out of it. I'm going to run your answer,
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:14.080]  but you did it four times. I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.320]  subject. I disagree, but I don't want to have that fight with you. Hey, it's okay. Leslie,
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:25.720]  it's okay. In the meantime, I'm president and you're not. That's called annihilating somebody.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:33.120]  Here's Trump getting into politics. It's vicious, full of lies, deceit and deception. I always used
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.520]  to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah. Now I say they're
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.920]  babies. Who's the toughest? The political people. This is the most deceptive, vicious world. It is
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:51.400]  vicious. It's full of lies, deceit and deception. You make a deal with somebody and it's like
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.360]  making a deal with that table. Give me an example. Well, I don't want to give you an example. I'm
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.520]  not looking at it. In the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do. Remember
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:05.800]  that when you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at making deals with other
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:11.160]  countries, nobody's been able to do anything like this. Actually, most people didn't even try
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.600]  because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it, but it's a very deceptive world. The
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.520]  other one he said there is so critical. When you don't go along with a swamp in the Republican or
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.960]  Democrat in the past, they come after you, your business, your name, your family, your credit,
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.680]  your credit card processing, they, they demonize you. They lie about you. Everybody's been
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:37.960]  intimidated. But Trump has shown rare leadership in taking all the errors, going over the top,
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:43.560]  delivering victory, and now blowing a hole in the globalist operation through which we can
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:49.320]  enter. But of course, you know who was there first helping blow the original hole. We planted
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:54.720]  the detonator. Trump hit the button. You as the Info Wars audience are the ones that built the
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:02.920]  detonator. Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.560]  the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year, resolve not to be the next

[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:31.120]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:43.120]  You know, most folks can't listen to this song. No more Mr. Night Sky on Relate, but I can. I got no friends.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:51.440]  Can't be seen with me. But those were never my real friends. The truth is, I can't imagine
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.160]  being attacked by the papers back when most people believed them 30, 40, 50 years ago.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.880]  Almost no one believes mainstream media now, so we've got more listeners, more fans, more supporters
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:07.920]  than ever. But here's the difference. The people that do believe mainstream media are more zombie-like,
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:15.040]  more aggressive, more crazy, more vicious than ever. We're joined here in just a moment by Joey
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.320]  Gibson, who leads up the Patriot Prayer Group. I guess they have their fourth rally in Portland,
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:28.560]  Oregon, where Antifa comes out and attacks everyone. And we've seen the mayor letting
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.560]  people block roads and beat up innocent people and pull people out of cars and beat their vehicles,
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:42.400]  the metal batons. And so I saw the national news with the mayor defending it and all the rest of it.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:48.400]  Ted Wheeler, Portland mayor, stands by decision to allow Antifa to block traffic, trying to get cars
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.520]  to run over them so they can scream, I guess, Charlottesville again. And then national media
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:59.040]  saying it's Nazi's rallying, when there's more people with brown skin at Joey Gibson's rallies,
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:05.680]  and there are, with the meth head, almost all white Antifa goonsquats. So I wanted to get him
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.680]  on, since this was national news yesterday and today, to find out what really happened. I mean,
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.640]  you can all go watch the videos. You see Antifa attacking first. You see the police standing
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.160]  down. You saw the footage last week of Antifa blocking roads during rush hour and again chasing
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.560]  people down in their vehicles, white people screaming and old white people saying, you effing,
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.600]  dumb, old, stupid white person. You're a Nazi. I mean, it's just total mental illness. What is
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.680]  the rhyme or reason? Because Soros is the main funder of Antifa. They are centrally controlled.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:43.760]  So to give us a bird's eye view and also a point blank range in the field view is Joey Gibson,
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:51.680]  founder of the Patriot prayer group, Gibsonforfreedom.com. He joins us. So thanks for joining us,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:55.920]  my friend. Oh, thank you for having me. It's, you know, it's my pleasure to be here.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.000]  You know, you guys that have the idea to have the free Alex Jones rally that a few hundred folks
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.640]  showed up to a few weeks ago, I knew about it like the last day of it came down. But then that
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:10.400]  spurred free Alex Jones movements. I know all over the country. So great job. Fill people in on
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.120]  Portland. Why it's the epicenter of this and some of the history and then what happened last night
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:21.120]  or yesterday. Sure. So we've been traveling around on the West Coast to certain cities,
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.720]  especially where the mayors have the police stand down. And over time, the mayors have kind of given
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.240]  up and they've allowed the mayors to do or they've allowed the police to do their job. Portland's
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:35.200]  kind of one of the last cities where they find it acceptable where people can just go out on the
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.040]  streets to do whatever they want. And they don't have to pay the consequences. So basically what
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:45.040]  happened a little over a week ago, you know, a black man was shot and they had a memorial on the
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.320]  corner that he was at. And they were literally going out redirecting traffic. They took over the
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.600]  streets and they were telling people where they could or could not go. One man called the police.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  There's a video of it and an older man and you know, they did not respond. And then they start
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.120]  yelling at him, call him a white supremacist because he's from North Carolina. They start
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.360]  judging him because of the state that he's from, which is complete bigotry. Like everything they
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:15.440]  say they're against. So in response to put more pressure on the mayor, we had a march and rally
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.760]  on Saturday. Within 24 hours, you know, we had, you know, a few hundred people show up because
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.640]  people are so angry and it was a great turnout. And the mayor had to respond. He finally had a
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:32.720]  press conference and he justified it, said that it's okay that the police didn't respond. He also,
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.240]  at the same time, said motorists should feel safe in Portland. No, no, they shouldn't. They'll feel
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.880]  safe when you enforce the law. It's that simple. And so you guys decided to have another event
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:50.080]  this weekend. Tell us about that. This weekend, that's, I'm not having another event this weekend.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.800]  Well, I just saw all over the news that they were saying patriot prayer attacked. It was big
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.880]  headlines in the last two days. So I know there was other events. And so I guess they had another
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.000]  patriot prayer. I mean, tell us about what happened to this event. I don't know which event you're
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.440]  talking about. What we are going to do though is we are going November 6th at City Hall. There's
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:17.040]  going to be a whole bunch of people on the left who are going to protest the mayor. So I'm going to
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.920]  throw an event to kind of show up with them so both sides can kind of come together and
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.800]  protest this mayor because there's so many reasons to not like this mayor, whether you're left or
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:31.920]  right. The guys, number one, the guy's a liar. He's bought and paid for and they'll say and do
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:38.640]  whatever it takes in order to protect, you know, his position as mayor. Well, see, I just said,
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.840]  hey, get Joey Gibson on and there's so many fights and so much antifa violence around the country.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:50.080]  You may not even know it was topofdrugsreport.com yesterday that Saturday and then again,
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.360]  Sunday, there were basically riots in Portland, Oregon. Patriot groups fight antifa. The headline
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.400]  was I guess they just called the group patriot prayer. They didn't start anything. Patriot prayer
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:06.000]  marks for law and order attack. That was the headlines. We can pull up those headlines or
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.040]  violence at Patriot for prayer law and order event. There it is, bear spray, bloody brawls at Patriot
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.480]  prayer. So again, you're really the founder of that. I'm glad I got you on. We don't pre-interview
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.920]  people. I just get folks on because, you know, we're not like mainstream media that scripts
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.600]  everything. I guess there's so much going on. You're not even aware of this happening.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.920]  Yeah, I mean, last Saturday was my event, but in terms of this weekend, I don't know if
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.520]  people are planning on doing something. If they are good for them, I'll make sure I'll be there
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:41.920]  and support them. Well, then, because this was all over mainstream news yesterday, so it looks
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.520]  like there must have been some other something happened as street fights break out all over the
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.880]  country and they just think now all opposition to antifa's patriot prayer. I mean, so many times I
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.360]  get credit for stuff. Hey, your info wars, people were out doing this and then it wasn't even info
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.840]  wars. So I think that's probably the level you've now reached. Well, that's a good sign. I mean,
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:05.360]  amen to that. I'm glad. But as long as, you know, I do this so the other people will do it. You know,
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.720]  that's the main thing we want to motivate other people want to inspire other people. That's why
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:14.240]  we do that. And so I think that there is a movement, especially in Portland, people are starting to
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.840]  understand that we don't have to sit around anymore. We don't have to sit around and allow,
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.720]  whether it be antifa or the mayor or the lack of police response, you don't have to take it anymore.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.200]  You can go out on the streets and you can make sure your voice is heard and you don't have to hide
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.520]  anymore. I don't care if you're conservative, libertarian, moderate, it doesn't matter. You
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.480]  don't have to hide. You don't have to be ashamed of who you are. Just go out there, say who you are,
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.120]  be unafraid and unapologetic. Well, Joey, you're doing it because you're learning about this now.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:46.720]  There's another just people spontaneously showed up Saturday night and then again Sunday and it
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.800]  all exploded when they attacked them, calling themselves patriot prayers. So the chain reaction
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.400]  has now happened. What do you make of leftist groups, Democrats, top Hollywood people, Alec
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.040]  Baldwin calling for civil war, overthrowing the government. This is the latest thing Alec Baldwin
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.720]  said. We quote need to overthrow the government. They're the ones out pushing violence. And then
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.400]  they go, oh, the Republicans are going low. We got to go lower pretending like we're the ones that
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.960]  are starting stuff and we're the ones that are being violent and acting like Trump made it up
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:20.800]  that they're acting like mob rule. I think that, you know, it's just another attempt where, you
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.880]  know, we're living in an era of deception. I see it all the time. You know, I get so much hatred.
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.120]  People say that I have hate speech and I don't, you know, and so everything's flipped upside down.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.200]  Honestly, I think it's a good sign. I think they're on their last leg. They're so desperate.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.040]  Elections are coming up. You know, they banned you. They took you off of all the social media
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.760]  this because they're losing the cultural war. They're being destroyed. Finally,
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.600]  conservatives are getting involved in the cultural war. Conservatives, libertarians are
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.680]  finally starting to push back. And so now they don't know what to do because for the longest
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.840]  time we just took it and took it and took it while they just slowly took away this country,
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.200]  whether it be the schools, you know, the media, Hollywood, all that stuff. And now they have
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:03.280]  this weird punk movement for freedom that's completely taken over, especially the youth
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.920]  and people are loving it and people are inspired by it. One thing I was talking to someone about
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:13.760]  the other day, you know, violence is one part of what's happening on the streets, but you can kind
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.880]  of look at the violence and you can kind of learn something from that. If you look at our people,
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.360]  we're willing, there's a lot of people that are willing to bleed for this movement. They're
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.640]  willing to bleed for freedom. But the other side, they're not willing to bleed because it's for
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.360]  selfish reasons why they do what they do. That's why they're so selfish. They're not even willing
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.160]  to show their face to be a face for their movement. That's how selfish they are. You just said it,
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.600]  the globalist and their minions are not willing to bleed and it's why they're going to lose.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.120]  Absolutely. Because if you've got spirit and you know you're doing it for the right reason,
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.280]  you realize blood means nothing. But if you're not willing to sacrifice the blood,
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:43:17.760]  they're going to lose everything. We'll be right back with Joey Gibson on the other side, infowars.com.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.440]  I mean that is so pure. It just goes right into your body when you take it. We're working on
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.200]  trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.920]  ago. So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done. I'm breaking the contract.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.640]  Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially the last run. In fact,

[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:01.840]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.440]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives,
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:12.080]  the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say,
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.080]  why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.040]  into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.040]  success but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:32.080]  and why we've been made the main target. And if you financially support us and if you spread the
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:38.240]  word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these

[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.800]  our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.440]  Soros the global Spain win. This is InfoWars Darker Tower. We hear support. I'm counting on you.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:03.840]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:11.280]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:18.640]  or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it

[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.560]  stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's

[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:32.800]  From enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.640]  So let me ask Joey Gibson, the founder of the Patriot Paragroup,
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.800]  who goes out and peacefully just marches and gets attacked by the left all over the west coast and
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.000]  all over the country. Alec Baldwin has come out. He's in the union leader. There's this,
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.920]  there's video of it. We need to overthrow the government. That's what Alec Baldwin has come out
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:05.760]  and said. Fresh off his first appearance on the season as President Trump was set on live after
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.400]  Alec Baldwin headlined the New Hampshire Democratic Party's inaugural Eleanor Roosevelt dinner Sunday
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.640]  night at the Manchester Down Hotel and he said, the way we implement change in America is through
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:21.920]  elections, Baldwin said. In that orderly way, we need to overthrow the government of the United
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:29.280]  States under Donald Trump, not in a violent, awful way, but it must be overthrown nonetheless.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:35.360]  Let's make America great again by making Donald Trump a casino operator again. Baldwin won an
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:41.040]  Emmy last year, blah, blah, blah. Well, at least Alec Baldwin will say he wants to make America
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.680]  great again, but the rhetoric of him and the former attorney general about when they go low,
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.040]  we kick them, kick them, kick them, fight, fight, fight. And then Maxine Waters saying,
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.600]  chase people around. They're getting more violent everywhere. They're attacking people
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:58.080]  more and more everywhere. And as you said, as the police finally in places like San Francisco and
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:04.080]  Austin, Texas, stand up to Antifa when they're physically attacking people there. Their only
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:10.480]  refuge is places like Portland, Oregon. Where do you see this going in the next 22 days till the
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:17.120]  election, Joey Gibson versus if they lose or if they win? What do you expect them to do the next
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:23.280]  22 days? But what do you expect them to do if they win or if they lose? You know, I've been thinking
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.040]  about that a lot lately. I like to look at it this way. So I'm pretty optimistic about the way
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.160]  the elections are going to go in November, even with the cheating going on. I kind of look at it
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.560]  like, you know, a child, you know, cries really hard the first time they're shocked. Second time,
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.200]  I like to think they're not going to cry as hard. I don't think they're going to riot, hopefully.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.920]  And so I think that things will be a little bit more calm if we end up winning. But we'll see.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:55.440]  What I'm really looking forward to, though, is the 2020 election. I think that Trump has a really
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:02.880]  good chance of winning, especially if the economy continues to get increased. And I'm really excited
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.240]  to be able to go out there in 2020, to be able to rally. And I think that's when things are going
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.280]  to get crazy. It seems like people care more about presidential elections than they do midterm,
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:17.920]  even though midterm is really important. Why do you think the left are such short-lived losers
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:24.000]  this time? I think it's because they believe their globalist utopia, their socialist utopia,
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.720]  was going to be delivered by Hillary. And they had all these plans ready to censor the press and
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.280]  break up the families and open the borders. But because Trump got in there as a stopgap,
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:40.080]  that has just enraged them. Well, it's, it's hard because a lot of these people, you know,
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:44.880]  no offense to them, they've built an ideology that's not from logic. You know, freedom isn't
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.240]  their main focus. For them, it's about emotions and how they feel and this and that, especially
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:54.080]  if you look at socialism or if you look at people who want health care for everybody,
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.840]  they're not thinking about the fact that we don't understand where the money would come from.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.000]  But emotionally, it sounds good to them because they're like, everybody can have health care.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.360]  And so a lot of the times they don't get what they want and they start to freak out and they just
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.840]  have meltdowns. It's things that I've never thought that I would see in my entire life
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:14.720]  when you go on the streets and these people absolutely despise me. They hate me so much
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:18.880]  and they don't even know why. And they're literally like, like foaming from the mouth.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:22.160]  Like that's not even a joke. I know you guys have seen that a lot. They're foaming from the
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:26.960]  mouth and they're yelling and they're screaming. And they say some of the most vile, hateful things
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.600]  you can even think of, especially when they get on that bullhorn. And then they say that I have
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.360]  hate speech. So I don't really, Alex, I don't have the answer for you. I don't know why they do what
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:40.640]  they do. It's just, it's beyond reason anymore. I used to try to figure it out. But when you
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:45.200]  ask them questions, they don't have answers. They have no answers. That's what I don't understand.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:50.080]  You know, so I don't know, but it's really frustrating. Well, let's talk about this because
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:53.760]  there's so many studies that will make your head spin. Thousands that say smartphones
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:58.720]  and over television watching makes you lose your humanity, lose your humility,
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:04.720]  become irritable. And that over smartphone use, and all this is connected to people,
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:10.640]  basically becoming animals. And you see that in the Kingsman Her Majesty's Secret Service,
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.200]  where the evil guy sends out the wavelength over the cell phones to make everybody kill each other.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.840]  Now that's an archetype of what's really going on, but see it. Patriots, fans flip off
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:26.320]  Tyreek Hill, throw beer on him that your chief scores touchdown.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:32.640]  And again, he wins the touchdown. He scores a touchdown. So they flip him off and throw beer on
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:37.760]  him. And I see this everywhere. People see it in relationships where there's not a governor.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:42.800]  There's no, there's no respect for other people. And everyone is acting more and more like animals.
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:45.920]  I mean, I really think it's almost like a form of mass demon possession.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:50.400]  Yeah, that's what I was just going to say. I would say one thing that I would suggest for
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:56.160]  this country is that we bring God back into the culture, but not in a way where we're oppressive
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:00.800]  or we force it on people. You know, it's not even everyone, not everyone has to believe in God,
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.880]  but if it becomes more part of this culture, if you look at the things that Jesus taught,
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:09.120]  even if you don't believe he's the son of God, the things that he taught is having love for one
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:13.840]  another, having respect for one another. And I don't see that respect anymore. When I think about
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:18.320]  those guys out on the streets blocking traffic, number one, that's extremely disrespectful. But
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:23.280]  number two, to chase them down the street and start attacking him because he refuses to obey
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:28.080]  your orders. It's just disrespect for other humans. And it's something that we're losing in this
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:35.760]  culture. And I do believe it's 100% a spiritual problem. It is a spiritual problem. And if you
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:42.000]  listen and watch the Antifa people, they're literally like disempowered, weird, scummy,
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:49.840]  archetypal images of wimps all out ganging up on people and just acting like virtue signaling
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:58.160]  scum. And to see them totally tone deaf and not connected to reality is, is disgusting.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:04.240]  Yeah, absolutely. One good example, when they were at the memorial before we went down, we sat
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.360]  down tiny and a couple of the guys to go talk to them. And they went live. And as they walked around
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:14.640]  talking to them, they asked them, you know, what happened? And they say a police officer shot,
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.080]  you know, a black man. And it's like, okay, but what happened? And they don't know,
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:22.320]  they don't even have an answer. So they're down there protesting and they don't even know what
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.960]  they're protesting. They don't even know what happened. You know, and the truth is he did shoot
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.640]  two people, you know, and so I want a full investigation. I don't know what happened, but
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:36.400]  I mean, let's be clear. Andy was shutting down roads in the rioting is somebody reportedly a
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:42.080]  black guy shot two people before the cops shot him before he got shot. And no one was even asked,
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.720]  was he guilty? Or were the police defending themselves or were the citizens defending
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.880]  themselves? That's how this has gotten so crazy. And nobody wants anybody to die. We're trying to
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.280]  stop black babies being aborted. Half the black folks in this country never get born. I want,
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.840]  I love black people. I love everybody. But the idea that almost always when they claim it's a
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.960]  non authorized shooting or or a or an improper shooting, it's always never the truth. And
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:12.080]  the mainstream media almost always covers up what really happened. It's all tribal thinking,
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.320]  you know, especially if you take the aborting the babies, if you really care about, you know,
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.640]  black, especially black babies, we can talk about the abortions, but people are so caught up in
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.440]  the left versus right paradigm that they don't really think about independent situations. You
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.640]  take even the police, you know, people refuse to look at each situation and each police officer.
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:36.880]  In every case, the person has shot somebody and is waving a gun around. Absolutely. I mean,
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.680]  you wave a gun around in front of cops or anybody, you're going to get shot.
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:44.640]  Most police officers are good people. I mean, they don't most of them just want to do their
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.240]  job. They want to protect and serve. I can tell you almost all police, well,
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.600]  they really don't want to shoot somebody and get sued and all the stuff that happens.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.800]  Joey Gibson, great job. We'll be following your event and other events
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:57.520]  as they unfold. Keep it up, my friend. Thank you.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.160]  All right. Dr. Steve Pachennick is going to join us next hour almost really going on and why they're
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:06.640]  hyping this Saudi Arabian slash American journalist death so much. Trump's hitting
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:11.200]  us a false flag. I told you that over the weekend, but we'll see what Steve Pachennick has to say.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.480]  I don't know if he's going to agree with where I think this is pointing.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:17.920]  He's got a lot of high level sources, so we'll get all that information coming up.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:25.600]  Listen, real quick, I'm very excited to announce a 35% off the super high quality
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:30.720]  storeable foods and infowarstore.com that are powered by mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:37.280]  You saw Hurricane Michael create incredible devastation in the Florida Panhandle and knock
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:41.520]  out a lot of conservative voters, which is really could be the Democrat secret weapon.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:45.520]  It's an example of how you can't just trust FEMA or the government to take care of you.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:50.160]  Even if Donald Trump's the president, you've got to be self-sufficient with high quality
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:54.640]  storeable foods and water filtration. Both of those are produced by the great folks that run

[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:21.200]  weeks, or months for aid. Looking for Puerto Rico, that's why it's so important to make sure
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.040]  that you have the storeable food you need to weather the storm today, with amounts ranging
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:29.600]  from three days to a whole year of storeable food selection can make sure you're not a victim in

[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:20.000]  i do intend a lot of days this week to open the phones up i've been doing a better job about that
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.680]  we have a lot of other big guests throughout the week coming up i haven't gotten to this yet
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.040]  south african president vows to accelerate land expropriations from whites
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:33.040]  just a year ago media matters said i was a conspiracy theorist that this didn't exist
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:39.360]  we also have macron says the epicenter of french language is now africa
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:46.400]  uh we've got so much more coming up on that front but this saudi arabia deals a big deal
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:52.000]  because it's meant to derail trump's plan to secure the middle east so it doesn't collapse
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.880]  into europe and then and then into the united states and other countries it's a major globalist
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:04.640]  destabilization program we're recovering that i want viewers and listeners to know something
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:12.400]  when i say to you without your support without your prayers without you spreading the word
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:20.960]  we will be shut down that's not an afterthought that is the central core and fact to everything we
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:26.960]  do here so every accomplishment you see info wars make every success against globalism
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:34.320]  every pro human development that takes place every defense of christian values that you see being
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:42.720]  secured from this nation sovereignty to the right to self-defense is because of you yes it's because
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:46.640]  of me it's because of the crew but without you just like different parts of the body
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:56.320]  working in concert together we will be defeated and so first off i want to thank all the viewers
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:02.480]  and listeners and our affiliates and everyone else and the crew for standing with us during these
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:08.160]  incredibly historic times where my greatest frustration is that i do not have more to give
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:14.480]  for my country and my family and god because by giving and standing up you build a great world
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:23.440]  by laying down you build a living hell it's not some selfishness that drives what i'm doing
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:31.360]  but at the same time it's not some selflessness see selfish people think you sell everybody out
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:37.120]  around you and you get ahead but then you create a toxic world in which you live that's a hell and
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.200]  you've got a lot of selfless people that get conned into serving the globalist and giving up
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:49.040]  control over their own lives what i'm doing is not selfless and it's not selfish it's common sense
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:57.040]  it's about survival it's about self-preservation and if i'm going to preserve myself and my progeny
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.720]  my children i want to preserve you into the future as well i believe in you
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.520]  now ladies and gentlemen they've taken five payment processors we've got with mafia
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:13.920]  bullying racketeering tactics and they're trying to take down our final ones right now
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:20.960]  and that's why i've launched the biggest sell in our history free shipping sure wide and 50%
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:26.160]  off all the supplements we don't raise the price and then lower it and then say it's down 50% like
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:31.840]  other fake black friday specials we don't do that when we lower the price it's lowered from the original
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:38.640]  real price so we have christmas black friday cyber monday all of it rolled into one right now
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:44.640]  until everything sells out and until i fix these issues we're dealing with i've stopped reordering
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:48.320]  products at this point because i'm not the type of guy to order stuff i can't pay for down the road
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:53.280]  that's the level of the dire straits we're in but i believe in you coming through and the last few
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:59.360]  weeks you've been doing it since i announced this issue we're having record sales but the cash 22
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.200]  we're not making a lot of money on them because they're so low priced and we're selling out of our
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.960]  stock but it's the only road it's the right path and it's what i'm doing to secure backup funds to
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:13.600]  go into the future while i'm having to sue people and having to have injunctions and take action to
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.920]  defeat these mafia organizations and the president's gearing up to take action as well i could tell you
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.200]  i spoke to folks connected to him very closely just a few days ago so i'm very excited that's

[02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:12.400]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:22.080]  with the king of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of what took place with regard to
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:31.760]  you as he said he's Saudi Arabian citizen i've asked and he firmly denied that i've asked
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:40.480]  secretary of state mike Pompeo to immediately get on a plane go to Saudi Arabia go to other places
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:48.800]  if necessary which he probably will but with regard to this go to turkey if necessary the king told me
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:56.640]  that turkey and Saudi Arabia are working hand in hand very closely on getting to the bottom of what
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:05.440]  happened so we'll see what happened but mike Pompeo excuse me mike Pompeo is leaving literally
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:14.080]  within an hour or so he's heading to Saudi Arabia we are going to leave nothing uncovered with that
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:22.400]  being said the king firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe i don't want to
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:29.680]  get into his mind but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers who knows
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:34.240]  we're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon but his was a flat denial
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:47.120]  all right i have people on that i respect i'm shown here back live
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:50.720]  doesn't mean that i always agree with them doesn't mean i disagree with them
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:54.960]  i talked to a lot of sources last week that said that they believed it was another element
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:08:00.240]  of the Saudi government that was going to kill this kashogi reporter uh because they then wanted
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:05.360]  to blame the the crown prince and the king and the deal they've got with trump try to derail it
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:10.640]  because obama and hillary and others uh are mad about the iran deal in trouble i don't know that's
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:15.440]  true if Saudi arabia is crazy enough in broad daylight at their embassy in turkey to bring
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:21.280]  somebody in with an apple watch and then kill them that sounds wild but i said yesterday some
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:26.320]  people are saying it's a false flag or a staged event to destabilize the region again i don't
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:30.320]  know that's true and dr steve pacenek is one of the most accurate people we've had on over the
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.960]  years and he predicted trump's election here like we did steve pacenek dot com he co-wrote
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:40.640]  a bunch of books and movies with tom clancy was a composite character for jack ryan he's a psychiatrist
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:46.480]  been a military officer as well worked in regime change camp david accords uh you name it been in
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:53.120]  the cfr till he resigned he exposed the whole fake bin laden fable uh about him being killed uh
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.080]  because he was dead a long time before and so much more so he joins us now i don't know his take on
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:03.520]  this yet uh and it doesn't mean he disagrees with me he's wrong because i'm not even saying i'm sure
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:09.760]  that's what's happening i just know this when you see mainstream media for a week hyping it like it's
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.640]  the end of the world over a dead journalist when when saudi arabia has been bombing yemen for years
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:20.320]  and killing tens of thousands and all this other crap it just smells of Benghazi to me now maybe
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:25.840]  i'm wrong we'll see what steve pacenek thinks but i really respect his opinion steve pacenek dot com
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.600]  again exclusive king of saudi arabia uh journalist was a false flag to stabilize trump peace plan
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:36.560]  that was the headline we put out asking the question uh show am i wrong or am i right or what's the
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:42.320]  best thinking on this with all your sources in the middle east that dr pacenek well honestly i
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:47.920]  think your your approach this is the most honest and the most credible number one the fact that
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:55.360]  kosoji was a uh washington post reporters are relevant number two everybody forgets that he really
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:01.520]  worked in saudi intelligence and was very close to the whole royal family so he's an operative
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.000]  whatever happened to him quite frankly is not relevant to our national security we have interests
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.600]  and trump has said it repeatedly and i'm going to say it again a hundred times we do not have friends
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.360]  we do not have enemies we have national interests our national interest is to be with saudi iraida
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:26.320]  it's our ally we want that hundred and ten billion dollars of military equipment sold to them period
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:32.880]  in turn turkey will have its two hundred million dollar debt billion dollar debt released by either
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:40.880]  us or i predict that mohammed bin salman will eliminate that debt for turkey and in turn we
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:46.640]  will find out quote that there was a rogue element is it relevant to our national security no
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:53.520]  absolutely you're right there it is not the end of the world it is not an ability it's not an
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:11:00.240]  interest to destabilize the middle east the issue is very simply what is in our interest our interest
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:06.160]  to maintain a friendship with saudi arabia maintain a friendship with turkey and period that means
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.120]  money will be transferred we will receive a hundred and ten billion turkey erdoğan will
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:15.520]  receive two hundred billion that's the bottom line let's pull back now though and then see the
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:21.280]  clear hype like babies and incubators or you know any hype we see before they do something like this
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.880]  the more globalist elements of the deep state i see really trying to sabotage something so what
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:34.400]  is the breathless cnn msnbc abc new york times trump's not doing enough we need to do something
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:41.440]  saudi arabia what are they wanting what they want is the attention that you've had for 17 years
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.880]  remember what we've talked about they're more about most people are not watching cnn and i'm
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:52.640]  watching msnbc i don't even know what they are anymore quite frankly they're not relevant and
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:58.960]  what happened is this guy alex jones becomes more and more relevant to the narrative that we have
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:04.880]  in the united states so what happens is you have an editor of the new york times a nice guy whatever
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:12.240]  he doesn't really know what to hide so he goes from various personal stories in mexico to a
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:19.600]  national disgrace in in turkey he has no idea the the the whole industry has no idea what you're
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:26.960]  finding is the end of the entertainment industry the media industry the radio the tv and what's
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:34.400]  happening is this alex jones show broke the whole model of saying okay can we do entertainment yes
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:41.040]  can we do a narrative that series yes can we do a paradigm shift that people can believe in yes
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:46.800]  what happened you left everybody in the trail i'm not lauding you i'm simply saying that what they
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:52.880]  need to do i mean the only recourse they have is either to keep silent or open their mouth if you
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:58.880]  go back in history and you look at all of the individuals who were interviewed about whether
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:05.920]  trump will become president united states there isn't one person either in the senate or anywhere else
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:10.720]  who agreed that trump will be president united states other than you me and the rest of our
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:18.080]  college they were ashamed cnn was ashamed msnbc they had poll after poll is that why they're so
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:23.280]  enraged and now the economy is coming back and and and it makes them look like the incompetence
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:29.680]  that you've been saying on my show for 18 years they are they are incompetent i can't even explain
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:35.680]  how incompetent they are believe me when i was in the national security area they would call me up
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:41.520]  they were sycophants basically what does a journalist do a journalist if i don't like somebody
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.320]  i tell him i don't like him so do you they all on purpose talk crap about everybody constantly
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:52.960]  and do no work and then they're always trying to social climb it's sick exactly right so when
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:57.840]  when you get on the air and you say something we don't have to count out of each other we don't
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:04.400]  need to we respect each other we care about what we say but you never never scream me before it's
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:08.560]  the reverse in the newspapers they'll ask you well what do you think what show do you think when i
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:14.000]  was on nmbc or abc or whatever it didn't matter they would always want to know where your position
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:20.080]  is because they didn't know how to create a spontaneous show what you're seeing now is the
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:26.160]  end of this industry will blitzer oh there was no way trump was coming in we have these 16 studies
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:32.720]  that were done and it's clear boom wrong uh it's the total end of their credibility it's the total
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:37.200]  end of them running their hoaxes and so instead of stopping lying they could have maybe saved
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:43.440]  themselves they quadrupled the line and have now gone into insane asylum land as a psychiatrist
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:48.800]  where do you think they go next well it's very simple they're not even saying they're just stupid
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:55.120]  and incompetent insanity doesn't even come into this when you're incompetent and you're basically
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:01.040]  ignorant a meg maggie haberman new york times why is she there her father was there new york
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:06.160]  times reporters they don't really know they think they know they hang around the people
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:11.600]  they're sick offense they manipulate your sources and then they have oh well we have deep sources
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:16.160]  look at the example of what happened to new york times you had a revolution supposedly new york
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:21.280]  time well i haven't seen anybody thrown out were they co-opted by the president of the united states
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:27.120]  i think they may have been co-opted i think that in turn trump made a fool out of the new york
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:32.960]  times when they had that piece in there so what's happening is you want to play with trump then you
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:40.400]  better understand 40 or 50 years of a very shrewd businessman who only thinks about one thing what's
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:46.320]  in my interest of the interest of my country and what is in the interest of the other and having
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:51.200]  him somebody like that at working for our interests has got what has these people who've been selling

[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:41.600]  we can and and not being centralized really worries the globalist it's not about tooting my

[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:54.080]  just because of how small it is but how big its footprint is but because dr steve pacanik wrote
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:58.560]  net force with tom clancy and has worked in cyber security and he knows a lot of the big
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.120]  brains that are involved and he obviously pointed out that google was really founded by darpa
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:10.720]  and the geospatial center 20 years ago and the rest of it earlier i covered this and i sat there
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:15.600]  a month ago in congressional hearings where senator cotton and senator rubio were the only
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:19.760]  ones that brought up real questions that's why the media cuts off the front of rubio i walk up
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.640]  politely at the press conference area and he says get away for me i don't know who you are and then
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:28.880]  i started saying hey just answer my question about us citizens being censored not just what's
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:33.200]  happening in china and so he was a jerk is why i started being a jerk back i probably shouldn't
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:37.760]  have been a jerk to him uh just because you know he got spun by the media but i was being real but
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:44.080]  we dr pacanik and i and many others talked about this 10 12 years ago how china was putting spy
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:50.720]  chips uh in chips that went back to the us to then spy on the pentagon spy on company
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:57.280]  spy on everybody now it's in bloomberg or google ceo tells senators that censored chinese search
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:04.640]  engine could provide broad benefits and this is google ceo sundar pachari has refused to answer
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:08.640]  a list of questions from us lawmakers about the company's secret plan for a censored search engine
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:14.160]  in china i'm here to tell you they've already deployed a dragonfly type system that tracks your
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:20.400]  identity and then puts you into an algorithm of what your psychology type is or what your profile is
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:27.360]  and then it admits that uh the head of google contradicts the head of global privacy who just
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:33.600]  testified two weeks ago and said there is no dragonfly we're not spying on anybody all of this so i see
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:39.040]  the capitulation of google and apple are more like in the case of apple that just
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:44.960]  marrying the communist chinese to get the tax exemption trump goes from 40 to 15 the left says
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:50.160]  how dare you we was just matching china and then china goes to zero but you've got to be state run
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:58.000]  and then six months ago it's in royers the code keys to the apple i cloud and your iphone id's
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.720]  are given to china well china fences that out and then steals data with hackers that they're worse
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:07.520]  than the russians so it's not that our government's perfect and i'm against the big brother thing but
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:13.280]  the only thing worse is to then give them everything and then work against the pentagon
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:20.000]  and american as bad as bezos is if you study the jedi program and all the stuff i've got here it's
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:26.240]  actually building a 10 billion dollar ai system with the pentagon to actually project free market
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:31.520]  and other things but it's the only cyber company and believe me amazon's a cyber company not just
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:36.640]  shipping that would work with the pentagon yet in this in this in this 10 million dollar program
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:42.240]  show as much as i don't like bezos and some of the things he's done it's the only big tech company
[02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:48.400]  i see that's even doing anything so the level of treason and i see this is world war four with the
[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:53.440]  collaborators and the globalists and the cfr that thought there'd be a chinese century and here
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:58.880]  comes trump pissing in the cheerios right the last moment everyone should be literally in the
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:03.280]  street supporting the president because at least he's an american president and i don't understand
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:08.640]  how google and others would bet on china with all of its problems it's it's it's it's beyond fiction
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:14.160]  as they say truth is trading the fiction dr pechenek and you look at this and i'm serious
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:19.840]  i'm an anti fascist i don't like tyranny i don't like police states i'm under a google apple
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:25.280]  twitter facebook big tech censorship with the stay behind democrat networks they're trying to destroy me
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:30.720]  me the chai com's own hollywood they're trying to oppress everything and i'm serious if the president
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.480]  marched the marine corps into these offices which would hurt the economy we shouldn't do it but i'm
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.800]  sorry if they arrested the heads of all these companies we have the damn evidence i mean we
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.120]  built this it's ours they're allied with a group that killed five times what hitler did
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:48.400]  they're raping american citizens in mass trying to leverage an authoritarianism a year and a half ago
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:54.400]  at davos their dictator showed up the chinese dictator and said i'll defeat trump and america
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:59.440]  they're weak and yonker said yeah we'll crush america i mean these are the damn quotes they're
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:04.880]  just asking politically and economically to have their goddamn teeth knocked out well
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:13.840]  let me be very straightforward with you china president she is in major major trouble even
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:22.080]  the new york post congratulated trump on being the true student of sunzoo meaning trump has just
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:28.880]  gotten into she's mentality into the entire communist party and he's playing with him to such as
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:34.640]  extent this is the sixth month in the row and thanks to your show on o and shroy and harrison
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:42.000]  jones i was explaining how every month she who has no idea of how to run the economy in china or
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:49.280]  any other economy is pumping in a hundred billion dollars in liquidity which means in effect china
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:56.800]  is bankrupt she knows that i know that trump knows that and what's happening is the one belt one
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:04.560]  road effort that he put out there is not working because country after country is defaulting on
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:13.440]  the loans she cannot handle the underlying suppression within his own community the district
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:18.480]  and so he'll be coming a dictator six months ago officially was a sign of weakness well that's
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:24.720]  correct i mean from the very day he became a dictator and said i'm a malice i said a year ago
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:31.280]  on your show this man has to be very stupid and i'll tell you why he and his father were tortured
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:37.520]  by the cultural revolution by malice he told himself i'm not talking about just simple words
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:43.360]  she was beaten up repeatedly and what was the conclusion he came to oh i'm going to be like
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:50.080]  malice instead of understanding that the true genius of china was don't chow ping who said
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:57.040]  cover your strength buy your time mal decided to go out and kill all the millions of these people
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:04.000]  and she took that model now what's happening is he's got revolution in china he's got revolution
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:10.800]  he took he literally has arrested the chinese head of interpol the chief of interpol happens
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:18.720]  to be chinese and he's in prison that's how bold and ignorant she is and he's dependent on a bunch
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:24.960]  of old men i'm a communist party and i'm predicting that the people's liberation army which is younger
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.080]  and looking around and say jeez you know she was never in our military they're gonna say this is
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:38.000]  not good for us meanwhile trump is tacking him down he can't do anything right now whether google
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.120]  continues or not that's up to the national and i cut you off i'll give you the floor next segment
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:48.240]  and i want to get into china and his witnesses and i agree why is the hollywood elite in the
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.880]  left running to him like he's this wonderful person and calling trump a dictator and nazi
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:58.240]  when they're literally cozied up to a mass murderer because they're ignorant my friend
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:04.720]  i've been worked in hollywood they have no basic education they're actors they're tv writers they're
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:11.200]  in a make believe world that make believe world has all kinds of constructs that are not real
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.000]  so they assume if they can use their hundreds of millions for which they're guilty because
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.200]  you stand up and you say a bunch of absurd words for a few minutes and you're in a movie and you're
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:28.480]  a movie star that's not really a job they know that i know that that's why i left the industry
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:33.680]  basically the industry is a joke i'm a member the producer no i agree but but but the narrative's the
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:37.840]  truth and even if they don't know they're complete traders we point out their traders the chi com
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.320]  they're weak-minded period and then i think the democratic party's permanently done i'm just
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:46.240]  they're too dangerous they're too out of control they hate america so much they've cozyed up the
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:57.600]  communist chinese what do we do about it when we come back the united states of empire is a book

[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.560]  they're virtue signalers but i think it's because in china they're allowed to do whatever they want
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:11.360]  they've made that decision with the globalist i think because trump just wants to create free
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:16.560]  market freedom behind the scenes he isn't threatening people like china like the democrats
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.960]  are and we see these headlines the new york times washington post that oh we're going to get more
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:26.080]  ruthless we're going to be more vicious well i've experienced the mafia tactics of the democrats and
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:31.680]  so what do we do about the democrats threatening people to drive them into the arms of the chinese
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:40.960]  dictator i want to get to a basic psychiatric principle the people in silicon valley are not
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:47.520]  smarter than anybody else what they've done is to develop something that you know darpa had
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:53.600]  done and the cia had done in the 1950s and 60s but let me give you an example what i just said
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:59.360]  of president g of china where he identifies with the aggressor the silicon valley leader
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:06.160]  like sergi brinn the father of google came out of the soviet union it was i and others in the
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:11.440]  intelligence community who took down the soviet union and what did he became become he became
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:17.680]  the trotsky of the internet he became the very communist that we took them out of that system
[02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:23.680]  so he began to identify with the aggressor that's what you have with a bunch of these guys they all
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:29.440]  become what we call liberal fascists they think they can control the communications they don't
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:35.520]  understand they're just a method of communication zuckerberg isn't some genius zuckerberg was
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:41.440]  a sociopath who understood how to manipulate himself and get into social network in the movie
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:46.960]  the same thing was sergi brinn i remember when he was at stanford he walked out of his phd but
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:54.640]  he's he's basically a fascist he hadn't changed his communist mentality in any way he decided to
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:39:00.560]  go into the search engine which was then facilitated by the national geospatial agency
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:06.320]  whom i've called up and said look guys you better get your algorithm in control because none of your
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:11.760]  algorithms are correct and they said no no no the father of the internet understood that i said
[02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:20.400]  there is no father of the internet if i knew about it at mit in my phd 1971 72 about social media
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:26.720]  then you can't tell me sergi brinn and marty's and zuckerberg all these jewish guys are such
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:31.600]  geniuses that i was already trained in social media in the internet i was about to say my dad in
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:37.120]  the late 60s was at ut and they already had spas all it was all very restricted but but it was
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.520]  it already had cd rom they were calling it information energy they were talking about social
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:46.960]  media networks i mean it was already being theorized then exactly so what happened is the
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:52.640]  government instead of coming in and saying okay this is enough nonsense on behalf of google this
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:58.880]  is nonsense on behalf of facebook facebook is going down financially google has had a problem
[02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:05.600]  financially facebook now has a problem financially and so what's happening is the government went
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.520]  right in into tell decided that's part of the cia that they're going to invest in this but instead
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:17.920]  of learning how to open up the systems what they were doing and it's something that roger stone said
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:23.920]  they're trying to measure how much dissension we can have within this internet system and see
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:29.840]  what's tolerated well from my point of view i think it's time for trump to come in and say okay
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:35.040]  you want to control this you're gonna have to pay a very heavy fee for it because now
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:40.400]  you've got a man who came out of the communist russia at soviet union and is worth 50 billion
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:45.040]  dollars give me a break the guy didn't do anything that was so brilliant that's what i'm
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:49.280]  getting at is they were chosen because they're yes men to build this system and they've already
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:54.080]  sold out to china and they're censoring everybody and then and then and for the democrats because
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:58.720]  the democrats have threatened to take over and nationalize them and so because trump's free
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.960]  market he's hands off by him creating a vacuum about republicans creating a vacuum of not letting
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:10.560]  the chai comms and the eu come in with regulations and fines they've taken control of google facebook
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:15.280]  and twitter because the the federal government isn't imposing himself so i'm not for government
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:22.800]  control but it's world government it's already come in well let me put it this way we create
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:28.960]  we the united states of america created that internet and social media china did not what china
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:35.360]  did over the 10 15 years or 20 years which we allowed them to do was to steal our technology
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:41.280]  and to take it and turn trump just said that's enough and that's a problem whether it's the
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:47.200]  democrats or republic and i mean you have soros is just a pawn in the council on formal issues
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:53.680]  it's a buffoons entity i mean i left the council because it's a geriatric unit of people who really
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:58.400]  couldn't do very much and don't know what to do and and you have buffoons there you have the illy
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:03.200]  clinton's you have the soros and all that doctor i agree with you you'll come back and break it down
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:08.000]  here's a problem they're still in quasi control which makes it more dangerous that they are buffoons
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:17.200]  well the control that's really there is the cia the nro the nsa and the fact that we are not in
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:24.400]  the forefront of cyber security one of the things that i've protested and wanted is to make a uh a
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:31.760]  member of the cabinet a senior member of the government in charge of cyber security john bolton
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:37.920]  has no idea about cyber security we put in a general called maca sony that is not enough
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:44.480]  he has to have the level of a uh literally a representative i agree stay there because because
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:48.960]  silicon valley does not respect the federal government or the president or the people or
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:56.080]  or the first amendment i mean that's it and they need to be brought to heal it's really hard to have
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:01.680]  the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:07.120]  heck even take your dog for a walk believe me i know i spend hours in front of a screen and then

[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:11.840]  well i was thumbing from montgomery i had my guitar on my back
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:17.360]  when a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:26.800]  he was dressed like 1950 half drunk and hollow eyed he said it's a long walk to nashfield would
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:34.880]  you like to ride waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:44.160]  lines of the info war imagine being president trump he knows about classic americana economic
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:49.200]  moves he knows if china has a huge tariff on us and canada has a huge tariff that you've got to
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:55.040]  say no to that but that's not free trade so he's able to get a few basic things done that have
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:48:02.080]  turned the economy around to a great extent but imagine the arrogance of these google owners uh
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:09.520]  five or six of them worth 30 40 50 60 70 billion dollars a piece you've got apple and you've got
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:14.800]  this this new royalty and it's all black boxes and they're all super rich they've all got teams of
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:21.920]  lobbyists so in congress says google you won't work with the pentagon but you'll work with china
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:27.920]  and state-run stuff they say we're not even showing up and it's because if you watch those
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:36.080]  hearings on c-spanner in person like i've done those senators are lawyers and they know how to
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.960]  act smart they know how to play golf but man they don't know anything about the internet they don't
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:47.440]  know about starting a business they don't have any optics so imagine the president is trying to drive
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:52.720]  the car and he can't even look out the window because it's all blacked out because he doesn't
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:57.840]  have anybody working for him that knows what's going on and he just is in the blind going well
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.400]  i've got a few readouts here that i could cut taxes and i could if tariffs aren't fair i could
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:06.560]  lower them and people already like there's a genius inside that cockpit what's he doing
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:11.200]  he can't even see out there's not even a portal to look out of now we're out here on the outside
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:17.760]  watching it with dr pacinic saying is central he needs a cyber council everything is this
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:23.440]  before the election and after so that's the biggest blind spot is they're cutting trump
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:28.960]  out from under himself they're they're undercutting our economy the cyber is kind of scared that we
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:34.400]  may wake up so they've all run to china and it's just a very very dangerous position to be in because
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:39.920]  i don't say this act smart i sat there and i watched google in person and then on television go
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:45.200]  go we're not building any censorship we don't know what you're talking about three weeks later
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:49.680]  the head of google's in a letter like you ought to love it it'll help you what's the big deal we're
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:58.560]  just curating like applehead said and i look at this that's a double entendry tim cook is a little
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:04.720]  rotten applehead i mean these people are classic authoritarians prancing around helping a dictatorship
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:11.040]  kill people and then saying we took alex jones off he's a fascist and they're engaged in a total
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:15.680]  purge of everybody's speech that's even killing their own platforms and people are resigning from
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:21.600]  all these institutions in mass and they're just virtue signaling so dr pacinic what does the
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:28.240]  president do because now in today's economy cyber stuff is obviously tied to everything
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:32.240]  and so i think it's the only place trump hasn't acted yet he's done a few things but i think he
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:37.520]  should act now what would you do if you were advising the president i would tell him there's a
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:42.800]  general named keith alexander who's now in private practice i've worked with him in g2
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:50.880]  and he's worked in other areas he has a private company i would make him a cabinet level officer
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:58.480]  cabinet level where he would be in charge and then he would oversee everything in cyber security
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:05.200]  make sure we were number one in cyber security in the world make sure that google facebook and
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:12.960]  every other so-called technical company complies with our constitution and doesn't eradicate our
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:20.080]  first amendment rights and basically once you have that cabinet position it will override john bolton
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:25.600]  it will override the defense department and basically make it a cabinet position right now
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:32.400]  we have a very good general named not persona who is the deputy to keith alexander but we need it at
[02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:38.640]  the cabinet level i cannot have cyber security in the department of homeland security where it's
[02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:45.200]  buried i can't have the cia have the unit i can't have the fbi have the unit it's too fragmented
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:52.480]  i do not need f-35s that are failing these are super fighters that are stealth they can't fly
[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:58.960]  385 million for each one of these planes instead i could have built a whole capability
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:05.200]  in national security on cyber command cyber security the reason i wrote well the enemy
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:10.240]  jets could never even take off but but expanding on that this this the national security crisis
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:16.160]  is and that's why big techs running circles around trump is he has a bunch of buffoons in there
[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:19.360]  that they don't even know what they're dealing with i mean everything is cyber
[02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:27.600]  and and and it's a crisis well i agree with you but he picked john bolton and he picked him for
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:33.040]  reasons that i don't agree with john was never qualified to be in this position i've known
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:39.440]  john over several administrations he has one thing that i share with him which is i'm against the un
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:45.040]  it's totally useless i've used them in peacekeeping they were worthless but john got rid of the cyber
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:50.240]  security you have a general there who's a good general cali but he knows nothing about what's
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:53.680]  happening trump's supposedly going to talk to him at the end of the month and the pentagon's
[02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:59.040]  going to talk to him first uh talk to these people they need to call them in and say stop lying and
[02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:02.880]  they should send the heads of the companies not their underlings and if they send underlings and
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:07.840]  don't and and then lie i'm sorry this is the number one national security threat these people are
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:12.800]  the threat they're the ones selling us out to china and so they need to either get out of the way
[02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:15.840]  or they need to get in some serious trouble because right now they've shown themselves
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:21.280]  be authoritarian monsters correct i agree with you there has to be a penalty for what they do
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:26.640]  and i i would have it imposed from somebody who is at the cabinet level where it's created
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:32.560]  john bolton has no idea about cyber security he's part of the Yale group with bob woodward david
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:38.880]  martin all of those boys cheney he's one of cheney's little boys and bush juniors little boys i mean
[02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:44.800]  these are all big techs running circles around them and laughing at them correct they are because
[02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:50.160]  they can call them a neocon and they say oh well he created the iraq war and we're for peace and
[02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:55.760]  we're for love and for everything of course they too are fascist fascists don't come only from the
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:01.520]  right side they come from the left side so you have equally two fascist societies and you and i
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:07.920]  are in the middle where they demonetize me and they demonetize you so whatever narrative we have
[02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:12.880]  we're cutting through all this fascism and saying you know what i really don't even need the federal
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:18.880]  government i don't need and you were right on when you said about senators do you think senator rubio
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:25.280]  from florida has any intellect he comes out of the santa fe college here right next to me he's not
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:31.840]  the brightest whip he had a history of questionable sexuality his brother-in-law was in the drug
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:38.160]  business he says his parents came over because they fled communist and nonsense i was born in cuba
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:44.480]  rubio was not born in cuba he's an american never served our country went to Mormon areas and he
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:50.720]  did nothing but sick be a sick offense so he could get to the top he never created a business
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:56.400]  never understood how to do anything constructive but that's your senator the other senator i have
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:03.200]  as a moron bill nelson graduate of Yale made sure that all our mosaic mind come and by the way i want
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:08.400]  to go into hearing and see smart senators as a citizen it's frightening to not think of myself
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  as an expert and then i literally literally go i know hundreds of times what they do about the
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:19.200]  internet cyber security and the chai comms because i actually read what the chai comms brag about the
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:24.080]  chai comms brag in their newspapers how there are enemy and how they've bought us up and how we're
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:30.880]  a joke and it pisses me off well it pisses you off and it pisses me off but when i wrote pack
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:37.200]  specific at 25 years ago the only one who understood it was the former cia chief of the
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:43.120]  commie of china that was jim lily who understood that i was warning that there would be a war
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:47.840]  over the spratley islands and lo and behold where are we we're coming in let me ask you that what do
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:55.440]  you think china is doing even claiming territorial waters down by the philippines and belligerently
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:02.960]  did what is their point in all this that you have to understand china's notion of itself is not as a
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:08.960]  nation it's as the middle kingdom in other words they belong to all of asia and all of asia belongs
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:14.480]  to china that is a complex that even bush senior talked about but we were aware of it when i had
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:20.000]  to deal with the chinese everything really belongs to them you have to feed them you have to nurture
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:27.040]  them because destiny is theirs and time is on their side so they claim that the entire south china sea
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:33.120]  is theirs when in fact we do not belong there with our saint pack commanders in fact we have been there
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:39.040]  longer than the chinese as a national security element and we're basically stating we're not
[02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:43.760]  leaving the south china sea we're not leaving the spratley islands question that they've been shooting
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:48.240]  at our ships and threatening so trumps increase patrols and what do you expect to happen there
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:54.240]  well what's happening in and general madis understands that that we're basically going
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:57:00.160]  to increase our military presence our navy presence our nuclear presence our air force presence
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:06.880]  so that china will back off at some point because literally she cannot afford what he's doing at
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:12.400]  this point china is not in a position after 30 years of self-aggrandization we got to go to
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:15.520]  break come back come back in two minutes and do five minutes on china because i know you're really
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:20.160]  smart on it and then where you see this going because yeah their population is their problem
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:24.880]  and and and all the destabilization there and what they're thinking straight ahead and then

[02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:51.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:18.400]  all right dr steve machinic steve machinic dot com is our guest find out his latest books there on
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:23.840]  his site coming up matt bracken is going to break down 22 days out where the democrats planning
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:29.120]  for violence false flags who knows we'll talk about it but getting back to china because it's
[03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:33.120]  central into the 60 minutes interview the president said listen we don't have any evidence that russia's
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:37.120]  really doing anything and i'm certainly not involved in them but whatever forget russia
[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:44.240]  china's the big issue and you look at the left and the corporations and the democrats basically
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:50.560]  bending over backwards to defend china in the final equation they're building all these little islands
[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:57.440]  which is a repeat of the japanese seizing islands so i guess their argument is we won't have to seize
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:03.840]  islands if we just build islands but i just don't it seems like at a very primitive level
[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:08.320]  kind of like just planting the flag and then shooting at our ships don't they know
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:13.600]  that if they did have america under their control they did it because they were going slow and i
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:17.920]  think you said earlier i think they're pushing too hard is awakening the sleeping giant even
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:23.440]  vice president pence who i know you don't trust he said there's a growing consensus that china is
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:31.200]  the threat i agree with that and what china has to remember is number one we have about a hundred
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:37.280]  two hundred bases all around china china is aware of it but they don't really understand
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:42.960]  how we can affect them let me give you an example when china is out of control i might suggest
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:51.360]  that we uh stimulate a problem on the on the border of butan where the indian army comes in and
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:58.320]  basically has a a conflict or small what we call low intensity conflict with the chinese
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:07.040]  armies over the water in the ganji because china is highly highly dependent on water if we close
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:14.000]  off the himalayas and we close off the water supplies that come to china china will die
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:21.360]  very quickly she knows this we know this so that's number one water starvation number two
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:28.640]  they have a false economy where the debt to asset ratio is negative in other words they
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:34.720]  don't want to admit that the trillions of dollars of mortgages are worthless yet they put it on the
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:40.320]  book as if they had assets worth trillions of dollars they refuse to do what we call mark to
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:45.360]  the market in other words your trillion dollar debt isn't worth but one million dollars so he
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:52.320]  doesn't want to do that number three he's using a lot of repression for any dissidents who comes out
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:58.480]  now when you have a population that's under the age of 30 and your percentage of the population
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:05.600]  is going up to 30 40 where they're the under the age of 30 you no longer are in control despite the
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:11.600]  fact that you might think you're the head of a communist party which is an arcane institution
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:18.560]  in china as i said before Mao Zedong who is not really the leader of china of the new china it was
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:26.080]  dong chao ping who said go forth and use whatever you need to do but hide your strength and buy your
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:34.880]  time she has failed to do that repeatedly and the chinese people understand that he has a problem
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:41.520]  the pla is not happy with him if he doesn't have enough money at the same time he's suppressing
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:49.200]  the eduards the muslim chinese who make up a major percentage of his army and national security force
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:55.600]  the more he represses them the bigger the problem is going to be so it's not hard to destabilize
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:04:02.080]  china sure they have something like 7 000 riots a month in china correct and they don't advertise
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:08.480]  that but that's exactly and it's going up in and in the numbers we can increase the numbers
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:12.640]  at will so the bottom line is china's been pushing us around with traders inside the government
[03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:17.200]  prompt just doing moderate resistance which is derailing them because they're so weak and now
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:22.560]  they they respect it more and more they're gonna probably have to capitulate at some point they're
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:28.800]  gonna have to capitulate because now they've uh co-opted vietnam malaysia indochina they've made
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:35.200]  enemies of everybody around chinese sea but trump says one thing that's very important and we have
[03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:40.880]  to listen to it he sometimes is more concerned about it all right hold on that's a cliffhanger
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:44.880]  you got to do 60 seconds more on the other side back in 60 seconds dr c picinic that matt braggen
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:49.840]  is taking over what is it trump says it's so important c picinic dot com news wars dot com
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:57.040]  spread those links the enemy hates them words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the
[03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:02.800]  future of humanity right now info lords is being openly targeted by the democratic party left
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:08.480]  to cia operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire soros crime syndicate people say
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:12.480]  why would you start a fight with them because they were already dominating and running america
[03:05:12.480 --> 03:05:17.440]  into the ground and i knew we had no future if we didn't do this so we've already had incredible
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:23.520]  success but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:28.480]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us that if you spread the
[03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:34.640]  word about our articles and videos info wars dot com we won't just continue to stand up against these

[03:06:00.400 --> 03:06:07.920]  china has been chosen to muscle out the rest of the world but i love this china live raw and unfiltered
[03:06:08.640 --> 03:06:15.120]  it's the alex joneshow the china is run by an authoritarian system i love the chinese people
[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:19.920]  i love china i want them to have a great future but to blame russia and start to fight with russia
[03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:25.280]  all day when china is the main threat is treasonous but we're here exposing it here with the president
[03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:32.240]  last night on 60 minutes we'll get final comments from dr steve pacenic here it is yeah okay um
[03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:38.560]  people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for flatter me at putin okay you're
[03:06:38.560 --> 03:06:42.800]  i don't understand i have been you don't know what i talked about with putin in the meeting prior to
[03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:48.480]  the president publicly you never say anything hard excuse me i didn't i'm the one that gave
[03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:54.240]  ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers obama didn't you know what he said he said
[03:06:55.440 --> 03:07:03.120]  and blankets i'm the one and he's the one that gave away a part of ukraine where russia now has
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:09.040]  this i mean him personally flatter me i think i'm very tough with him personally i had a meeting
[03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:14.400]  with him the two of us yeah it was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting do you
[03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:21.520]  agree that flatter me at putin is involved in assassinations in poisonings probably he is yeah
[03:07:21.520 --> 03:07:27.360]  probably i mean i don't probably probably but i rely on them it's not in our country why why not
[03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:31.040]  they shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing of course they shouldn't do it that's you know
[03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:38.480]  it do you believe that the russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election well they they meddled
[03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:42.720]  but i think china meddled too and i think i think china meddled and you want to know something
[03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:46.560]  why do you say china why don't you just let me ask you russians meddled because i think china
[03:07:46.560 --> 03:07:54.320]  meddled also and i think frankly china this is a bigger problem you're diverting the whole russian
[03:07:54.320 --> 03:08:01.200]  thing i'm not doing anything i'm saying russia but i'm also saying china and notice what he said there
[03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:07.360]  it's obama that allowed all this to happen and it just gets crazier from that point on
[03:08:07.360 --> 03:08:12.080]  when with leslie stahl not even knowing what she's debating or what she's discussing i mean
[03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:16.480]  trump probably have like 500 people killed last week and they're sitting there asking the question
[03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:21.040]  about did this putin kill anybody i mean it's like three-year-old talk isn't it dr pacenek
[03:08:21.920 --> 03:08:27.040]  well it's absurd because if leslie stahl was anyway informed she would have known that on
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:38.000]  february 2018 trump ordered madis to order the b-52s and the apache helicopters to destroy the group
[03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:45.520]  morgan corporation that a Wagner corporation that was working for the gru in syria so we killed
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:51.520]  over 400 russians who attacked our special forces now they don't want to talk about that that's not
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:56.960]  the issue the greater issue for trump and it's going to be harder for people to understand is i
[03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:02.880]  know who are my enemies are and i can handle them the real problem i have is trump is my friends and
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:08.000]  i'm not convinced that nato is a good force and that's where he differs with madis but i agree with
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:15.520]  trump i'm not sure i want to help out japan who demands that we have accompanying ships gun ships
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:20.880]  navy ships in order for them to get oil from the middle east and then turns around and literally
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:27.120]  takes advantage of us in our cars and our science and everything else so he's saying i can handle my
[03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:34.080]  enemies it's my friends that i'm really mistrustful of and that's the key to trump he's the businessman
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:39.840]  he understands what's our national interest it's not personal he doesn't want to be liked he doesn't
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:44.880]  care to be liked even though it sounds like he cares to be liked what he really cares about is
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:50.240]  what is good for america and what are you going to do for us not a what are we going to do for you
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:55.520]  so with china he knows exactly what he's doing he's pushing them to brinksmanship with japan
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:10:01.440]  and abbey he's warning them listen you may take advantage of us and think that you're our ally
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:06.720]  but don't mess with me i've been around business too long so it's my friends that i have to watch
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:12.160]  more so what's the what's the larger what's the larger russia strategy the larger russia strategy
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:18.480]  is he leads putin alone putin hasn't done anything to us that harms us does putin monitor our relation
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:23.840]  he's got better things to do putin is building alliances in iran he has to deal with the middle
[03:10:23.840 --> 03:10:28.960]  east he took over some of our problems in the middle east under obama who didn't know anything
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:34.880]  about what was going on and went into libya and our nato forces went into libya and destroyed the
[03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:40.960]  entire country and what trump is saying you know what i don't want that and with putin i can figure
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:45.760]  out what we need to do you take care of the middle so it's a policy of stability versus the globalist
[03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:52.160]  policy and always creating crises that's where putin and trump get along that's exactly it alex you
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:58.640]  hit it on the point it is stability and national security for our benefit not for the world for
[03:10:58.640 --> 03:11:03.120]  the united states and the russians recognize nationalism and what's for your benefit they respect
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:08.560]  that so in some cases will butt heads but at least it's clear final comment then china is building
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:13.360]  tv and radio stations all along the mescan border beaming in chinese propaganda to the huge chinese
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:17.600]  population that's recently got here i welcome the chinese just become americans don't be chai
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:22.480]  com operatives but they threaten their families back at home not just in pennsylvania or ohio
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:27.600]  or iowa all over the country i see clear chinese propaganda in the austrian american statesmen
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:32.640]  by these uh you know confucian societies at ut i open the paper up you know the old people still
[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:39.920]  read and it's a double spread about oh trump's bad on trade oh this is and it's china's paying for it
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:45.760]  and so we don't have any evidence of russia messing with our elections if they are go after them but
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:51.520]  i mean he's he's pointing out that it's china that is in our business and it needs to be stopped
[03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:56.400]  and some of these little belligerent people that are involved in hollywood other areas working with
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:12:01.200]  china they need to be indicted and that's too embarrassing for everybody whatever needs to
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:05.840]  happen because i want citizens to have rights i have rights you have rights i follow the rules
[03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:10.400]  i'm a constitutionalist i'm a loyal american i'm sick of being sanctioned and attacked like i'm a
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:14.960]  foreign enemy i want to see the real foreign enemies attacked i want to see them to start
[03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:19.680]  having some real problems and i'm saying i'll back the president if they start having real problems
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:23.440]  i think everybody else thinks that don't are pretending i'm sick of sitting here and taking it
[03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:30.320]  well you don't have to take it and right now what what trump is doing is baiting the chinese
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:36.320]  in further so when they have to put in little stations with all this kind of excuses they are
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:42.960]  self-incriminating in a way what he's doing is remember he he understands san zu the chinese
[03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:48.000]  in in the in the very clear national security area we're not part of the communist party
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:54.960]  understands that he's taking down china piece by piece week by week within a few weeks he's
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:13:00.800]  going to meet with g and i'll guarantee you that there will be an agreement because she can not
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:06.480]  continue what he's doing now remember he sent his daughter to the harvard he came here and he spent
[03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:14.320]  time here he has a harvard train finance minister so in effect what ironically is happening kim
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:21.520]  jung an who went to swiss boarding school for many years is far more westernized and sophisticated
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:28.800]  than president chi of china because she is still acting as if he was 40 years ago in the middle
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:36.880]  ages of mao zi tong and has no idea of what he's talking about when in fact he was brutalized his
[03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:44.000]  father was brutalized he has no sense of shame and what he's become is the abusive wife and exactly
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:48.400]  in the u.s is never parlay with north korea we can now use them against china and they'll at least
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:53.360]  make concessions that'll really disquiet china then we have vietnam on their border who's ready
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:58.160]  to go to war with them what about the vietnam front i think if we back vietnam they might even
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:02.640]  because china's already been attacking their their coastal oil fields i bet we could open up a huge
[03:14:02.640 --> 03:14:09.200]  flank of uh non-conventional warfare and guerrilla warfare uh with uh northern vietnam and and the
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:15.040]  chai comes well what you hear again on alex the reason i'm smiling is because the vietnamese
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:21.200]  is the only country to have defeated china three different times and china does not want to go up
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:26.960]  against the vietnamese right now they're in the maycon delta and the vietnamese will handle the
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:33.280]  chinese and the chinese will regret that they ever have to go back into vietnam because they have
[03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:40.480]  defeated the chinese repeatedly and contrary to what we were told in the vietnam war the chinese
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:46.240]  hate the vietnamese and the vietnamese hate the chinese so you're absolutely right we can open
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:51.280]  that front well as you know ho chi men wanted us to ally with him against china and japan we didn't
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:56.800]  do it that's correct but you know your history why didn't you tell us in west moreland that we had
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:01.600]  generals who didn't know that i l l dj that didn't know that i have john f kennedy who didn't know
[03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:08.240]  that please tell me about our leaders they didn't know that the vietnamese never give up well you're
[03:15:08.240 --> 03:15:14.480]  the only one who knew it i knew that but we had to learn it the hard way we had to spend 55 000 men
[03:15:14.480 --> 03:15:19.920]  in a quarter of a million wounded in order to learn the lesson that vietnam had nothing to do with
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:26.080]  our national interests great jobs dr pechenek talk to you soon god bless thank you and god bless you

[03:17:57.040 --> 03:18:02.800]  it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:09.360]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:15.600]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:22.640]  out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there
[03:18:22.640 --> 03:18:28.800]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:34.560]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:41.760]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:47.680]  the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:54.480]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it it's really
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:59.920]  hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to

[03:20:18.960 --> 03:20:25.840]  okay matt bracken for the rest of the hour and uh i'd like to first give a shout out to dr p you
[03:20:25.840 --> 03:20:31.360]  know it's a it's a tough act to follow because the man is just uh his knowledge of these these
[03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:36.320]  affairs is encyclopedic and i just i just learned by listening to him i never want to see him go off
[03:20:36.960 --> 03:20:43.120]  even when i'm coming on but um it reminds me when he was they were talking uh alex and and
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:50.400]  dr uh dr p were talking about the leslie stall interview and what um what basic first level
[03:20:50.400 --> 03:20:56.240]  thinking she uh was showing there on the 60 minutes interview becoming preoccupied with the the
[03:20:56.240 --> 03:21:02.560]  kashogi apparent murder and i'm going to get to that in just a minute but you can you can really
[03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:11.920]  see and and dr p brings us out so so vividly that our president is operating at like a master
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:19.680]  3d chess level and leslie stall right now when i'm picturing her what i'm picturing is that um
[03:21:19.680 --> 03:21:28.960]  that npc meme face over the non-player character role model that from uh from uh you know video games
[03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:35.760]  she just doesn't get it she's obviously being fed information that she doesn't understand anything
[03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:41.760]  about she's fixating on things like you know one one dead uh re you know salty reporter and whether
[03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:46.880]  we're going to you know overturn the world order on this when i'm sure if you asked her about that
[03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:53.760]  wagner group the 400 russians that mattis annihilated in syria she would probably just
[03:21:53.760 --> 03:22:01.200]  stare at you blankly so whereas the the average liberal and the average liberal reporter is
[03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:08.240]  operating on a first level thinking basis trump is acting on so many levels at the same time that
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:14.080]  they basically can't comprehend it yet i think the american the average american voter understands
[03:22:14.080 --> 03:22:21.440]  trump is finally operating on on for the best interests of the united states of america you
[03:22:21.440 --> 03:22:29.840]  know trump often said and says that our trade deals were stupid and that's true but i think he's
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:35.760]  avoiding saying something even harsher which is that the americans making these trade deals
[03:22:35.760 --> 03:22:42.400]  were sellouts they're lining their own pockets by expediting the you know the transfer of our
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:47.600]  technology and our factories to places like china they don't give a damn about you know
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:53.280]  whether or not we make our own military gear in this country or if we could you know surge up a
[03:22:53.280 --> 03:22:59.520]  military buildup in a wartime they don't care as long as they made their money selling you know
[03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:06.400]  selling out our traded our treat our technology our our intellectual property and even our
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:12.640]  factories just shipping them off offshore as long as they can profit in the transfer and that's
[03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:20.480]  what trump is turning around i loved what dr dr p said about about um the you know not worrying
[03:23:20.480 --> 03:23:26.240]  so much about the enemies we can take care of china and russia it's our friends our backstabbing
[03:23:26.240 --> 03:23:35.040]  allies that's harder and leslie stahl she's back on that first level thinker um npc meme face saying
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:40.400]  but but aren't you being harsh or isn't that being rough on our allies i mean she just
[03:23:40.400 --> 03:23:46.640]  doesn't get it no wonder we constantly lose in this global poker game we finally got a hard
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:52.800]  nosed winner in charge and the liberals it just blows their mind they can only see at the first
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:58.880]  level oh he's saying mean things to our allies yeah but he's getting results he wants nato for
[03:23:58.880 --> 03:24:04.560]  example to pants fair share what's wrong with that and you're not going to get there by you
[03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:09.760]  know speaking softly to them or shipping them plain loads of money that's just not going to happen
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:16.320]  now the big news today is obviously a kashogi thing and i've been giving it a lot of thought
[03:24:16.320 --> 03:24:22.640]  i've been uh reading everything i could get my um my hands on in the internet that is and i found a
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:29.920]  really good um alga zero piece that that keeps reloading if you um if you refresh it every half
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:35.680]  hour so it'll actually have the newer stuff at the top and you know it's it's uh extremely
[03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:40.400]  informative because this is really an important story and maybe not for the reasons that people
[03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:47.280]  think you know my first impression of the kashogi hit is it's got to be the world's worst wet up
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:53.440]  you know i mean imagine sending a team of 15 assassins to one of your own consulates
[03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:59.680]  then killing an enemy of the state inside the consulate this absolutely trashes the
[03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:06.000]  saudi reputation worldwide who that's not a stooge for the government will ever willingly
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:13.360]  walk into a Saudi diplomatic mission i mean if it could be a kill box so it brings up the thought
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:20.080]  who benefits you know why would you do this even the Saudis can't be that stupid especially king
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:26.240]  salman now if you just wanted to kill the guy the last thing you would do is lure him into a
[03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:32.320]  consulate where he's filmed going in but not out presumably not filmed going out however
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:39.520]  if you kill him you know in a uh for example a a an arranged traffic accident where he's run down
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:46.400]  crossing the street uh or something like that you know poison in his tea at the hotel uh it might
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:51.200]  look better than you know murdering him inside your own consulate but on the other hand then
[03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:56.400]  you don't get a chance to interrogate him now who would want to interrogate him some of the best
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:01.120]  information that i've seen there's a good article in zero hedge this morning about this some of the
[03:26:01.120 --> 03:26:06.640]  people that may have wanted to interrogate kashogi before killing him could be Saudis that had
[03:26:06.640 --> 03:26:13.200]  advanced knowledge of 9 11 now this is why you don't want to just run him over on a street in
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:19.040]  Istanbul you want to know what he knows and you also want to know maybe who he shared the
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:25.520]  information with so you can go after them also in terms of damage control if during torture
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:31.600]  slash interrogation he can demonstrate to you that it that doesn't matter he's got a a a fail
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:36.480]  safe switch a dead man switch so that if he doesn't come out the information will be released
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:43.280]  well that's worthwhile information in itself but if the if the Saudi intel bosses that had this
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:49.840]  information that want this information um if they could be implicated in pre-knowledge of 9 11
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:56.000]  you know they might be willing to do it now when you say a Saudi intel boss that doesn't necessarily
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:27:02.320]  mean an ally of the king look at our own CIA where Brennan was working for the deep state
[03:27:02.320 --> 03:27:09.040]  against president-elect trump and then against uh against you know president trump in fact
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:14.560]  you can have the same situation in Saudi Arabia the country is in turmoil even though there is
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:21.120]  a new king there are it's virtually an underground civil war taking place with much of the royal
[03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:27.440]  family arrested or exiled and many of the people in place their loyalty might be divided or they
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:33.920]  might secretly be working against the king so if you have a a a trader intel boss who's
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:39.360]  who's on the surface still working within the Saudi government he would be able to possibly
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:45.360]  order this 15 man hit team to the consulate without the exact knowledge of the higher levels
[03:27:45.360 --> 03:27:50.720]  of the Saudi government that they were going to kill Khashoggi then it's a win-win if they
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:58.000]  interrogate him the report the report gets back to the uh the you know the uh traitorous intel boss
[03:27:58.880 --> 03:28:03.520]  indicating whether or not you know the fact that he had pre-knowledge of 9 11 will be reported or
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:11.920]  not and if this damages King Salomon then it's a twofer so you so you possibly help the uh enemies
[03:28:11.920 --> 03:28:18.320]  of the king because this is just ruinous to Saudi Arabia's reputation Pompeo's flying over there
[03:28:18.320 --> 03:28:24.320]  right now to read them the riot act so this this is you know a real uh vipers nest inside of
[03:28:24.320 --> 03:28:30.400]  Saudi Arabia and by no means can you assume that if this hit happened it was ordered by the king
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:37.840]  it can definitely be a rogue operation in a sense the way that Trump inarticulately put it this
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:44.560]  morning and we'll be back in a little bit um we'll start taking calls so if there are calls um we'll

[03:33:13.920 --> 03:33:26.320]  okay matt bracken i'm back uh for the rest of this hour and the calling number is 877-789-2539
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:34.720]  877-789-2539 and we'll be taking calls in a bit yet to wrap up this kashegi thing
[03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:41.200]  the novelist in me looks at this and and just really marvels because it's got so many elements
[03:33:41.200 --> 03:33:47.520]  of a of a thriller or a spy movie if everybody here presumably if you're watching this show
[03:33:48.080 --> 03:33:56.240]  you're seeing the movie with gene hackman called enemy of the state this is this involves somebody
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:03.200]  accidentally filming a hit and then the flash drive i believe with the information on it is passed
[03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:10.000]  to a friend i believe that's denzel washington and the next thing you know the nsa is chasing after
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:16.640]  everybody that might have this this uh damaging information so in this case you've got kashegi
[03:34:16.640 --> 03:34:24.000]  wearing an apple watch into the consulate and it's synced up to record to the smartphone that is left
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:30.720]  outside either with his fiance or somebody else uh then the the smartphone maybe that gets handed
[03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:37.360]  to somebody else or maybe it's the information is sent automatically in real time to the cloud
[03:34:37.360 --> 03:34:43.920]  somewhere and we might in in this the two weeks since this happened have this big chase for this
[03:34:43.920 --> 03:34:50.000]  information because it could conceivably have the voice of kashegi being tortured and murdered and
[03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:55.360]  possibly sought up if you can imagine now if the turks had it and they wanted the damage
[03:34:55.360 --> 03:35:01.200]  saudi arabia they could release it for black or they could hold it back for blackmail purposes
[03:35:01.200 --> 03:35:08.000]  or the big actors the usa turkey saudi arabia they might all be trying to figure out who really
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:13.440]  did the hit and what does king salman have to do with it because they if it was a rogue element
[03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:19.440]  doing this to take to take down the king they they won't want that to happen but imagine how
[03:35:19.440 --> 03:35:24.560]  what big stakes these are imagine you're like the friend of the fiance and you're holding this smartphone
[03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:31.440]  right now with the images and the sounds on it uh it would be a terrifying time running around europe
[03:35:31.440 --> 03:35:38.880]  and the middle east trying to stay one step ahead of how many uh intel agency assassins it's it's
[03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:45.200]  right out of uh right out of a james bonder a tom cruise movie you know it seriously is and uh
[03:35:45.840 --> 03:35:51.920]  maybe this is a a lesson from this is don't look at the first level the first level is
[03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:58.560]  you know the the bad evil saudi's sent a hit team to kill this guy in the consulate maybe that's true
[03:35:58.560 --> 03:36:05.360]  the saudi's are not known for having the highest national IQ but seriously would you do that when
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:10.240]  it's going to obviously blow back in your face this is like pulling a pin on a grenade and holding
[03:36:10.240 --> 03:36:17.920]  it up to your chest it's just so self-destructive maybe it happened that way maybe this is a turkish
[03:36:17.920 --> 03:36:24.240]  play maybe the guy did get out and nobody has it on film but i i tend to think that he came out in
[03:36:24.240 --> 03:36:31.200]  uh you know in a in a couple of suitcases and uh is never going to be found he's probably fed the
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:37.680]  jackals in the uh desert somewhere on the flight back to saudi arabia but uh it's it's a dirty
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:43.840]  business but um it's very interesting and i'm i'm going to uh be interested to see how this unfolds
[03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:49.120]  over the coming days well matt bracken we know how it's unfolding right now and the best thinking of
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:54.720]  my good sources the pentagon even steve bachanik ish why would the saudi's do this at somebody
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:59.840]  else's embassy in turkey who they're basically in conflict with with 15 guys it's the worst
[03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:04.400]  place ever to kill somebody it'd be perfect for diplomatic crisis it's just like trump
[03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:09.680]  can't even run two or three levels deep his own white house with the leaks and as you pointed out
[03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:15.520]  the cia the justice department moles the stay behind networks that are they're doing all this
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:20.240]  those are really really great points but here it is this is coming out uh the washroom post you name
[03:37:20.240 --> 03:37:28.800]  it breaking cnn reports saudi's it is cnn preparing to admit that uh mr jamal kashoggi
[03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:35.360]  was killed in an interrogation gone wrong cnn reported on monday it's just minutes ago that
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:41.040]  saudi arabia is preparing to report in which they admit that jamal kashoggi the washroom post
[03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:46.000]  columnist who went missing earlier this year was killed in an interrogation gone wrong so see how
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:52.720]  do they deny it if it's a rogue group in their own agency like the king and told trump kashoggi
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:37:57.760]  that makes them look even weaker if they're not in control see a prominent saudi dissident went
[03:37:57.760 --> 03:38:03.120]  missing after walking into the saudi consulate in istanbul on top of second turkish officials
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:07.520]  said they have proof he was murdered and dismembered by a team of saudi agents a charge the saudi
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:12.960]  government vehemently denied but see now they learn no it was your government per cnn however the
[03:38:12.960 --> 03:38:18.800]  saudi's are preparing a report admitting that they intended to abduct and bring kashoggi back
[03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:24.880]  to saudi arabia but that he was inadvertently killed in the process report is intended per cnn
[03:38:24.880 --> 03:38:29.200]  to absolve the saudi government responsibility for the murder by claiming the operation was not
[03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:36.320]  cleared so again the rogue situation showing trump knows what was going on uh has exposed it so they're
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:43.040]  actually confirming the rogue scenario cnn's arma damon reported that istanbul that's turkey the
[03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:47.760]  report will be most likely concluded operation was carried out without clearance and transparency
[03:38:47.760 --> 03:38:53.040]  and that those involved be held responsible so we've got false flags being admitted here uh
[03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:58.160]  damon added that the saudi's report is still being prepared and could change which who knows
[03:38:58.160 --> 03:39:04.640]  means cnn's putting a spin that they admit it but really the spin is that it was rogue like we said
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:11.600]  because kibono who benefits fits into that uh to derail uh trump's larger plan to stabilize the
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:16.880]  middle east versus the globalist plan of destabilization so you notice these provisos by cnn
[03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:21.520]  show them continually just like on trump said to declassify evans they were trying to set him up
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:25.440]  he now has that leverage against them to make the deep state capitulate but will they really
[03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:31.760]  capitulate instead they spend things like this what my question would still be you know even
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:37.920]  with this clarification and it's very important is what information did the whoever ordered the
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:43.360]  15 men you know somebody had to have pretty high level clearance to order a 15 man team apparently
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:48.800]  they cleared out the consulate like you know an hour before kashogi arrives so they have nobody
[03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:54.480]  but these 15 men in the consulate you know so that i presumably so that the ladies at the front
[03:39:54.480 --> 03:40:00.240]  desk don't hear the screaming and aren't able to report it later uh other actors might have been
[03:40:00.240 --> 03:40:03.840]  you know you can use lasers and microwaves on windows things like that depending on how
[03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:07.440]  sophisticated the counter surveillance sure and they say they have recorders this is the worst
[03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:12.800]  place ever to do this so let me ask you this gut level everybody agrees it's the setup and kill the
[03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:20.080]  peace deal but what is that the only motive or is it what kashogi under what he knew yeah i think
[03:40:20.080 --> 03:40:25.760]  it's what he knew because in terms of doing a snatch on the street with a van you know roll
[03:40:25.760 --> 03:40:34.000]  up in a carpet that kind of you know the they'll old standbys um kashogi is going to be a very hard
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:38.880]  person to capture that way this is like trying to capture the you know the granddaddy jack rabbit
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:45.120]  that people have been hunting for for 20 years i mean you know he's he's a guy who's wily he knows
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:49.760]  all the tricks of the trade he's been in and out of the intel community in terms of uh
[03:40:49.760 --> 03:40:56.720]  he thinks he's meeting with his buddies or he or he's he really thinks that this is clear he's
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:02.000]  gotten high level assurances that he's good to go for the divorce papers he can't get married
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:07.600]  without them i think it's foolish for him to walk into any Saudi embassy or consulate but it shows
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:13.600]  that whoever ordered the hit was very desperate to get what he had inside of his brain no matter
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:19.680]  what it took even to kill him and cause a huge flap like this because it tells me that if kashogi
[03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:25.440] 's planted the information on you know into some kind of a failsafe situation where you know it's
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:31.600]  going to be disseminated after his death then uh this could blow 9 11 wide open because a lot of
[03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:37.760]  people seem to believe that these high level intel people uh they knew about 9 11 gearing up you know
[03:41:37.760 --> 03:41:42.720]  maybe not the exact target but they knew all about obl and the teams in the usa sure we know
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:47.360]  that's a lever trumps got over him to make Saudi Arabia capitulate we'll be right back at the final

[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:31.520]  final segment and we're going to go straight to calls now and uh you work people are thinking
[03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:39.360]  not necessarily on saudi arabia but anything um i see uh jason in canada uh says going after the
[03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:49.520]  enemy at the top uh jason are you there yeah i'm here matt go ahead jason well i just feel like uh
[03:47:49.520 --> 03:47:56.240]  you know with just sum up a lot of things that's happened over the years the isomic invasion uh
[03:47:56.240 --> 03:48:02.800]  the anti solar riots that are happening now and stuff um you know just kind of like the setup for
[03:48:02.800 --> 03:48:10.400]  catastrophe it's happening around the world and i'm just wondering like it do you know like is there
[03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:18.560]  any plans to move on the the real instigators of all this like to move at the top of the pyramid
[03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:25.440]  the george source and the uh you know the the bill gates and stuff you know well i i don't know
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:31.360]  about that but i i i think that uh everybody's waiting for the for the midterm election results
[03:48:31.360 --> 03:48:36.800]  the uh the left is already losing it over um cavernal being confirmed on the supreme court
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:42.240]  they're talking about basically the giving up on the constitution that the electoral college means
[03:48:42.240 --> 03:48:46.640]  there's no more democracy so i think that we're going to move into a whole new stage after the
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:52.240]  midterms but until then we just have to wait and see um you know if the republicans hold the senate
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:59.040]  in the congress the democrats are going to lose their minds um let's go to um ashley in missouri
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:04.240]  i want to take a lot of calls quickly because they're they're stacked up ashley in missouri go ahead
[03:49:05.440 --> 03:49:09.920]  yeah mr bracken it's an honor to speak with you um you've been talking about this new platform
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:16.400]  that uh that you're gonna announce that's coming out and uh in reference to that i listened to an
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:23.680]  interview uh by robert david steel the other day on x-22 report spotlight and he was talking about
[03:49:23.680 --> 03:49:29.520]  a new platform that's coming out also and i was just wondering is there any connection between what
[03:49:29.520 --> 03:49:37.120]  he's working on and and what i'm not familiar with with uh what steel is working on but um
[03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:43.600]  i've been working on a program a platform called uh free zoxie dot com basically has an alternative
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:49.200]  to uh twitter facebook and youtube uh the link you know there's a there's a link at the top
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:54.560]  of my twitter feed if you're into anybody's interested but the basic uh the basic rundown
[03:49:54.560 --> 03:50:01.040]  is we need more alternatives than just uh you know trying to post on liberal social media uh
[03:50:01.040 --> 03:50:05.520]  there's a there's a an existing platform out there you know gag which i've been on for two years
[03:50:06.160 --> 03:50:12.960]  which has a lot of strong points um but it's not really a video hosting site either it's sort of a
[03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:19.440]  twitter clone and uh you know we'll be we'll be uh you know trying to roll out more functions on
[03:50:19.440 --> 03:50:23.920]  free zoxie as time goes on the point isn't that these are going to you know replace facebook
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:29.280]  and twitter tomorrow but as censorship ratchets up and you know it gets tighter and tighter on
[03:50:29.280 --> 03:50:35.280]  liberal social media people should start thinking about uh you know alternate communications channels
[03:50:35.280 --> 03:50:40.800]  the more that there are the harder it will be for big brother to to uh you know censor us social
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:46.560]  network analyze us track us trace us you know the the the more channels that are open the better
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:52.720]  i welcome them all and uh you know free zoxie is one that that i'm uh you know helping to start
[03:50:52.720 --> 03:51:00.640]  up but uh you know i i also recommend you know gab and others um to uh brine and washington talking
[03:51:00.640 --> 03:51:08.560]  back to saudi arabia brine go ahead hey how's it going uh great thanks i just want to say
[03:51:08.560 --> 03:51:13.520]  something real quick uh um i really hope that the supplements don't get uh blocked and that you
[03:51:13.520 --> 03:51:17.840]  got to keep telling them because they've changed my life i don't have no kidneys i'm on dialysis
[03:51:17.840 --> 03:51:21.200]  and all my levels have been great i work out every day i've gained almost 10 pounds of
[03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:25.600]  muscle so just thank you guys for that thank you alex um and my message the other day that's
[03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:31.760]  beautiful god first and having cries in our hearts i think alex also because after i sent
[03:51:31.760 --> 03:51:36.800]  that message to alex he uh he touched on it for two days in a row and i appreciate that it just
[03:51:36.800 --> 03:51:42.400]  shows that if one person says something speaks out that the message could spread pretty easy um
[03:51:42.400 --> 03:51:49.120]  about saudi arabia the man i seen what happened and heard i already knew it was a setup i mean
[03:51:49.120 --> 03:51:53.600]  they're not only trying to stop what trump is doing in our country but they're trying to stop it
[03:51:53.600 --> 03:51:58.640]  around the world because globalism isn't just america it's they're strapping down on all
[03:51:58.640 --> 03:52:03.680]  countries and right now trump has sparked an evolution or a revolution around the world
[03:52:03.680 --> 03:52:08.480]  and everybody's seeing and hearing freedom and they want it they want freedom they want liberties
[03:52:08.480 --> 03:52:12.480]  and they don't want to be strapped down by the globalists and have everything cooking for them
[03:52:12.480 --> 03:52:18.720]  and and and be under authoritarianism and um so i already knew that's a very good point a very good
[03:52:18.720 --> 03:52:28.160]  point that's a great point go ahead go ahead these people following them around the world
[03:52:28.160 --> 03:52:34.960]  to shut down his speech and his movement um i don't know if you've seen the interview with the
[03:52:34.960 --> 03:52:45.040]  the chinese um sorry i'm having a blank the chinese uh ambassador or whatever um they had an interview
[03:52:45.040 --> 03:52:49.280]  and the guy on fox classified was giving them questions and he was basically putting them
[03:52:49.280 --> 03:52:54.000]  on the spot like uh they say that you guys are spying on america and that you're storing our
[03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:58.400]  information and you know basically the main subjects they've been talking about and his guy
[03:52:59.200 --> 03:53:04.400]  every time this ambassador would would answer the question he would completely deny it but when
[03:53:04.400 --> 03:53:09.600]  he starts talking his eyes will start blinking a lot they start blinking super fast his face will
[03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:15.760]  start flinching and uh it was pretty miraculous to see this guy try to deny what china's doing
[03:53:16.320 --> 03:53:21.360]  and you know he's representing china and getting it with a hardball question well they're like
[03:53:21.360 --> 03:53:26.800]  they're in a whole no well they're they're in a whole new world with president trump you know
[03:53:26.800 --> 03:53:32.400]  they they're they're used to these uh you know ivy league uh state department walks that are
[03:53:32.400 --> 03:53:38.960]  basically squishes and half of them are just setting up their post uh their their post government
[03:53:38.960 --> 03:53:44.720]  career you know by selling out our country you know with the payoff to come after retirement
[03:53:44.720 --> 03:53:50.000]  and that's all ending with trump it's a new sheriff in town that's for sure um let's hey uh
[03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:56.080]  pastor sam in texas we're going to talk about the uh central american guatemalan caravan go ahead
[03:53:56.080 --> 03:54:04.960]  pastor sam yes matt you're there all over yes i'm here can you do you read yeah loud and clear go
[03:54:04.960 --> 03:54:11.680]  ahead excellent yes it's all over drugs today even uh posting some older articles about central
[03:54:11.680 --> 03:54:18.160]  american politics uh mike penn just met with three central american presidents last week
[03:54:18.160 --> 03:54:25.360]  talking about stemming the flow of migrants and uh it seems like there are two contradictory
[03:54:25.360 --> 03:54:31.440]  messages going out the caravan departing right after at the same time as the vice president met
[03:54:31.440 --> 03:54:36.000]  with them and i'd like to weigh in on that but uh you first you've probably snooped and pooped
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:45.040]  all through central america yeah you know the the key to this is mexico um by them facilitating
[03:54:45.040 --> 03:54:51.680]  this passage of this caravan and just the illegal migrant trade in general they're not acting as our
[03:54:51.680 --> 03:54:56.960]  friend that's for sure it's a very hostile act and you know president trump is it deals in real
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:55:04.320]  politic and i hope that he just turns the screws back uh on mexico where he can um you know i go i
[03:55:04.320 --> 03:55:10.720]  remember all the way back i believe it was on in the nixon era when uh or actually it was uh gosh
[03:55:10.720 --> 03:55:17.360]  when was this i think push the first they um they kidnapped an american dea guy down in mexico the
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:22.800]  cartels did and we knew that they had mexican federal you know the mexican government was wrapped
[03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:28.160]  up in this you know working with the cartels they just clamped down on the border so hard that the
[03:55:28.160 --> 03:55:33.520]  that traffic was backed up you know 24 hours going into mexico they said until we until we find out
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:39.200]  what happened to our dea man uh i think his name was kiki camarena uh we're going to search every
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:44.640]  vehicle for an hour and you know there are ways to apply the screws to mexico so just allowing them
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:50.640]  to have another uh big parade of care of uh guatemalan immigrants straight to the border all paid for
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:55.440]  you know with ultimately with george soros money i don't think it should fly i don't think that they
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:55:59.840]  should be allowed asylum they're in a state they're in mexico you don't just get to go wherever you
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:05.440]  want in the world and claim asylum so i would i would be more forcible this time in rejecting them
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:09.920]  you know at the border uh make them you know if they're in california make them report to texas
[03:56:09.920 --> 03:56:16.400]  then send them back to california just don't play the game you know be be rough um let's see uh
[03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:23.200]  i got james in louisiana uh china and saudi arabia go ahead james you've been on for a while
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:30.400]  yes sir uh pleasure speaking i've actually been deprived of uh the info wars kind of sort of
[03:56:30.400 --> 03:56:37.360]  because uh the app has been lagging tremendously and i can't find no links anywhere really but uh
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:45.440]  but to my point this whole saudi arabian scuffle with the journalist i really hope trump is just
[03:56:45.440 --> 03:56:52.400]  pandering to the military complex and talking about not really wanting to withdraw the arm sales
[03:56:52.400 --> 03:57:01.040]  and stuff like that because i i mean come on now that's they that's should be something that shouldn't
[03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:07.760]  be bought about cutting off and you know it's when you're talking about factories in the usa
[03:57:07.760 --> 03:57:13.440]  that are geared up years ahead of time to produce jets and things like that it is a major disruption
[03:57:13.440 --> 03:57:17.680]  and you know we don't even know the facts of this case yet too so to you know to basically
[03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:22.240]  cause factories to be closed in the usa people thrown out of work i wouldn't go for that head
[03:57:22.240 --> 03:57:28.240]  fake you know not on what we know all right thanks a lot everybody uh we're going to be
[03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:33.680]  out of here and i'll see you the next time uh that i'm guest hosting or just guesting on info wars
[03:57:34.320 --> 03:57:38.560]  and uh it's a great time to be alive well let's wait for those midterms we'll see you
[03:57:43.040 --> 03:57:48.560]  x2 we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much
[03:57:48.560 --> 03:57:53.040]  we were buying and they said oh we want more money more money and oh this and that and so
[03:57:53.040 --> 03:57:58.480]  i've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes
[03:57:58.480 --> 03:58:03.120]  in next to it that literally is so pure that if you put in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree
[03:58:03.120 --> 03:58:08.640]  hot plate it gasses like i dream of genie and then this purple gas i mean that is so pure it
[03:58:08.640 --> 03:58:12.320]  just goes right into your body when you take it we're working on trying to get other suppliers
[03:58:12.320 --> 03:58:19.040]  right now but i bought a huge amount of it ordered it six months ago so i get the price down and i
[03:58:19.040 --> 03:58:23.760]  said if you don't lower it i'm done i'm breaking the contract well i broke the contract last week
[03:58:23.760 --> 03:58:27.920]  and so this is potentially the last run in fact right now it is the last run
