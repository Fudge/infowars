[00:00.000 --> 00:23.840]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com
[00:23.840 --> 00:40.680]  studios it's alex jones the info wars servers are laboring right now under
[00:40.680 --> 00:50.080]  record traffic as the world tunes in to hear but myself and my guests are going
[00:50.080 --> 00:55.400]  to break down and say and what collars to this broadcast are going to say about the
[00:55.400 --> 01:03.040]  historic incredibly bold move that we witnessed yesterday by the president I
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.600]  came up here last night shot a special report at 10 p.m. right as the president
[01:09.600 --> 01:17.280]  was taking credit for what unfolded we have the top link at drudge report
[01:17.280 --> 01:25.680]  dot com and you can see it there and we have live feeds embedded in that report
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.520]  sleeper cells in the USA and the report details of the FBI has already arrested
[01:32.520 --> 01:38.920]  people that were clearly planning sleeper cell attacks we're going to be
[01:38.920 --> 01:52.480]  looking at every angle of that as well I'm asking listeners to really pull back
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.840]  and be cerebral about this and I'm I'm trying to that myself I'm certainly not
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.840]  lecturing you I'm lecturing myself and look geopolitically what's happening
[02:01.840 --> 02:05.920]  around the world and what message President Trump is really sending with
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.920]  this not just to North Korea but also to Obama and Hillary and John Kerry
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.440]  that have been working with Iran publicly against President Trump and
[02:15.440 --> 02:21.200]  Congress and against the law and the fact that they've been encouraging Iran to
[02:21.200 --> 02:27.560]  attack ships sink ships and engage in massive paramilitary activity across the
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.280]  Middle East triggering a wider civil war between Shiites and Sunnis so that's
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.880]  really what's going on here now is it good what President Trump did well let's
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.920]  look at why he did do it and then let's ask ourselves what he was supposed to do
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.760]  if he didn't take action and Iran was given a green light to continue to
[02:50.760 --> 02:55.680]  expand provocations and try to overthrow the Iraqi government and install
[02:55.680 --> 03:02.280]  another domino in their plan for the original Islamic Republic of planet
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.600]  Earth ice this was simply trying to copy from a Sunni perspective with the
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.880]  Shiites have successfully done in Persia and the Iranians are where the word
[03:13.880 --> 03:19.800]  Aryan comes from Hitler modeled his system off of the Aryan plan where they
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.920]  have believed for 3,000 years they have a right to rule the earth the Iranian
[03:24.920 --> 03:30.600]  people are very smart folks and they founded what is modern India today
[03:30.600 --> 03:36.080]  Pakistan they invented chess much of language astronomy and a mixture of
[03:36.080 --> 03:43.280]  that with expansionist Islam is a good case of cancer anyway you slice it so
[03:43.280 --> 03:46.800]  we already had one guy last century saying he was an Aryan going to take
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.880]  over the planet and we do have that going on again I'm not saying I want to
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.680]  have war with Iran I'm not saying they're the devil I'm saying that the
[03:58.680 --> 04:05.640]  Hezbollah militias all over the world are the most expansionist arm of Islam
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.800]  and are working with the globalist deep state against President Trump and
[04:10.800 --> 04:15.320]  America and so that's not being discussed in the news why this happened
[04:15.320 --> 04:20.560]  Israel is bracing for retaliatory strikes as well Pentagon has said that it
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.560]  will be a massive counter strikes if Iran responds disproportionately
[04:25.560 --> 04:29.200]  because this was a response to the attack on the embassy and I want to be
[04:29.200 --> 04:35.400]  crystal clear yet again this is not a false flag this is not a staged event
[04:35.400 --> 04:39.400]  we were attacked our sovereign territory was our troops have been getting
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.600]  killed all over the Middle East and Africa by Shi'at trained groups and so
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.520]  this is a very strong message from the president will the gamble succeed we'll
[04:48.520 --> 04:52.320]  look at the pros and cons or I think it's all going and where you think it's
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.640]  going today let's try it
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.680]  Al killer in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead Alex hey I just want to say
[05:07.680 --> 05:10.680]  it's great to be back once again and I've never gotten to do this but I'm

[05:14.000 --> 05:18.040]  toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level I use the

[05:21.200 --> 05:25.360]  absorbs into your gum it is by far the best product I've ever used in my life
[05:25.360 --> 05:28.960]  I literally just took turbo course on my way to the gym right now I've had four
[05:28.960 --> 05:32.960]  shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.440]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life
[05:36.440 --> 05:39.680]  so I just want to get that out of the way support this man everything that he
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.200]  exposed nobody knew about Bohemian Grove nobody knew about fd nobody knew

[05:47.920 --> 05:50.880]  it up yourself well we try our best sir they definitely want to stop the air

[05:53.600 --> 05:55.720]  sir
[05:55.720 --> 05:57.720]  you
[06:25.720 --> 06:44.320]  this is the potential for World War three and with asymmetric warfare being
[06:44.320 --> 06:49.560]  carried out in Western nations by the Kud's forces and their allied
[06:49.560 --> 06:58.600]  militias of Hezbollah again I am your host Alex Jones we are now into 2020 it
[06:58.600 --> 07:04.400]  is the third day of January 2020 and we are going to open the phones up
[07:04.400 --> 07:09.360]  throughout the next four hours starting at the bottom of the hour and we'll give
[07:09.360 --> 07:17.640]  out toll-free number at the start of the next segment now I am not going to come
[07:17.640 --> 07:25.800]  on this show and choose a side of I'm for this strike or I'm against this
[07:25.800 --> 07:32.960]  strike and I'm not doing that to be lukewarm and to not take aside I'm doing
[07:32.960 --> 07:38.120]  that because I want to look at this for the perspectives of the Iranian
[07:38.120 --> 07:45.360]  government and the individuals running our government and talk about the
[07:45.360 --> 07:50.400]  different players that are involved and what has brought us to this point then
[07:50.400 --> 07:57.520]  at the bottom of the hour I am going to give you my personal view and what I
[07:57.520 --> 08:05.000]  think about this situation and where I think it's headed and what my discernment
[08:05.000 --> 08:14.240]  and spiritual gut level site is on this but I want first to just pull back out
[08:14.240 --> 08:23.560]  of the emotion myself included and I want to analyze the facts here we know
[08:23.560 --> 08:27.760]  that there have been six different chemical attacks that have all been
[08:27.760 --> 08:35.400]  confirmed to be staged in the last five years a good two years before Trump
[08:35.400 --> 08:39.000]  even got into office they'd stage several and the ISIS and al-Qaeda
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.160]  operatives would fire the chemical weapons and put out promo videos wanting
[08:43.160 --> 08:47.680]  to get the praise like rock stars but then the press would still blame the
[08:47.680 --> 08:54.320]  Syrians and the Iranians for it and we would come on air and say that is not
[08:54.320 --> 08:57.800]  the case that is a stage chemical attack and the UN has been forced to come
[08:57.800 --> 09:00.960]  out and say it and it's all been confirmed now and they're really trying
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.240]  to cover that up so when Trump blew up that chemical weapons dump in Syria I
[09:06.240 --> 09:12.000]  got really mad at him because Trump knows good and damn well that that was a
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.680]  stage chemical attack I thought it meant they were about to escalate like they
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.920]  normally do but instead he used that to silence the war hawks and to allow Syria
[09:21.920 --> 09:25.200]  to take its country back from really nasty folks he made Saudi Arabia stop
[09:25.200 --> 09:32.600]  we worked with Iran some to help clean up ISIS but then Iran is now expanding
[09:32.600 --> 09:39.120]  and Iran did have its malicious attack and and take over the embassy and they
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.840]  are killing US contractors and they are killing US troops and they decided that
[09:43.840 --> 09:48.720]  no they're going to have an Islamic Republic out of Iran their own Islamic
[09:48.720 --> 09:52.920]  state that they set up in 1979 worldwide and that's what they teach that's what
[09:52.920 --> 09:57.520]  their Ayatollah teaches and that's what this top general who was second
[09:57.520 --> 10:07.640]  commandant Iran admittedly that's what Salomeini was trying to do and so
[10:07.640 --> 10:10.800]  Trump just can't pull us out of Afghanistan and Syria and Iraq which has
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.920]  been trying to do without getting these groups to stop attacking US interest
[10:16.920 --> 10:20.520]  because Saudi Arabia will then launch an even bigger war and both sides have
[10:20.520 --> 10:25.640]  nuclear weapons Iran already has nukes so does Saudi Arabia and that's why this
[10:25.640 --> 10:32.840]  is all coming to a head and the issue is the delivery systems that Iran has are
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.520]  getting more sophisticated and that's why Israel says is it if it goes much
[10:36.520 --> 10:39.400]  further they're going to attack so regardless of what side you want to be
[10:39.400 --> 10:44.600]  on we're all on this planet that could end up in a giant new war that rivals
[10:44.600 --> 10:50.880]  anything we've ever seen or could be worse and so why have we gotten to this
[10:50.880 --> 10:56.560]  point because the deep state the permanent bureaucracy the CFR the
[10:56.560 --> 11:02.160]  Bilderberg globalist leftist arm of it that works closely with the neocons has
[11:02.160 --> 11:09.520]  been double dealing with Iran Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Fiona Hill the
[11:09.520 --> 11:18.880]  general McMaster types they have been working publicly in shadow diplomacy to
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.200]  derail everything that Trump's trying to do to bring real daytime and a
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.040]  stalemate and an armistice and a ceasefire in Africa in the Middle East and
[11:28.040 --> 11:32.440]  in the globalist strategy of the Arab Spring of breaking Europe's borders of
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.880]  flooding Turkey and of destabilization Trump is really pragmatically saying
[11:38.880 --> 11:41.720]  we're not going to do this in the Middle East is not an issue we're already
[11:41.720 --> 11:46.040]  energy independent in the US we need to pivot to deal with China they're the real
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.240]  threat and the globalist want to divert us and our military and our blood into
[11:50.240 --> 11:57.160]  that sand trap and so Trump has legitimately been trying to end those
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.280]  wars and dial them back and scale down and the globalist have been saying he's
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.760]  wrong he's an idiot and they've been trying to block it instead of having the
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.080]  deep state side with Iran against Saudi Arabia or the deep state side with Saudi
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.320]  Arabia over Iran Trump's tried to set up all the sides stop it but that's not
[12:17.320 --> 12:23.960]  happen and so the Iotola after the embassy was taken over and after the flag
[12:23.960 --> 12:31.400]  and all the rest of it was captured he came out and he vowed that Trump could
[12:31.400 --> 12:36.080]  do nothing and that Trump was a joke well now you see that's not the case but
[12:36.080 --> 12:45.560]  why did he do that because continually the deep state had been giving them
[12:45.560 --> 12:52.400]  intel and advising them to cause a crisis by sinking ships in the straight
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.920]  over moose and the Persian Gulf just like Michael Moore said when President
[12:56.920 --> 13:00.200]  Trump was president elect they said oh we're gonna embarrass him with Iran and
[13:00.200 --> 13:08.200]  with North Korea but in both cases Trump has been able to put pressure like he
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.920]  did with North Korea and get them to come to the table at least ending the
[13:12.920 --> 13:19.120]  escalation that Kim Jong-un was involved in trying to start a war with his
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.360]  neighbors under globalist direction and Chaikom direction Trump got him to stop
[13:23.360 --> 13:27.360]  all that at least to back off that had gotten the big permanent deal but he
[13:27.360 --> 13:36.600]  got him to back off because the US was about to invade two years ago and so
[13:36.600 --> 13:45.560]  now they're doing that again and Trump is letting Iran know just like the
[13:45.560 --> 13:51.160]  situation with North Korea that carried of the stick if you stop all this the
[13:51.160 --> 13:54.320]  sanctions will go away and we'll work with you if you keep escalating and
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.680]  working with the deep state the international globalist system through
[13:57.680 --> 14:02.640]  the Chaikoms to embarrass America and to sabotage us and to bankrupt our
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.640]  military in our country we're going to confront you when you're militarily
[14:07.640 --> 14:11.520]  expanding and when you proportionately start attacking us we proportionately
[14:11.520 --> 14:17.080]  attack you it's going to escalate until we use bunker buster bombs to kill the
[14:17.080 --> 14:28.600]  moolas in Tehran and that's something these individuals understand and get and
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.520]  so that's pragmatically what Trump's doing there's a lot of other angles now
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.880]  there's a big gamble here but is it really a gamble does Trump really even
[14:38.880 --> 14:42.960]  have a choice we'll we'll explore that Tucker Carlson's very upset with Trump
[14:42.960 --> 14:48.400]  obviously that's a perspective that you can say has a lot of validity we're
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.480]  gonna play that clip coming up this hour but see just because there's bad people
[14:53.480 --> 14:56.520]  that want war with Iran just because the neocons are a bunch of liars and
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.120]  planet WMDs and the New York Times help do it with the Democrats bipartisan evil
[15:01.120 --> 15:09.580]  doesn't mean that Trump's new real politic that he's practicing is wrong it
[15:09.580 --> 15:13.800]  doesn't mean that because just because the neocons are bad and the leftist are
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.680]  bad doesn't mean that Iran and its leadership it's very unpopular and
[15:17.680 --> 15:24.240]  mass murders its own people doesn't mean they're good either I don't want a war
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.480]  our own CIA in 1953 overthrew Muhammad Mosadek who was pro-America but he
[15:30.480 --> 15:36.120]  wouldn't follow orders of the globalist and so all of this comes out the CIA did
[15:36.120 --> 15:40.560]  back then so I get regime change isn't good then the CIA helped get rid of the
[15:40.560 --> 15:43.840]  Shaw and put in the Ayatollahs so there's a lot of triple and double
[15:43.840 --> 15:48.080]  crossing going on here and they want to use Iran to embarrass Trump just like
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.120]  Jimmy Carter was in 1979 and Trump is acted decisively so far to block that
[15:53.120 --> 15:58.600]  and for now is winning the political war but what will happen in the next phase
[15:58.600 --> 16:04.520]  I'm here with Scott you see him founder of OMG tax tell us how your company helps

[19:04.560 --> 19:10.200]  happened to someone you know everybody is well aware of the fact that most
[19:10.200 --> 19:15.440]  people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they
[19:15.440 --> 19:22.480]  get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still like
[19:22.480 --> 19:28.080]  concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics
[19:28.080 --> 19:32.280]  to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.680]  studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine it doubles
[19:36.680 --> 19:41.000]  your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity it
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.720]  goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next
[19:45.720 --> 19:51.720]  year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you
[19:51.720 --> 19:56.400]  problem of hoax you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the
[19:56.400 --> 20:00.680]  worst flu ceases on record happening right now
[20:02.520 --> 20:08.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:08.000 --> 20:27.640]  the big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[20:27.640 --> 20:36.320]  tyranny well so does he lie from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones the
[20:36.320 --> 20:44.120]  big question everybody's asking is how will the Islamic Shiite dictatorship of
[20:44.120 --> 20:53.040]  Iran respond to their co-fuehrer you know the religious leader and you have the
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.680]  military dictator that's admitted this guy was probably as powerful as the main
[20:57.680 --> 21:04.400]  royal mula the Ayatollah who traces his royal lineage back to Muhammad so the
[21:04.400 --> 21:09.920]  Shiites are a form of a religious royalty Kim Jong-un is a third generation
[21:09.920 --> 21:17.240]  communist royal the Saxe cobert gothers are a it's got to be 30 generation or
[21:17.240 --> 21:31.120]  so Transylvanian inbred royalty and this royalty this Islamic royalty has real
[21:31.120 --> 21:35.560]  sleeper cells around the world and they have promised quote the Ayatollah put
[21:35.560 --> 21:39.480]  these tweets out this morning we can put them up later the Ayatollah has
[21:39.480 --> 21:49.960]  promised hashtag savage revenge and to destroy the barbarians and I've got some
[21:49.960 --> 21:53.960]  of the video of a speech he gave saying that the world will be Islamic and that
[21:53.960 --> 21:59.640]  they're going to take over and nothing can stop them but that's not a threat at
[21:59.640 --> 22:08.840]  all they say the world belongs to their version of Islam that's hereditary
[22:08.840 --> 22:15.040]  royalty and then we've got to bow down to these dudes that all look exactly the
[22:15.040 --> 22:21.480]  same are totally inbred and crazy and rule over the Iranians and most of them
[22:21.480 --> 22:27.480]  aren't even Persian it's just unbelievable next segment I'm gonna go
[22:27.480 --> 22:31.160]  over the Paul Joseph Watson article it's top link to drudgereport.com Iran has
[22:31.160 --> 22:36.720]  Hezbollah sleeper cells in the US ready to strike and it goes through the FBI
[22:36.720 --> 22:42.120]  reports that can confirmation of the plans to attack JFK and Pearson
[22:42.120 --> 22:48.640]  airports alone and a lot more we'll cover that next segment but let's look
[22:48.640 --> 22:54.040]  right now geopolitically at what's going on punch up a map of the Middle East
[22:54.040 --> 23:03.160]  right here going into Central Asia and Iran is perfectly situated between
[23:03.160 --> 23:12.720]  Afghanistan Pakistan India Turkmenistan Azerbaijan Turkey Syria Iraq Jordan
[23:12.720 --> 23:22.760]  Israel Lebanon Saudi Arabia Oman UAE Persian Gulf all of it they're right in
[23:22.760 --> 23:25.640]  the middle of the chessboard
[23:26.440 --> 23:32.000]  Zbigniew Brzezinski has a geopolitical theorem that has been adopted by the
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.280]  globalist called the grand chessboard model and Iran's right in the middle of
[23:36.280 --> 23:39.120]  that grand chessboard and the Mullahs say that as well that's you know where they
[23:39.120 --> 23:44.680]  invented chess not the Islamists but the Persians they've captured or
[23:44.680 --> 23:50.600]  controlling and they believe it's their right to export their militias all over
[23:50.600 --> 23:56.120]  the world and so yeah it's a good thing in my view that their militias working
[23:56.120 --> 23:59.520]  with Russia and the United States were able to kick ISIS and al-Qaeda out of
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.640]  here when back before Hillary Clinton and the globalists were actually aiding
[24:03.640 --> 24:08.680]  that to cause a civil war but then they did a double deal Hillary and Obama and
[24:08.680 --> 24:11.720]  made a deal with Iran they give them billions and billions of dollars and
[24:11.720 --> 24:16.480]  then let them go around expand proxy wars all over the Middle East and all
[24:16.480 --> 24:22.200]  over Africa and to put their sleeper cells in Europe and the United States and
[24:22.200 --> 24:25.920]  so contractors and US troops and others are getting killed all over the place as
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.360]  Trump tries to pull back and tries to leave the region for all intents and
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.200]  purposes compared to the escalations and they're seeing that as weakness and
[24:34.200 --> 24:42.440]  they're pushing now saying oh we're gonna try to make Syria Shiite we're gonna
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.440]  try to make all these other places Shiite and we're gonna attack your
[24:47.440 --> 24:52.040]  embassy because you bombed some of our paramilitary taking over areas of
[24:52.040 --> 25:01.760]  Iraq and what did the Ayatollah say to Trump he taunted Trump before the
[25:01.760 --> 25:10.920]  Soleimani strike said you can do nothing you can't do anything now why
[25:10.920 --> 25:16.400]  would he say that again think about the treason of people that claim they're
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.160]  American citizens even their globalist of John Kerry and Barack Obama who
[25:20.160 --> 25:27.080]  traveled the world from Korea to Japan to China to Iran to Israel to Germany to
[25:27.080 --> 25:35.400]  the UK to Canada to Argentina Brazil
[25:35.400 --> 25:42.440]  saying don't listen to Trump he's going to be gone soon he's a loser he's an
[25:42.440 --> 25:48.920]  idiot in fact if you embarrass him by sinking some ships in the Strait of
[25:48.920 --> 25:54.840]  Hormuz or in the Persian Gulf that'll help remove him back at home and he's
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.920]  not gonna get the backing now here's the danger the Tucker Carlson talks about
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.440]  and I agree with him you've got the neocons who double deal and who worked
[26:04.440 --> 26:08.600]  with Iran before to embarrass Jimmy Carter oh yeah they work with Iranians
[26:08.600 --> 26:14.000]  the Iranians are super beyond duplicitous I mean when you think about the
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.960]  Iranian moolas and triple quadruple games of chess it's not even strategic
[26:19.960 --> 26:26.000]  it's mental illness straight shooting is the most sophisticated thing in the
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.320]  universe innocence is the most sophisticated thing it's so simple it's
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.920]  complex these guys don't get it they don't get the Christian or Anglo-Saxon
[26:35.920 --> 26:43.240]  Legos or Nexus or or Genesis very sad it's very smart folks but it's constant
[26:43.240 --> 26:47.360]  screwing each other constant double dealing constant plans within plans all
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.480]  about vengeance all about double dealing all about screwing somebody over they
[26:51.480 --> 26:57.160]  got like a thousand names for knife over there and the neocons have been
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.360]  working with them propping them up the whole time as well because it's an
[27:00.360 --> 27:03.960]  authoritarian regime that they can work with and when everybody else has
[27:03.960 --> 27:06.960]  sanctions on them remember Halliburton Dick Cheney we're still making money
[27:06.960 --> 27:11.040]  with them so tyrants like to work with tyrants and what you see on the service
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.640]  is not what's really going on with the neocons and and and with John Kerry in
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.760]  the leftist and the globalist that the internationalist that have been working
[27:19.760 --> 27:24.400]  with Iran in the nuclear deal and Trump is saying it's crazy to let Iran expand
[27:24.400 --> 27:30.840]  around the world and export their Islamic jihad so we're gonna tell you stop
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.960]  expanding or we're going to stop you because you've openly declared that
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.400]  you're going to nuke Israel as soon as you can and whether you love Israel or
[27:39.400 --> 27:44.040]  hate Israel or neutral on it Israel has 600 700 nukes they're not going anywhere
[27:44.040 --> 27:51.400]  so if you let Iran attack them because they're crazy or is they think they have
[27:51.400 --> 27:55.640]  a right to rule it'll cause a new nuclear war and if you don't do something
[27:55.640 --> 28:00.720]  about Saudi Arabia they're going to attack them and so we're not the world's
[28:00.720 --> 28:06.560]  peacekeeper under Trump he's just trying to de-escalate all of this and what the
[28:06.560 --> 28:10.200]  globalist set up in Trump's own words I'm trying to fix what Obama and Hillary
[28:10.200 --> 28:13.840]  and the establishment did of getting all these groups fighting and stirring them
[28:13.840 --> 28:20.640]  up to control them that's dangerous Trump has said and he wants to stop that so I
[28:20.640 --> 28:23.840]  think I pretty much already told you where I stand on what Trump's done but
[28:23.840 --> 28:26.360]  I'll get into tales that we come back and then I'll get to the Tucker Carlson
[28:26.360 --> 28:29.760]  and then I'll get to your calls we're gonna look at some of the strike

[33:36.160 --> 33:42.600]  crazy thank you for joining us on this live Friday edition well did President
[33:42.600 --> 33:52.640]  Trump have any choice but to strike and kill basically the top leadership of the
[33:52.640 --> 33:57.360]  Iranian military and their terror networks worldwide yes Trump had a
[33:57.360 --> 34:02.360]  choice he could do nothing like he did the last 10 ships or so they blew up
[34:02.360 --> 34:06.200]  and sunk the last times they shot and killed US troops all over the Middle
[34:06.200 --> 34:09.600]  East or the other times that they're killing contractors that are just
[34:09.600 --> 34:15.080]  simply there working at oil fields Iran is muscling its way through the Middle
[34:15.080 --> 34:24.240]  East it believes it can topple the other Islamic regimes and if that happens
[34:24.240 --> 34:28.200]  you'll have an organized Islamic force even more deadly with 3 billion Muslims
[34:28.200 --> 34:35.200]  ready to take over what's left of the rotting West so long-term taking Iran
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.920]  out of the control of the Islamists that captured the secular country and 70
[34:40.920 --> 34:46.760]  plus percent in internal polls hate it and if we could take that away from the
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.800]  radical Islamists that'd be a big victory for humanity wouldn't it but you
[34:51.800 --> 35:00.040]  see our criminal globalist government in 79 removed the Shah and put the
[35:00.040 --> 35:07.160]  Ayatollah Khomeini in and then they double-crossed Jimmy Carter and they
[35:07.160 --> 35:10.640]  sabotage the raid and all of it you say oh great that's what got Ronald Reagan
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.240]  in the point is is it's the groups behind that and Trump is saying I'm not
[35:16.240 --> 35:20.760]  gonna be like Jimmy Carter and I'm not gonna be like JFK with the Bay of Pigs
[35:20.760 --> 35:25.880]  and all this crap he's not telling anybody what's going on he's fired the
[35:25.880 --> 35:32.200]  moles in the National Security Council he's not telling Pelosi and the House
[35:32.200 --> 35:35.960]  and Senate Intelligence Committee what he's doing now you know why because
[35:35.960 --> 35:42.040]  they're globalist a lot of them and they're leaking the information and so do
[35:42.040 --> 35:46.800]  I like war absolutely not I was against the last string of wars because they
[35:46.800 --> 35:50.400]  were based on lies they were based on false flags they were based on yellow
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.880]  cake and uranium and aluminum tubes and nuclear reactors and centrifuges with
[35:54.880 --> 35:57.560]  anthrax and
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.640]  Colin Powell holding it up in his hand knowing he was a liar I was on over a
[36:04.640 --> 36:11.760]  hundred radio stations in 2001 popular conservative talk shows but I was
[36:11.760 --> 36:15.840]  against expansion of that war I was against the millions of dead Iraqis
[36:15.840 --> 36:19.960]  because they were a secular government originally put in by policies of Eisen
[36:19.960 --> 36:24.120]  Howard and the deep state wanted to get rid of Saddam because they wanted to
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.800]  make worse things happen and have a civil war there which you now see to
[36:27.800 --> 36:32.000]  bring down those seven countries that Wesley Clark later talked about Trump
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.280]  is going back to the Eisenhower policy of trying to stabilize countries and
[36:36.280 --> 36:43.680]  westernize them that's what I want so when we see oh Trump's going along with
[36:43.680 --> 36:47.760]  the plan now to bring down one of the final countries in that hit list that
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.200]  the general Clark talked about that's bipartisan that's not in my view what's
[36:51.200 --> 36:57.600]  happening we know John Kerry and Obama and Hillary have worked with the Iranians
[36:57.600 --> 37:03.360]  they've gone to Iran Kerry has and others to openly say Trump is weak embarrass
[37:03.360 --> 37:09.440]  him militarily and so it's very bold to not just sink some Iranian patrol boat
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.800]  or hit some militia with some more fighter jets that's what that's what
[37:13.800 --> 37:18.560]  Bill Clinton did when he was very unpopular in an impeachment you know
[37:18.560 --> 37:20.600]  they're running the headlines everywhere which I think we should look at
[37:20.600 --> 37:27.640]  because it's historic those headlines one of them's on drudgerport.com of Bill
[37:27.640 --> 37:33.920]  Clinton impeach bombs Iraq impeachment voted house delayed as Clinton launches
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.880]  Iraq airstrike starting military need to move swiftly but you see nothing can
[37:38.880 --> 37:42.520]  actually happen in Iraq when he did that already bombed an aspirin factory in
[37:42.520 --> 37:49.120]  Sudan before that as a distraction and that was confirmed this is real we've
[37:49.120 --> 37:53.520]  been attacked the embassy was attacked because they've been probing and we've
[37:53.520 --> 37:59.000]  been putting up with it and so instead of bombing an aspirin factory Trump
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.960]  boldly killed the leader of the organization that has sleeper cells
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.280]  inside the United States and inside Europe and and now that's the gamble
[38:09.280 --> 38:12.720]  they may really strike even though that'll blow up in their face and the
[38:12.720 --> 38:16.320]  U.S. will retaliate even bigger as could escalate into a wider regional war
[38:16.320 --> 38:18.880]  they're definitely gonna try to block the Strait of Hormuz and drive up oil
[38:18.880 --> 38:24.120]  prices that's already starting to happen and so this is a really bad decision
[38:24.120 --> 38:28.480]  but it's one of the best decisions you could make out of a list of even worse
[38:28.480 --> 38:34.600]  decisions. I'm gonna play some of what Tucker Carlson has to say about this
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.560]  from his perspective which I agree with that perspective you know we've got a
[38:38.560 --> 38:41.720]  bunch of other guests coming on like Syrian girl and others that have been
[38:41.720 --> 38:44.560]  over there and live there and you know say that Trump's wrong we're gonna hear
[38:44.560 --> 38:47.920]  that perspective we're not a cult we have debates we're gonna open the phones
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.400]  up and you can agree disagree give us your expertise maybe you live in Iran
[38:51.400 --> 38:53.840]  maybe you live in the Middle East maybe you've been in the military maybe you
[38:53.840 --> 38:56.640]  think I'm wrong maybe you think Trump's wrong I want to hear it I respect you
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.840]  this is the central Texas Command Center and a lot of the commands are when you
[39:01.840 --> 39:04.800]  call in with your ideas and what you think ought to be done because I think
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.600]  you're amazing and I really like to show when I take calls that's why we do it
[39:08.600 --> 39:16.560]  877-789-2539 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 let's give first-time callers a
[39:16.560 --> 39:20.320]  chance in the first round and then you can call in of your regular caller you
[39:20.320 --> 39:27.480]  know next hour or so please 877-789-2539 now we'll go to your calls we come back
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.440]  I will hit the sleeper cell news because that's really serious and not just if
[39:31.440 --> 39:35.400]  the Iranian military gives those orders remember it's a it's a it's a
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.840]  governmental Islamic worldwide system where religion the economy and the
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.720]  military are fused in a takeover in a jihad that most experts are agreeing
[39:44.720 --> 39:49.200]  to trigger World War three or already in a slow motion war with globalism and
[39:49.200 --> 39:53.000]  radical Islam trying to get rid of Christianity in the West because no one
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.360]  can compete with the Renaissance Christian economy everybody wants to be in
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.000]  there everybody wants to experience the fruits of it so that's why radical
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  Islam globalist systems work together with the chai comms the chai comms
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.560]  don't let Islam into their country they put you in a death camp I think that's
[40:08.560 --> 40:12.600]  wrong but the point is they know it's an expansionist authoritarian thing
[40:12.600 --> 40:18.120]  competing with them but they'll use it against us all day long and and produce
[40:18.120 --> 40:23.080]  Netflix shows paid for by the Chinese government openly worshiping Islam
[40:23.080 --> 40:29.520]  vacation because they know that's a cancer for us so you see it's Christendom
[40:29.520 --> 40:35.720]  and the Renaissance and the West and those those ideas of radical liberal
[40:35.720 --> 40:39.600]  egalitarianism that the fascist left is trying to overthrow because they're
[40:39.600 --> 40:43.280]  threatened by it they're on the chai con payroll the left of today is an
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.520]  occultic group don't confuse leftist with liberal quagga university has the
[40:47.520 --> 40:57.600]  seminal video on that so we're gonna break it all down today but let's roll
[40:57.600 --> 41:04.760]  some of the footage of the strike from the Reaper drones the robot did the
[41:04.760 --> 41:11.760]  killing and then we'll show you some of the footage from the ground as well but
[41:11.760 --> 41:14.600]  those guys thought they were untouchable they thought they were working with a
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.600]  deep state they thought Trump was weak well now they think different so I
[41:18.600 --> 41:24.240]  think Trump who's shown real restraint when the deep states trying to set him
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.080]  up with this Iran conflict let them know hey we're serious and so you better
[41:28.080 --> 41:30.600]  understand that when you escalate it's gonna get a lot more serious from there
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.080]  and on and I think that's peace through strength it's a gamble things could go
[41:34.080 --> 41:36.840]  desperately wrong I think we're gonna find out very very soon how they're
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.200]  gonna respond they've got to respond to look strong to the cult they've got
[41:41.200 --> 41:45.080]  run in your country and so we're gonna break it all down the day I'll get to
[41:45.080 --> 41:48.440]  the Tucker Carlson we come back to sleep ourselves and then your calls Andrew

[43:57.680 --> 44:04.640]  for freedom I keep my eye on the news all the time but I miss the fact that in
[44:04.640 --> 44:13.600]  late 2019 just about two weeks ago the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.640]  vaccine to be given inside the United States and it is an experimental vaccine
[44:18.640 --> 44:25.920]  it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified it so
[44:25.920 --> 44:31.160]  it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's
[44:31.160 --> 44:36.840]  admittedly killed a name so many this is just crazy and the Congo's had the
[44:36.840 --> 44:41.240]  biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in
[44:41.240 --> 44:44.920]  the last few years I would of course open the borders up here and letting
[44:44.920 --> 44:50.040]  people in unfettered the Democrats distribute across the country you cannot
[44:50.040 --> 44:55.280]  make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault on
[44:55.280 --> 45:02.480]  America this is the new world order it's either happened to every person
[45:02.480 --> 45:08.280]  listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody is well aware of the
[45:08.280 --> 45:14.200]  fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[45:14.200 --> 45:19.240]  right before they get it and that they get the worst case of the flu of their
[45:19.240 --> 45:26.240]  life but still like concentration camp victims they line up at the different
[45:26.240 --> 45:30.240]  pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it doesn't matter that
[45:30.240 --> 45:34.160]  studies mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you
[45:34.160 --> 45:38.360]  take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next
[45:38.360 --> 45:42.840]  season by lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the
[45:42.840 --> 45:48.000]  governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.880]  never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the giant hoax
[45:53.880 --> 45:56.400]  going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.720]  seasons on record happening right now I would thank you for everything you've
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.240]  done for the info war but I know you're like me you don't want my thanks you
[46:06.240 --> 46:09.520]  want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters
[46:09.520 --> 46:12.840]  and you want them off your back and off your children's back and you know what
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.920]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team and it's why
[46:16.920 --> 46:23.480]  inforce has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus
[46:23.480 --> 46:26.880]  the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a
[46:26.880 --> 46:33.440]  future for humanity and I know you are as well so thank you in 2019 for standing
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.720]  with us because you are the info war and I want to thank you for committing to
[46:36.720 --> 46:41.400]  stand with us in 2020 however you can for bottom my heart for my family and
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.040]  from the great crew at info wars I want to thank you all because you are the
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.680]  info war and you know that's not just words that's reality you have made
[46:49.680 --> 46:56.400]  history we have made history together info wars.com only has power because of
[46:56.400 --> 47:07.400]  you and I suggest you use it you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:14.560 --> 47:24.920]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide
[47:24.920 --> 47:32.600]  it's Alex Jones I totally understand me and against these wars I've been
[47:32.600 --> 47:38.320]  against all of them the Vietnam we weren't allowed to win that that was all
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.520]  stage deal that to cause fissures here in the United States and huge profits for
[47:42.520 --> 47:48.320]  the military-industrial complex and Trump was against the 2003 Iraq invasion
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.080]  and Trump's been trying to get our troops out but Iran's been attacking our
[47:53.080 --> 47:57.600]  interests and they think it's weak that we haven't stood up to them and you know
[47:57.600 --> 48:01.480]  just because America's had some corrupt bad people running for a while doesn't
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.320]  mean that everybody else is good like the chai comms grabbing the South China
[48:05.320 --> 48:11.080]  Sea and militarily attacking Vietnam and funding all these different invasions
[48:11.080 --> 48:15.680]  for the UN of the United States so I don't like a chicken hawk feel good
[48:15.680 --> 48:21.240]  about people dying and I don't enjoy wars just because I fantasize about how
[48:21.240 --> 48:29.240]  it's manly but Trump has boldly said look we'll just kill your leadership you
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.280]  try to take over our embassy they really did that they're really pushing all of
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.760]  this they're really sinking ships and mining ships and my own listers are
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.680]  like oh no it's a false flag and turns out Iran is doing that but why are they
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.080]  doing it to embarrass Trump and then denying it and later admitting it
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.400]  because they're working with the deep state just like they did with China
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.960]  telling North Korea to suddenly escalate on Trump and start firing missiles at
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.000]  Japan and threatening to invade the South and Trump had the military build
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.880]  up they were gonna go in told China China said okay stop those were tests
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.120]  Trump went through to become president and now in the last year of his
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.640]  presidency if he doesn't get reelected with 304 days left what was he supposed
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.360]  to do when they did that to the embassy and then there's the top general with
[49:19.360 --> 49:22.480]  the head of the global militia they're meeting at the airport like it's all a
[49:22.480 --> 49:29.440]  big joke and the Iotola is saying you're a joke you can quote do nothing you can't
[49:29.440 --> 49:35.840]  do anything close quote because Trump had done nothing and they believed that
[49:35.840 --> 49:39.960]  we were paralyzed ladies and gentlemen now the neocons are gonna try to
[49:39.960 --> 49:48.840]  leverage this and here's the big problem Saudi Arabia Israel or elements
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.080]  inside our own government and I'm not saying Saudi Arabia is all evil
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.720]  their their their their establishments very bad and we're trying to make them
[49:55.720 --> 50:00.120]  not be like that and Israel I don't dislike Israel but Israel's got some bad
[50:00.120 --> 50:03.640]  people running it sometimes to different factions and Israel's been caught
[50:03.640 --> 50:09.080]  staging false flags that's in Jerusalem post they helped fund Hamas to
[50:09.080 --> 50:14.680]  counter Hezbollah and they helped fund some of the ISIS operations in Syria so
[50:14.680 --> 50:19.640]  did the United States under Obama and Hillary what if Israel stages a false
[50:19.640 --> 50:25.280]  flag to get us deeper into a war you've already had the Iranian rebels firing
[50:25.280 --> 50:32.840]  ICBMs into Riyadh trying to start a war so false flags are still a danger and
[50:32.840 --> 50:38.400]  and who could pull them to get us into a full-on war with Iran because Iran has
[50:38.400 --> 50:44.120]  now said that they're gonna destroy us they're gonna annihilate us hashtag
[50:44.120 --> 50:50.160]  savage revenge well what happens if there's some terror attacks it's not
[50:50.160 --> 50:55.200]  really Iranians so I get why this is so dangerous and I get what is being said
[50:55.200 --> 51:03.000]  by Tucker Carlson because this could get out of hand really quickly here's the
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.760]  problem that already got out of hand our criminal government overthrew the
[51:06.760 --> 51:10.800]  elected government of Iran in 53 and Operation Ajax and that everything else
[51:10.800 --> 51:14.200]  since then and Trump is legitimately trying to end that strategy of tension
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.600]  that strategy of destabilization and I like that does it mean that it didn't
[51:18.600 --> 51:22.520]  gonna be bloody does it mean it didn't gonna be a really bad emergency surgery
[51:22.520 --> 51:29.640]  does it mean things might not go bad or even worse yes but at a gut level I know
[51:29.640 --> 51:32.200]  how much the globalist take Trump and they hate him really be in the president
[51:32.200 --> 51:34.880]  and I believe he's making the best decisions with the information he's
[51:34.880 --> 51:39.040]  got doesn't mean I like what's happening so here's another perspective that will
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.800]  take your calls and get your perspective here's Tucker Carlson we have an
[51:44.800 --> 51:47.920]  unexpected Fox News alert for you something that has just happened in
[51:47.920 --> 51:52.280]  Iraq the situation they're heating up very quickly without any debate here in
[51:52.280 --> 51:56.840]  Washington Iraqi television has just confirmed that Kasim Sulamani former
[51:56.840 --> 52:01.400]  general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard in the commander of the Quds Force has been
[52:01.400 --> 52:04.880]  killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the United States near the
[52:04.880 --> 52:09.360]  Baghdad Airport along with the top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia
[52:09.360 --> 52:16.520]  now what were they doing in Iraq unclear but his death comes several days after
[52:16.520 --> 52:20.400]  in tensions kind of came out into the open in that country last week if you've
[52:20.400 --> 52:23.160]  been following this you know an American civilian contractor was killed by
[52:23.160 --> 52:27.120]  militants in Iraq the US government blamed that attack on Iran and it
[52:27.120 --> 52:31.880]  retaliated with strikes in response protesters blockaded the US Embassy in
[52:31.880 --> 52:35.120]  Baghdad it's basically where we were when the show started tonight Defense
[52:35.120 --> 52:38.000]  Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.760]  additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region
[52:42.760 --> 52:47.560]  which apparently are what we are seeing right now now again there's been
[52:47.560 --> 52:51.680]  version of debate or even discussion about this but America appears to be
[52:51.680 --> 52:56.960]  lumbering toward a new Middle East war and we have to say it's one that official
[52:56.960 --> 53:01.160]  Washington has wanted for decades for example discretion national security
[53:01.160 --> 53:05.280]  advisor John Bolton has made it his life's mission says to start a war with
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.000]  Iran and tonight Bolton may be finally getting his wish should you be happy
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.840]  about that that's the question well the last time we took John Bolton's advice
[53:13.840 --> 53:19.440]  in the region Iran became far more powerful than it was before before we
[53:19.440 --> 53:22.880]  took John Bolton's advice why because things are never quite as simple as they
[53:22.880 --> 53:26.600]  claim they are in Washington in this case the very people demanding action
[53:26.600 --> 53:30.440]  against Iran tonight the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest
[53:30.440 --> 53:35.600]  threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion
[53:35.600 --> 53:39.360]  of America now in progress from the south the millions the tens of millions
[53:39.360 --> 53:42.920]  of foreign nationals living among us illegally the torrent more
[53:42.920 --> 53:46.680]  significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire
[53:46.680 --> 53:50.560]  generations of Americans nobody cares in case you haven't noticed pay no
[53:50.560 --> 53:54.400]  attention to all of that these very same people tell us the real threat is
[53:54.400 --> 53:58.560]  Iran well they're liars they don't care about you they don't care about your
[53:58.560 --> 54:03.080]  kids they're reckless and incompetent and you should keep all of that in mind as
[54:03.080 --> 54:07.520]  we're with Iran looms closer tonight Kurt Mills is a senior writer at the
[54:07.520 --> 54:13.480]  American conservative he joins us now let's stop there the full interview is
[54:13.480 --> 54:17.400]  thought-provoking it's up on info wars.com and I totally agree with
[54:17.400 --> 54:21.840]  Dr. Carlson that we're dealing with a bunch of scum in DC a bunch of chicken
[54:21.840 --> 54:25.120]  hawks he could have added that Bolton and a whole bunch of other senior
[54:25.120 --> 54:29.920]  neocons were part of companies that got waivers to work with all companies that
[54:29.920 --> 54:36.000]  made billions in Iran during the sanctions on Iran that Cheney and others
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.160]  got waivers for so they are the worst of the worst I can't stand John Bolton the
[54:42.160 --> 54:49.280]  man is a menace that said the Iranian leadership is a menace they mowed down
[54:49.280 --> 54:52.400]  six hundred and something of their own people just a few weeks ago women that
[54:52.400 --> 54:59.200]  take off of jibs get killed oh but don't worry AOC says they need to put their
[54:59.200 --> 55:06.480]  head jibs back on oh by the way she's saying that Trump's doing this to wag the
[55:06.480 --> 55:12.760]  dog Clinton was super unpopular and propped up by the system Trump's super
[55:12.760 --> 55:16.200]  popular I've been saying that for years now even their own internal polls show
[55:16.200 --> 55:22.640]  he's just insanely popular every Democrat I know that is a cognizant
[55:22.640 --> 55:27.600]  person who has a IQ above room temperature supports Trump now because
[55:27.600 --> 55:31.400]  the Democrats are so dangerous there has been a systemic break with the
[55:31.400 --> 55:35.760]  Democrats everyone knows they work for the globalist in hate America and you're
[55:35.760 --> 55:41.360]  damn right fentanyl coming in from the chai comms Mexico is just the the toilet
[55:41.360 --> 55:44.120]  into which the chai comms dump it so let's not blame the Mexicans come on
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.840]  let's blame ourselves we're putting up with it and using it and letting the
[55:47.840 --> 55:52.320]  chai comms got caught trying to ship enough into the US or Mexico last year
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.000]  to kill 10.6 billion people if they all took one dose of it if you broke it up
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.320]  with that many doses to a lethal dose that's more people than they're on the
[56:02.320 --> 56:09.400]  planet by four billion almost so yes he's absolutely right that's the real
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.400]  menace millions a year dying from this massive suicides occultism falling away
[56:14.400 --> 56:21.080]  from God industry being shut down but Trump I've got all the real numbers he's
[56:21.080 --> 56:24.880]  changed the rules the regulations he's defeated the courts taken three years to
[56:24.880 --> 56:27.800]  now deport people at the border instead of bringing them in and then let them go
[56:27.800 --> 56:34.520]  it's all right here it's happening Trump's the real deal but it doesn't mean
[56:34.520 --> 56:37.800]  that he's doing a great job a lot of things he's real he's an American
[56:37.800 --> 56:42.960]  president he's really trying to set the country back on the right footing but
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.600]  he's letting the big media cartels big tech cartels financed by the Koch brothers
[56:48.600 --> 56:51.640]  and others that are financing the Heritage Foundation the rest of it
[56:51.640 --> 56:56.040]  literally screw this country over and silence millions of people and use AI
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.320]  in real time to block what people see and do pre-programmed that's not
[57:00.320 --> 57:05.320]  censorship that's total surveillance in control even the Washington Post calls
[57:05.320 --> 57:11.520]  it the surveillance apocalypse it sounds like I wrote it or Paul Watson did or it
[57:11.520 --> 57:18.080]  sounds like Matt drudge on the radio 20 years ago and we were all right and so
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.240]  because we're right and we're credible and we've done homework and we know what
[57:21.240 --> 57:27.440]  we're talking about we're the ones that are under attack and being silenced
[57:27.440 --> 57:32.160]  all right I'm going to your phone calls Dr. C. Pachennick who's a real expert on

[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.520]  explain I understand why Trump did it it's very dangerous
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:40.480]  it's a bad option of a whole bunch of other worse options
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:43.920]  and are we just supposed to sit there and let the iranians do whatever they want
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:48.400]  blow up some more ships mine some more harbors attack attack attack just because
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:51.680]  the neocons helped stir this up just because the globalist

[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:52.400]  let's go to a call right now let's go ahead and
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:55.840]  talk to Paul in New Jersey go ahead and thanks for calling
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:03.520]  hello Alex hi Alex I remember Mike Pompeo a few months ago trying to paint
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:07.440]  a brush about um Iran being the center of
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:12.000]  exporting terrorism throughout the world but if you check from
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.200]  University of Maryland's website it's called the
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:21.600]  the global terrorism database and it's actually linked to the
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:25.920]  Department of Homeland Security and you researched this this was a news item
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:31.120]  several years ago that 94 percent of the terrorism
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:35.280]  throughout the world is Sunni sponsored terrorism
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:39.520]  as we know Iran is the Shiite nation and so
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:43.920]  if we take out the 94 percent then the Shiites are only responsible for six
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:47.520]  percent of the global terrorism which is the small percentage
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:51.040]  in fact in matters al-Qaeda with Sunni sponsored terrorism
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:57.600]  ISIL al-Nusra jundalot of God's army a whole assortment
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:02.000]  of these global terrorist groups and they're the ones doing
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.760]  a lot of the atrocities in Africa today. And Soleimani
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:08.640]  is the guy that helped take out ISIS in the Middle East.
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:12.800]  Exactly and actually we should almost be thankful to Soleimani
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:18.800]  because we were allied with him back under Obama around 2015 when ISIL was
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:24.480]  making forays into Northern Iraq into Mosul into
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:29.600]  Crete and Soleimani basically led his team and it wasn't you know an
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:34.080]  officially an Iranian army but a group I'm sure of Shiite militias
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:39.120]  to drive ISIS out of Iraq and for that we should be thankful for him.
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:43.040]  And in a sense this is what I'm saying about Donald Trump that he's got to stick
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:47.040]  with a coherent narrative because remember
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:50.000]  what we've been hearing. You sound like a really smart guy that's got a
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.200]  background and a lot of research but and you're absolutely right everything
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.840]  you're saying is totally true and DC's full of criminals and they'll turn
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:58.720]  anything Trump does into something bad and this is really dangerous like Tucker
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:00.960]  Carlson said we're going to go to break I'm going to come back to you
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:03.760]  because I want to give you the floor smart callers but I want to ask you as we
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:07.360]  come back Paul why then did they attack the embassy
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.600]  why are they doing this to the ships why are they shooting stuff down
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:15.280]  why are they playing into this why are they meeting with the back channel
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:19.520]  of Obama and Hillary and the deep state who we know are trying to use Iran
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:23.520]  to to embarrass Trump they're using China to try to get North Korea to embarrass
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:26.880]  America and Trump stood up and North Korea
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:31.360]  back down this is a very strong message to North Korea and to China right now
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:35.440]  and it's about Trump's leadership so I get the whole history and the background
[1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:38.000]  and all of that I'm talking about what Trump did here
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.680]  and what do we do when people attack our embassies I'm gonna
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:44.960]  ask you that when we come back or I just asked the question we're back in 60
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:48.000]  seconds with Paul in New Jersey then we'll go to Andrew
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.080]  and everybody else stay with us on this live Friday global transmission
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:56.240]  whatever you do spread the live link from ban.video and the drudgereport.com
[1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:00.480]  link to our story I keep my eye on the news all the
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:04.640]  time but I miss the fact that in late 2019
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:11.120]  just about two weeks ago the CDC and the FDA approved
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:16.560]  live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States and it is an
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:22.400]  experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:26.800]  they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal
[1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:30.960]  same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:34.640]  killed and maimed so many this is just crazy
[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:38.880]  and the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:42.320]  giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course opening the
[1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:45.840]  borders up here and letting people in unfettered
[1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:50.400]  the Democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:54.160]  of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault
[1:05:54.160 --> 1:06:12.800]  on America this is the new world order
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:16.560]  well president trump did something very bold yesterday
[1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:20.480]  instead of blowing up some chiite militia in response
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:24.240]  to their attack on the US embassy he killed Soleimani who's basically the
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:28.800]  leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran they say is the number two guy but he
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:32.400]  ran the show and the head of their global militia
[1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:35.600]  and yeah there's university studies and things that say most exported terrorism
[1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:43.200]  is out of Saudi Arabia is the whole al-Qaeda a variety
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:48.640]  but the chiites have their political islamic operations around the world
[1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:52.240]  and they do have the real competent sleeper cells
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:55.680]  and they've said they have those sleeper cells and they've said they're going to
[1:06:55.680 --> 1:07:00.640]  have a savage revenge that's a quote against us so
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:05.840]  i'm asking the caller paul what do we do then
[1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:09.440]  why when when when iran goes into the embassy and i know you're gonna say
[1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:12.320]  well we bombed some of their militias yeah that we're
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:16.960]  killing contractors and i mean iran is pushing back
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:20.160]  and i know you're gonna say well we've got sanctions on them
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:25.680]  so you're gonna say we're being pushed by Saudi Arabia and Israel
[1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:30.240]  into this and i think to a certain extent you're right
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:34.320]  and so what do you think should be done what do you think this is going
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:38.160]  well for one i i think uh the chiite militias
[1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:42.560]  in iraq are not fully controlled by the iranians i would argue that they're
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.440]  actually a bunch of hotheads they form their own
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:49.840]  sectionalized or factionalized little groups and then they go off on their
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.320]  own without borders from iran i would just like by the way
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:58.800]  that in eastern ukraine some of the secessionists and the donbas
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:02.960]  uh go on their own and don't really get their orders from russia
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.200]  either i i think the situations are somewhat similar when you have a great
[1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:10.640]  power which is sympathetic towards uh
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:15.120]  you know expansionism along their border but they don't really want to own it
[1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:17.840]  you understand they don't want a direct connection oh sure you always have a
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:21.040]  group rise up and then and then claim it once to join you later i mean my
[1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:24.480]  not bragging it's an interesting historical fact my ancestors
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:29.040]  you actually worked with president jackson uh more than a decade before
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:34.240]  texas seceded from mexico and it was all a plan i mean i'll just be honest to
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:38.240]  come in uh because you know the mexican government couldn't occupy things
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:42.480]  build it up uh and then as soon as they tried to ban Protestantism
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.160]  basically use that as a way to launch texas and so even back then
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:49.600]  i mean the u.s government was already planning its western expansion
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:52.240]  into places like texas so you're absolutely right but that's how these
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:55.680]  proxy operations work that's just textbook
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:59.440]  yeah and i but as for my wish list i you know
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:02.960]  we have to remember that that three quarter of a billion dollar
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:06.960]  embassy uh complex and really is more like a fort
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:10.480]  was built by the 911 culprit george bush
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:15.920]  junior and the point is the fact of the matter is this an american i don't
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:20.320]  really want to kill my way out of keeping that fort
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:25.760]  over there in iraq to me it doesn't matter it to me it's not a big deal if we
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:30.960]  strategically just pack our bags and retreat oh i agree with you i think i
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:33.920]  think trump's original instinct to pull the hell out of there and let them kill
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:37.600]  each other or fix it hopefully is the right way to go but
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:41.600]  how does he do that then when the neocons the left are going to call him weak
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.280]  well you just let them call you weak and and go to the american people and
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:48.800]  explain it and take it take it and on the stump
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:53.200]  and out on the campaign well where do you think this is going to end because it
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:55.840]  it could certainly end really bad how do you think the iranians are going to
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:58.800]  respond or are they smart enough not to escalate
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:02.320]  i think they're exactly that they won't escalate everything's going to cool
[1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:04.480]  down and we'll forget about it in three weeks they're
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:08.160]  they're smart they don't want to direct conflict they have to build up still and
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:11.600]  work on their economy and other issues stronger alliances with the chinese and
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.880]  russia and build more missiles in their mountain
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:18.880]  bunkers there you know i i think they're very smart group of people
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:23.600]  and actually i would argue if the goal is to rule the middle east i would think
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:28.240]  that you'd want to divide it and to divide the middle east and soonies are
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:32.480]  about i think 85 percent of the muslim population
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:36.080]  in the region i think it behooved us to
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:39.040]  make iran into the enemy i think we should make
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:42.880]  actually iran more influential and more powerful
[1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:46.640]  so then we have a better balance sure but i mean are you then agreeing are you
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:49.840]  are you agreeing with obama and his shadow diplomacy when what they've been
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:52.480]  doing well i like the thought that you do it on
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:55.360]  the cheap i don't like that obama toppled libya or
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:58.480]  syria at all by any means nor do i want to spread this carnage
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:03.600]  and turn the whole middle east into a charles house but i i do believe
[1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:07.600]  do it on the cheap i don't let me ask you this why do you think trump did this
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.440]  i mean i think he knows that iran is probing and and and talking to the
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:14.320]  deep state and thinks he's weak and i think he did it telegraph strength
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:17.840]  that but very likely and but i think the iranians are going to back down out of
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:23.440]  this they're they're smart cookies so all right smart caller paul thank you sir
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:26.080]  you tell that guy's definitely been working at the state department or
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:29.760]  something speaking of the state department dr steve chenex coming up
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:33.680]  he's an iran expert by the way a lot of listeners go this guy says he ran this
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.400]  operation that operation he really did run a lot of big operations and was
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:39.200]  involved in the bunch of others when he's sitting there rattling stuff off
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:42.800]  it was about his memoir that's why he rattled off 10 minutes of stuff and i
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:46.480]  stopped him because it's just it's so so over the top but it really is true there's
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:49.120]  a lot of people like that that have done a lot of stuff
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:52.160]  i mean gosh i've had cousins and stuff that were in the army 35 years they'll
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:55.600]  hardly tell you stories but they do it's just like one after the other of the
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:59.200]  wild stuff goes on you never hear about it just crazy
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:02.880]  let's get my boy my family definitely doesn't want to go to war with iran
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:06.320]  because it's all classified stuff but i've talked to some that let's just see
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.320]  we got satellites that can see down into the dirt and that iran's had nukes for
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:15.280]  at least 15 years folks so it's it's bad so it's Saudi Arabia so the this place
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:21.040]  is a time bomb a time bomb okay let's go ahead and
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:27.600]  talk to andrew in Idaho the camera andrew welcome
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:31.360]  hey it's good to talk to you again i don't know if you remember me i told you
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:34.800]  i've been with you since bohemian grove well i do remember a lot of callers
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:39.280]  called up bohemian grove andrew but thanks for calling what's on your mind
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:43.680]  uh i just really worried about the direction we're headed right now
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:47.280]  looks like we've uh drifted a long way since since ron paul if i could just
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:50.960]  start off real quick just so you know that my wife says i'm your biggest fan
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:54.800]  so i'm a big fan of you folks keeping us on air and defiance the globalist so
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:58.480]  god bless you brother i've spent thousands thousands on your
[1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:00.880]  store i can probably give you the best product push you've ever had well that
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:03.760]  will get given the product push i haven't done one yet this hour and
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:07.040]  you know we're barely keeping the size we are so we need folks to buy the
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:10.480]  products they're great products which products you like best
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.520]  i think i have almost every one of your products but i can't i can't do a push
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:17.440]  for your products right now i can't uh i understand i thought i was just you were
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:21.200]  sigling i mean if you'd like to go ahead sir what's your take on you said drone
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:26.000]  strikes obama sleeper cells do process i just feel like we've just a long way
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.400]  from you know pulling out and becoming uh
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:34.720]  physically responsible uh but no i understand but they've got us caught sir
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:37.920]  they've got here's the deal i don't want this war i don't like what happened
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:41.360]  yesterday okay you know it doesn't make me get excited
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:44.640]  yeah in a way of like feeling tough and powerful but
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:50.960]  yet the same time you understand that the globalist are working with iran
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:55.760]  at a certain level to try to make trump look stupid
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.760]  and they can only make him look stupid by uh coercing him into a war uh
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:04.480]  that that's the best way to make him and our entire party has become
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:08.000]  very very different from uh from where we were when we were with uh
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.760]  when we were supporting wrong paul and it just about is the way it is no you're
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:15.520]  right the the the the libertarian nationalist party that kind of formed
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:20.080]  that helped get trump in we don't want to be we don't want to be co-opted
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:25.600]  if trump becomes neoconian we are exactly and i keep
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:29.600]  staying everywhere i mean i am defending against taxation i see people writing
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:34.640]  i'm glad my tax dollars went to a to a to drop by you know to kill a terrorist
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:38.480]  with anwar al-awki he was the first american citizen killed if we any of
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:41.520]  us that remember it was killed without due process under obama
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:45.680]  during that time i was defending uh due pro you know criticizing obama
[1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:49.680]  defending but defending our constitution against uh
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:54.080]  liberals like my sister i hear you and now it's the left
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:57.280]  loves all these wars and says trump's wrong for not wanting to blow up north

[1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:33.200]  life it was a day i no longer take Adderall and i get
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:37.280]  by literally the 13 hours a day i work on a half of a packet of your turbo
[1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:40.320]  force and if you take a half a packet that's literally a
[1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:43.920]  dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know a monster which is what

[1:19:56.640 --> 1:19:59.680]  in four store dot com
[1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:15.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:21.040]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming
[1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:26.000]  to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:30.240]  here's my position i understand why president trump did what he did
[1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:34.240]  iran clearly was striking our installations to proxies
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:38.320]  and the leaders of the iranian international network
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:43.200]  are feared by the establishment they're a real group that can really strike
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:46.960]  around the planet uh they're not a synthetic system the
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:52.000]  globalist control like isis and al-qaeda and the globalists see it as
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.920]  returning balance to things that iran's becoming too strong in the middle
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:00.320]  east uh and trump wants to look strong for north korea
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:04.080]  and looks strong for china it's a very decisive bold move
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:09.280]  it's not the normal obama aspirin factory like bill clinton would do
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:14.080]  that said trump got elected on ending these wars
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.080]  and once you start feeding the beast it's just gonna want more
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:20.320]  so
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:24.240]  at a sick level though i like seeing action out of trump and him being
[1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:27.360]  himself because this is trump this is trump
[1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:31.280]  the sit in the neocons it's not the the left's totally freaked out right now
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:34.000]  the neocons are freaked out right now they're like because he looks so
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.440]  presidential it is a bold move not that it's
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:41.040]  presidential to kill people but to go right after those guys who are really
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:43.760]  bad news when it comes to being able to actually
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:47.760]  project terrorist force they've got sleeper cells in the us they've got
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:55.200]  sleeper cells all over europe and iran may just go crazy
[1:21:55.200 --> 1:21:58.560]  but i wish it wouldn't have happened i wish that we weren't this crisis with
[1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:02.960]  iran but believe me if iran doesn't think trumps
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:07.360]  in charge now they do and that's really the final reason trump did this
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:10.720]  is the back channel stuff with obama and hillary and
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:14.560]  carry carry goes over there and says don't listen to trump he'll be out soon
[1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:19.040]  ha ha ha and that's why the autola said you can't do anything
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:24.800]  and that's not that kind of blustering worked with other people
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:28.800]  because obama and and hillary those are puppets of the
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:32.240]  globalists they don't run things with somebody like trump
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.960]  trump wants peace he wants to be the guy to get the peace prize he wants to
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:39.280]  reverse all this but i think people better understand
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:44.080]  that you don't want to mess with trump and he wants peace
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:47.200]  but he likes to go right up to the edge of war
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:52.000]  to then elicit that peace is that good we're gonna see
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.040]  i just want to see action on the attack on the first amendment i want to see the
[1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:59.200]  cartels gone after big media cartels that are trying to censor people
[1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:01.840]  i want to see trump get control of his government i want to see trump fire the
[1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:04.960]  neocons and the never trumpers the sorrel's people and he's starting to do
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:07.840]  that i mean he's starting to really become the president
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:11.920]  now if he becomes the full president and gets his real presidential power and
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:15.920]  then starts going sideways i will become an enemy of trump
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:22.400]  but right now um
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.720]  i feel like trump just got stronger and i'm just being completely honest about
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:30.160]  how i see it it doesn't mean it's a good thing
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:33.200]  doesn't mean it's not going to go bad that mean we're not going to hear from
[1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:36.960]  you obviously every caller is against this i can
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:39.680]  see all of you are against it and i'm here telling you
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:43.360]  that i understand why trump did it because i don't just go with what's
[1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:45.760]  popular i was against all those wars before
[1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:49.200]  totally against them because they were all based on false flags and stuff
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:52.640]  iran is trying to take over iraq and i get your point
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:55.360]  let him have it
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:03.360]  so that's what trump tends to do he bombs stuff and then pulls out
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.400]  how about we just pull out of iraq then how about we petition the president to
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:11.280]  pull out okay you made your point you killed him let's get the hell out of
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:13.120]  there how about that what do you think listeners
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:16.320]  cameron in missouri thanks for holding you lived in iran you say give us your
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:21.120]  take on this uh alex what a pleasure to talk with you
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:26.400]  you have been an inspiration i kind of parked all of this to the side
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:30.560]  20 some years ago until a friend of mine turned me over to you and
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.160]  and you were talking about 9 11 and i thought i really took heart in your
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.640]  courage and uh and i started doing a lot of uh
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:43.440]  my own uh research about it and and i came to the same conclusions
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.680]  my dad uh worked in the iranian government years ago at my mom they
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:52.080]  both worked in the savoc which was basically created by the cia
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:59.120]  uh to basically iran's cia to keep it simple and uh they used to cross train
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:02.960]  with the israeli massad from time to time you know when they would come to iran
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.080]  they were famous torturers so you're saying your mother and father both worked
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:09.680]  in the iranian secret police uh of the shaw
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:12.880]  yes but in the counterintelligence they had nothing to do with the torturer
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:15.680]  they weren't in the torture they were out doing uh countering foreign
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:22.080]  intelligence correct correct and so of course my
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:26.960]  dad later left the savoc very much like in the u.s you leave cia you go into
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:31.280]  other departments and he went into the prime ministers
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:35.440]  the part prime minister's office when the shawf
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:39.680]  now he was the foreman command there and the ayatollah is you know threatened
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:42.560]  our lives and we basically left with very little
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:46.720]  we ran with our lives and came to the u.s about
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:53.760]  40 years ago 1979 uh and uh really since then i've seen basically the same
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:57.440]  policy that uh you know the the new world order is
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:01.440]  totally propping up the ayatollahs they're very easy to get rid of
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:05.280]  they're having us here debate and chase our own tales but
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:10.560]  this regime can fall very quickly uh just as they got rid of the shaw i think
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:17.120]  us uh owes the iranian people
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:20.560]  basically a payback to the ayatollahs because they brought him in
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:25.120]  and i think us needs to help the iranian people just empower them like
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:29.200]  harm them well that's why we're trying to support the the restart movement what
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:33.120]  do you think about that group well i mean like yeah that's good i'm not
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:37.600]  you know i i don't think no one group is no i agree you're just saying you're
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:40.880]  and listen i totally agree with you that from what i knew i mean iran had its
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:43.760]  problems but it was a really nice technological place
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:46.960]  until the islamists took over and people don't know that it's admitted
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.880]  that elements of the cia put the ayatollahs in then they double across
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:54.080]  each other it's just been a mess and that's why bolton keeps saying he wants
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:57.520]  to get rid of iran because the truth is the neocons are making money with them
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:01.520]  and working with the molas neocons yes well
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:04.960]  the whole new world order the george soros who they're all making money behind
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:08.000]  the scenes and they want us to believe that they're the great devil
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.160]  they're the iranian government is a bad actor and they really
[1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:16.720]  must go and uh the people have to remember iranians just like in israel
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.480]  they are all required to do two years of military and all we need to do is to
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:25.120]  arm the iranian young people who've been in the military have the green beret
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.640]  they're trained to do this kind of guerrilla warfare and just no you're
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:31.600]  right you're right that well i mean we could easily just just kill all the
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:35.200]  leadership and their bunkers but i mean the problem is it'll look like we're
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:38.000]  we're invading and from the numbers i've seen
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:42.560]  what iran's one of the youngest countries in the world huge population under 30
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.600]  uh i mean the problem is we've tried to send people in there they all get
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:48.560]  killed because they got such a spy network i mean how would you propose
[1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:53.440]  overthrowing the dictatorship alex and no fly zone like we did with the Kurds
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:58.480]  okay just stop all air traffic over iran stop all trade stop it stop
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:01.760]  shut down everything and let the people arm the people
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:06.320]  send the green berets in arm the people in groups and they will get rid of this
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:10.240]  government in they got rid of the shah in two days i was there when the
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:14.960]  revolution happened i was 14 years old they just attacked the military bases
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:18.000]  took the guns from the soldiers who didn't want to shoot at them because
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.960]  soldiers don't want to kill their own people
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:24.880]  you're right and and a lot of numbers show attacking iran unless we got rid
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:28.160]  of their leadership and actually dig the moolas in deeper
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:32.560]  and it'll unite the iranian people against america the public opinion will
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:36.320]  be against and iran is no sirio sir let us get your name and number in case we

[1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:02.480]  knock on wood i am not tempting fate
[1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:06.160]  but everybody around the office especially folks that have worked there a
[1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:09.280]  long time have noticed that i really don't
[1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:12.880]  ever get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow
[1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:16.800]  because i just made that statement i'm not tempting fate i'll say that again
[1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:19.840]  because i am superstitious when it comes down to that i'm very thankful the good
[1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:24.480]  lord for the constitution i've been given but up until
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:27.440]  about eight nine years ago when i started taking
[1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:33.200]  x2 and the products in force life i i still got sick every couple years
[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:36.400]  and you know i still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like
[1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:40.880]  that but now that i religiously take the
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:44.000]  products and info wars life or the highest quality supplements you're gonna
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:48.640]  find out there i just never get a fever anymore
[1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:53.840]  it's probably been three four years since i've had a fever
[1:32:53.840 --> 1:32:59.600]  it's just crazy so i chalk it up genetics and the great products
[1:33:01.280 --> 1:33:09.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:09.600 --> 1:33:11.600]  you
[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:21.520]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:35.600]  it's alex jones
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:41.200]  all right let's go to monroe in florida says they agree with
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:45.680]  trumps decision i mean i think anyway you slice this the world in crisis there
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:50.480]  really is no good decision here but i'm just saying i know why trump did it i
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:53.920]  understand why trump did he's been very transparent about it
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:57.680]  and trumps done a lot more good than he's done bad
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:02.080]  and this makes him stronger against the deep state i still
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:08.080]  don't celebrate you know people being killed uh what do you think monroe
[1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:11.360]  yeah anybody who is uh listening right now
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:15.840]  whoever disagrees they have that right to disagree with trump's decision
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:19.840]  however we must remember that trump knows
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:24.480]  way more than we do at this point in time okay intelligence says so right
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:27.680]  okay so another thing it's so many is linked to
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.920]  over six thousand attacks against coalition forces in how many years
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:36.960]  so there's there's so much going on right now that we don't know about
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:41.200]  and we are making these pre-determined outcomes based on assumptions
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:46.320]  we need to stay strong behind trump we cannot back down we can't waver
[1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:49.920]  we don't have a choice we've been overrun for how many years the united
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:53.360]  states but i try calms we've been infiltrated left and right
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:57.360]  we've been sold out left and right we can't give in now
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:03.040]  okay we must stay strong pal do you uh do you agree with that
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.520]  uh i agree that iran has been expanding and did attack our forces i understand
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:10.000]  that we get into discriminations with them as well but they need to stop
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:14.080]  attacking the ships the trade or moose and most of smart money
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:18.320]  thinks that iran is going to back down they may not back down
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:21.920]  somebody else can stage a false flag and say iran did it i think all cards are
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.040]  on the table i believe trump thought he did the best thing but what you're
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:27.920]  getting at is i have a bunch of articles on this
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:31.200]  the word is iran was gearing up and i've seen some evidence of this to
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:35.760]  overthrow basically the iraqi government and fully install
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:39.440]  themselves and expand their islamic state and so that's another reason
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:43.920]  uh that this was carried out and done what do you think
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.760]  well they're like i said before there's so much more going on than we actually
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:53.120]  know and you know the the iranians uh these regime
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:58.160]  leaders they're smart they try to go for the psyche of the american
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:02.160]  they they try to take advantage of our kindness okay
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:08.080]  and our good honor and our heart okay and these people they don't live by the
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:13.440]  same codes of honor that we do okay so like i said
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:17.920]  psychology is a big play in this we can't we can't just say
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:22.640]  okay look at this one issue and say he's made a bad decision
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:26.800]  now you know should i vote for him should i not vote for him
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:32.400]  we cannot waver because there's so much he cannot tell us that intel can't tell
[1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:35.440]  us there's so much going on that if we did know
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:39.360]  everything that's going on we would say oh i completely understand
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:44.720]  we need to have trust and faith god i i personally believe that god has chosen
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:48.720]  trump to be the president of the united states and he will lead us down these
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:53.200]  dark paths but soon to come there will be light i personally believe that
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:56.880]  well monroe i know this uh the deep states been working with iran against
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:36:59.760]  trump and trying to make him look weak trying to
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:03.760]  destabilize things probing uh against the united states so this
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:08.480]  definitely has the deep state freaked out right now i appreciate your call
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:12.160]  it's still a very dangerous escalation and it does show wow what else has rump
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:16.080]  been shown to make him do something like this because this is this is a big deal
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:20.560]  let's go to texas now and talk to richard richard thanks for calling
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:26.640]  uh hey out so uh normally i disagree with some points of your analysis on
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:31.280]  these complex issues but i really think um what you've said has been accurate so
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:35.120]  far uh the only thing i want to highlight in addition
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:41.040]  is the fact that the the green zone is the most fortified embassy anywhere in
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:45.440]  the world from any nation it's literally a heavily armed military
[1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:49.440]  secret so for the attack to get through the embassy
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:53.840]  either a private military contractor working with leftists in the cia or the
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:57.680]  cia itself had to have authorized the attack and made
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:01.040]  a way for the the forces to get through i mean there's just no
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:03.920]  possible way well let's pull back and talk about that because i i think you're
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:07.920]  right in one way the iraqi military we looked it up the iraqi
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:13.120]  military was the first ring or and and and they stood down
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:18.800]  and then which happens a lot in wars and then soc was the company they were
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:21.920]  ordered to not shoot the quote demonstrators
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:25.280]  because they didn't want to look like a you know an authoritarian move by the
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:28.000]  united states instead it was done not as a
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.600]  false flag but as a type of false flag to let them attack
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:35.200]  to then let them capture part of the base have to seal the u.s
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:38.880]  uh to to to instead of making it a propaganda victory for iran
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:42.880]  if a bunch of people got mowed down instead it made them look bad
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.800]  uh and which again shows they were working with the deep state cnn abc news
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:50.720]  they all have the same headline protesters take over
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:54.640]  and and uh you know even the new york times is writing obituaries and saying
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.040]  how great you know this general is so you could see the coordination to embarrass
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:01.760]  trump uh and and so i was saying hey they have a
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:05.760]  right to shoot these people come into the embassy but but now i see
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:09.040]  that i think trump had probably already ordered the ambassador he
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.200]  they knew this was coming and so they let them do it
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:18.080]  yeah exactly and i i think um your analysis that
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.080]  he made the best with a bad uh choice is accurate in that
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:27.280]  the neocons in the cia wanted a war so they made a little pact with their
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:30.960]  leftist friends in the cia that they could have a bunch
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:34.720]  um you know a vengazi situation but either way the deep state wins
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:38.480]  and then chump trump comes out of left field he's like i'll just kill their
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:42.960]  leaders so he totally you know ran a scythe up on the
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:46.640]  deep state and won and projected american power boosted
[1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:49.520]  in fact richard i'm so glad you called because right before i went live i even
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:53.120]  wrote notes that i was gonna say this that if people think they're 3d chess
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:58.240]  you just saw it from trump this smells of trump it's him i get chills i mean
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:02.080]  listen let's not start you know what and yet like the wolf says in paul fiction
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.320]  but right now it looks like a master stroke by trump just saying
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:09.760]  yeah i agree 100 thanks for taking my call look let me ask you this though how
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:13.360]  do you think iran counter strikes and how do the neocons in deep state that
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:18.240]  clearly had the media lined up to make trump looked like jimmy carter 1979
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:22.480]  that didn't go the way they wanted it to so so what do you think they pull next
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:26.720]  well i think it's impossible to tell i think it'll develop over the next week
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:32.160]  but it was such an unexpected move uh from a us president i think they're
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:34.720]  really going to have to have some meetings
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.800]  and figure out i i really don't think they would anticipate at this move
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:42.160]  so i think we're just gonna have to watch the situation closely and we'll get
[1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:47.360]  some hints probably fairly quickly here i agree thank you very much richard
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:52.560]  one thing for sure 2020 has just gonna be amazing i mean
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:59.280]  and i think every way and just mythically the iconography uh the just the
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:04.960]  the numbers alone uh it's it's going to be incredible
[1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:08.160]  it already is uh let's go ahead now and take another call here
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:12.720]  let's talk to jeff in louisiana thanks for holding jeff go ahead
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:17.680]  how you doing alex brother louisiana here a longtime listener
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:21.760]  longtime follower been following you probably for 10 years and uh
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:24.640]  it's an absolute pleasure not to be able to speak to you and your listeners i
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.080]  want to talk about two things real quick with you guys
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:31.200]  first one about the attack on the general the iranian general then the
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:34.960]  second one a couple suggestions for your operation i had a couple good ideas
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:39.840]  first off with iran we need to treat iran like a beef nest
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:43.520]  what do you do with a beef nest in your yard you have two options
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:46.960]  either stay away from it or wait until the evening comes
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:51.200]  let every bee come home to nest and then spray it kill every single one
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:57.520]  and destroy the nest these iranians they literally believe that it's up to them
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:01.200]  to bring the apocalypse in the end of the world and if they can do this
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:05.200]  they win they believe that the 12th team mom is just going to show up in iran
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:09.600]  and save them all so they're willing to sacrifice every single man woman and
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:14.080]  child and this is exactly what they want that's right that's why the ayatollah
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:16.640]  is congratulating i'm going to play the clip coming up
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:20.320]  he's congratulating the families how great it is that they're dead
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:25.200]  yes exactly are as americans and as christians are we really willing to go to
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:29.360]  a war with 80 million people are we really willing to kill
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:33.360]  80 million people i've worked overseas i've worked state-side for the federal
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:37.440]  government all i saw was corruption and stupidity
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:41.920]  and all we're doing is doubling down on stupidity we have not had any luck with
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:45.520]  interfering whether in central america no i hear you i mean we are very soft and
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:48.800]  domesticated at least most of the public and then we're about to go to war with
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:52.640]  psychotic piranhas stay there i want you to finish your point jeff we'll be right
[1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:57.120]  back
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:00.880]  i would thank you for everything you've done for the info war but i know you're
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:05.200]  like me you don't want my thanks you want victory over the globalist and these
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:08.640]  devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back and off your
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:11.920]  children's back you know what i'm the same way and that's why
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:16.160]  we're on the same damn team and it's why m4s has been delivering time and time

[1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:25.440]  taking action against the globalist because i'm committed to a future

[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:18.240]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:23.600]  it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:28.000]  modified it so it's supposedly non-lethal same stuff they did with the
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:32.240]  Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so many
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:37.280]  this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:40.960]  they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:44.320]  oh and of course open the borders up here and letting people in
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:48.000]  unfettered the democrats distribute across the country
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.440]  you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:55.040]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:46:03.600]  this is the new world order

[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:20.000]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide in the year 2020
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:24.720]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:30.800]  it's alex jones 2000 seems like five minutes ago
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:34.640]  but also a thousand years ago and now it's 2020
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:38.560]  wow and i haven't spent a lot of time on this
[1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:45.920]  but i really need to i make them into a special report tomorrow just on it
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:51.200]  they put me on every news channel and every newspaper in the country i've
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.360]  randomly checked it okay you understand only the deep
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:00.000]  state cia can do that trump kill doesn't have damn control
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:03.680]  of it that the same group attacks him constantly
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:06.640]  uh and you're like well why can't he stop he's the president he's ordered it
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:11.920]  they just won't quit that's it's crazy they had me on
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:17.520]  from nine at night until about two a.m while the ball dropped they had
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:22.880]  scrolls saying alex jones found guilty of lying about sandy
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:27.840]  hook parents that's not even true it was just some attorneys feast thing
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:30.320]  because the judge said i we didn't answer the questions like we're supposed
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:33.680]  to and that's not accurate either we're like what is your source of the cnn
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.960]  video well cnn who is the source who gave it to you
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:41.280]  oh you didn't tell us oh we need 68 thousand dollars and 37 thousand
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.000]  dollars and i mean it's a joke evil
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:53.040]  but that turns into jones is guilty of the sandy hook
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:58.080]  why would they do that why would they take an 11 day old ruling
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:01.600]  that had been the local paper that meant nothing it was the last year of this
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.960]  judge you know just attacking us
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:11.600]  in my view and the lawyers i know that that they've
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:16.400]  never seen anything like this is insane
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:20.560]  i mean imagine a deposition they ask you a question and you don't know
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:23.440]  because the statute of limitations is like two years are asking about
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:26.640]  seven-year-old videos just like we don't know it's a video we edited years ago we
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:30.880]  don't know you don't have the source of that this is do you have violated the
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:36.240]  court order 63 thousand dollars 37 thousand dollars
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:41.680]  20 thousand dollars
[1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:45.360]  in the rage to destroy the first amendment in their trump derangement
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:47.680]  syndrome
[1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:52.800]  but that isn't the issue yes i'm persecuted yes they pay people to tell
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:58.640]  outrageous lies about me but why we're gonna go back to your calls
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:02.400]  amazing calls it's because folks
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:08.320]  we really know what we're talking about and you know who knows what we're
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:11.280]  talking about it's not a butt-kissing thing anybody that
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:15.920]  listed the last hour of these calls it's like these are phenomenal
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:19.760]  nobody in talk radio has callers like this cnn can't get any good callers
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:24.400]  my callers are better than fox news is best guest we've really got the thinkers
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:29.200]  we've got the best guest we've got the best crew we're real
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:36.480]  number one podcast 2017 Joe Rogan number one podcast 2019 Joe Rogan
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:40.880]  which was the number one ever in all time that's in the news
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:45.600]  why wasn't i number one in 2018 he didn't have me on
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:52.640]  not bragging well i'm saying people love freedom and even my obnoxious loud
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:57.920]  mouth texan ash because i'm real and the obnoxiousness in
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:02.080]  all of it is endearing i know just like your obnoxiousness is
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:06.880]  endearing because you know what it's real folks there's nothing fake here
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:10.400]  in fact i'm so damn real i can't stand it i sometimes want to control myself
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:13.520]  i sometimes want to act a different way i sometimes i can't i can't control
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:17.440]  myself i'm a maniac it's all real i'm totally
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:24.400]  real i've never lied to you i compulsively tell the truth
[1:51:24.400 --> 1:51:28.480]  and these people out there they can't stand that you see and they also don't
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:30.720]  like the fact they can't scare me and they don't like the fact they can't
[1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:35.280]  scare you but let me just tell you i've studied war propaganda and how the
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:38.800]  globalists do stuff folks
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:43.360]  i think they're probably i need to go to your calls but i need to
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:45.840]  probably do a special report so i don't cut into the main broadcast time of your
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:48.240]  calls but
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:51.360]  i think they're getting ready to do a false flag and blame me and they might
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:54.960]  kill me and i'm only not sad to be dramatic
[1:51:54.960 --> 1:51:57.680]  and if that happens i'm not a loser i'm a winner i don't want to die by the way
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:00.080]  i'm not gonna commit suicide but you know what i mean
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:03.280]  they don't do that unless they got something big point
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:06.880]  let me tell you something i was on every news station
[1:52:06.880 --> 1:52:14.320]  in the country i checked randomly hundreds last night
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:18.320]  you know what that means that means the folks running the show they're fighting
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:22.000]  trump v being we're talking cia the highest level
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:25.440]  brennan and those folks they've got a plan
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:29.120]  and they're assassinating my character in my name ahead of
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:32.960]  trying to kill me now dr pacenic used to be involved in assassinations regime
[1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:35.920]  change and he's not you know doing it as a sturdily tough guy i think he'd call
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:38.240]  it a medical you know necessity or whatever
[1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:40.880]  unless you find a lot of assassinations and stuff at high level to actually use
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:43.920]  doctors for it now he's a psychiatrist and a lot of
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:46.240]  other things but he's gonna be joining us we'll take your calls as well but i'm
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:50.000]  gonna pick his brain about myself but not
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:56.560]  not from a selfishness point of view but for everybody like i'm not that
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:02.400]  important okay that every newspaper that's in
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:05.840]  this these networks because they get an order it comes in and it's like hey
[1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:08.960]  push this and they do it
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:14.000]  and they did that to us again i mean
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:18.480]  so i'm not sure exactly what's going on but
[1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:21.520]  they usually do that when they overthrow your government or they assassinate
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:26.480]  you and so i'm just proud of the work we've
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:29.520]  done to get under this much attack i mean i i gotta be honest with you
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:32.720]  it's not a pride thing it's a satisfaction thing of a job well done
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:37.040]  that wow i really counted for something man i i really i did a decent job and
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:39.840]  our listeners boosted our transmission you did this too
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:43.280]  so if they do kill me or whatever you know just keep the mission going on and
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:46.160]  i'm not a loser they don't win by killing me or whatever it is they got
[1:53:46.160 --> 1:53:49.760]  playing but it's it's bad so i'm the new year i thought i just
[1:53:49.760 --> 1:53:52.480]  go ahead and tell you that because i just gotta tell you everything
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:55.360]  and i'm not doing it be dramatic folks it's it's real okay
[1:53:55.360 --> 1:53:58.560]  i mean that's the wings of death flapping around you can just hear them
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:03.840]  and uh fine whatever you know just don't let me see a comment because i'm gonna
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:07.440]  fight for my life but it's just nothing to me
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:12.240]  because i expected this a long time ago i told you i got on my knees a lot of
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:16.400]  times and i said i feel the evil i see what i want to defeat it god and i want
[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:19.840]  people to wake up and and god literally told me it was like i've
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:24.320]  said this for 20 years like you're going to trigger the whole
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:28.080]  movement to take down the globalist and you're gonna inspire others to do it
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.000]  and then you're gonna be destroyed in the end so you're sure you want that
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.600]  and uh i mean i said this on her 20 years ago i mean i've literally heard god's
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:38.800]  voice in my head and when those times you know it i mean it's like
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:42.560]  okay you want this because you're gonna get really torn to pieces at the end of
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:46.400]  it but it's gonna be really good and i'm so i don't know this is the end of it i
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:49.440]  don't know that's what this is or whatever it is but you know what
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:54.080]  hey i asked for it and i actually like it i just have selfishly because i never
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:54:57.360]  prayed and ask god for things other than take care of my family and my
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:02.000]  children and god's done that god's done that
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.200]  and uh that's really all that matters but you know and i've also given my god
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:08.320]  my children to god because you can't let them you know control you about being
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:10.960]  able to get to your children so i just turn my children over to god and god's
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:13.040]  protecting them but they can't get to me through my
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.000]  children either i'm totally committed they can put a gun to my head anything
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.880]  i'm never stopping i'm never giving up i'm never giving in
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:22.400]  i'm never backing down i'm never submitting to them
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:25.280]  and they're in a battle to kill my name because they see it as an image of
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:28.560]  americana and freedom and they'd think of they can destroy alex jones they can
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:32.640]  destroy anybody because they they they know you're backing me
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:36.960]  and they know they think if we can get this guy and capture who he is and use
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:39.840]  him as a straw man and use a symbol of freedom as a symbol of
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:42.960]  evil and corruption then we win well you know what as long as you tell the
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:46.160]  truth and as long as you spread the word they fail
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:49.200]  and as long as you don't buy their stories that i'm a loser and then i'm a
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:52.080]  failure because that's all that is is jones is a failure
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:55.280]  jones is a failure he's he's a failure he hurts kids
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:58.160]  that's a bunch of bull it's the democrats want to kill kids in the womb
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:01.840]  they want to kill kids outside the womb they want to disease everybody they
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:06.240]  want to sterilize little kids everybody knows who wants all the fake phony wars
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.080]  and all the islamification and all the garbage it's the left
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:13.360]  it's not me i'm not a bully i didn't hurt kids
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:17.200]  i just don't believe official stories especially when people that have been
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:20.000]  high up in the cia tell me it's completely fake
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.240]  but whatever that's not the hill i'm gonna die on
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:26.720]  we'll go to some of your calls and we're gonna get steve pacinica on and get his
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:28.960]  take and continue with calls while he's with us
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:32.160]  i've gotten a lot of calls so far but i'm gonna finish up with jeff
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:35.040]  then i'm gonna go to tarif next and then i'm gonna go to everybody in the order
[1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:37.600]  from which you're called justin everybody we're gonna get to everybody
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:40.880]  today and i'm gonna go ahead and host into the fourth hour
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:43.920]  syrian girls gonna join us as well i want shroyer is gonna be interviewing
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:46.400]  dr pacinic again for even longer today on his show
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:49.440]  three to six p.m but he's gonna pop in i want to get his take
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:52.560]  and i'll just say what rebecca said she's a smart lady and i said what's your
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:55.680]  take on this she said i don't like sending four thousand more
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:56:58.960]  trips than at least trump said he'd get trips out
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:02.160]  you know it's one thing to kill the iranian general
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:05.760]  but it's it's he needs to not escalate trips and i think that
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.440]  is absolutely right and and that's why i go around asking people what do you
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:13.520]  think what do you think because the knowledge of the crowd
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:16.960]  the knowledge of the people is really where you find it when they are awake
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:20.400]  awake people are amazing listen these callers then you try to talk to a

[2:00:07.680 --> 2:00:11.280]  now to the third hour taking phone calls jeff and louis yana as a holdover
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:15.280]  he made a point was it a finishes point he made it he said i ran like a beehive
[2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:19.520]  in your yard either stay away from it or wait till they go to bed at night and
[2:00:19.520 --> 2:00:24.320]  do what i do and go uh you know with a squirt gun spray some
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:25.920]  gasoline in it and light it on fire if it didn't
[2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:29.200]  too dry outside that's the best way to get rid of them instead of just letting
[2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:32.720]  them you know sometimes the bead poison doesn't even kill them all they come back
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:39.600]  so that's what i do i use gasoline um i'm not gonna tell a b story i just
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:45.440]  anyways i'm gonna stop right there let's just say somebody in my family had bees
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:47.760]  they didn't like me for whatever reason would attack me when i went to their
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:50.720]  house i mean i'd be 50 yards away the damn things would attack
[2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:54.560]  so i snuck over and dealt with the bees but my parents listen i shouldn't tell
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:59.440]  the story anyways uh what was the end of your
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:03.200]  analogy jeff well what i was gonna like i said you know
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:08.800]  these people they really believe that it's their job to bring upon the
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:12.800]  apocalypse in the end of the world you can't fight against that sort of crazy
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:16.000]  mindset and what is the end game dude does anybody
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.920]  really think that if we just kill some generals and kill some leaders
[2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:23.360]  the people within the country will just change their opinion no they won't
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:29.200]  there's 79 80 million people in iran they all will fight to the death well
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:34.320]  listen let's learn hold on i think the core controlling religious cult
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:37.360]  will and because we stand for nothing now it makes us very easy to feed i agree
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:39.680]  with you that their military is formable their
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:43.200]  professionals are very dangerous but you know half their population is under
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:47.040]  30 and they've done internal polls something like 70 percent of those
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:51.680]  wildly love america uh and and and do not i mean
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:54.560]  do not want to be under it
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:58.560]  and kill these people who don't have anything against us because once we go
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:01.600]  in there and start killing people like we did in syria trying to pick who's
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:04.480]  good and who's moderate and who's bad well no that's the reason why russia is
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:07.520]  able to go into syria and win when nobody else could because they're going
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:11.120]  there and if they tell you evacuate the town and if you don't they'll kill you
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:14.480]  and that's what you do in a war i mean in world war two we bombed whole cities
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:17.360]  i'm not saying that's a good thing but that's how you win wars i hear you
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:20.560]  thank you jeff good points all right let's take another call here tariff and
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:23.760]  louisiana thank you for holding really appreciate that you're on the air
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:27.520]  i've been trying to get um in contact with y'all for some years now
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:32.640]  and um i want to talk about two things mr alex um i'm a whistleblower my va
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:37.760]  whistleblower and also i'm anti-wall i'm pro trump but also i i can
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:41.680]  criticize trump yes you can absolutely yeah so
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:45.440]  okay trump was lied to i feel to believe
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:50.560]  once i saw what happened last night i had this feeling a strange feeling that
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.160]  came over me i said wow they they they got them this
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:56.320]  time but you gotta go with your gut it's always
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:00.160]  right yeah so i say okay what happened okay so
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:04.160]  you had the contractor with what they're not telling you that contractor was
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:08.800]  killed but you had regular or rocky military was killed
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:12.240]  as well that was protecting the contractor contractors
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:16.640]  you had rocket police in some rumors that was circling on the internet that
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:20.800]  you had some p.m. you that was protecting them as well that was
[2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:24.640]  killed it won't make it won't make sense for p.m you to
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:27.760]  check but to um attack their own brothers and
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:35.520]  sisters right so so hey you had 450 kilometers away
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:39.200]  on the syrian or rocky broader the p.m you unit
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:43.440]  that was fighting against isis it was hit all right
[2:03:43.440 --> 2:03:47.840]  um our our aircraft done it i think was
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:51.040]  it was uh i get your point if supposedly
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:54.640]  sheite militia attacks from contractors why we kill some shea militia
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:58.960]  400 miles away or 400 kilometers away well well
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:03.040]  i don't think it was shea militia killer shea militia i think it was another
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:06.720]  group that was doing it i think it was a group that
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:10.880]  was um maybe isis affiliated being funded from
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:14.000]  outside well that's what i was going to say we know israel and we know
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.960]  Saudi arabia stage false flags that's what i said up front the only way
[2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:20.320]  trump can be wrong in this is if false flags were staged
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:23.680]  and then iran should have come out and said that if they didn't do it
[2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:27.280]  i mean well that's true they should have said something
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:30.800]  and they don't like the fact how they are surrounding our embassy
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:34.240]  hold on i've got dr steve pacinic who's worked for the cia state department

[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:50.000]  minefield on the other side news wars dot com

[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:23.760]  is dr steve pacenic he's gonna be back on the war room today i really appreciate
[2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:26.080]  him giving us so much of his time in the new year
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:28.880]  he really is an interesting character his new memoir is out i went
[2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:32.560]  downloaded it last week and read it over christmas and i know a lot of history
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:35.440]  and it's just amazing how many things this guy has been involved in but
[2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:38.880]  that's really how it always is is there's certain people that are doers
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:42.400]  and people that aren't and so people see all the stuff info wars has done it's
[2:06:42.400 --> 2:06:45.920]  it's kind of ridiculous that we listed all but we're in the game of
[2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:49.680]  direct action as us citizens for freedom peacefully
[2:06:49.680 --> 2:06:53.920]  with information warfare just you know self-taught by
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:57.760]  the truth in history and and dr pacenics worked you know all over the place
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:07:00.720]  and with different agencies and regime change and you name it and he was
[2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:04.080]  involved in a lot of missions that were successful the only
[2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:07.120]  camp david accord he ran that he's on record big there's the
[2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:10.080]  psychologists that got that done the only piece still that ever worked and
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:13.200]  he was also involved in missions that didn't go well the delta force that he
[2:07:13.200 --> 2:07:15.680]  helped found in the whole first mission was jimmy carter
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:20.240]  and all the weird triple crosses going on there so i can't think of anybody
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:23.440]  better to come on and i didn't pre-interviewing uh this morning i
[2:07:23.440 --> 2:07:26.160]  said hey can you try to call and get him on
[2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:29.040]  and didn't even go to steepachinic.com because i probably visited every few
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:32.560]  days but i didn't want to know i just said i want to get him on i i'll say
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:35.520]  what i think i'll have callers and then i love the
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:39.200]  randomness and and and the and the and the realness of getting him on
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:42.800]  and then seeing through his lens what he thinks uh is
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:46.480]  is happening is the sleeper cell threat real why do you think trump did this
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:49.200]  wasn't the right thing to do well what's going to come out of it how are the
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:52.400]  neocons going to respond how does this what does this do to the back channel
[2:07:52.400 --> 2:07:56.560]  we know that obama and hillary and carrier still having was uh
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:08:00.240]  have they been doing things with iran to embarrass trump and the and the pentagon
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:03.280]  um so those are all my questions and then we have all these great callers
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:05.840]  they're going to bring up their own points on this and we'll get steepachinics
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:09.040]  take on that but when we go to your callers now we got a guest on i know
[2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:11.600]  you understand this this quick question or comment we'll get
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:14.560]  bachinics take on that as well as website is
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:20.000]  of course a steepachinic.com and we also have um

[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:28.720]  for the fourth hour so thanks for joining us wow 2020
[2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:32.240]  is already off uh to a roaring roaring start
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:36.320]  gibbisher prime approximation uh as as a leading i think
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:42.720]  long-term expert on this well as much as i've criticized uh the issues that
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:47.200]  going to warrant particularly 9 11 a lot of the problems that arose as a
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:51.200]  result of the iran hostage seeds 9 11
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:57.120]  really has come to fruition right now i am for the assassination of sulamani
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:08:59.760]  i would have done it a little bit more elegantly
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:04.080]  i would have done it quietly i would have had more evidence the reason for
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:08.080]  this is far more complicated than anybody
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:12.880]  has realized in the news number one for several weeks my own people have been
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:16.000]  telling me that contrary to what the new york times
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.160]  reported in the media reported the riots in
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:24.960]  iraq was not against the american embassy it was against the iranian
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:30.000]  leadership in iraq that was totally corrupt now you have to
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:33.760]  understand i don't mean you i mean in general the american public
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:37.680]  has to understand that from the very beginning in 79
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.600]  what i when i was involved to say to jimmy carter personally
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:45.200]  do not put in our embassy personnel
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:51.840]  in iran or anywhere else and let you know the the events
[2:09:51.840 --> 2:09:57.520]  transpire without our intervention we have had nothing but iranian corruption
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:01.840]  underneath a muslim leadership now i say this with
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:06.320]  the ability to say look i've been in iran i was at homeini's house
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:11.120]  i negotiated with homeini and homeini clearly told me about his son
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:15.280]  khamini who wasn't very bright and in turn
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:19.360]  what happened is that khamini has had a power struggle
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:25.440]  with sulamani who came in to power and the head of the revolutionary guard
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:31.200]  over 20 years ago and in turn we were involved in another war which we don't
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:35.920]  talk about which we did initiate and actually one of our neoconsummy
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:41.120]  halazad was instrumental in that and that was the iraq iran war which we
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:43.760]  don't talk about and i'm not gonna interrupt you in a moment because i
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:45.920]  want you to build a role because you are leading expert on this but you're
[2:10:45.920 --> 2:10:48.800]  saying my gut level visceral reaction is
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:52.080]  right thing to do uh lets the deep state know they're not going to play double
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:55.920]  deals with iran against the us is a message to north korea on so many
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:00.560]  fronts trump made the right move absolutely but more importantly it's
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:04.320]  a message to the children and the young people in iran
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:09.120]  that we're with them and in fact that we're not only with them but we will
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:13.440]  help them to dispose of the leader ayatollah khamini
[2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:17.680]  the amount of corruption that has been there has been so serious
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:21.520]  i didn't go on the air a couple of weeks ago but i had one of my videos where i
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:27.440]  said clearly thousands of young men and women in iran were killed
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:34.000]  by the irg under the order of sulamani and directly the order of ayatollah khamini
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.560]  he couldn't care less now the most interesting element of this is when i
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:42.640]  was in iran 10 15 years ago i went to kum kum is the
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:47.760]  headquarters of the iranian persian muslim belief i have a great respect
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:52.160]  for the iranians because they're persian and ironically we jews
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:56.560]  prayed of sarius and darious the great i mean bb doesn't tell you that
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:12:00.960]  sulamani was a jew but we have a lot of respect for the persians
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:06.480]  ironically in kum the ayatollahs they are said to me this is not a legitimate
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.880]  government under khamini or khamini and the reason for that is
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:16.560]  there was no reason to have a muslim society in persia which was
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:21.280]  far more advanced than anybody had advanced now what happened in effect
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:25.840]  was sulamani began to grab power he became more and more powerful
[2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:30.560]  he was one of our allies between 206 209 when he was in iraq but the
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:33.920]  reality was and my own men had said this to me
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:38.240]  and i had to turn my own opinion around when we invaded iraq which i was
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:41.200]  against and everybody knows that i'm still against it
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:45.440]  nevertheless we had to deal with a very big issue there and that issue is
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:48.640]  something we didn't talk about which was the iranian
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:53.280]  soldiers under sulamani had killed hundreds of our own
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:57.280]  brave warriors it wasn't the iraqis it wasn't al-qaeda
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:01.520]  it wasn't isis it wasn't anybody else except the iranians
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:05.600]  that left a deep deep memory in the minds in the hearts
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:09.920]  of my soldiers my military intelligence the cia
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:14.000]  and we never said very much about it but in the in return
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:19.040]  we felt we felt that this was going to be a lingering problem for us
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:24.880]  now having said all of this the scenario around the world was perfect
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:28.320]  for the takedown of sulamani what do i mean
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:32.240]  number one in one of my videos i had said in lebanon
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:36.240]  a few months ago that the young people of lebanon
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:41.920]  shiai sunnis uh all were protesting the corruption of his
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:45.360]  that's right we don't need a globalist arab spring putting radical muslims in
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:48.960]  charge of these civilizations we need a real spring of real revolution
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:52.480]  to westernize and have a renaissance which they're ready for
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.600]  correct now you hit it on the head alex and that's exactly what's happening
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:01.200]  right now it happened very quickly it could only happen under
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:06.560]  trump and also this attack spells the end of nancy
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:10.480]  polosi once and for all she can't say oh we didn't know
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:13.360]  about this you know we weren't briefed too bad
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:17.840]  if you're too busy doing work that's not relevant to the nation state
[2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:22.080]  or our farm policy you don't belong there none of the democrats belong there
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:25.760]  because they really weren't involved in and you know they leak it they can't
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:28.960]  help themselves it's not a question to leak they're
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:32.000]  incompetent she doesn't really understand what the
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:35.440]  republic is about she has no understanding of the history
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:40.800]  she has no understanding of how we work she really is lazy and stupid
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:44.800]  that's correct but i would say even more so it's her swan song it's not only
[2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:47.840]  hers it's also schumer who doesn't understand
[2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:51.120]  shift who doesn't understand all these individuals
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:55.120]  are they're totally not relevant to the running of our republic
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:59.200]  so when they talk about the deep state they're not the deep state
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:03.440]  the guys like me and others who have been running this for 30 40 years we're
[2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:06.160]  going to maintain the republic no matter who's there
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:09.120]  and it's not going to fall apart and listen when you say that it's not an
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:13.040]  arrogant statement the power is always the people taking their kids to school
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:16.400]  the people working out the fields the doctors taking care of people
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:20.320]  and the people communicating and saying no and the quiet
[2:15:20.320 --> 2:15:23.360]  silent majority in government corporations that also know what's going
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:27.280]  on and so it was a message to corrupt evil powerful oligarchs across the
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:30.720]  world as we see the nationalist spring the popular spring
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:34.160]  that it's going to spread in the middle east central asia you know india has
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:37.920]  now got you know hindu nationalist fighting radical islam the world's on
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:41.040]  fire it's awakening and pushing back against these arrogant corrupt
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:45.600]  establishments and letting so-called god sulamani invincible mastermind
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:48.560]  know know you're like everybody else and now you're dead
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:51.600]  you're not as special as you thought you were and that's what my gut level
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:55.360]  instinct was we'll talk about it with dr. c patina can take your phone calls

[2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:27.920]  temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd
[2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:30.960]  offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable

[2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:25.600]  is fighting to stop everybody from having their own communications so
[2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:28.400]  you support independent media it is revolutionary
[2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:31.200]  his new book american warrior in crisis is excellent
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:34.560]  we're going to read a real memoir of real direct action and special
[2:20:34.560 --> 2:20:37.600]  operations this is it and it sounds pretty amazing to go
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:39.600]  research it because i'd already studied a lot of history and
[2:20:39.600 --> 2:20:43.040]  seen stuff that pacinic was involved in in his name in it at the head of it and
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:45.440]  a lot of it and then people hear the stuff on there like that's just too
[2:20:45.440 --> 2:20:49.120]  much to be involved in well you haven't been around in stuff 40 50 years
[2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:52.800]  and that's what happens when you've done it it's it's really true and he's not
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:56.400]  a coward he'll come on this show let me raise that it's an article up on
[2:20:56.400 --> 2:21:01.760]  info wars dot com all joseph watson cfr president says the world will be a
[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:06.400]  battlefield after i ran escalation and so you've been a member of the cfr you
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:09.760]  resigned it for 9 11 for the fact that they were involved in it
[2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:15.760]  richard in haas and uh they are really the establishments trying to
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:19.680]  give trump a backhanded attack i thought they love war so much but i guess they
[2:21:19.680 --> 2:21:23.280]  didn't make this call why why doesn't the establishment like what just happened
[2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:27.200]  dr pacinic alex let me tell the audience number
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:32.000]  one the cfr is nothing more than a geriatric unit
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:36.800]  for has been in both the republican and democratic administration who's set up
[2:21:36.800 --> 2:21:41.840]  by the rock of fellas it's run by a bunch of people richard haas is the
[2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:47.440]  paramount leader of such an organ organization he has a big mouth
[2:21:47.440 --> 2:21:52.720]  he's never served in our military he's a terrible national security advisor
[2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:56.880]  they don't know what they're talking about they get funded by everybody
[2:21:56.880 --> 2:22:00.720]  including the cia and mi and anybody else
[2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:04.320]  and honestly i left it because it's useless
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:09.520]  not only is it useless but they're so self aggrandizing that these people
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.720]  really don't understand the nature of war they don't understand what psyopsis
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:18.480]  they don't know what agitation propaganda so they're not relevant
[2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:21.680]  what you're seeing is that the alternative media
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:27.440]  the alex jones the oan shroyers the steve pacinics we're becoming the
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:32.640]  mainstream while the new york times hits us with conspiracy theories and i
[2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:36.480]  start laughing i said fine you want to write in wikipedia
[2:22:36.480 --> 2:22:40.400]  that we're conspiracy theorists fine i don't particularly care
[2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:44.400]  i happen to know what the truth is you happen to know what the truth is
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:49.600]  the cfr is so antiquated it's for self aggrandizing individuals
[2:22:49.600 --> 2:22:53.440]  you've got the hillaries you've got the clintons you've got the bushes
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:59.280]  it's it's nonsensical i left it not only because of 9 11 i left it because it's
[2:22:59.280 --> 2:23:05.520]  pathetic organization and richard haas is the paramount pathetic jew
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:10.240]  who talks a lot but never served our country and i can go through that whole
[2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:13.440]  list of the other leaders well i was about to say you mentioned mi6
[2:23:13.440 --> 2:23:16.480]  british intelligence helping set it up nothing is the british people themselves
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:19.760]  but the cfr is a globalist anti-american organization
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:22.800]  and i've watched their meetings they just congratulate each other
[2:23:22.800 --> 2:23:25.920]  and just spew this crap about china is going to dominate america
[2:23:25.920 --> 2:23:30.720]  and america sucks i mean what a bunch of jerks to hate their country so much
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:35.920]  well it's not only that there you've got joe biden what more pathetic committed
[2:23:35.920 --> 2:23:39.680]  he admitted to crimes at the cfr and haas clapped
[2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:42.800]  and all these other little little little wimps look at this guy
[2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:47.520]  these are legends in their own minds that's my point but the point is you
[2:23:47.520 --> 2:23:50.720]  don't imagine that kind of imagine that kind of fistfight you want to go to
[2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:53.760]  war with that guy you think that guy's gonna lead america i think that guy
[2:23:53.760 --> 2:23:58.160]  cares about your folks alex that's they're the mickey
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:01.280]  mouse of the world you don't you don't even have to engage with them they're
[2:24:01.280 --> 2:24:04.640]  so irrelevant you have no idea no i agree i i i agree
[2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:08.320]  though and and so i want to go to so-called but
[2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:12.640]  why do you think there's why is this information why is this good
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:16.640]  what trump did it spurs revolution against the islamic state
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:21.280]  against the iranian islamic state why is it good it's it's an amazing
[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:26.000]  action because it basically puts ayatollah khamenei
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:29.840]  into a position where he has nowhere to go and internally
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:33.680]  he knows that we're going to start a agit problem and we're going to take him
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:37.040]  down this is a signal to iran that we're finally
[2:24:37.040 --> 2:24:40.080]  going to take you down not necessarily with strategic
[2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:44.800]  motion movements in armaments but we show them how effective we can be on a
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:50.320]  one-off or using our own intelligence and it's also a signal to ayatollah khamenei
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:55.840]  we've pervaded their entire society when we need to we will create the agit
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:25:00.400]  prop to bring down khamenei he's counting his last days in effect
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:04.160]  and let's expand on that he thought because it was back channels to obama
[2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:06.000]  and others that trump would already be gone by now
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:10.560]  he shot his mouth off saying you can do nothing you can't do anything to trump
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:13.600]  now he looks like a complete fool of the whole world
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:17.760]  well he is a fool i mean even his own father i told you i went to his house
[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:21.360]  and i negotiated with his father who was very bright
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:24.960]  i don't agree with him but he said my own son is not very bright and you're
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:28.720]  going to have to deal with him and the truth is he wasn't very bright so he
[2:25:28.720 --> 2:25:33.200]  had to depend on a sula mani who came out of the iran iraq war
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:38.320]  and he was ruthless in turn what's happening is the corruption
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:42.480]  that came into the system including the iran revolutionary guard
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:47.200]  was so offensive to the young people and these young people in iran
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:51.600]  they're exceedingly bright i gotta tell you i went to the university of tehran
[2:25:51.600 --> 2:25:56.480]  these are incredibly bright students who speak english they appreciate america
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:00.240]  they do not like the mula they do not like to be repressed by an
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:05.120]  antiquated religion which hasn't been you know modernized in hundreds of years
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:09.440]  and in turn what will happen is trump has said you know what
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:12.960]  obama you know what john carrey you failed
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:18.960]  the cia failed on the brendan and what i'm doing is to eliminate 180 billion
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:24.320]  dollars you gave in hostage these to the iran
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:29.360]  leaders and that i'm now making sure that we wiped out that and that was another
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:32.880]  question i was going to get to uh you you've said firebush people the national
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:36.240]  security council that have worked for obama and the bushes and the clinton's
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:41.440]  trump's now doing that and the word is he's going to fire even even more
[2:26:41.440 --> 2:26:45.600]  that's correct but thanks to you and i was able to announce it in on a video to
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:49.280]  say look mr president you can't have
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:54.240]  hundred people on the phone you've got to have at most maybe four five or ten
[2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:57.840]  under baker james baker we had a very tight ship
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:01.040]  and either way you're not just saying these messages get the trump we're not
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:04.160]  just saying it to act powerful that's why they have congressional hearings saying
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:07.120]  we can't let info wars in the white house we got to keep trump from it
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:10.320]  because he hears this common sense we were the ones that expose
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:15.200]  fiona hill being a soros operative and McMaster they literally want me dead just
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:19.440]  because of that which again shows how powerful is the deep state that a radio
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:23.200]  show out of texas saying to the president hey this person's a globalist
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:27.360]  hurts them it shows why can't trump though get more people around him to
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.400]  help him navigate because i get he's a businessman and knows how to get those
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:33.680]  things done but he's got to get those traders out
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:38.320]  well unfortunately he braided his own self-destruction on a show that i said
[2:27:38.320 --> 2:27:42.480]  two years ago when he brought in the neocons when you bring in john bolton
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:47.520]  who is a chicken hawk i've known john i've i he and i've talked and we've
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:50.960]  worked together but honestly he is nothing more
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:54.560]  than a war hawk but when you say go to vietnam come on john
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:57.520]  you wanted to war he said oh no no i don't want to get killed
[2:27:57.520 --> 2:28:01.600]  in the trenches why don't you come to war and i write oh no i don't want to get
[2:28:01.600 --> 2:28:06.000]  killed so what you have is the entrance of a lot of these
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:11.120]  chicken hawks under john bolton who came in and said we're gonna go to war
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:14.880]  well the time was right and trump measured it
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:18.400]  very carefully because you gotta remember trump doesn't like war
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:22.720]  he has said from the very beginning war is not a very useful tool
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:27.360]  but what he did was not to create a war it's an announcement of the war to
[2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:31.920]  ayatollah khamenei but basically he strategically took out
[2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:36.800]  two of the key men in the iran iran revolutionary god and he had announced
[2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:41.760]  beforehand these are terrorist organizations anyone forward he said
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:45.120]  i'm not warning you i'm threatening you phone calls with dr steve pacinic i
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:48.400]  promise callers bam bam bam when we come back steve pacinic.com
[2:28:48.400 --> 2:28:53.120]  i'm alex shones with info wars dot com we'll be right back

[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:11.120]  to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our ppx
[2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:14.400]  microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:17.520]  electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the
[2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:20.320]  historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:23.840]  mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[2:29:23.840 --> 2:29:27.440]  to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:30.960]  thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:34.080]  if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's what you should do
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:37.360]  right now check out the ppx microgrid system at my
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:41.920]  own power grid dot com that's my own power grid dot com over a thousand
[2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:45.840]  dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too and the best part
[2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:49.520]  you're not going to pay 750 or 500 dollars 300 or even 200
[2:29:49.520 --> 2:29:56.800]  go to my own power grid dot com to learn more that's my own power grid dot com
[2:29:56.800 --> 2:29:59.920]  it's either happened to every person listening
[2:29:59.920 --> 2:30:03.680]  or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[2:30:03.680 --> 2:30:08.960]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:12.240]  have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:16.720]  and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life
[2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:20.480]  but still like concentration camp victims
[2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:24.080]  they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:27.280]  to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies
[2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:30.720]  mainline government studies in canada and europe show that when you take the
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:33.840]  flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the
[2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:38.160]  flu the next season by lowering your immunity it goes on and on
[2:30:38.160 --> 2:30:42.800]  or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:47.040]  that the flu vaccine has never ever even worked
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:51.040]  but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the giant hoax going
[2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:53.760]  no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record
[2:30:53.760 --> 2:30:58.160]  happening right now i keep my eye on the news
[2:30:58.160 --> 2:31:04.320]  all the time but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago
[2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:12.000]  the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:16.480]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine
[2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:22.800]  it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified it so
[2:31:22.800 --> 2:31:26.240]  it's supposedly non-lethal same stuff they did with the
[2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:30.560]  garter cell vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so many
[2:31:30.560 --> 2:31:35.280]  this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:39.200]  since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years
[2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:42.560]  oh and of course opened the borders up here and letting people in
[2:31:42.560 --> 2:31:46.320]  unvetted the democrats distribute across the country
[2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:49.760]  you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[2:31:49.760 --> 2:31:53.360]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america
[2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:58.000]  this is the new world order it was about three and a half months ago
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:01.360]  and i said on air i'm going to religiously take my supplements
[2:32:01.360 --> 2:32:04.640]  i'd always taken them in the past but i forget like everybody else to stay on
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:08.160]  the regimen well i've done it and i've lost 39
[2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:11.760]  pounds in less than four months and my life is so amazing
[2:32:11.760 --> 2:32:15.440]  and i still have cake and ice cream and pie just like i did before
[2:32:15.440 --> 2:32:20.800]  i'm exercising the same amount but my body has the trace elements and the key
[2:32:20.800 --> 2:32:24.160]  things it needs like the clean iodine and x2 and x3
[2:32:24.160 --> 2:32:28.640]  and i take a good energy booster like turbo force and brain force for my brain
[2:32:28.640 --> 2:32:31.760]  and i take the fish oil and i take the turmeric and i take the knockout
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:34.480]  and i use the good toothpaste it's fluoride free that's got the tea tree
[2:32:34.480 --> 2:32:38.560]  oil and so much more at infowarslife.com 2020 is dawning we have

[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:29.760]  i i know i'm not a globalist the globalism is for this world government
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.000]  i'm for america but america still has interest in and i don't want these wars
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:38.240]  and i've given you my honest view uh on what trump did
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:41.040]  uh and i've had played with tucker carlson had to say and i get his
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:43.760]  perspective and we've had collars that agree or disagree
[2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:47.120]  we're not a cult where we're one thing or we're the other
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:51.360]  we're trying to have a discussion okay so so quantify
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:54.400]  why i need to get down on my knees i'm gonna get under steve pacinic's take on
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:58.800]  this because what i've done uh my issue is i know iran's
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:01.920]  running proxy armies all over i know they're working with elements of the
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:06.240]  deep state to try to sabotage trump's plan to get us out of the middle east
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:09.520]  and and and this would actually lead to iran being run to their
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:12.720]  by their own people will the neocons and others try to go into iran and set up
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:16.240]  some new horrible thing if if if the iotolis fall absolutely
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:20.320]  do i want regime change no i'm talking about real politics the real stuff
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:24.160]  going on in the world do you think i'm like a hawk pushing war here
[2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:29.440]  absolutely you entertained um uh regime regime change and like uh
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:33.440]  you sound like obama with it hold on how do you think how do you think trump
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:36.720]  got north korea to come to the table the deep state through china had them
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:40.800]  threatening to attack japan everybody to try to get us into a war and make us
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:44.000]  look like idiots and then trump geared up and they back down
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:47.680]  let's get steve pacinic's take doc you want to comment on what he's saying here
[2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:51.680]  well with all due respect i came out of the same area this gentleman comes from
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:55.200]  virginia if he has a problem i understand virginia it's a
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:59.760]  disaster of a state now i do what i did i moved to the south
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:03.360]  i moved to florida to texas the northeast
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:08.720]  virginia naryland new york california illinois michigan will all be finished
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:11.760]  for simple reasons you have governors who are totally
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:15.440]  ineffectual at the local level you're totally ineffectual
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:19.360]  you don't have commissioners who can do roads or do anything else you can
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:23.840]  complain sir but the bottom line is very simply you come down to the south
[2:37:23.840 --> 2:37:28.000]  you come down to where we have no taxes and we carry guns i think you'll be a
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:32.400]  happier man but don't blame alex jones this is not his fault this is not
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:34.880]  anybody's fault let me throw it in this way let me throw it
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:37.600]  but i mean i think he's allowed to ask the question i agree with let me throw
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:40.240]  this at him and get both your takes on this
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:43.840]  i got really mad when trump bombed that little chemical base in syria
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:47.040]  because i thought it meant a huge war like it always has in the past he did that
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:51.600]  to silence the hawks and to then make the enemies back off and it was a
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:54.240]  measured response and it worked really well
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:57.840]  okay now if this gets expansive i'm not going to be happy i think this is a
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:37:59.920]  measured response i don't like seeing the trips being
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:03.920]  upped it could go bad but but i don't understand how
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:08.240]  how how you think i'm betraying you being pro war i'm not telling trump what
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:12.400]  to do and i think we'll still see how this unfolds
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:17.840]  speak with steve because steve i'm staying in virginia bees my family's
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:21.840]  been here since the 1700s i'm fight i'm either fighting or that's all
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:26.720]  is to it but we this isn't america first we
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:31.440]  got to get out of all this stuff it is enough alex and you know it is and
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:35.280]  well i think what pacenic saying is is if that regime goes down
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:40.080]  and they get a populist regime and tay ron that will absolutely stabilize a
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:43.520]  lot of the middle east and you won't have the big chi i tsuni conflict
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:46.560]  and saudi arabia won't have the excuse to be on the war path is that an accurate
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:51.120]  statement you review dr pacenic yeah also remember there are allies who
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:54.480]  agree with what we're doing number one we couldn't have done this without russia's
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:57.680]  agreement that's what a week ago that's when trump
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:02.480]  and putin agreed on it number two it's a destabilizing force which we need had
[2:39:02.480 --> 2:39:06.880]  to resolve in order to shift to east asia we want to get out of the middle east
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:10.080]  he said it in order to get out of the middle east we have to resolve the
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:13.760]  problem that's been the focus of an issue for about 20 30
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:16.560]  years thanks to the bush thanks to the trump
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:20.320]  admin is uh to the government always says he's cleaning up the problems the
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:23.760]  deep state created by the hating he's tying up the loose ends and if he
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:27.040]  doesn't then we'll start getting upset i mean i mean just and i think you got to
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:30.640]  give us a little bit you know i mean a little bit more benefit of the doubt
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:34.880]  here the room let's just stop with this with the
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:38.480]  stuff it's okay just and i appreciate your call i got to move on to other
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:41.200]  people all right all right i got to move on to the people it's very interesting
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:44.320]  calls and that's how you're able to call in cnn and stuff when they take calls
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:47.680]  it's all controlled you just called in you're on the air that's what info wars
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:52.480]  is not a cult um therese we had him on earlier but
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:54.400]  i want to hold him over to ask you a question
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:57.680]  therese thinks it might have been a false flag by another country
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:01.200]  like saudi arabia or israel with the attack on the oil workers
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:04.880]  to get us into this what do you think dr patrick
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:08.880]  well the attack on the oil workers was i think uh it may have well been a
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:13.120]  false flag but this had nothing to do with what was going on with sulamani
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:18.800]  sulamani of himself is a real problem for agitation
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:22.320]  the middle east for the most part he is a real problem
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:26.800]  for ayatollah hameni there has been a problem between the both of them
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:31.120]  and what happened in effect is we're resolving an internal and an external
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:34.080]  problem in iran by taking him out we're
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:37.760]  basically saying to ayatollah hamen now it's your turn
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:40.720]  you want to make peace or you don't want to make peace you don't want to make
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:44.560]  peace we'll go inside of iran and we already have operative and it's a
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:48.240]  message to kim jong-un i'm sorry and it's a message in
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:52.320]  north korea the north koreans look kim jong-un
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:56.480]  is not a stupid guy as i said he went to the school in switzerland i went to
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:40:59.760]  school in switzerland i stayed there for a week i was kicked out
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:04.160]  he stayed there for three years so he has a clear understanding what the problem
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:08.400]  is is what he saw under the clinton obama and bush
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:12.720]  administrations that when you say you're an ally like adafi
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:16.640]  we then take him out then when we say is saddam who's saying you know take away
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:21.200]  your weapons then we take him out so kim jong-un is saying listen guys i
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:24.080]  want to be friendly i'm not interested in a war
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:27.520]  but the minute you take away my weapons you take me down
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:31.760]  so the answer is trump has to convince him we're not going to take you down
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:36.880]  we'll take your weapons away and guess what kim jong-un i want to build hotels
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:40.240]  just when you're young has been waiting to see if trump can really stay in
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:43.680]  power it's not only that he likes trump he
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:47.680]  knows he'll stay in power but he wants to see what in turn he can get
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:51.600]  for concessions that he knows he needs to make and that's going to be the piece
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:54.480]  that the last caller really wanted all right we're going to go to break
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:57.120]  and come back and take a lot of calls we're going to go to chris we're going
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:41:59.760]  to go to tony we're going to go to josh lube all the everybody
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:02.240]  oh and shroyer you're going to have this gone with you for a couple hours later
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:05.280]  in your show briefly what's your take on this situation
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:08.480]  well there's so much to get to it's tough for 50 seconds left in this segment
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:12.800]  but i will just say this um you know just looking at the what we know for
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:15.600]  sure and kind of the the responses we've seen
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:20.240]  geopolitically it may be fair to make a comparison to what we saw in syria where
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:23.360]  yeah we didn't like the airstrikes we feared further intervention further war
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:26.640]  but now look what's happening in syria russia is taking over there
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:33.280]  their forces are going in us forces are retreating so it's a slow trend uh that
[2:42:33.280 --> 2:42:36.720]  sometimes seems like maybe we we push back when we need to be coming out
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:39.920]  but maybe that's what you need to clear some space to get out so so we'll see i
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:43.840]  agree with the caller we need to get out but it's going to be messy and look the
[2:42:43.840 --> 2:42:46.960]  guy was responsible for killing hundreds of us troops and the democrats are
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:50.560]  denouncing his murder i mean how bad does that look for the democrat party on top
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:55.200]  of everything else that's right and andro's making deals with turkey too
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:43:01.680]  knock on wood i am not tempting fate but everybody around the office
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:05.840]  especially folks that have worked there a long time have noticed that i really
[2:43:05.840 --> 2:43:09.680]  don't ever get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:13.600]  because i just made that statement i'm not tempting fate i'll say that again
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:16.640]  because i am superstitious when it comes down to that i'm very thankful the good
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:20.880]  lord for the constitution i've been given but
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:24.240]  up until about eight nine years ago when i started taking
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:30.000]  x2 and the products in force life i i still got sick every couple years
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:33.200]  and you know i still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:37.680]  that but now that i religiously take the
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:40.880]  products and in force life one of the highest quality supplements you're gonna
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:45.440]  find out there i just never get a fever anymore
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:50.720]  it's probably been three four years since i've had a fever
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:57.280]  it's just crazy so i chalk it up to genetics and the great products
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:02.080]  as i drive in to the central texas information warfare command center

[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:42.800]  i want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:46.800]  just words that's reality you have made history
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:50.800]  we have made history together info wars dot com
[2:45:50.800 --> 2:45:54.480]  only has power because of you and i suggest
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:58.560]  you use it i keep my eye on the news all the time
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:05.760]  but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the cdc
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:13.760]  and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states and
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:20.000]  it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:24.400]  they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal
[2:46:24.400 --> 2:46:28.560]  same stuff they did with the garter cell vaccine that's admittedly
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:33.680]  killed a name so many this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest
[2:46:33.680 --> 2:46:37.680]  outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:40.880]  the last few years oh and of course opening the borders up here
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:45.120]  and letting people in unvetted the democrats distribute across the
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:49.280]  country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:52.880]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:56.320]  this is the new world order
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:47:03.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:15.760]  we take a lot of your phone calls right now with dr steve patinix he'll be back

[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:36.160]  get to the calls but i just want to say this going back to the caller before
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:39.280]  last i think his name was jesson from virginia
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:42.400]  i really study the way the world works and i really study how governments work
[2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:46.080]  and all the rest of it and trumps legitimately trying to have
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:50.640]  economic power and and work with countries and not have this destabilization
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:54.080]  strategy of tension globalist plan he's very pragmatic
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:58.640]  and there's this word people just salivate and get sick of phantic what
[2:47:58.640 --> 2:48:02.880]  how about israel and and go oh you're you're for this war you're
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:05.520]  for israel i want out of the middle east we've
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:08.400]  got to deal with china if you want to talk about a real threat and trumps
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:11.520]  trying to pivot there is patinix just said that's a fact
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:14.720]  and then people just like oh you're doing it for israel oh wait oh israel is
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:18.480]  giving me orders right now that's ridiculous under patinix a huge
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:23.200]  critic of israel if anybody knows that that's just asinine
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:26.560]  he's trying to run projects to round up all the israeli spies
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:30.080]  so it but people call in though it's just like magic oh
[2:48:30.080 --> 2:48:33.200]  you're you're you're against the iranian regime because
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:36.960]  because they hate israel some people hate israel so much
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:42.000]  they love the iranian moolas that is just crazy dr pacenic
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:45.840]  well let me put it this way israel created a myth
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:50.400]  about judieism about the holocaust that you know i've talked about it before
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:54.160]  the american jew really doesn't understand what the holocaust is
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:57.920]  he makes up numbers of six million but the fact is bb
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:03.520]  has grew up in america israel has its own problems we're not there to help is
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:06.560]  really israel is going to have to deal with israeli now
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:11.760]  and they did not do well in 2000 i have rounded up massad operatives and i put
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:15.120]  them in prison i've also warned massad that they could
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:18.480]  not get involved in 9 11 afterwards i put them in prison
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:21.280]  and by the way you really did do that people think you're just but let's go
[2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:24.800]  back you really lost family to hitler it's on record that you
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:29.520]  you know came to my family but the point was this i mean hitler is one thing
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:34.080]  but the one thing nobody talks about is before hitler came to power my mother
[2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:37.840]  came out of russia said what about the soviet union in stalin
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:42.080]  he killed seven million christians before hitler even came to power i totally
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:44.720]  agree what you're saying is that you you've exposed the professors in the
[2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:47.600]  books that are out there that there was actually a large group of
[2:49:47.600 --> 2:49:51.760]  a large group of jews that wouldn't let jews get out of germany and poland and
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:55.200]  made them pay to the other jews
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:59.120]  well that's i mean look it's very simple who created
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:03.040]  the the IBM tickets that knew we were christians and all
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:06.880]  tom watson who gave mangle all the projects for eugenics
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:11.360]  that was a carnagy endowment the Rockefeller brothers who created
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:16.720]  concentration camps it was the british 1898 unless you learn your history
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:20.720]  as you said elix you're going to be a fool and you will just repeat the
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:24.480]  nonsense of israel israel didn't take in any holocaust
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:28.160]  jews they didn't want it when uh bengurian was asked by
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:32.960]  eichmann who spoke hebrew he said do you want three to four hundred thousand
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:36.960]  of these people in the camps he said no i'd rather have pigs and
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:41.040]  ironically guess who was the leader of taking away the jews
[2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:44.800]  a man by the name of hydric an austrian jew
[2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:50.800]  so within history's army there were over 146 000 jews
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:54.320]  two out of the five field commanders i'm getting tired of this
[2:50:54.320 --> 2:50:58.640]  were jews that was the big secret that hepler was really a rock child and i've
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:02.080]  looked into it it's true i didn't make this up
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:05.760]  i mean the whole thing about israel is a cockamamie story that they
[2:51:05.760 --> 2:51:10.320]  we need a land of the jews no in 1965 america pulled out
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:14.160]  so they came up with the story in the house but i'm not even against israel
[2:51:14.160 --> 2:51:18.080]  all i'm trying to say is these ignoramuses call in and like magically go
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:21.680]  oh you're you're doing this for israel when they don't even know what they're
[2:51:21.680 --> 2:51:25.920]  talking about or who they're talking to i mean it's ridiculous i feel like
[2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:28.880]  that's just kind of a different approach to sitting here saying you're a russian
[2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:31.760]  agent or or oh you work for the jews or you work for the vatican
[2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:35.680]  no i work for freedom dammit i have integrity and i'm sick of that crap
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:39.200]  it's just another thing like oh they're all wars for oil or they're all wars for
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:41.840]  regime change there's a lot of different factors that go into these wars in the
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:44.400]  middle east it's a very complex issue but but it
[2:51:44.400 --> 2:51:47.520]  the problem is now and half the damn oil goes through there
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:51.920]  and the iranians and the and the and the salties are about to kill each other
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:55.040]  we're gonna have world war three let's look at the issue at hand now
[2:51:55.040 --> 2:51:58.960]  i'm sorry you gotta go ahead you have people concerned now that iran is
[2:51:58.960 --> 2:52:02.320]  going to strike the united states but again it's my understanding
[2:52:02.320 --> 2:52:05.760]  if you're making comparisons here this was a drone strike targeted on one
[2:52:05.760 --> 2:52:08.800]  individual looks like it just blew up a car no weddings got
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:12.640]  hit no civilization uh you know centers got hit
[2:52:12.640 --> 2:52:16.640]  it wasn't a place where residents and the guys they killed literally run
[2:52:16.640 --> 2:52:20.320]  these bulldozers where they haul women and children up by their necks and kill
[2:52:20.320 --> 2:52:23.680]  them if they don't wear a jib the guy's a damn butcher he's dead now the
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:27.440]  department of defense released documents claiming this guy was responsible for
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:31.280]  over 500 us troops deaths and being maimed over there as
[2:52:31.280 --> 2:52:34.640]  well so again but how about this now let's get
[2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:38.320]  let's just look at what we know and what's developing so now you have all
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:41.680]  these democrats and leftists saying oh we're afraid iran's going to strike
[2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:44.560]  well you know we've got a wide open border
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:47.760]  right now okay and we're going to sit here and bitch
[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:50.640]  about what's going on in the middle east and you're going to have wide open
[2:52:50.640 --> 2:52:53.680]  southern border and you're concerned about iran attacking us well let's
[2:52:53.680 --> 2:52:56.320]  can let's let's do something about no i totally agree we have to do something
[2:52:56.320 --> 2:52:59.120]  about that let's take a call from chris in washington thanks chris for
[2:52:59.120 --> 2:53:02.080]  holding her on the air with dr c pechenek i want shroyer
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:06.000]  yeah hey thanks thanks uh for having me on
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:09.600]  uh dr pechenek alex oh and i appreciate
[2:53:09.600 --> 2:53:13.280]  all all that you do and all the wisdom that you guys have
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:17.520]  together you're all together i don't have anything
[2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:21.360]  knowledgeable that other than i agree with everything you're saying
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:25.760]  i mean you you guys have been hitting it right on the spot
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:29.680]  well i appreciate your call chris let me ask dr pechenek this sleeper cells how
[2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:33.520]  big a threat is that with the uh coulds and the and their
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:37.360]  malicious and embedded groups and how are the neocons and globalists going to
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:41.680]  try to spin this and and towards their aims
[2:53:41.680 --> 2:53:45.760]  but one we there aren't that many sleeper cells we're not worried about it
[2:53:45.760 --> 2:53:50.640]  number one you got to look at how big we are as a nation we're huge we're four
[2:53:50.640 --> 2:53:56.640]  time zones larger than most countries in terms of the neocons this is what they
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:53:59.520]  started with 9 11 this is what they started in the
[2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:03.840]  iran or iraq war you got to go back to the 1980s but the gentleman in
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:08.720]  virginia he's got to understand this goes back to the 1980s when we initiated
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:12.320]  wars again iraq in iran and guess who flew
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:18.480]  for iran the israelis in the 1980s for eight years the israelis flew on
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:24.560]  behalf of the irans without marked airplanes in turn we flew for iraq
[2:54:24.560 --> 2:54:28.960]  so what happened as a result of that war and sulamani came out of that war
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:34.720]  as a major major soldier and he it was like world war one
[2:54:34.720 --> 2:54:38.960]  one million people died in iraq one million people died in iran
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:44.400]  i was there i saw the massacre of it it was worse than world war one it had
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:47.680]  nothing to do with israel other than the fact we
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:53.040]  asked israel and the iranian humani to fly on behalf of the iranians
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:57.680]  this was a war started under the bush administration the reagan administration
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:01.920]  we sent schultz had sent tear gas to that area
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:07.200]  i was there when they sent it so if you want to go back to me muster gas
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:11.120]  mustard gas that's correct we sent mustard gas now you know and your
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:15.040]  and your fans know it do you think anybody in the news has talked about
[2:55:15.040 --> 2:55:18.160]  that no do you think anybody in the news goes
[2:55:18.160 --> 2:55:22.000]  back to the carter administration or the reagan administration or the bush
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.480]  administration all of which i was in and i was against but nevertheless i
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:30.800]  served my country so it's very easy for somebody in virginia to say oh i'm
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:34.800]  disappointed in this and that it's much harder to be what you have to be a
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:38.720]  citizen soldier you don't like what happens try to make it
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:42.080]  better you work at the local level you don't like what happens at the local
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:46.560]  level they work at the national level but stop complaining americans have to
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:50.320]  stop complaining and understand you don't like what's happening
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:53.600]  then organize if you want to be a democrat fine you want to be an
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:56.720]  independent fine you want to be another party fine
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:00.720]  but don't tell me about your miseries we have a huge country
[2:56:00.720 --> 2:56:03.920]  where we're doing exceedingly well well i think i don't want to get derailed by
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:07.040]  that caller my whole point is we're all legitimately having a massive
[2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:10.640]  discussion and debate about was this right and i think we're saying we give
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:14.480]  trump the benefit of the doubt and we see the strategy and we hope it doesn't go
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:17.520]  terribly bad uh but we're doing it as americans who
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:20.080]  have that right and we're all on the same team well we need to respect the
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:23.520]  elements here alex too i mean if you play a game of football when it's a
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:27.440]  clear day out versus when it's uh snowy and windy you're going to play a
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:29.440]  different game and that's what we're dealing with here
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:32.800]  the obama administration had different elements the bush administration had
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:35.280]  different elements the trump administration has different elements so
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:38.720]  we're dealing with an entirely different set of elements here and i believe
[2:56:38.720 --> 2:56:42.400]  is is america first and he's proving it and so we give them the benefit of the
[2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:44.800]  doubt and it's not easy to sit here like if you
[2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:48.400]  look at the carryovers on the foreign policy from the bush administration
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:50.720]  from the clint administration from the obama administration the bush
[2:56:50.720 --> 2:56:54.000]  administration it's kind of the same element so it's easier to come on in
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.920]  response to something obama or bush did it's usually moving the same agenda
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:01.360]  it's a different set of elements now we're still kind of looking at the field
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:04.960]  analyzing how everything's ending up laying on this whole geopolitical
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:09.120]  chessboard and and maybe things will look clear in 2040 i want to do five more
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:12.720]  minutes without a pechenic than syrian girl who lives in australia but his
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:17.760]  family was in the ruling party at the top uh in syria really smart she's
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:20.560]  against what happened we're gonna get her perspective that'll make some folks
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:24.080]  mad as well but final segment dr steve pechenic will be back on it for to give
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:27.840]  deeper analysis uh with oh and shroyer on the war room that's three to six
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:32.320]  p.m band dot video on the satellites for radio and tv only way people find out

[3:00:13.040 --> 3:00:18.400]  a couple hours you can do it uh but but i was asking you when when remington said
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:22.320]  you supply the pictures i'll supply the war uh when when when her said that's a
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:25.120]  remington i i know what war propaganda is i know
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:28.320]  when it's a major push coming out of the government and i know trump's not in
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:31.600]  full control of government yet because but when they do these pushes on me with
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:35.200]  the fake sandy hook news uh you know they've lost lawsuits and stuff you
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:39.040]  usually say i'm a true on every channel on new year's eve while the balls are
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:42.800]  dropping who the hell is giving that order and in in in your view and what
[3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:44.640]  is that
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:48.160]  let me put it this way so that the american public understands
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:53.280]  the deep deep state that we're talking about is not what about clinton or any
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:56.560]  of that we have a phenomenon called the mockingbird phenomenon that was done in
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:01.840]  the 1950s what happened was a cia as it grew up came out of the
[3:01:01.840 --> 3:01:06.160]  os s made a deal with graham of the post with
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:13.360]  paley of uh newspapers with all the washington post the new york times cbs
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:19.680]  paley of cbs we all agreed in that time in the 50s and later on in the 60s
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:24.160]  that much of the news that will come out has to be integrated
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:28.160]  with our intelligence and our propaganda machinery
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:34.800]  so when alex jones who comes out of the mainstream or becomes a paradigm shift
[3:01:34.800 --> 3:01:39.840]  eventually becomes encompassed within that discussion and what do i mean
[3:01:39.840 --> 3:01:44.080]  most people don't understand the deep deep state it's nothing about hillary
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:48.400]  or anybody else is really a constant hegellian dialectic to make it very
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:53.200]  simple we go both democrat and republican we create tensions on both
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:56.320]  sides to maintain the viability of the republic
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:01.040]  and the vitality so when you think the new york times is hitting alex jones you
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:04.800]  better think again who are really hitting alex jones and if you think alex
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:08.240]  jones it's just simply attacking the new york times then you better
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:12.640]  ask why does a guy like the chenic come on and why is he asked repeatedly will
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:16.800]  you come on so the point i'm trying to say the american public is
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:20.560]  you're part of an ongoing revolution that's in
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:24.720]  that's part of the narrative of the republic the narrative that's the
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:29.200]  president left us really legitimately hate me and don't even get
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:32.800]  that that they're being invoked to attack by smarter folks that understand
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:36.080]  out of the clash and the process it'll help reignite americana
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:39.280]  thought saying i'm not organic and totally legitimate i'm my real self
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.200]  you're just saying the archetype is being used in a dialectic conflict
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:46.720]  correct now and you got to understand
[3:02:46.720 --> 3:02:50.160]  you're i'm we're pitting let's i'm putting a nancy
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:55.520]  pelosi against alex jones on any spectrum that makes no
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:01.680]  sense a woman who's literally on a swan song with a man who's constantly been
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:04.720]  in the forefront of news every day and by the way
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:08.800]  happens to know his history and happens to know the difference between a
[3:03:08.800 --> 3:03:12.320]  republic and a democracy and a nancy pelosi
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:16.640]  who has to go to our own people to find out that we're not a democracy
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:21.920]  and then comes back with absurd notions that that kind of dialectic is part of
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:27.280]  this republic and once again the republic is not a democracy
[3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:30.720]  we have representatives so it's just like the founders created separation of
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:34.160]  powers at every level it's a real conflict but
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:37.440]  but but it's being set up so that people can make their own decision
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:41.120]  and see how pathetic the globalist are and this is a process
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:45.600]  that's exactly correct but you have to remember and this is what the democrats
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:48.720]  do not understand in the liberals
[3:03:48.720 --> 3:03:53.520]  hamilton madison all of our great jefferson
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:58.960]  hated the tyranny of the masses they came they saw the revolution in france
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:04.160]  and what happened to king six louis 16th and they said we will not have that
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:09.280]  in our own revolution that's why they did not accept the tyranny of democracy
[3:04:09.280 --> 3:04:13.600]  and that's exactly what pelosi and the democrats have no idea about what they
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:17.200]  thought before hegel ever codified it the founders had already put in a
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:21.280]  alien dialectic into the country itself which is the secret to the republic
[3:04:21.280 --> 3:04:24.480]  you are brilliant you hit it right on the head you see you should have been a

[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:24.480]  your calls in i did good the first hour or two then i got behind with the
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:28.560]  chenicon but it's it's been a powerful broadcast today we're praying for peace
[3:06:28.560 --> 3:06:32.800]  we hope this doesn't escalate uh but i see why trump did it now syrian girls are
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:36.160]  really smart lady and she's been on many times over the years been too long since
[3:06:36.160 --> 3:06:40.640]  she's been on i'm glad she's here uh and you can find her on twitter at
[3:06:40.640 --> 3:06:45.280]  partisan girl and at patreon at syrian girl and i'm not going to go into her
[3:06:45.280 --> 3:06:49.360]  whole past or who she is uh but but but maybe she should recap she had been on
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:52.000]  the show in probably a year which she should be on every day with this stuff
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:55.680]  going on and she's welcome to not she doesn't have to tell me alex you've
[3:06:55.680 --> 3:07:00.480]  done good i like you but you're wrong i respect her perspective uh because when
[3:07:00.480 --> 3:07:03.520]  you've got all these countries doing this a lot of times both sides can be
[3:07:03.520 --> 3:07:07.120]  right depending on your perspective and i'm not being moral relativist here
[3:07:07.120 --> 3:07:11.440]  it's just it does you depend on where you're at uh but
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:15.120]  she's definitely been a very accurate person on the fake chemical attacks
[3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:19.040]  on what's happened in syria how iran came in and helped stop al-qaeda and isis
[3:07:19.040 --> 3:07:23.040]  taken over and killing all the religious minorities so i think that uh the
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:27.120]  salamani you know did good work there uh but you know now you've got proxy wars
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:30.640]  and the rest of this stuff going on so she's here to give us her take on that
[3:07:30.640 --> 3:07:35.760]  so thanks for coming on syrian girl thanks so much for having me on alex uh
[3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:39.600]  even though i'm you know don't have to say it and still it's i really respect
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:43.120]  the fact that you allow people onto your show even if you
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:46.400]  don't agree on everything and so i'm glad to be here
[3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:49.120]  oh yeah well i mean i mean i'm gonna agree with your perspective i think
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:53.200]  you're right about all this it's just that iran's been pushing us around
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:56.480]  and trump and working with the deep state i think to embarrass trump so that's
[3:07:56.480 --> 3:07:59.440]  why he went ahead and killed him and so i know why trump did it i'm not even
[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:02.320]  saying in the fullness of it i think it's a good idea
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:07.520]  but i do see why trump did it but give us your expert take on this
[3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:11.120]  well uh firstly this man you know this is probably the first
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:16.080]  anyone in the u.s has heard of him but he has actually a very powerful general
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:19.760]  in the iranian military probably the most powerful general
[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:23.760]  and in fact he was working with the united states to fight isis
[3:08:23.760 --> 3:08:27.120]  for the last few years um he fought alongside them
[3:08:27.120 --> 3:08:33.440]  in battles in uh you know in mosul at kirkuk and uh also in
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:38.400]  Afghanistan so you know he has in the past you've
[3:08:38.400 --> 3:08:42.000]  been seen as kind of a front um and now they've
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.880]  suddenly come up with all this stuff about him
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:48.880]  uh after they assassinated him saying that he
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:52.320]  killed americans whose names we haven't been told
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:56.400]  and now they've changed it to he hasn't killed americans but he will
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:08:59.920]  kill america he was going to and that's why we killed him
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:03.760]  of course all of this is it's not really uh
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:07.680]  true this is just justification um this is about
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:14.320]  isolating iran the problem they have is that uh the deep state had this goal
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:19.360]  they were going to get uh in syria al qaeda in power
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:23.840]  so if we remember during you are there i know you fought against iraq war in
[3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:27.360]  2003 and all the propaganda and lies that we were told
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:31.280]  then we were told that the shiites were going to greet the united states as
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:34.560]  liberators and that they were going to get rid of saddam
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:39.200]  and after 2003 they got rid of saddam which wasn't a religious man
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:43.760]  and they they basically the u.s under the u.s uh
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:48.160]  control they installed the shiite government and now in syria they're
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:52.880]  trying to get rid of Assad and install well they tried to install a muslim
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:56.160]  brotherhood government we know that that's just a fact of
[3:09:56.160 --> 3:09:59.440]  history um and we know that al qaeda and the
[3:09:59.440 --> 3:10:05.120]  leader of al qaeda is still holed up in idlib where the leader of isis was
[3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:09.440]  also holed up al baghdadi and yet uh we have
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:12.960]  statements coming out from the white house saying that they don't want Assad
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:17.760]  and russia to go in and get out as jolani and yet they have time to
[3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:20.480]  assassinate this iranian guy that for isis
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:27.440]  so the plan was to get shiites in power in iraq to get the muslim brotherhood
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:31.200]  or syni extremists in power in syria and then have them fight
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:35.920]  each other now that didn't work out so now the iranian presence in iraq has
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:39.680]  become a more of a liability and that's why they're targeting it
[3:10:39.680 --> 3:10:43.040]  and if you notice in last week when they struck
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:48.640]  the iraqi-syrian border that's also goes to show you that what they're
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:10:51.760]  targeting here is that alliance that connection
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:56.560]  between iraq uh syria and iran and that's what's
[3:10:56.560 --> 3:10:59.440]  it's a danger not to the united states but to ishiel
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:03.360]  linking up and creating you know their own uh shiite islamic state through
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:06.560]  there why then and of course what you're saying is true from that
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:10.240]  perspective you're right why then did they attack the
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:16.320]  embassy and give uh trump the pretext to kill them
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:20.000]  well uh iran didn't attack the embassy
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:23.680]  it was iraqis who was protesting outside the embassy
[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:27.760]  the reason they protested was because of the bombing that happened
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:32.160]  on the syrian iraqi border those iraqis while they were
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:36.000]  you know supportive of iran at the same time we have to remember that
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:40.480]  a couple weeks prior to that other iraqis that were supported by the united
[3:11:40.480 --> 3:11:44.480]  states attacked the iranian embassy and destroyed that
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:47.920]  so there was all the stuff happening beforehand that nobody
[3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:51.600]  is linking together you're right about all that but they did go into the
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:54.000]  facility and burn a bunch of it down and take stuff to they weren't just
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:59.760]  protesting outside and a lot of them are with the uh you know uh in the
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:04.480]  um militia that's controlled by iran so so but i understand some ongoing
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:07.600]  so what do you think's going to come out of this the iranian embassy was burned
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:11.440]  as well um they went inside that and burned it too but iran never assassinated
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:15.520]  where do you think all this is sure where do you think all this is going
[3:12:15.520 --> 3:12:20.320]  well unfortunately uh you know these militias that iran is supporting um
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:25.120]  uh hello sorry there was an error message that popped out of my computer
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:28.480]  these militias they they did fight isis alongside
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:33.280]  american soldiers uh so you know yes they are militias but the fact is even
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.120]  syria has had to use militias because the army wasn't enough they
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:42.320]  called them p mf the people's mobilization forces um so
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:46.080]  unfortunately because isis was overrunning the country
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:49.040]  they had to get dig in to get militias but those militias
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:53.440]  did you know they did help out and why create enemies of them now that's the
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:56.880]  question what's going to happen now well we're what we're witnessing what's
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:12:59.520]  happening now they're going to have a troop search
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:02.720]  and iraq invasion it's going to happen all over again it's going to be
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:09.120]  2020 is now 2003 all over again except now there's no allies
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:13.600]  there's no shiites to work alongside with as there was in 2003
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:17.360]  now both the sunnis the shiites and even some of the Kurds
[3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:20.880]  have been disgruntled now they're all the enemy and who has
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:25.120]  been supportive of such a a troop search Nancy Pelosi
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:29.760]  that it was needed i mean this woman you know her father actually was one of the
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:32.960]  founders of israel he was one of part of one of the
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:37.520]  original terrorist organizations that was that was active
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:41.680]  before israel was created um it was regarded as a terrorist organization
[3:13:41.680 --> 3:13:46.720]  by the british um to try to create israel so you know she has a
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:51.360]  obviously a stake in this and i wonder if this whole impeachment against trump
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:56.320]  was to try to force his hand into doing this stuff
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:14:00.720]  well and then you say all that and it starts convincing me because
[3:14:00.720 --> 3:14:03.680]  i know the history of all that it's absolutely true i think trump's
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:08.320]  legitimately trying to get us out of these wars um the deep state's been
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:11.600]  trying to stop that but he did work with Russia
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:15.600]  and at least got back to allow the isis al-qaeda groups to be
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:19.040]  taking out he's trying to work with turkey i think to try to mop that up
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:22.400]  correct me if you think i'm wrong i know the deep state tried to embarrass
[3:14:22.400 --> 3:14:26.560]  trump to uh through kim jong-un and china until
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:30.640]  trump got strong and then kim jong-un back down uh so i think trump's really
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:34.960]  sending a message to put it as well
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:40.960]  say that again sorry with putin too sure so so what do you think
[3:14:40.960 --> 3:14:47.040]  trump thinks he's doing is my question i think i'm on for you know i think they
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:50.640]  told him that this is a bad man that killed people and we need to take him
[3:14:50.640 --> 3:14:53.600]  out i don't think he realizes the gravity of the situation
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:56.880]  because now this man is one of the most powerful men
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:01.760]  in iran and so if you if you want to study i don't think he's the second most
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:05.360]  powerful he was the most popular and most powerful person i mean
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:10.400]  because the itola's a moron reportedly uh so i mean he really was he
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:15.280]  we just killed the head of the iranian government something along those lines
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:18.960]  and so anyone in the iranian government right now is going to feel personally
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:21.760]  under threat and if you're going to feel or even even
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:26.080]  any of the world leaders right now are feeling personally under threat
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:30.320]  and if that's the case you know what they have to retaliate they have to do
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:34.080]  something all right let's talk about that siri girl and i promise callers i'm
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:36.800]  going to get to you one way or another i love you i appreciate you and i respect

[3:20:52.640 --> 3:21:00.080]  kasem salamani salamani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on
[3:21:00.080 --> 3:21:06.480]  american diplomats and military personnel but we caught him in the act
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:12.480]  and terminated him under my leadership america's policy is
[3:21:12.480 --> 3:21:16.880]  unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:22.880]  any american we will find you we will eliminate you we will always protect our
[3:21:22.880 --> 3:21:28.880]  diplomats service members all americans and our allies
[3:21:28.880 --> 3:21:32.800]  for years the islamic revolutionary guard corps
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:38.640]  and its ruthless cudd's force under salamani's leadership has targeted
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:43.200]  injured and murdered hundreds of american civilians and servicemen
[3:21:43.200 --> 3:21:48.640]  the recent attacks on us targets in iraq including rocket strikes that killed
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:53.360]  an american and injured for american servicemen very badly
[3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:56.560]  as well as a violent assault on our embassy in
[3:21:56.560 --> 3:22:02.960]  bagdad were carried out at the direction of salamani
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:07.920]  salamani made the death of innocent people his sick passion
[3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:12.880]  contributing to terrorist plots as far away as new deli in london
[3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:17.520]  today we remember and honor the victims of salamani's many atrocities and we
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:21.600]  take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:26.000]  is over we're going to pause for one moment to let our fox stations join us
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:29.920]  perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the middle east
[3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:34.400]  for the last 20 years what the united states did yesterday should have been
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:38.320]  done long ago a lot of lives would have been saved
[3:22:38.320 --> 3:22:45.440]  just recently salamani led the brutal repression of protesters in iran
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:49.920]  where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:55.280]  by their own government we took action last night to stop
[3:22:55.280 --> 3:23:01.600]  a war we did not take action to start a war
[3:23:01.600 --> 3:23:04.960]  i have deep respect for the iranian people
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:09.360]  they are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:13.360]  potential we do not seek regime change however
[3:23:13.360 --> 3:23:16.560]  the iranian regime's aggression in the region including
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:21.280]  the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors
[3:23:21.280 --> 3:23:27.440]  must end and it must end now the future belongs to the people of iran
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:31.600]  those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation
[3:23:31.600 --> 3:23:35.760]  not the terrorists warlords who plunder their nation
[3:23:35.760 --> 3:23:43.040]  to finance bloodshed abroad the united states has the best military by far
[3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:47.600]  anywhere in the world we have the best intelligence in the world
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:51.680]  if americans anywhere are threatened we have all
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:55.520]  of those targets already fully identified
[3:23:55.520 --> 3:24:02.240]  and i am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary
[3:24:02.240 --> 3:24:08.560]  and that in particular refers to iran under my leadership we have destroyed
[3:24:08.560 --> 3:24:14.160]  the isis territorial caliphate and recently american special operations
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:18.720]  forces killed the terrorist leader known as al baghdadi
[3:24:18.720 --> 3:24:24.160]  the world is a safer place without these monsters
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:27.760]  america will always pursue the interests of
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:33.040]  good people great people great souls while seeking peace harmony and
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:37.280]  friendship with all of the nations of the world thank you god
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:41.120]  bless you god bless our great military and god
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:44.640]  bless the united states of america thank you very much
[3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:52.480]  thank you all right clearly it's about the fact that
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:56.240]  the islamic regime is very unpopular and there is an attempt to overthrow it
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:24:59.520]  by the people and folks want that to happen
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:02.880]  and trump does not want a shiite sunni civil war starting
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:06.640]  they let the iranians go in with the russians and that's who mainly did most
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:09.120]  of the work so when trump's talking about taking out al qaeda
[3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:12.480]  and isis i love our military but it was russia and the iranians
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:14.800]  now the iranians they were like hey we're going to take everything else over
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:17.760]  we're not stopping and so in trump's view and why he made the decision is i
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:21.040]  predicted it's why he did it they said sir he's going to keep expanding
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:24.800]  just like isis so we have to stop him too so trump said
[3:25:24.800 --> 3:25:29.440]  i took action to stop a war now let's see if he can control the neocons
[3:25:29.440 --> 3:25:33.680]  and the deep staters from that because once you feed the pirate it's going to
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:36.480]  want more and more but i do think they came just like
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:39.920]  syrian girl said and said sir he's a bad guy he does all this you can show him
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:43.360]  it public executions hanging people and stuff
[3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:47.600]  and and trump said well get that guy uh and because he's a real personal type
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:50.240]  guy he doesn't want to just kill random troops oh you want me to kill the head of
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:54.400]  something i'll do that so that's my view and
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:59.120]  syrian girl your response what you just saw the president uh trump say
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:03.840]  i was more interested in what he didn't say um what was missing in his speech
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:08.320]  was any mention of al-qaeda and the leader of al-qaeda al-joulani
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:11.760]  which is still in syria's idlib you know we're being told that
[3:26:11.760 --> 3:26:16.160]  well he needed to really kill this guy but what about the guy that he really
[3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:19.120]  needs to kill you know the people that we were told that are responsible for
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:24.720]  9 11 um so it's because that guy is currently
[3:26:24.720 --> 3:26:29.120]  filing Assad and a deep state doesn't want him removed they don't want al-qaeda
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:35.120]  to be removed and actually the guardian translated one of al-qaeda's
[3:26:35.120 --> 3:26:39.040]  one of the leader of al-qaeda speeches recently so that was you know very
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:41.920]  interesting but yet here killing the people who are
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:46.480]  fighting ISIS and i do have to say you know this the fact
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:49.840]  is that the shiites already took over everything
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:53.520]  in iraq since 2003 they already had everything
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:57.360]  so but that was the point of the iraq war because they told us that the shiites
[3:26:57.360 --> 3:27:01.520]  were the majority and the saddam was you know had a sunni
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:04.800]  who was a sunni and he was leading a sunni minority and that's what we have to
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:10.640]  flip it over to them and they indeed want the deep state wanted a civil war
[3:27:10.640 --> 3:27:17.760]  and that's why the then in 2004 the u.s. ambassador
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:21.280]  wrote a constitution that federalized and cut up and carved up the country
[3:27:21.280 --> 3:27:25.520]  they wanted a civil war so you know to mention you remember when they
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:28.960]  set up those explosives and they pretended that they were just stop as
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:32.400]  terrorists while they were setting it up the british in in basra
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:36.240]  no that's right i mean you just trump's being told though he's gonna stop a
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:40.160]  civil war so he thinks he's stopping the previous policy of civil war but you
[3:27:40.160 --> 3:27:44.320]  think he's being set up i'm very confused as to how this could
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:49.120]  stop a civil war like this is nothing to do this has nothing to do with
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:54.400]  anything to do with civil war i'm just but i but trump we know is being
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:58.320]  surrounded gradually by more and more swampish people
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:03.600]  like pompeo like lindsay graham you know the fact is that he has been given
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:08.320]  bad intelligence in the past for example on syria and the chemical attack that
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:13.760]  happened in in duma in you know 2017 2018 we know
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:18.320]  now from the opc w leaks that the whole thing was a sham
[3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:22.400]  and yet trump was misled into bombing syria over that that scene that you're
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:26.480]  being shown right now it has been proven to be
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:30.000]  confirmed that it was a thing you're absolutely right stay there
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:33.520]  i want you to rise shotgun with me and i promise you if the if the hair didn't
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:36.160]  rise over bear creek that's a combination of the
[3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:39.600]  hairlips the admiral and water doesn't rise for bear creek uh very politically

[3:29:54.240 --> 3:29:58.320]  i keep my eye on the news all the time but i missed
[3:29:58.320 --> 3:30:02.320]  the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago
[3:30:02.320 --> 3:30:10.000]  the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:14.480]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine
[3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:18.400]  it is live it's not even attenuated
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:22.800]  they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly non-lethal
[3:30:22.800 --> 3:30:26.960]  same stuff they did with the garter cell vaccine that's admittedly
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:32.080]  killed a name so many this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest
[3:30:32.080 --> 3:30:34.880]  outbreaks of ebola ever since they started
[3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:38.320]  giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course open the
[3:30:38.320 --> 3:30:41.840]  borders up here and letting people in unthedded
[3:30:41.840 --> 3:30:46.400]  the democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude
[3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:50.160]  of this insanity and it is an attempted ebola assault
[3:30:50.160 --> 3:30:55.280]  on america this is the new world order knock on wood
[3:30:55.280 --> 3:31:00.240]  i am not tempting fate but everybody around the office
[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:03.120]  especially folks that have worked there a long time
[3:31:03.120 --> 3:31:08.240]  have noticed that i really don't ever get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow
[3:31:08.240 --> 3:31:12.160]  because i just made that statement i'm not tempting fate i'll say that again
[3:31:12.160 --> 3:31:15.040]  because i am superstitious when it comes down to that i'm very thankful for
[3:31:15.040 --> 3:31:20.480]  good lord for the constitution i've been given but up until about eight nine
[3:31:20.480 --> 3:31:24.640]  years ago when i started taking x2 and the products
[3:31:24.640 --> 3:31:28.560]  in force life i i still got sick every couple years
[3:31:28.560 --> 3:31:31.760]  and you know i still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like
[3:31:31.760 --> 3:31:36.240]  that but now that i religiously take the
[3:31:36.240 --> 3:31:39.360]  products and in force life with the highest quality supplements you're going

[3:31:49.200 --> 3:31:54.880]  it's just crazy so i chalk it up to genetics and the great products

[3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:15.360]  waging war on corruption
[3:33:18.160 --> 3:33:22.560]  i'm your host alex jones okay i've been doing a lot better job taking calls i'm
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:26.960]  taking probably four times five times the calls that i used to
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:30.960]  and we're the calls are amazing but i i'll suddenly go to like you know 10
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:34.960]  15 calls let me get a bunch of guests on her by sister for two hours and so
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:39.360]  we're going to go to you here in just a minute or two
[3:33:39.360 --> 3:33:42.800]  and then i've got some of the statements of chuckie schumer
[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:46.720]  all these folks but i i do agree with syrian girl
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:51.200]  trump is very informed about business a lot of other things about pr and he
[3:33:51.200 --> 3:33:54.000]  does care about the country but he has not really been studying
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:57.760]  geopolitical systems like a lot of people have
[3:33:57.760 --> 3:34:02.160]  and his instincts about being against war are very very good
[3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:05.840]  and that's what scared the neocons and others about him but
[3:34:05.840 --> 3:34:10.000]  this killing salmani is a huge deal he's the leader of iran
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:14.320]  he's not the number two and
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:20.880]  i don't see how they don't respond either smart they wouldn't respond
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:24.320]  and the truth is the deep state is incompetent
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:27.440]  a lot of them and they're scared of him i mean that they've got
[3:34:27.440 --> 3:34:30.880]  sleeper cells around the world i mean dr pacenic is a smart guy he's like oh
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:34.480]  we know who they are it's not that big a threat
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:38.480]  the hysteria that will happen if there's a big terror attack and then the
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:41.600]  liberties will lose because of it all the borders wide open
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:45.280]  and the troop escalation i don't like any of this i like trump i know why he
[3:34:45.280 --> 3:34:48.640]  did it and if and if the reason he did it turns out to be
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:54.720]  correct well then he's right but it's a hell of a gamble the problem is
[3:34:54.720 --> 3:34:58.320]  iran is playing hanky panky in the gulf they are pulling games i get their
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:35:01.920]  undersanctions they're pushing back are they supposed to just take it laying
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:04.880]  down but the way it's brought to trump is he
[3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:07.440]  doesn't see it like that he sees it as they're pushing
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:09.840]  so starting girl you're a smart lady and i might be kind of sending you're one
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:12.320]  of the smartest people out there when it comes to this
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:15.520]  the very eloquent ladies everybody can see and and attractive which it's
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.160]  politically incorrect i'm not supposed to say that but we're not under sharia
[3:35:18.160 --> 3:35:20.720]  law here and you're not either so i'm gonna say it
[3:35:20.720 --> 3:35:25.760]  don't thank you but but but seriously um
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:31.920]  what do you think's going to come out of this what do you think the neocons are
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:35.440]  going to do how do you think iran's going to respond
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:38.720]  um sure well you know i think we both agree
[3:35:38.720 --> 3:35:44.800]  that after 16 years of war in iraq you know most people want us all just to
[3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:49.760]  come home and that now that isis has been defeated
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:56.640]  for the majority um that's what's supposed to what's happened
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:36:01.280]  but the military industrial complex that would make them lose a lot of money
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:05.760]  and so they wanted another excuse to stay so now they targeted the people that
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:09.360]  were fighting isis um this is an act what happened was
[3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:13.280]  an act of war this is if anything's an act of war
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:16.320]  this is it this is the kind of thing that started world war one
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:22.400]  um and now we are at the threat of world war we are a threat of war a big war
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:27.280]  um you know suleimani was one of the people that made the iran
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:31.840]  nuclear deal in the same way that gaddafi you know he actually made a deal
[3:36:31.840 --> 3:36:36.560]  with the us two and europe and made an alliance with them and he got rid of
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:40.640]  his chemical weapons etc but what this thing has shown us is that you
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:44.160]  can't make peace deals with these neocons in the steep state
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:48.080]  you just can't because it'll kill you later searing girl everybody always
[3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:52.800]  makes that point about if people work with the globalist they get
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:57.840]  betrayed and you know what you're right suleimani actually did make a deal
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:00.640]  with obama and the rest of them and he made a deal with
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:04.240]  trump to help finish up getting rid of isis and now this happens to him
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:08.800]  uh it it looks like they'll work with you until it advances their position
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:11.840]  but as soon as it starts advancing somebody else's position
[3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:14.880]  then they betray him and that's not a good way to operate do you think trump
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:19.520]  knows that he's done that no i'm sure that he's been fed
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:22.800]  exactly what the american people have been fed
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:26.560]  which is these people are terrorists and they're killing americans which we
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:29.840]  don't know the names of the americans that they supposedly been killing
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:34.160]  um that they killed this contractor in in uh
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:37.600]  actually the contractor was killed in the kurdish areas
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:41.680]  where the the shia militias don't even really operate sure but the argument's
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:44.800]  going to be that that the moolahs are unpopular
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:48.320]  and that uh you know this guy had a lot of blood on his hands and was torturing
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:51.120]  a lot of people and that we should get out of the iranians way and let them
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:53.920]  have regime change i think that's really what this comes down to
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:57.520]  and so if i seem schizophrenic on this topic i'm not on most it's because i go
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:37:59.760]  back and forth because i can see both sides of it
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:03.360]  we're not a cult we're having real debates here uh in real discussions
[3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:06.480]  Syria girls are guests Carlos you're a real trooper for holding i really
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:10.560]  appreciate you he's a longtime caller always a very smart fellow geopolitically
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:15.040]  a doctor i guess or scientists or something i forget uh but uh uh

[3:38:19.280 --> 3:38:22.800]  Syria girl you're one of my heroes believe it or not you've done

[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:30.800]  as i make them because your input is is really even more valuable
[3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:34.960]  than most people realize first of all
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:40.400]  iran is a an old civilization of people they've been around the bend this is a
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:44.960]  society that is very very wise and i believe with all my heart
[3:38:44.960 --> 3:38:49.120]  that they will take this in stride they will keep their gunpowder dry
[3:38:49.120 --> 3:38:52.400]  they will think about it and they will rely on their
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:57.440]  allies um russia and china in a situation like north korea
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:01.280]  where i believe peace will prevail i don't think president trump
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:06.080]  wants a war his actions however have to be looked in international law
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:09.840]  and whether they were in fact warranted under the circumstances
[3:39:09.840 --> 3:39:15.200]  i know that um iran and dr pashin it was absolutely right
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:19.680]  you have to be understood in history if you don't look at history
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:23.040]  you're going to make serious mistakes i hope this
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:28.400]  action by president trump is not revealed to be a very serious mistake
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:31.840]  rather that if you look at the history of iran
[3:39:31.840 --> 3:39:36.160]  um it was at one point a strategic
[3:39:36.160 --> 3:39:39.120]  move by kissinger to have a pincer with israel
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:43.520]  and iran cooperating with the shaw the shaw was not doing
[3:39:43.520 --> 3:39:46.800]  uh the the the things he was supposed to do he
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:50.320]  was resented by the iranians he created the savak
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:54.480]  terrible organization terrible cruel i remember that his
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:59.440]  agreeing reform was lousy and he was removed by the people let me ask you
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:01.440]  this carlson we've got to get to everybody else and i appreciate you how
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:04.880]  to gut level how do you think this is going to end
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:08.720]  my feeling that it's going to end by russia and china
[3:40:08.720 --> 3:40:12.000]  uh keeping iran from going any further with this
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:17.280]  and i hope that um president trump uh really sits down with mr pumpail and
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:21.920]  fixes his clock his clock is dirty he was an admitted liar in cia
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:26.160]  and i believe he's still continuing his shenanigans uh to this day
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:31.840]  all right i appreciate your call um let's go ahead and talk to some more
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:34.960]  callers peter in the midwest thanks for holding your a trooper
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:41.280]  welcome go ahead hey jones uh jamha uh sorry syrian girl
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:44.800]  you're beautiful gotta say that because uh i've been following you for a while
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:48.640]  because i also fought um kind of in syria uh
[3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:52.560]  alex i got to be quick on this i was also an operator in china
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:56.560]  they got i walked in kind of on some plans regarding a pipeline the pipeline
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:41:00.160]  is now fully functional there's a friendship pipeline between syria
[3:41:00.160 --> 3:41:04.400]  and iran and iraq there's a new one that just got started last year
[3:41:04.400 --> 3:41:08.800]  from iran to china and russia there is going to be peace in that region there's
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:11.920]  going to be plenty of money but the thing is if you think about it
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:15.680]  guess what just happened last week where a lot of maneuvers between china
[3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:19.600]  iran and russia for the naval military and exercise were being carried out in
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:23.680]  the region america was invited but they didn't want to do it
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:27.600]  now they said that there was a a deal that trump and prudent just carried out
[3:41:27.600 --> 3:41:30.800]  well if you think about it if you want a good energy deal
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:34.560]  and you got somebody like suumane who's got a lot of iranian shia
[3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:40.240]  militiamen that are coming back off the iranian iraqi syrian border
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:43.600]  and these people don't have anything else where to go because russians are not
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:48.320]  going to let them go further um saa is taking out fsa very quickly
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:50.720]  but i really wanted to let you know that there was another thing that i was
[3:41:50.720 --> 3:41:54.080]  more concerned about that i got wind of from some of my military contacts in
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:57.040]  africa that some of the fsa al-qaeda back
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:00.640]  operatives about 700 got flown out of idlib and it got
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:04.320]  placed down into africa and there's wind about them trying to collect
[3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:08.080]  ibola and trying to use it okay well that's amazing
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:11.920]  listen i'm and i college it's just i held for three hours four hours no no

[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:35.920]  still trying to contain it because they don't want to get them out of the
[3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:39.200]  congolese region still some congolese make their way through
[3:42:39.200 --> 3:42:41.840]  and get themselves down to mexico and then from there that's why we've been
[3:42:41.840 --> 3:42:44.480]  seeing the outbreaks that we have and you've been talking about the ibola

[3:43:05.680 --> 3:43:09.840]  hours a day at ups and make a long story short i used to have a problem with

[3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:18.640]  i'll tell you the ultimate sin in my view is these groups that set up things to
[3:47:18.640 --> 3:47:22.400]  play all the different sides they call that being mac of alley being geniuses i
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:26.400]  call it mental illness the knowledge of evil
[3:47:26.400 --> 3:47:30.160]  but definitely Ebola can last in men's
[3:47:30.160 --> 3:47:34.800]  testicles for months and months can be spread it's a perfect sleeper cell type
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:39.520]  uh human bomb weapon and i know they bring in conga leaves with a thousand
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:42.960]  every month right through past the board patrol the democrats do and then
[3:47:42.960 --> 3:47:45.040]  disperse them people are dying of kidney failure
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:48.560]  there's reportedly are abola cases in the caribbean that's mainstream news
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:52.080]  and in the us is being covered up people go why doesn't trump stop it he
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:47:54.960]  can't control what's happening in the office next to him because of the treason
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:58.800]  so just recap peter and and and tell us what you were told
[3:47:58.800 --> 3:48:03.840]  buy your sources and what's happening uh out of central africa
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:08.400]  all right basically fsa the free syrian arab army most are really getting
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:12.720]  crushed by saa and their al-qaeda back operatives these are pro human smugglers
[3:48:12.720 --> 3:48:16.000]  and stuff they all got moved out of uh Syria they got flown on a plane they
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:19.360]  got put into central africa and this has been going on for a few years now
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:23.280]  ever since the second endemic outbreak of conga the congo version of a virus
[3:48:23.280 --> 3:48:26.000]  where actually it's like a it's the second version where it actually
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:30.080]  lasts a lot longer it's got a 50-50 death ratio they've been actively
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:33.520]  attacking all of the conga leaves abola centers down there
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:36.320]  trying to get a sample of the virus trying to get the vaccine trying to
[3:48:36.320 --> 3:48:40.000]  figure it out trying to get people that have been vaccinated with it that were
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:43.280]  tested on the virus that are still technically communicable
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:47.040]  and getting them out of congo getting them first uh they try to get them into
[3:48:47.040 --> 3:48:50.560]  nigeria and and they try to get them over to the other borderlands and they've
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:53.200]  been still trying to smuggle these people now the congo these people are
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:57.680]  getting into mexico they're coming here they've been by the way we've shown
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:01.440]  hundreds ourselves and then literally left us come over and attack us uh here
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:04.960]  in austin it's crazy yeah there's your sleeper cell
[3:49:04.960 --> 3:49:08.160]  alex it's really nasty stuff and it's disgusting because the
[3:49:08.160 --> 3:49:11.760]  destabilization in our own country regarding all of you know the human
[3:49:11.760 --> 3:49:15.120]  waste and everything on the west coast and that stuff it's just a breeding
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:19.920]  ground for you already know about that um secondly the iran china russia
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:23.280]  connection if they've just got their pipeline working they've got
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:27.040]  working through the stands through kazakhstan astana is growing as a
[3:49:27.040 --> 3:49:30.960]  massive capital right now pakistan is going to start growing up with carachi
[3:49:30.960 --> 3:49:34.080]  and then of course even mongolia all of these regions are going to get a bunch
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:38.400]  of natural gas because iran found a whole bunch more of natural gas reserves
[3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:41.680]  now the reason why they're acting like this is because they felt kind of bulky
[3:49:41.680 --> 3:49:44.320]  for the fact that they had both russia and china in the region
[3:49:44.320 --> 3:49:47.840]  to kind of protect them from acting stupid with sulamani he kind of knew a
[3:49:47.840 --> 3:49:50.960]  lot of about the energy crisis because he also knew where the money was coming
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:54.880]  for ices getting funded from turkey now this is the biggest thing alex
[3:49:54.880 --> 3:49:58.320]  if you cut off his head they're going to have a power vacuum and someone else
[3:49:58.320 --> 3:50:01.040]  is going to have to make sure that the deals get done for all of the energy
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:04.880]  resources in that region and if iran can't play around with the sues
[3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:08.080]  can out choking off other countries for oil and stuff even though they're
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:11.680]  getting their money from russia and china
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:14.560]  that's why they're so what do you think is going to happen in the end game
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:17.680]  loblos are trying to bring down the u.s trump's trying to stabilize it
[3:50:17.680 --> 3:50:22.240]  i think he means well but this is a gamble gut level he's only a smart guy
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:27.680]  how do you think this is going to end um we're going to look at a boiling point
[3:50:27.680 --> 3:50:30.400]  but it's not going to pop off until something more
[3:50:30.400 --> 3:50:34.960]  internal crisis here in america happens and that's the bigger concern that i'm
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:37.280]  worried about the bigger concern is when we start
[3:50:37.280 --> 3:50:39.520]  having biological problems with the with this
[3:50:39.520 --> 3:50:44.240]  this virus outbreak here in america or and you know the virginia situation with
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:48.400]  gun confiscation coming up and i hate saying this but china and
[3:50:48.400 --> 3:50:52.160]  russia they're just biting their time and gold is getting really valuable it's
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:54.880]  all bought out in germany i i understand that's right they're
[3:50:54.880 --> 3:50:59.120]  trying to plunge the economy and and we want to warn people but then if we
[3:50:59.120 --> 3:51:03.200]  did we if we if economy goes down then it only helps the globalists it's a
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:06.800]  one hell of a time 2020 so critical thank you so much sir amazing call
[3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:09.200]  by the way we're gonna get to all these calls because i always try to come up on
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:11.840]  the same phone board he's gonna go right to him and we don't get to you right
[3:51:11.840 --> 3:51:13.760]  now but i'm gonna get to more here in a second
[3:51:13.760 --> 3:51:16.400]  syrian girl what do you want to say about what he just broke down because i
[3:51:16.400 --> 3:51:20.560]  know that isis and al-qaeda have said that they are trying to bring aboli in
[3:51:20.560 --> 3:51:22.960]  and and weaponize and i know the democrats and soros
[3:51:22.960 --> 3:51:26.480]  are personally bringing in thousands a week to texas alone the board patrol
[3:51:26.480 --> 3:51:29.680]  can't even stop them federal judges let them go they go i don't want you to
[3:51:29.680 --> 3:51:33.120]  ask it boom uh you leave lilias can shoot women in the back in california
[3:51:33.120 --> 3:51:36.960]  juries let them go they go she white kill them i mean the left is in a war
[3:51:36.960 --> 3:51:41.520]  against america right now it's insane uh and and and so that's what we just hope
[3:51:41.520 --> 3:51:46.000]  trump can you know not be manipulated what do you think
[3:51:46.000 --> 3:51:49.760]  i'd like to you know make a comment about all of the callers if that's okay
[3:51:49.760 --> 3:51:56.880]  um if we have time the last one uh about africa uh there is a story that i
[3:51:56.880 --> 3:52:01.360]  heard that the free Syrian army or al-qaeda linked
[3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:05.760]  militias were being transported to north africa
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:10.240]  libya because turkey which funds these free syrian army
[3:52:10.240 --> 3:52:14.400]  militias is actually the clared war and is going into libya now
[3:52:14.400 --> 3:52:18.160]  so that's what i've heard that they've taken some of those guys and they've
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:21.200]  switched them into theirs i mean turkey turkey did just vote
[3:52:21.200 --> 3:52:26.880]  the turkey did just vote to uh basically invade uh libya
[3:52:26.880 --> 3:52:30.880]  yes but i haven't heard about the congo thing because i think it would be
[3:52:30.880 --> 3:52:34.240]  i think it would be difficult to carry that out
[3:52:34.240 --> 3:52:38.480]  because syrians look like me or they me with a darker tan
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:41.680]  so there was like a thousand syrians in the congo
[3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:45.040]  would stand out so i don't see how that would happen unless they were
[3:52:45.040 --> 3:52:49.040]  dressed up as aid workers i know i haven't heard about that so i can't comment
[3:52:49.040 --> 3:52:51.920]  on it well you know there's al-shamab and all that but you're right those are
[3:52:51.920 --> 3:52:55.680]  those are mainly africans all right thank you that's a great
[3:52:55.680 --> 3:52:59.280]  angle on that who's been holding the longest now
[3:52:59.280 --> 3:53:02.000]  josh in west virginia you're a trooper thank you so much sir
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:06.640]  going to talk to you in the year 2020 yeah it's great to talk to you i'm a little
[3:53:06.640 --> 3:53:10.720]  sick so don't mind my voice breaking up
[3:53:10.960 --> 3:53:15.760]  i was just going to talk about stuff that happened in iran
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:20.080]  i was thinking that maybe china iran
[3:53:20.080 --> 3:53:26.400]  each state was all intertwined and trying to throw trump off and make him
[3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:29.840]  look weak right before going into this first phase of the trade deal
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:34.160]  yes and maybe there's some more facets to it but
[3:53:34.160 --> 3:53:37.680]  i'll let you get to the other colors no no no that's a great point
[3:53:37.680 --> 3:53:40.720]  from your perspective and and this makes trump look stronger
[3:53:40.720 --> 3:53:43.760]  the democrats in deep state are very upset right now
[3:53:43.760 --> 3:53:46.960]  i think they were planning to manipulate this and get this a lot bigger but but
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:51.200]  i also see syrian girls perspective yeah i do too
[3:53:51.200 --> 3:53:55.120]  i see i see about 10 different ways it could have
[3:53:55.120 --> 3:53:59.280]  went down i think it maybe trump
[3:53:59.280 --> 3:54:05.920]  spoke to or had somebody speak to this guy that they smited the iranian terror
[3:54:05.920 --> 3:54:09.440]  general and they kind of dealt him a card to see
[3:54:09.440 --> 3:54:13.920]  which way he'd play it i don't think he played it the right way
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:16.720]  oh you know absolutely you know that happened
[3:54:16.720 --> 3:54:21.040]  absolutely well that my my my gut level and i talked to some folks that that
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:24.080]  are hooked in pretty good and they said that's what they've heard
[3:54:24.080 --> 3:54:28.000]  this is really a message to obama and the deep state and everybody i mean
[3:54:28.000 --> 3:54:32.240]  that trumps gonna start killing people uh because this guy was double dealing
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:35.920]  with neo cons and everybody as well and i don't think anybody expected him to
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:39.120]  just ignore the advisors and just kill this guy
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:42.640]  because you know boltons like i want war i want to bomb tehran war war war
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:47.360]  prime goes here we'll just kill the head of iran that because the guy runs iran
[3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:50.640]  right so it's a big deal thank you sir great points
[3:54:50.640 --> 3:54:53.360]  syrian girl deal that's the other perspective here is that trump wants
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:55:00.000]  folks to know he means business well yeah this is the big escalation and that
[3:55:00.000 --> 3:55:03.520]  would certainly show the world that he means business but the same time it
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:07.840]  also what wasn't the business he's in it's the business of war
[3:55:07.840 --> 3:55:10.560]  unfortunately it's the business of keeping soldiers
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:15.280]  in the middle east perpetually to get rafion and all of these weapons
[3:55:15.280 --> 3:55:19.600]  contractors money and to make these deals i mean you know this is all
[3:55:19.600 --> 3:55:24.160]  unnecessary also what we're being told here is the same
[3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:27.760]  lies of we've been told in the past that you know we're going to be greeted as
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:32.320]  liberators that iraqis or pompeo said iraqis are celebrating this
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:37.760]  assassination and iranians too the fact is that iraqis uh you know they were
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:42.160]  holding up his posters on the street in the video that pompeo posted they
[3:55:42.160 --> 3:55:47.440]  were holding up pictures of the sea i i told us that were assassinated and as
[3:55:47.440 --> 3:55:50.960]  well as that you know they've been chanting anti-u.s chants now
[3:55:50.960 --> 3:55:55.360]  um you know around karbala which was a you know a shia city
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:56:00.800]  so this is not a uh some this is this is a something this is an escalation you
[3:56:00.800 --> 3:56:05.040]  know this is this is aggression absolutely right but but but
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:08.560]  solemany was hated in a lot of the Arab world and seen as a bogeyman
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:12.240]  they'll normally agree with Atlantic monthly by a Saudi Arabia of course you
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:15.040]  know the Saudis the Saudis definitely hated him
[3:56:15.040 --> 3:56:18.960]  um he destroyed their ISIS in their al-qaeda as well
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:22.240]  so yeah girl i don't know hey listen i don't know why you hadn't been on the
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:25.200]  show in a while and whoever told you i don't like having on the show is is
