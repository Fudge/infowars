[00:00.000 --> 00:18.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:18.080 --> 00:24.640]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex
[00:24.640 --> 00:33.720]  Jones and we are now entering the 25th hour of global transmission I'm your
[00:33.720 --> 00:37.680]  host Alex Jones let me just say that the entire info wars crew our guest
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.720]  host our guest our crew on the ground in the Philadelphia covering the DNC have
[00:42.720 --> 00:52.840]  done a spectacular exemplary excelsior amazing in-depth job especially the
[00:52.840 --> 00:56.920]  techs and producers with all the documentation the research running the
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.440]  cameras running the microphones lining up all the gas doing everything amazing
[01:01.440 --> 01:10.960]  job to the entire crew absolutely amazing we do about I don't know five
[01:10.960 --> 01:14.560]  hours of broadcast day out of the studios and then that takes a lot of
[01:14.560 --> 01:19.520]  preparation and focus and we also produce a lot of short news pieces and
[01:19.520 --> 01:25.200]  many documentaries every day so I'd say probably seven eight hours of live and
[01:25.200 --> 01:30.960]  also produce content for an operation of really about 20 people working in
[01:30.960 --> 01:35.280]  production 25 people so I want to just say congratulations to the crew and also
[01:35.280 --> 01:38.720]  the listeners especially who been supporting the broadcast spreading the
[01:38.720 --> 01:45.160]  word about it our affiliates around the country we are having the biggest sale
[01:45.160 --> 01:48.800]  ever in our history and I've been saying that every few months now because
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.240]  we're just increasing the size of the sales because the formula I have is to
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.120]  try to have the very best prices on high quality products be able to self fund
[01:56.120 --> 02:00.600]  ourselves and then be able to have a smaller profit per item but people know
[02:00.600 --> 02:03.920]  how to shop out there not just support us and they find it really is a good deal
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.640]  and then they end up you know not buying one but buying two buying three and that
[02:07.640 --> 02:10.920]  it brings in more revenue so that we can get more aggressive and our more
[02:10.920 --> 02:13.960]  reporters and more writers and more researchers and but Hillary for prison
[02:13.960 --> 02:19.080]  banners in the sky across the country and trucks driving around and billboards
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.800]  and just everything else we're doing and Darren McBrain has a great idea about
[02:23.800 --> 02:27.960]  trying to do a series you know like they have all these different cable channels
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.840]  because now the internet's so dominant we would dominate that and I want to get
[02:31.840 --> 02:34.240]  back into longer form documentary films it's just that we've been trying to
[02:34.240 --> 02:41.880]  establish the news operation wow if you go to drudgereport.com there is again
[02:41.880 --> 02:46.520]  Hillary where she does this great white shark attack deal you know great whites
[02:46.520 --> 02:52.500]  crest out of the water and they have like their jaws snapping and I'm not
[02:52.500 --> 02:57.560]  trying to be mean there's something very psychotic and very predatory about
[02:57.560 --> 03:03.440]  Hillary Obama can come off charming and you know seem like a suave guy even
[03:03.440 --> 03:06.840]  though you know he's creepy because you know he stands for but with Hillary man
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.840]  she is just not just her actions but her and Bill are like something out of
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.680]  the the monsters but but the monsters are likable that they just look like
[03:17.680 --> 03:24.840]  creepozoids I was uh hiking on the green belt this morning and I and I came
[03:24.840 --> 03:32.040]  across an old woman I got probably her son and and his girlfriend or something
[03:32.040 --> 03:35.920]  I saw him a hundred yards away coming on the path and I got creepy feeling and as
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.440]  I got up close to him they had super white skin they were all dressed real
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.520]  weird and I was just like oh devil worshipers just absolutely you know you
[03:44.520 --> 03:51.480]  click wow these are creepy people and Pat Raleigh was with me and he was just
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.400]  who would you feel that when people went by I was like yeah wow evil let's say I
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.840]  been around Janet Reno in front of her once when she spoke at UT from just right
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.560]  in the front aisle at the microphone and she did this demonic smile and started
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.200]  like snapping her teeth and reportedly Hillary is obsessed with her and loves
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.680]  her I mean these are demonic creatures I mean just go to drugsreport.com I've
[04:16.680 --> 04:20.440]  got all this news proving they're evil but just look at this thing where she
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.680]  does this shark can you guys show the cover of jaws when we come back because
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.280]  I just thought of this you know where the sharks popping out of the water and it
[04:28.280 --> 04:32.680]  has that look it's not like there's a screamshotting it she does this joker
[04:32.680 --> 04:43.560]  meets the great white shark and by the way we've got Obama saying there's no
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.920]  way you know Trump's gonna win bet on Hillary well because even Google by the
[04:49.920 --> 04:57.320]  way has been caught and they won't even change it not even listing Donald Trump
[04:57.320 --> 05:02.720]  on the internet under presidential candidate a new study suggests that tattoo
[05:02.720 --> 05:08.320]  ink may be toxic reports Fox News getting inked may lead to long-term skin
[05:08.320 --> 05:12.440]  problems and an increased risk of cancer according to a new report by the
[05:12.440 --> 05:17.320]  European Chemicals Agency researchers found red ink was the most dangerous but
[05:17.320 --> 05:22.480]  they warned blue green and black ink is also risky the most severe concerns are
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.440]  allergies caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic mutagenic or
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.720]  reproductive toxic effects the report stated it's also being reported that
[05:31.720 --> 05:37.120]  governments in the EU do not regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food at
[05:37.120 --> 05:41.560]  many shops operate without government regulations in the United States the
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.880]  Food and Drug Administration regulates chemicals and products including tattoo
[05:45.880 --> 05:51.120]  ink cosmetics and color additives but due to other public health priorities the
[05:51.120 --> 05:55.680]  FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo inks and pigments you can find

[08:13.320 --> 08:20.000]  wars.com new center deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas broadcasting
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  worldwide you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the
[08:25.000 --> 08:42.400]  technotronic technocracy takeover. You're listening to Alex Jones it is
[08:42.400 --> 08:49.960]  Thursday the 28th day of July 2016 this is teleprompter free television
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.560]  slash radio broadcasting and transmitting worldwide from deep in the
[08:55.560 --> 09:08.640]  heart of Texas Austin and that's ministry with their lead singer bringing us in
[09:09.360 --> 09:15.880]  didn't know that maniacs a listener they say there'll be two things left alive
[09:15.880 --> 09:21.040]  after a nuclear war cockroaches and Al Jorgensen
[09:22.760 --> 09:28.440]  reportedly done more drugs than anyone ever I've told that by people that know
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.800]  for 30 years like he's like the king in Hollywood or in rock and roll of that
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.680]  shows how resilient human beings can be I don't know why I'm digressing off into
[09:38.680 --> 09:45.080]  that little factoid that's almost meaningless. Drugs just changed his main
[09:45.080 --> 09:49.240]  headline but I still want to blow this up because I want to create a meme
[09:49.240 --> 09:56.160]  showing Hillary Clinton cresting next to the jaws shark and going after what's
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.120]  left of the Bill of Rights and Constitution because if you look at that
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.160]  face that's the one she makes when she does this hyena laugh by the way that
[10:05.160 --> 10:11.920]  was on TBS and so they removed it and apologized a few days ago on Monday so
[10:11.920 --> 10:17.320]  that's why I do want to play that again here in just a moment because if you
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.960]  listened to her I was listening in a restaurant and it was so annoying and I
[10:22.960 --> 10:27.680]  wasn't even allowed that people asked me to please turn it off then I was
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.680]  listening to it over at my parents briefly with my son last night and my
[10:32.680 --> 10:36.880]  mother is using an irritable person and she said what on earth turn what is that
[10:36.880 --> 10:43.720]  turn it off so I guess they used to speak of industrial music skinny puppy to
[10:43.720 --> 10:50.400]  torture folks at Guantanamo Bay I think we can replace the skinny puppy for
[10:50.400 --> 10:56.680]  torture with the hyena do we have the hyena queued up let's let's go ahead
[10:56.680 --> 11:02.240]  now this is Hillary in between hyenas and it's almost the same sound and it's
[11:02.240 --> 11:10.560]  totally fake it's a bark here it is and then we will after we play that we will
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.080]  continue with the news by the way a lot of the crews but in there like off and
[11:15.080 --> 11:43.600]  on 18 hours now we're gonna pull this article up in a moment and talk about
[11:43.600 --> 11:47.720]  what Google's up to this is emblematic of everything we know that they've been
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.960]  spiking searches for Hillary for prison we know they've been spiking searches
[11:52.960 --> 12:02.160]  and redirecting the searches into favorable things about Hillary if you
[12:02.160 --> 12:09.200]  if you search Hillary crime you get her crime bill of in the 1990s 1994 but
[12:09.200 --> 12:16.400]  they've gone to a level beyond even the BBC and their spiegel real changing the
[12:16.400 --> 12:22.040]  name of an Islamic attacker from Ali to David or even they pledge allegiance to
[12:22.040 --> 12:26.920]  ISIS is Cremala Akbar they just say it's not Islamic because there's nothing
[12:26.920 --> 12:40.360]  less Islamic than ISIS and of course there's nothing drier than water but
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.800]  now Google will not even let you as of still this morning this is going on for
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.360]  a day it was identified days ago but but it's been in the news for a day and I
[12:50.360 --> 12:54.720]  checked it this morning it was still that way you search presidential candidate
[12:54.720 --> 13:01.120]  stories up on info wars.com with screenshots and he's not even listed
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.400]  it's Hillary the Green Party and candidate and then the libertarian
[13:06.400 --> 13:12.680]  candidate spoiler Gary Johnson stories up on info wars.com Trump not listed in
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.640]  Google search for presidential candidates when you scroll down wait for it
[13:17.640 --> 13:28.720]  there it is not listed now you go to being boom he's front and center and it's
[13:28.720 --> 13:35.520]  got all the other past candidates but there it is I'm not saying being is
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.120]  perfect by any stretch the imagination but you'd expect Donald Trump to be
[13:39.120 --> 13:46.760]  front and center presidential candidate you try to search crooked Hillary can't
[13:46.760 --> 13:50.520]  get it you see these should all be top searches because they are the top searches
[13:50.520 --> 13:55.440]  on Google often on the last few months Hillary for prison or will Hillary go to
[13:55.440 --> 14:02.680]  prison has been the number one search but you can't find links without going
[14:02.680 --> 14:10.080]  five six pages deep to the most popular relevant searches now folks if Google do
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.480]  that they'll do anything and this is emblematic of they stole the primaries
[14:15.480 --> 14:22.760]  and the nomination for Bernie Sanders voters stole it and told you in the news
[14:22.760 --> 14:27.000]  yes we met days before to decide who the winner was in places like California at
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.160]  a quote rich donors house but they still went ahead with the ceremonial election
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.320]  and then ignored it and then just change the numbers what they wanted
[14:37.320 --> 14:42.320]  Clinton email reveals that Hillary worked with Google CEOs to keep hashtag
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.040]  Benghazi video blocked that's in the WikiLeaks emails but so you're not
[14:46.040 --> 14:53.680]  hearing about the 20,000 new WikiLeaks DNC emails and phone calls you're just
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.200]  hearing oh Putin did it he's so bad or oh my gosh it said they might want to work
[14:59.200 --> 15:05.960]  against Bernie oh Hillary was never against Bernie she stole it from him so
[15:05.960 --> 15:10.600]  now we have the in fact we probably should play today let's grab some of the
[15:10.600 --> 15:15.520]  some of the voicemails and play these here on air
[15:17.480 --> 15:20.800]  we're not gonna talk about who got the emails cuz we really don't know I think
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.360]  it's probably the Russians thank God somebody's fighting back against this
[15:24.360 --> 15:30.560]  criminal group that's hijacked our nation out of self-preservation are you
[15:30.560 --> 15:34.520]  fighting back I mean they're trying to get street riots killing police going
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.440]  we have a foreign globalist group overthrowing the nation like in the red
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.800]  revolution in 1917 1918 I mean that's what this is but it's a globalist
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.680]  operation but using communist tactics I mean I cannot stress to anyone the
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.560]  grave danger we're in when they're stealing nominations and Google won't
[15:53.560 --> 15:57.760]  let you search crooked Hillary and redirects you and then we've got
[15:57.760 --> 16:05.600]  Hillary emails and DNC emails with Google who they meet with for five hours a
[16:05.600 --> 16:11.600]  week at least at the White House some weeks they meet with Google up to four
[16:11.600 --> 16:20.680]  times and I mean Google heads they are in their wargaming and and and deciding
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.840]  what you can see and where you can go like we're living in Chilchescu's
[16:25.840 --> 16:31.520]  Romania or Kim Jong-un's North Korea this is
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.400]  trillions of light years beyond anything that we've even seen go on in
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.360]  North Korea with the high-techness of it and how the it's it's just so over the
[16:41.360 --> 16:49.840]  top so completely brazen they're caught red-handed in thousands of scandals and
[16:49.840 --> 16:57.240]  and rigging everything and then they have a another all-day hate fest misinterpreting
[16:57.240 --> 17:02.160]  and misconstruing and misrepresenting and lying and spinning and obfuscating and
[17:02.160 --> 17:08.160]  and and and dissembling Donald Trump
[17:13.240 --> 17:19.360]  I got to tell you though if America lets Hillary Clinton steal the election we
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.800]  deserve it I mean we have butchered 55 million babies and we have let globalists
[17:24.800 --> 17:29.120]  do all these evil things in our name and so guess what what comes around goes
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.040]  around you reap what you sow the chickens are going to come home to roast
[17:33.040 --> 17:40.520]  everybody because our men were too busy playing fantasy football our women were
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.360]  too busy acting like their tarts while their kids are getting hooked on
[17:44.360 --> 17:47.480]  government-shipped in drugs
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.400]  and believe me I'm not on some high horse I'm just here to tell you that we
[17:53.400 --> 18:01.800]  make Sodom and Gomorrah and in corrupt decadent latter Rome look like very tame
[18:01.800 --> 18:09.440]  societies and cultures and I'm not even talking about so much sex or drinking I'm
[18:09.440 --> 18:14.400]  talking about not caring not taking it personal when you're enslaved not taking
[18:14.400 --> 18:17.720]  it personal when you're lied to not taking it personal when you're overrun
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.800]  by tyranny the good news is people are fighting back and taking action and
[18:23.800 --> 18:28.240]  waking up the problem is globalists are organizing governments corporations and
[18:28.240 --> 18:33.480]  media to go after people that are trying to bail water out of the sinking
[18:33.480 --> 18:39.400]  ship because the globalists want to sink civilization in some giant funeral
[18:39.400 --> 18:45.480]  pyre of humanity and then they believe out of that transcendent Phoenix will
[18:45.480 --> 18:55.480]  rise out with this new super being I mean talk about a lie of the devil even if
[18:55.480 --> 19:03.800]  you don't believe in an incarnate entity the color out of space fallen here I

[24:44.080 --> 24:51.800]  more oppressive and normally it gets pretty brazen out in the open now we
[24:51.800 --> 24:57.200]  have all these people engaging in classical psychological warfare raising
[24:57.200 --> 25:03.880]  the bar on Western civilization so high with 50 different genders and all the
[25:03.880 --> 25:11.880]  rest of it to sow total confusion and I was watching video that Joe Biggs and
[25:11.880 --> 25:17.520]  others shot at the DNC live there's hours of it and we weren't just picking
[25:17.520 --> 25:29.320]  out certain people to make the Democrats look like cooks a good third of
[25:29.320 --> 25:35.520]  them are what I would describe as people that came out of the hail bop cult the
[25:35.520 --> 25:42.400]  Jim Jones cults the Charlie Manson cult mental institutions but they weren't
[25:42.400 --> 25:50.440]  born mentally ill they are totally scramble-brained filled with hate and
[25:50.440 --> 25:59.080]  have been given this whole language of gibber what I was on screen you're an
[25:59.080 --> 26:05.080]  effing white male privilege silence non-binary trans people I mean this is
[26:05.080 --> 26:12.120]  just Martian gibberish and it's all these people just hopping around they have no
[26:12.120 --> 26:19.000]  futures there is no culture they've been totally raised on scrambled adult
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.200]  swim weaponized media to make you illogical and mentally ill and they
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.440]  don't know what planet they're on you know I'm sad for age screlics and Carl
[26:29.440 --> 26:34.000]  the cock that we shot footage of and that's what they're known as I have to
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.360]  use those those those terms because it has become one of the most famous memes
[26:38.360 --> 26:41.600]  probably in internet history and we shot the footage we did not come up with the
[26:41.600 --> 26:48.200]  meme though we do supply much of the raw material for the memes and you know you're
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.080]  hopping around screaming at people you're an effing white male when you're an
[26:51.080 --> 26:54.800]  effing white male and you say you can't listen to an effing white male male white
[26:54.800 --> 27:03.360]  privilege spewing total mindless racism and you're so arrogant and so unable to
[27:03.360 --> 27:11.000]  form an argument that people are going to ridicule that but we had one of this
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.760]  supposed associates call up here to the office last night of the man known as
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.560]  age screlics his identity is known I'm gonna say his name
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.080]  saying can we please fix it but but but that it's the fault of the person they
[27:26.080 --> 27:31.320]  debated he created the meme no he didn't you said what you said you said that
[27:31.320 --> 27:37.640]  illogical bizarre contradictory things and you look like arrogant cartoon
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.880]  characters so you've been turned into those there's a new video out that I'm
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.160]  gonna have posted infowars calm that is a animated piece with age screlics and
[27:48.160 --> 27:52.800]  to Carl the cook cook that is the best thing I've ever seen and when it comes
[27:52.800 --> 27:56.320]  to really showing these people are like we can't play it here because there's so
[27:56.320 --> 28:02.200]  much cussing but it's their words it's their words with voice actors that are
[28:02.200 --> 28:09.240]  just simply amazing so I've I've got a headline for this I'm gonna tell you guys
[28:09.240 --> 28:13.160]  are in the break and I want to tweet it out when posted infowars calm it is
[28:13.160 --> 28:19.760]  adult but it's just so intellectual but also so funny at the same time all the
[28:19.760 --> 28:24.720]  contradictory illogical things that these people really say but here's the
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.400]  deal Carl the cook and age screlics are we're just being mean and virtue
[28:30.400 --> 28:39.280]  signaling and wanting to bully and getting off on virtue signaling to black
[28:39.280 --> 28:46.400]  people there's steps down now of what I call the Muppet zombies and I don't say
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.600]  this with pleasure a good third of these people are whacked out of their minds
[28:50.600 --> 28:57.160]  and not even on drugs I've seen mind control victims I've seen the film
[28:57.160 --> 29:02.480]  footage of ours airmen shot down and held for years in North Korea in the
[29:02.480 --> 29:08.200]  Korean War and prisoners of war in Vietnam and I'm telling you folks that's
[29:08.200 --> 29:12.160]  what high schools and colleges and all this have done to people they take young
[29:12.160 --> 29:14.960]  kids and they tell them you've been hurt you've been bullied even when they have
[29:14.960 --> 29:18.520]  it been they teach him to be victims and they teach them their identity is being
[29:18.520 --> 29:24.680]  a whack job then they scramble all the terms this is how you keep people from
[29:24.680 --> 29:29.880]  having families and having kids this is weaponized systems this is not liberal
[29:29.880 --> 29:33.760]  this isn't oh they screwed up they tried they wanted to help we have
[29:33.760 --> 29:36.200]  Department of Education manuals that have been reprinted in the book
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.000]  deliberate dumbing down that I think we still sell them for store.com where
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.280]  they said 30 years ago this would finally be their plan but after the zombie
[29:44.280 --> 29:47.720]  phase I'll tell you what comes next I'll tell you about the after the zombie
[29:47.720 --> 29:54.200]  face there's a new man we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:54.200 --> 29:58.120]  and the GCN radio network
[30:00.120 --> 30:05.080]  a Texas judge on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining charge against two
[30:05.080 --> 30:09.680]  California anti-abortion activists who made undercover videos of themselves
[30:09.680 --> 30:15.080]  trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood reports CBS News a district

[30:18.680 --> 30:22.920]  request of the Harris County Prosecutor's Office defense attorneys said
[30:22.920 --> 30:26.800]  their client should have never been indicted if they had been convicted of
[30:26.800 --> 30:30.800]  the felony charge each could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison
[30:30.800 --> 30:35.240]  prosecutors alleged that the defendants use fake driver's licenses to conceal
[30:35.240 --> 30:39.320]  their identities while dealing with Planned Parenthood the defendants who
[30:39.320 --> 30:43.680]  founded a group called Center for Medical Progress previously rejected plea
[30:43.680 --> 30:48.160]  deals offering them probation a grand jury initially began investigating
[30:48.160 --> 30:52.280]  Planned Parenthood but the group was cleared of misusing fetal tissue you

[34:14.080 --> 34:18.120]  Jack Strickland the question I don't see being addressed is the abundance of
[34:18.120 --> 34:34.160]  references in her emails about AIDS Skrillex. Here's what's happening they
[34:34.160 --> 34:37.960]  want to censor the internet Google and all the rest of them they want to shut
[34:37.960 --> 34:40.720]  down searches on Hillary and her criminal activities they want to just say
[34:40.720 --> 34:44.360]  Donald Trump doesn't exist just a racing from the presidential candidate
[34:44.360 --> 34:52.720]  pages all you're doing is showing people what hardcore despots you are and then
[34:52.720 --> 35:00.080]  your victims are the scramble-brained bullies that are just running around
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.080]  trying to intimidate everyone but the intellectuals are using your own
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.120]  idiocy right back at you and I've got to say Joe Biggs and the rest of crew that
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.520]  are on the ground in Philadelphia I'm gonna get Biggs on today have been
[35:14.520 --> 35:17.760]  getting footage where I'm sitting up at night for like two three hours trying to
[35:17.760 --> 35:23.240]  watch all this I can't turn away because it's so horrifying and I keep hoping
[35:23.240 --> 35:31.240]  maybe there'll be some people that aren't zombies and there's like Baron
[35:31.240 --> 35:36.200]  Harkin and Jabu the Hutt creatures I mean the creepiest people you've ever
[35:36.200 --> 35:43.320]  seen on the outside and then on the inside they're even creepier and you've
[35:43.320 --> 35:48.080]  got to understand this is who the globalists have mobilized to bring down
[35:48.080 --> 35:52.240]  this country and they've done an incredible job I can tell you they will
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.800]  not rest until every one of us is a brain damaged fluoride head they will
[35:56.800 --> 36:01.320]  not rest until it's the law you got to give your kids high fructose corn syrup
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.560]  formula so they got a brain a third the size it should be or a third smaller
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.240]  than it should be to be technical and it's just horrific I mean if this isn't
[36:11.240 --> 36:18.960]  satanic if this isn't some devil then it is the devil because we've created it
[36:18.960 --> 36:27.000]  you understand the devil exists Kim Jong-un devil exists and notice how
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.880]  weak the devil is a little toddling wimp who executes family members with
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.760]  mortars and just runs around with all these sycophantic people worshiping
[36:36.760 --> 36:42.280]  him and his whole population is almost at starvation level and then he is so
[36:42.280 --> 36:46.400]  disconnect from reality he thinks Dennis Rodman's cool just Rodman wasn't cool
[36:46.400 --> 36:58.960]  15 years ago super boring super stupid it's just evil is so twilight zone evil
[36:58.960 --> 37:07.320]  has to import cars to North Korea and Cuba they can't even build cars because
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.720]  the state doesn't want you to it wants to rub out innovation and humanity it's a
[37:13.720 --> 37:20.440]  post-industrial Jacobin Luciferian society and I've had so many historians
[37:20.440 --> 37:25.320]  on and I say are the roots in communism the Jacobins of the French Revolution
[37:25.320 --> 37:30.840]  and they go yes but it goes back before that to the legalists of China and to
[37:30.840 --> 37:36.000]  Plato and if you haven't read the legalists and if you haven't read Plato
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.600]  you don't know what you're dealing with just because you don't go out and get
[37:42.600 --> 37:45.880]  me son you've got zits all over your face you can scream you're an effing
[37:45.880 --> 37:52.640]  white male Donald Trump wants war when Donald Trump has been anti-war or you
[37:52.640 --> 37:59.480]  say that he hates gay people when the guy was an advocate for equal rights before
[37:59.480 --> 38:03.440]  it was cool 30 years ago and whether you support that or not the point is
[38:03.440 --> 38:11.240]  everything they say about Donald Trump is twisted or inverted and that's what
[38:11.240 --> 38:19.600]  this comes down to they want you to feel bad about yourself they want you to be
[38:19.600 --> 38:24.360]  poisoned and ugly because they're poisoned and ugly and guess what we're
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.360]  not gonna do that and here's thing about the human mind and psyche if you're not
[38:28.360 --> 38:34.400]  aware of an attack it will defeat you but studies show if you're aware of an
[38:34.400 --> 38:40.280]  attack and resist it it makes you stronger I don't care if it's poison it
[38:40.280 --> 38:45.920]  doesn't matter what it is when you're aware of it and if the dose is see
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.720]  the globalists want to dose us with poison and cultural poison and literal
[38:49.720 --> 38:53.960]  poison and GMO and electromagnetic radiation slowly well they try to
[38:53.960 --> 38:57.120]  mitigate it and figure out ways to shield themselves they're basically doing a
[38:57.120 --> 39:03.480]  mass test but if we're aware of the attacks just mentally and drink purified
[39:03.480 --> 39:08.360]  water and take nutraceuticals and get sun and pray to God every study there's
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.440]  thousands of them you mean even atheists admit that prayer brings you to a higher
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.520]  level of brain activity and the whole body when you when you go into that
[39:16.520 --> 39:22.520]  space and connect with God the higher power that it opens you up and is
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.560]  absolutely associated more than anything with defeating all sorts of
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.960]  diseases you name it that's what so many times a person's wife or husband will
[39:32.960 --> 39:35.440]  die and they're totally healthy in their dead a month later because they give up
[39:35.440 --> 39:38.440]  the will to live
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.080]  well we have to have the will to live and the entire globalist program is
[39:50.080 --> 39:55.320]  about taking our will to live away telling us we're bad telling us we're
[39:55.320 --> 39:59.480]  evil telling us that we're a fallen you know twisted bad group that only they
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.560]  can raise us up no God can raise us up not the New World Order that seeks to
[40:04.560 --> 40:07.800]  bring us even lower
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.600]  two mysterious lights streak across the sky side-by-side seen in California Utah
[40:16.600 --> 40:22.280]  Nevada Chinese rocket test probably they're really fired a
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.400]  missile right off the California coast few years ago and let us know anti-satellite
[40:28.400 --> 40:34.160]  weapon you know they're calling it conspiracy theories when people
[40:34.160 --> 40:38.120]  question your gun and the end and the martial law I have mainstream articles
[40:38.120 --> 40:42.560]  calling a conspiracy theory if you discuss the coup and the counter coup
[40:42.560 --> 40:44.840]  and how they're arresting tens of thousands of people and killing them
[40:44.840 --> 40:49.040]  and torturing them and the media just doesn't want that discussed so they call
[40:49.040 --> 40:56.480]  it a conspiracy theory oh that's right again this is just the total assault on
[40:56.480 --> 41:00.720]  reality and again you can go back to the New York Daily News you go back to the
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.680]  it's admitted that they stole the election from Bernie Sanders they stole
[41:04.680 --> 41:10.160]  California they stole New Hampshire and eight other states Sanders was
[41:10.160 --> 41:13.800]  destroying her and they wouldn't let the delegates that came that actually
[41:13.800 --> 41:20.400]  represented the precincts come and they said the super delegates will decide and
[41:20.400 --> 41:26.040]  now in Turkey Reuters says the public's questioning the government and doesn't
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.000]  like martial law and so you know what they are their conspiracy theorist they're
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.160]  protesting in the street conspiracy theories flourish after Turkey's failed
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.800]  coup see now just demonstrating is a conspiracy theory I'm a one time I was
[41:40.800 --> 41:43.320]  going to the PSA and they wanted naked body scamming and I said look I know you
[41:43.320 --> 41:46.680]  guys save that and I know that it doesn't protect anybody and I know it puts
[41:46.680 --> 41:52.760]  off radiation and they lie and the guy goes oh another conspiracy theorist no
[41:52.760 --> 42:02.280]  what I was saying was facts I'm coming up this is on drudgerport.com it's an
[42:02.280 --> 42:08.240]  info wars.com Paul Joseph Watson's story Bernie delegate DNC is replacing
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.960]  Sanders supporters with paid seat fillers to create fake unity well that's
[42:12.960 --> 42:15.960]  exactly what the Republicans said they were going to do but see Trump didn't go
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.880]  along he said you're stealing it and the media said he's discredited now he'll
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.120]  lose because he made it up but we are gonna take the votes and not count them
[42:24.120 --> 42:30.000]  and but but still he's a sore loser I'm not able but Trump was winning so Trump
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.480]  didn't sit down and didn't shut up and then let them put the the wooden man
[42:35.480 --> 42:42.040]  meets count Chocula you know up there Ted Cruz
[42:44.360 --> 42:49.600]  he fought he spoke out against the fraud he won and mark my words he's gonna win
[42:49.600 --> 42:55.120]  a landslide and mark my words Hillary is probably gonna steal it in front of
[42:55.120 --> 43:01.160]  God and everybody else at high noon they're gonna be projecting her as the
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.280]  winner by two or three o'clock in the afternoon they don't even care about the
[43:04.280 --> 43:12.200]  ratings this is about taking this country down and mounting our head on the wall
[43:12.200 --> 43:20.240]  as a trophy Bernie delegate DNC is replacing and then we've got another clip
[43:20.240 --> 43:25.080]  Bernie supporter confronts seat filler they're throwing the Bernie delegates
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.120]  out because remember they've been booing almost unanimously like 80% of people so
[43:30.120 --> 43:34.200]  they're having to kick them out they're withdrawing their credentials because
[43:34.200 --> 43:39.360]  they're supposed to be there under law under free and fair election laws the
[43:39.360 --> 43:42.280]  ceremonial republicans supposedly manage it but you don't get to just say
[43:42.280 --> 43:45.480]  well then we don't count votes anymore that is the crazy arrogance of these
[43:45.480 --> 43:50.320]  people and you saw it in both parties because it's the same political class
[43:50.320 --> 43:56.400]  that's been pampered that have infested this government and infested our nation
[43:56.400 --> 44:04.120]  and infested the rest of the world that are firing people like General Flynn
[44:04.120 --> 44:08.400]  that are trying to stop World War three with the Russians and who wouldn't back
[44:08.400 --> 44:13.120]  ISIS and al Qaeda so just removed him two years ago and General Flynn is one
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.880]  of the most successful commanders in the military reorganized special forces you
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.400]  name it he came out and he said Hillary Clinton should be arrested for treason
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.400]  that's the kind of stuff they'll blow his airplane up for but he said it so you've
[44:26.400 --> 44:32.640]  got people one inch away from a military counter coup and I've never wanted a
[44:32.640 --> 44:38.000]  military counter to because they usually go wrong and they're bad at some point
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.320]  though there has to be a limit when they're fixing elections openly
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.920]  stealing elections openly having Google not list Donald Trump and have the
[44:47.920 --> 44:52.120]  hijacked federal government trying to start a civil war financed by a
[44:52.120 --> 45:01.080]  bizarro Hungarian Jew Nazi sympathizer how do you make that up who's 85 and
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.680]  looks completely insane and told newspapers he believes he's a messiah
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.360]  we have crazy people like George Soros with $25 billion we know a probably
[45:11.360 --> 45:19.760]  trillions literally trying to overtake Russia look you're no Napoleon you're
[45:19.760 --> 45:23.800]  no Hitler bro they all thought they were a messiah to at least they were
[45:23.800 --> 45:32.720]  military commanders and were war heroes you are a demon you're not even a devil
[45:32.720 --> 45:42.200]  for us and that's why you're in this position to cause World War three just
[45:42.200 --> 45:48.920]  look at that worm on screen look at that sick evil filthy monster that you would
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.440]  expect to come right up out of the bowels of hell that is Schmeegel on
[45:53.440 --> 46:02.600]  steroids that is Gollum that is a tool bag say what you want about that off
[46:02.600 --> 46:05.800]  Hitler but he had the Congressional Medal of Honor that's the iron cross
[46:05.800 --> 46:10.480]  first-class and second-class and was in hundreds of battles and was a message
[46:10.480 --> 46:13.760]  runner through the lines and had the record surviving running through the
[46:13.760 --> 46:20.520]  lines and was gassed twice by German blowback of mustard guests and then had
[46:20.520 --> 46:23.560]  hallucinations that he was gonna save Germany and all the rest of it a very
[46:23.560 --> 46:32.080]  twisted dark wicked guy Napoleon top artillery commander military genius
[46:32.080 --> 46:38.880]  thought he was God thought he was invincible those were military men that
[46:38.880 --> 46:46.640]  knew what they were doing starting wars George Soros is a demon and they've got
[46:46.640 --> 46:52.480]  a bunch of sycophantic yes men and women infesting the CIA infesting all
[46:52.480 --> 46:58.480]  these agencies cement the powers and these weird women on power trips with
[46:58.480 --> 47:02.920]  all their jewelry flapping their arms about how we're gonna blow Russia up
[47:02.920 --> 47:08.040]  and and in top generals on Fox News saying we need more dead Russians and
[47:08.040 --> 47:18.560]  more body bags this is the kind of talk that just absolutely reeks of collapse
[47:18.560 --> 47:24.760]  and failure and thermal nuclear war just just stinks these are stinking demons
[47:24.760 --> 47:31.440]  on narcissistic crazy power trips and oh we're in control oh we're in command oh
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.640]  we have all these weapons oh we have all these satellite-based weapons oh let's
[47:35.640 --> 47:41.000]  use them oh we've got DU Sabo's in orbit oh it doesn't matter if you knock
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.360]  Russia out their response will end up destroying the United States with
[47:45.360 --> 47:51.720]  submarines off the coast jackass sure you got five to one superiority on the
[47:51.720 --> 47:59.760]  Russians it doesn't matter the world ends George Soros must be stopped Hillary
[47:59.760 --> 48:05.240]  Clinton is obviously a complete lunatic if you saw her in the grocery store you
[48:05.240 --> 48:10.200]  go around the aisle to stay away from her if you saw her she's a creep she's a
[48:10.200 --> 48:17.920]  witch she's turned over to evil look at her face on drugs look at it
[48:17.920 --> 48:26.880]  tonight DNC storm warning the heavens open up to drown the corruption and then
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.680]  her can we keep the high unit thing again just running around barking like a
[48:31.680 --> 48:35.480]  hyena and then she does this thing where she opens her mouth like the joker I
[48:35.480 --> 48:40.000]  mean all she needs is green skin folks
[48:41.400 --> 48:47.440]  these people are gonna destroy us I'm telling you the only solace is they're
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.240]  gonna be destroyed in it or down in their bunkers can you imagine being locked
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.920]  up with a bunch of globalists in a bunker they're gonna go completely insane
[48:56.920 --> 49:00.720]  Bible says the law of enrichment will go into the mountains into their armored

[49:38.840 --> 49:43.600]  freaking you can see that actually almost see the devil standing behind

[55:51.320 --> 55:56.560]  this is a big story a Bernie delegates DNC is replacing Sanders supporters with
[55:56.560 --> 56:01.360]  paid seat fillers to create fake unity the articles on info wars.com and the
[56:01.360 --> 56:07.440]  left-hand side of dredgerport.com let's go ahead and play that club it's
[56:07.440 --> 56:14.080]  contemplating leaving but I'm gonna stay because the convention is full now
[56:14.080 --> 56:19.360]  every seat in the house is full so those seat fillers you guys were going
[56:19.360 --> 56:26.440]  about it's real they're in here now there are a lot of people sitting there
[56:26.440 --> 56:35.200]  who I don't know or have seen the entire time I was here. I've been hearing from
[56:35.200 --> 56:38.360]  some of you have been contacting me by text and direct message that the media
[56:38.360 --> 56:44.600]  is talking about how the convention looks more unified today that you know
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.960]  everybody's applauding in unity and chanting in unity and it's it's because
[56:48.960 --> 56:53.000]  the Bernie people aren't here the Bernie people aren't here and the people that
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.880]  are here are getting paid to sit in their seats and clap their hands that's
[56:55.880 --> 56:59.160]  what I believe about a hundred percent sure but that's what I believe that's
[56:59.160 --> 57:01.920]  what I see with my eyes
[57:03.280 --> 57:10.160]  they have the floor closed off right now for anybody who gets out of their seat
[57:10.160 --> 57:14.280]  to go to the bathroom which is how this all started for me what do you do
[57:14.280 --> 57:17.720]  anything if you're hungry if you leave your seat you can't get back in right
[57:17.720 --> 57:22.280]  now and my guess is that's because a seat filler is in your seat. The full

[57:25.920 --> 57:30.860]  is stealth they don't just openly say it it's all just oh what we don't know what

[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:12.000]  some of the demographics but what I'm getting at here is I've been telling you
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.720]  that internal polling scientifically conducted by unnamed parties is showing
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.360]  about a seven and a half that's I told you that a week ago told you again that
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.680]  that's really what the Trump campaign thinks they've got going that's the real
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.840]  numbers they don't want to be too optimistic or folks won't bust their
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.360]  butts to get out and vote it isn't just generally about overall popular vote
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.240]  because the Electoral College as well and there is massive pull out all the

[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:11.680]  talk about genealogy a lot and I found out recently that we're related to a lot
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.080]  of interesting folks it's okay go ahead so so many people for president John
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.520]  Adams son Quincy Adams delicious grant which I'm not really proud of that but

[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.760]  drunk and did some corrupt stuff but he was interesting guy and it is so cool
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.200]  you know and it seems as these things are unfolding before us it's almost like

[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.880]  ancestors that's that's that's our great genetic heritage and that's what they
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.560]  want us to forget but listen it's not just that we have corrupt elites we have
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.800]  elites that are anti-human the species is threatened that's why people are
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:07.080]  activating people can feel it in their bones in their gut mm-hmm and you just

[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.000]  where we're from or all this stuff by the fact that we want liberty and we want
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.160]  freedom and that's why to see them stoke the fires of racism on all sides is so
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.800]  sad because it is a plan to bring us down the species is under fundamental
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.800]  attack thank you Monica more calls straight ahead
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.240]  a new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic reports Fox News getting
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.760]  inked may lead to long-term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.960]  according to a new report by the European Chemicals Agency researchers
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.840]  found red ink was the most dangerous but they warned blue green and black ink is
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.600]  also risky the most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.280]  ink and possible carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects the
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.680]  report stated it's also being reported that governments in the EU do not
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.520]  regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food and many shops operate without
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.040]  government regulations in the United States the Food and Drug Administration
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.240]  regulates chemicals and products including tattoo ink cosmetics and
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.040]  color additives but due to other public health priorities the FDA has not
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.800]  traditionally regulated tattoo inks and pigments you can find more reports on

[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:48.160]  white shark emerging or cresting out of the water and it's across in a great
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:54.840]  white shark and the Joker I mean she really is villainous and I think it's an
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.680]  important meme to have the Constitution up on the top of the water or the Bill
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.280]  of Rights or America and you know here here she's coming or the Second
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.640]  Amendment quite frankly because that's really what's going on here so how do
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.720]  you illustrate her as the shark coming up with the Second Amendment because
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.720]  they're coming out with the guns the delegates have told us we're going to
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:24.120]  get the guns they have told us and then and they're now stealing the election in

[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:37.480]  candidate he's just not listed think of the control and the openness where is the

[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.760]  Freelicks and Carl the Cuck and other famous people I mean these are like
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.360]  zombies that I've seen who've been through brainwashing camps I mean I
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.600]  don't know what's happened to these people what have you experienced Joe
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.800]  Biggs it's pretty amazing I mean there's been a large group of diverse
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.200]  people outside to say the least you know you've got this black lives matter
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.200]  group you've got these anarchists you have these socialists you have just the
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.680]  pissed off Bernie fans who feel like they've been cheated and with the DNC
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.320]  leaks has been proven they have been and they're all kind of like meeting in the
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:07.280]  middle and finding common ground and their massive numbers of the thousands
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.720]  outside when they go out there and last night they were able to rip down the
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.200]  wall the police had to jump in there and start shutting it down people were
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.880]  arrested the other night I witnessed people jumping over the fence trying to
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.400]  get into the DNC to help support the Bernie delegates last night there was a
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.560]  lady who was yelling calling this guy a effing white male and that effing white
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.720]  males always speak over non-binary transgendered people I don't even know
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.720]  what that means I guess that's a new what it means is you're not allowed to
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:41.000]  speak when you speak it's it's evil yeah it's ridiculous this is what you'd
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.160]  get from a whacked out person that was in some you know eastern mysticism cult
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:52.080]  or something I mean these are wackos yeah I mean when I saw her start
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.240]  speaking and she goes camera please cameras please I'm speaking cameras and
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.120]  I'm like who the hell are you talking to and she would sit there and just pitch
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.840]  this temper tantrum and start screaming whenever someone else would talk and all
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.840]  you would hear was someone being streamed like fascists or not see or
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.680]  whatever and they use these little terms all the time weird little bully guys
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:15.160]  that would come over and threaten to physically attack people I mean it's
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.280]  just what wow these are victims man these are mind control victims well
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.720]  there's a case 19 years old his name's Joey he's a local and he's been going
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.720]  around all these protests that's him right there in the white shirt teach him
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.960]  people about globalism they come over and grab him and start like grabbing and
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.000]  pick him up and pushing him and threatening to attack him because he
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.040]  went over and started trying to debate the girl and you know and said you know
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:44.400]  what's going on this is by the way they hog all the cameras too yeah it's
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.600]  definitely been interesting to see this melting pot of retards so to say you
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.920]  know we should be politically incorrect because these are the equivalent of these
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:59.040]  are culturally lobotomized people I mean they're there that they are like
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.280]  someone in who's had you know their brain cut into and I I mean I laugh at it
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.520]  too there's there's a new epic video that went up on info wars.com titled
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.880]  Age Scree like a Carl the Cuck star in new film it is it is adult in nature but
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.880]  it is their characters that were created by the Internet of course we shot the
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.400]  footage and you know I mean you know they say we're f-ing white males or
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.040]  anybody else and then Western civilization is a bad thing so we've
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.920]  basically tried to get into their minds and well I mean we didn't produce this
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.000]  but this film I think is a masterpiece have you seen it yet no I have not yet
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.720]  I'll have to check it out well this is this is a masterpiece of intellectual
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:46.520]  tour de force that I think deserves an Oscar I wouldn't doubt it but wait till
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.240]  you see it I mean it's unbelievable in fact I want to I want to find out who
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.600]  these talented people are other points other observations we're gonna talk to
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.560]  David here I think tonight's gonna heat up again as well you know last night a
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.200]  lot of people came out I think once Hillary Clinton takes the stage on this
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:08.440]  historic night so to say historic in the fact that we found out how deep the
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.000]  corruption goes in the DNC and how they can completely ignore it spin it like
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.320]  it's okay and the American people just go along with it I think that's the
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.160]  historic moment right there not the fact that there's a woman but the fact
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.120]  that these people have the curtain pulled away they can see behind it they
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.080]  can see the corruption and they're still going you know what I'm okay with it
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.520]  I'm right I'm with her I'm with her this is absolute falling to the altar of
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.520]  authoritarianism rigging everything kicking the burning people out bringing
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.160]  in the fake delegates and then putting on a facade show I think you can say more
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.080]  than ever David Knight reporting from the DNC going back to big sir in a
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:50.040]  moment that this really is the time that you could say the total has pulled back
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.160]  the curtain and now America in the world must decide whether we're gonna stay in
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.760]  Tennessee land or save ourselves yeah Alex you're talking earlier about
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.880]  creating a meme with Hilary as a shark or something I think the meme would be
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.760]  something about Hilary jumping the shark and the rest of the DNC jumping the
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.000]  shark Hilary that's what we've seen here this week we've got the story course by
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.560]  Paul Joseph Watson talking about how they're trying to fill these empty seats
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.560]  Alex inside the auditorium we had to to get out of there to get on the air
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.760]  because Katy Perry is rehearsing for tonight she doesn't have her pyramids
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.560]  with her she's got stars and stripes all in the background not illuminati eyes so
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.800]  you know they're cleaning up their act for tonight but they got a lot of
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.760]  entertainment planned they've got a card stunt that they're going to do they've
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.280]  got cards taped to each one of the seats that they're going to show at some
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.840]  point time but the substance is what's the issue Alex last night I want to
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.440]  read you a quote from Barack Obama's speech he said Hilary knows we can insist
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:50.120]  on a lawful and orderly immigration system can you believe that he would have
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.840]  the audacity to put that in there after what he has done when we look at what's
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.760]  happening in Europe with this priest you know that is where we're headed Alex
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.440]  sure he's violating law the law was already there he's completing the
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.480]  smuggling process or letting people in with serious diseases it's all
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.320]  confirmed he's totally all us exactly but he they're upholding the law though
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.760]  David in fantasy land yeah you know we we know that Europe is a couple years
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.400]  ahead of us in terms of the big wave of Muslim migrants from countries that
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.960]  we're at war with and we just had at the end of Ramadan about a week or so ago
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:33.080]  we had John Kerry bragging about the fact that he had brought in six times the
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:38.360]  number of immigrants from Syria where there's the war going on bragging about
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.520]  that to a group of Muslims and when I look at what happened in France you know
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.960]  that was a first that they don't want to talk about on the Democrat Party okay
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.720]  that was a big first we haven't had something like that for several hundred
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:55.120]  years and you're in Europe where Muslims have gone in and committed atrocities
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.600]  like that in a religious based motive but of course the pope says they had
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.840]  nothing to do with the religion you need to understand we all need to
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.480]  understand that it's a Muslim custom that when they take over an area they
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.400]  always desecrate the holy sites of the other religions and then they erect
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:19.400]  their mosques over those former sites. That's right the blue mosque in Istanbul
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.480]  what's Constance and Opal is one of the biggest and oldest Christian churches
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.640]  and of course it's now a mosque and it's it's captured booty it's cute though
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.600]  it's cultural enrichment to have your daughter sold into sex slavery as they
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:40.680]  did more than 20,000 of the Christians little girls they can be loaded on the
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.120]  slave ships and taken to Africa to be gang raped in North Africa but again
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.840]  doesn't matter that the Muslims created the modern slave trade because all of
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.520]  the mainstream media teaches black people to be Muslims because that's how
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.120]  you fight the whitey. Well it's just amazing to me Alex to see the bold
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.440]  face lies are being told by the pope that are being told by Obama in terms of
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.440]  talking about how we're gonna have an orderly system and then today he doubled
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.800]  down on this you know the whole theme this week has been look Donald Trump
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.360]  painted a very dark picture of America everything is just wonderful even as
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.560]  we're having daily terrorist attacks going on in Europe that they don't talk
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.320]  about it all but then he doubles down he says this he thinks he says that the
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.360]  idea that America is somehow in the verge of collapse this vision of violence
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.040]  and chaos everywhere where do we get that from the news that they're not
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.880]  talking about doesn't jive with the experience of most people but it will be
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.000]  our experience Alex we know this is going to be brought to America we know
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.920]  the policies of Hillary the policies of Obama and Kerry are the policies that
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.680]  are going to bring the same types of terrorism with bombs knives trucks to
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:51.240]  America's shores and we know the rest of the equation official martial law in
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:55.640]  France extended basically indefinitely national police to go after people that
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:02.120]  criticize Islam same thing in France the public can have bags in public or
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.760]  whatever now everyone's a prisoner martial law but bring in more of the
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.080]  darling little 80% military aged men who invaded Syria and then blame the
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.880]  Syrians everything is a lie on a lie it's like they're playing a game where
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.040]  the more lies they can pack into one statement the better Joe Biggs what do
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.200]  you make of the permanent civil emergencies they're putting into Europe
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.000]  right now yeah that's pretty crazy you know what's happening all over I mean
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.440]  the fact that they're actually bringing in these terrorists allowing them to come
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.600]  in and then expecting people to assimilate to the jihadi ways assimilate to
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.360]  Sharia law and not expect them to assimilate to their cultures that are
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.160]  they're coming into liberal to have your daughters genitals cut off into but
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.320]  people in cages and then not let your wife even leave the house and then poor
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.160]  acid on her face if you want to it's legal it's super progressive and trendy
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.080]  I mean it's amazing I think we should do that to everyone you know I'm ready to
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:01.160]  get on the acid train and jump in there I mean I mean you know why I mean if
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:06.720]  Islam so enriching I don't know why she didn't have a Chelsea do that you know
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.800]  it is interesting though around here Alex there's a fact that the mainstream
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.480]  media keeps portraying that you know there's all these Hillary supporters
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.840]  that everyone's united you know there's there's hardly any unity inside these
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:22.040]  halls at the DNC at the Wells Fargo arena hardly any sure the majority are
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.760]  Bernie supporters and they're being kicked out I'm told yeah it's like it's
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.440]  like remnants of ghosts there's like ghosts everywhere like spirits floating
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.760]  around that used to be this revolution that it's just now empty and gone and
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.480]  now they're all outside protesting at night time but the mainstream media says
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.760]  oh there's like one or two hundred people outside when actuality there are
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.920]  thousands and thousands of angry people now imagine all those people all across
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.000]  the country if they would have shown up to Philadelphia it would have been a mad
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.160]  house out here there's not just a few thousand people who are angry in this
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.040]  country there are millions and millions and by the way they know it's not
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.800]  Donald Trump is screwing them over they know it's the DNC stealing it from them
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:05.000]  what's coming up next Joe what's coming up next night well tonight it's six
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.840]  o'clock again the Revolutionary Communist Party are added again they're
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.640]  supposed to be doing another flag burning ceremony which I will be sure as
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.160]  hell attending and trying to put a stop to that just because yeah that's
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.800]  ridiculous you know it's funny I'm glad we were talking about this because last
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:25.800]  night they were doing flag burnings right out there caught themselves on fire
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.960]  well here's the interesting thing they started burning flags they burnt an
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.120]  American flag they burnt just a red flag they burnt another stupid flag they
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.920]  burnt Israeli flag and then they brought the rainbow flag over and I said burn
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.760]  that flag and they go well no that's not a flag that's a symbol I went huh I
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.680]  said what do you mean that the rainbow flag they all engage in double think I
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.840]  want to be clear I don't tell you to go grab these flags away in fact I mean
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.040]  quite personally I think it's their first amendment even though they're scum
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.000]  and even though they went over to the country I know the flag's been a symbol
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.440]  of evil for some people but overall it's a symbol of good and we should take it
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.200]  back and I understand as you a veteran and the rest of it it's a symbol saying
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.160]  they want to burn you and so and yet I know you've been actually burned up in
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.120]  vehicles yourself and then so it's not a fun thing at the same time I just think
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.600]  you should show the rhetoric of how they're anti-gun anti-family and I think
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.680]  you should just let people hear these filth I really think you should let
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.320]  people see the type of person that wants to see this country basically burn up
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.760]  into a communist hell oh you should have seen the video last night there was I
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.080]  put up the death cult revealed or whatever these people were holding hands

[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:19.200]  speaking in front of colored people and she started speaking and wouldn't shut
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.320]  up because she wanted to say something and this person of color decided he was
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.360]  gonna grovel to her feet and beg the white lady if she could if he could
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.560]  speak before her and kind of you know you know laughing at her and mocking her
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.360]  and the video is up as well I put that up last night but it the insanity out

[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.800]  into weird sick stuff and they've never had to actually do anything in their
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.200]  life and they are they are mentally ill they are degenerates and and they want
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.400]  to bring us down they don't like the fact that we want to build things they
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.320]  don't like the fact that we're into beauty they don't like the fact we're
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.880]  into success they don't like real liberals and they're coming for us Joe
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.320]  Biggs will talk to you more a fabulous job thank you Joe thank you sir all right
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.760]  I'm gonna take a few your phone calls that we finish up with night night what
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.280]  else is on your agenda what else are you noticing I hope you go out I know you've
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.240]  already done this talk to folks about what they believe in their socialism
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.800]  their communism yeah you're wanting our guns I think that's really key to document
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.400]  now you've also documented how they've you know stolen it from the delegates so
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.920]  great job I mean I've got to tell you in full wars drudge others we are the new
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.080]  media we're not the alternative media we are dominating coverage I'm not
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.040]  bragging I mean we're getting more traffic I know for a fact that the
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.840]  major CNN shows it's incredible I mean normally four five six million YouTube
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.840]  views a day we're getting way more than that just on YouTube you you you count
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.240]  terrestrial radio you count all our other platforms we are reaching just a
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.360]  sickening amount of people this is very very exciting we know Alex you're
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.640]  talking about burning flags and everything I guess that's why they have
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.280]  a few of them on the stage but they really are down with it as we saw them
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.760]  rehearsing in there with Katy Perry as much red white and blue symbolism as
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.040]  they can come up with but I find it kind of interesting that the socialists the
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.600]  communists here are now going full-on McCarthy with these leaks you know they've
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.000]  been embarrassed by these leaks and now they continue to say it's Russia it's
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.280]  Russia red-baiting like it's the 1950s it's absolutely amazing remember it was
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:29.040]  the House un-American activities committee the who act well they just
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.720]  need to change the age from house to Hillary and we're right back to the
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.200]  old McCarthyism that we had before but we're gonna be talking to people we've
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.840]  been looking we saw a couple of people at one point time we're on our way to
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.000]  another event that we're here with every town so we want to get some people
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.200]  engaged on this gun control issue because I'm sure that's gonna be a key
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.520]  part of Hillary Clinton's speech tonight and I want to get some of these
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.560]  people to explain to us why we shouldn't be allowed to protect ourselves when
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.840]  we're in the midst of all of this heavy heavy security you know you have to
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.160]  have a card to come in and I get into this area sure I would ask these
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:08.320]  people why why does Hillary have security or why does a movie star have
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.320]  security well if you're not rich you can't afford the security and why do
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.280]  you have to have ID cards in order to vote for your Democrat candidate isn't
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.400]  that racist we're told that's racist when they want to do that in North
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.760]  Carolina they want to get people's picture ID but you have to have all
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.520]  kinds of ID that's a great point they're even kicking the real voters out the
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:30.080]  real delegates and putting fake ones in so they're talking about Jim Crow great

[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.720]  beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites

[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:12.440]  work sir on this great product the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:22.600]  Alex Jones show they have been expunging not just off TBS but first
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:32.120]  aired it but off the internet of Hillary in a mashup with laughing hyenas next to
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:39.000]  her laugh clearly fair use clearly political speech and this is part and
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.440]  parcel of the fact that WikiLeaks had to point it out two days ago no one even
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:53.640]  cares they're breaking our will that it turns out for months you search
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:34:00.240]  presidential candidate US you don't get Donald Trump on Google's display it only
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:07.920]  shows Hillary and the Green Party and the Libertarian Party this is beyond
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:15.280]  1984 and now TBS has deleted hilarious tweet comparing Hillary to hyenas well
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.280]  we put it back up on Twitter and the Don Salazar just posted and it's going on
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:25.080]  YouTube and here's the deal I told YouTube this at the RNC when they were on
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:34.240]  the YouTube stage the young Turks that work for them they they called us up
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.080]  acted like I took over blew up said Roger Stone was on the stage was all made
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.560]  up we're going to National Suzer here in one minute but it's thematic of this
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.480]  censorship and persecution they pulled our three videos of it within an hour
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.880]  didn't say copyright violation didn't say we took it off just said sorry
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.040]  unavailable and I had to go on the internet and threaten to sue Google
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.960]  which I don't want to do but I'm going to because it's fundamental free speech
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.800]  if they take down the hyenas when I put it up we're gonna play it right now but
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:13.800]  Dinesh the Suzer was put in prison for nine months for doing nothing went out
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.240]  and got five friends to give money to pull campaign didn't fill out a pack for
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.280]  him the Hillary is playing from dictators and his crime was having the
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.120]  number two documentary in world history now he's already got the highest
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.520]  grossing film documentary of 2016 and it's only been out a week and I want to
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:33.680]  thank our listeners I don't have any financial interest in this I have an
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.800]  interest in my kids living in the somewhat of a free country but it's all
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.960]  about censorship and we have to counter it with culture and with art and with
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:36:03.920]  supporting information now let's go ahead and play this clip
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:16.960]  and now there's this photo of her last night with Obama like a great white
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:24.520]  shark cresting I mean her actions are so evil but I just don't know what to
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.040]  say and where I'm gonna go to your calls up to Nash goes I appreciate people
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.400]  holding we've got Tucker Carlson joining us to Dinesh it was great meeting you in

[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:58.840]  of this authoritarian system they're setting up so it's it's got to feel
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:04.040]  good that despite everything they've done to you that you're back on top Alex
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.360]  thank you very much I know I'm absolutely thrilled the left unleashed a whole
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:15.560]  battery of critics who tried to bash the film into submission through rotten
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.720]  rotten tomatoes and through basically misrepresenting what the film is about
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.680]  the great thing is we've had people see it they love it they go nuts they tell
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:28.760]  other people you've been telling people about it and so word of mouth is
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.800]  spreading the fate of a movie depends a lot on how it does in the opening couple
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.880]  of weeks and so it's just fantastic to see people flood the theaters we're
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.840]  looking to have a really big weekend this second weekend we're crushing Michael
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:46.920]  Moore he made a film last year and in five days we have outperformed his film
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:52.160]  and our film is already in the top 10 political documentaries of all time in
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:59.960]  one week well of all time well incredible it's a top 10 we're gonna my
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  Obama film is number two and my film America's number six tomato says your
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:11.400]  film is five percent of course there's a whole genre of films that are so bad
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.400]  everyone wants to go see him so in a way I think you may have the lowest rating
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.240]  ever on rotten tomatoes at least they didn't just de-list you at at at least
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.080]  that they didn't just de-list you like Google did well go to the right of the
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.880]  screen and you'll see that our audience reaction is over 80% and so you've got
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:32.080]  probably the biggest spread between what the critics say by the way a lot of
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.360]  these critics haven't even seen the movie they can't find one thing that's
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.880]  wrong with it so what they do is they go into this kind of thrashing around
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:45.800]  invective the film is adjut prop it's paranoid it's delusional etc but the
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.120]  bottom line of it is they can't keep people away from seeing it and by the
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.080]  way sir for radio listeners let me describe to them the rotten tomatoes
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.920]  page this is incredible I missed the forest for the trees the horrible little
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.800]  globalist minions at rotten tomatoes that that have have disgraced themselves
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.160]  and discredited themselves attacking any libertine or conservative or
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.160]  patriotic or nationalistic film I mean they're well known for this that's why
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:16.280]  folks don't go there now gave it a five percent but the audience rating was 82
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:22.520]  incredibly high so you see the total paradox there of the fraud versus the
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.240]  truth yeah there's a group called Cinema Score and this is an objective
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.240]  independent agency and they interview people as they come out of the theater
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:37.480]  and then they rate films and it's very hard to get an A or an A- in fact the
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.520]  only film playing in the theater right now other than ours that got an A-
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:48.000]  rating is Star Trek so from the audience reaction these are the two best films
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.760]  that are out in the theater and this includes the whole menu of Hollywood
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.280]  films that are out there this summer well I mean your America 2016 was powerful
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:02.760]  slick historic very good I felt good watching it it wasn't gloomy it was
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.080]  almost upbeat but you know what Donald Trump's right we're in deep crap your
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.160]  your new film is a horror film it's very dark and it comes I think close to
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.800]  showing how evil she is but it's really hard you know unless you actually see
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.600]  the kids buried and found dead at Mina with maggots all over them so I mean she
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:23.520]  is a monster and so congratulations well it's just thrilling to to have this
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:29.200]  film in the theater as a kind of vaccination or antidote to the
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.560]  unbelievable squid like cloud of rhetoric that's coming out of Philadelphia
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.240]  first of all to listen to that old con artist Bill Clinton you know gee if we
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.760]  came from Mars and had never heard of before he might be a reasonably effective
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.960]  used car salesman but to literally hear this one given what we know the
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:52.160]  selective a Rapunzel story of Hillary I mean it's downright nauseating and so I
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.600]  think for Republicans our film is a great sort of protest vote it's a way to
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.360]  equip yourself and arm yourself and in a sense take it so we have taking a
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.600]  shower from all the false and we got a deep program of my family personally I've
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.520]  been so busy I still haven't seen even though you had us at the premiere I'm
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.080]  going to see it Saturday but my family and friends have all been taking
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:17.320]  liberals and deprogramming and they're saying that the liberals already hate her
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.440]  and no she stole the election so it's that they're they're like being deprogrammed
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.080]  out of a cult right now and totally freaking out some people I've talked to
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:30.160]  say that liberals start crying when they leave this is a film that could
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.400]  actually have a transforming effect not just on independent voters but also on
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:39.600]  women Latinos and minorities now here's something that's odd if I were Michael
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.520]  Moore the whole Democratic Party would have gotten behind me and they'd be
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.800]  pushing this film for all its worth weirdly we haven't heard a whisper from
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:52.040]  the RNC we haven't heard a whisper from the super PACs those are the guys who
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.960]  can actually take this film and drop it in the mailboxes of independent voters
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.360]  they can do something with it and they have reach and resources that we don't
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.880]  have so that might change but as of now it's all quiet on the Republican front
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:08.920]  you're right speak speak more to that I mean because you're obviously having a
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.520]  stewed eye working in the Reagan administration and others and know the
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.760]  behind-the-scenes things I've been watching on c-span just how they'll have
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.440]  a camera for an hour or nothing's going on showing the political operatives they
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.720]  look really upset hateful towards each other the stagehands look really in
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.920]  disarray I mean the RNC had a great feeling to it and I've been to others
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:32.920]  that didn't but they weren't still anything near the just watching it from
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.960]  afar my crews there and they said they pick it up on the street that it is just
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:42.760]  like a civil war going on within it and just a feeling of dirtiness absolutely
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.680]  well I mean just look at this recent email scandal I mean the Democrats have
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:49.960]  been trying to rig their own election and they're supposed to be a party that
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.160]  carries the name Democratic the other thing is it's funny to listen to the
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.920]  way the Democrats talk in private we show in the movie and in the book that
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:02.320]  the Democratic Party is the party of bigotry this is the party that has far
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.880]  from being the party of minorities they have been the enslaver the segregator
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.160]  the tormentor the lyncher the hanger of minority groups and immigrants and so
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.160]  and so it's wonderful to see the the lifting of the curtain because now you
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.000]  can see the way they actually think the way they talk in private so they put on
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.680]  a big show in Philadelphia but in private they talk about Hispanics that's the
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:26.920]  Taco Bell initiative they make fun of gays they want to ridicule Bernie Sanders
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.800]  for his religion these are very despicable people but they they
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.680]  camouflage and put on this big halo of social justice by the way I mean your
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.960]  film exposes all this your film exposes all this obviously I've you know I've
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:43.480]  read the reviews but this is what I experienced growing up my dad was a
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:47.360]  you know Reagan guy my mom was more of a Democrat but she liked Reagan you know
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.840]  she was like an old-fashioned Democrat but I mean I grew up where we didn't have
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:53.960]  a bunch of guilt but we knew people done bad things in this country and we wanted
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.400]  to build everybody up and so you know it was really bad to be racist because
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:00.720]  that's what scum did because they wanted to feel better about somebody and being
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:04.680]  around Republicans in my life they actually are like guilty and really
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:08.120]  wanting to lift people up on average I never heard anything racist out of
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.560]  Republicans not you know inside the halls of Congress when I visited or at
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.160]  events or anywhere or Pat Buchanan events whatever but man let me tell you
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.240]  I've been around Democrats my whole life living in the South and man they are
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:25.920]  and even the black Democrats are like managers of the blacks and will say
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.760]  horrible things about black people like like you're in the club with them and
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.800]  like they're the uncle Tom and you're like totally freaked out and then and
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:37.200]  then I mean I'll say I don't want to abort all the black people now nobody
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.640]  wants them scum and trash you I mean it's just like the Democratic Party I
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.840]  guess always ran the plantations and everything and they never really stopped
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.800]  they just got more sophisticated sorry Dinesh yeah no they're running urban
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.520]  plantations right now that are very similar in many ways to the old rural
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:57.640]  plantations I sneak my way into the Democratic Convention and I sat down in
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:00.840]  a corner right near the floor and I watched all these people walk it around
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:05.920]  and and I just tried to get their vibe and the vibe I got out of them is that
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:10.800]  these are the overlords of the new liberal plantation they walk around like
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.600]  they are overseers managers plantation owners they talk about the people who
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:19.120]  are dependent on them as if in a sense all they care about these people is
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:22.840]  their votes just like in the old days all that the plantation owners want is to
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.400]  steal the labor of the slaves all the Democrats today the new plantation or
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.360]  all they care about as long as we get these people to vote for us that's it
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.320]  that's all we care about and then they can point out a few Republican things
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.800]  are obviously problems aren't perfect in history then a lot of corruption and
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.440]  then create this cosmology of race like they've done with the police when
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:48.160]  statistically it's non-existent yeah the police are charged with the on the
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.120]  impossible job of keeping the lid on the liberal plantation now think about what
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:56.480]  it's like to live in those places where there's basically everyone has a meager
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.600]  provision they give you food and health care just like on the old slave
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:06.000]  plantation the men are allowed the house no opportunity no hope nihilism despair
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.120]  so the liberal plantation is kind of boiling over and some of our urban
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:15.480]  these shootings and stuff come out of that exactly so show the left knows
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.320]  they've double black employment all this to make them more dependent and then
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:22.280]  they're just blaming the enforcers that they have they're trying to get the lid
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:26.200]  on it's that's why that's why I have some issues with the police obviously and I
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:31.160]  don't reform some of the problems but it's a total scapegoat to just randomly
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:34.840]  attack people in blue and just say they're the problems in America and
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:40.160]  whatever the problems we have I mean the very idea that Bill and Hillary this
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.680]  kind of Bonnie and Clyde operation that's in it for themselves it doesn't care
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.680]  about domestic policy nor do they care about foreign policy they're just like
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.040]  brokers who want to collect 10% and that's all they care about and so the
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.360]  idea that they can fix problems is just ludicrous now you know we've had crooks
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.360]  in American politics before but we didn't know they were crooks in advance
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.600]  with Hillary the Democrats know and they've still put her forward and I
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:09.400]  think that actually is a referendum on the character of this party that would
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:13.800]  advance a known crook as their standard bearer that is exactly what I've been
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:18.240]  saying independent of you because it's prima facie it's just truth so so what
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:21.560]  does that say I mean either they end up winning the world I don't think they're
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:24.760]  gonna back off now if they get in they're gonna go for everything they're
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.720]  not gonna stop clearly we've got to defeat them now or even if she gets in
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.440]  we have to stop her because this nation's never faced more peril with
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:40.520]  naked election stealing naked primary stealing naked stealing from the
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.320]  Sanders voters this is unprecedented yeah I think ultimately we don't want you
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:50.520]  know a gangster running America we don't it's just sort of like Al Capone in the
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.400]  White House now when Al Capone was running virtually running Chicago he
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.760]  wanted full access to the Treasury he wanted to be able to give contracts to
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.040]  his buddies he wanted to be able to snuff out his opponents or throw them off
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:05.640]  the stage he wanted to be able to walk into the Cubs stadium and have the whole
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.680]  crowd shout with cult-like dedication big Al big Al big Al and that's what
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:14.920]  Hillary wants that's what that's Hillary's goal for herself and this is
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:18.080]  not what not I think what we want in America I grew up in India it's a country
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.480]  run by gangs slumdog millionaire style I came to America for something different
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.440]  it'll be so disheartening for me as an immigrant to see that third world kind
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:32.720]  of gangsterism come here to America well I know this you can't go to Italy or
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.920]  India or China or Russia and be an outsider and end up being heading a
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:42.600]  federal department and a speechwriter and a guy that you know speaks to tens of
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.600]  millions of people and it's so respected I mean I know you love America I mean
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.320]  America's not perfect the boy isn't it the best place out there to be able to
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:52.800]  really advance somebody who's got the talent like you who deserves to be
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:57.840]  successful who can enrich society like you've done to Nash you know the choice
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.200]  in America is between two things there are ladders of opportunity and that's
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.120]  the Republican Party and the latter is good because you can climb up the
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.520]  ladder and how far you get depends on luck and it depends on your own efforts
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.560]  the Democratic alternative is that they don't believe in ladders they believe
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.720]  that they're sitting on top of the roof and they're putting a rope down and
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:20.760]  they're asking you to hang on to the rope and they will pull you up and what
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.640]  people don't realize they think oh well the latter you know the latter's work
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.600]  the rope is easy I'll take the rope but you don't realize they don't intend you
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:33.560]  to pull you up all the way they want to pull you up somewhat and then hold then
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.920]  hold because that way they have you where they want you they have you in a
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:40.440]  position of enforced dependence you can't go anywhere
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.960]  not creating a new caste system a class system that's they have a caste system
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:49.600]  with themselves at the top and they're the only ones that come out ahead look
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.800]  at the people who live on the liberal plantation they never get ahead the film
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:59.120]  the book the books obviously important people can get that at Amazon.com or at
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.200]  Hillary's America the movie.com you can find out put your zip code in we're
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.720]  showing but now it's showing pretty much everywhere I think it's in like 10
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.880]  theaters in Austin again a lot of my family went last weekend they were
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:13.000]  amazed by it my mother again didn't like Hillary and the Democrats but you know
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.320]  she sure didn't like you know the bushes either but I tell you she is just sick
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.400]  but she can't even look at Hillary now. The beauty of a movie it's ten bucks you
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.880]  know this is a way to use your influence to put fuel in our rocket if you see in
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.200]  the movie you love it go see it again take students buy them tickets get them
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:31.320]  to the movie theater. It's a referendum against them trying to censor
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.520]  everybody and throw us in jail. It's a power movie's a powerful weapon you can
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:39.560]  watch a film in 90 minutes and come out of it at the end of it a little
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:42.640]  different on the inside. I think if we could show this film to
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:46.680]  independents and blacks and minorities it would discombobulate them it would
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.080]  it would try to. I agree final segment to Nash and then call folks and then our
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.280]  next guest Tucker Carlson went back in three minutes to Nash to Susan folks you
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:58.880]  have to admit you've been conned though okay it's like a Nigerian email scam you've got to admit you've been conned.

[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.520]  to retire. Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.080]  silver group he said how simple and safe it was it's a private storage IRA and we
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.520]  could have real gold and silver in our hands. Really you mean we can actually see
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:24.560]  it and touch it? Absolutely Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:28.440]  help build a retirement income bottom line we would own a real tangible asset
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.640]  and we would have the security of knowing we're protected no matter what

[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:07.720]  also discovered how normal cells turned into tumor cells he discovered the one
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:12.200]  prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency Dr. Joanna Budwig built
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.400]  upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells to
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:19.240]  overcome this oxygen deficiency she found that it was a sulfur in the cottage
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.960]  cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.640]  emulsified and more readily absorbed flax oil delivered in this manner was
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.040]  able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body now there's a new

[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.440]  I'm gonna promote it. I don't need any money. Of course, the Susie hasn't offered that the point is is that

[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.840]  Or how much money we've got for trips. We need to raise a lot of money. I
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:09.800]  Can tell you right now that the average talk show host on almost 200 stations like I am with top ratings in many cities now
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:11.880]  And 50,000 watt stations we've broken through
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:17.480]  I'd have a private jet and some 20-win mansion. I can't keep my four-bedroom house clean
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.640]  So I don't want a private jet in the mansion. I built this with the money other talk show hosts could have done this
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.400]  They just they build mansions
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:29.920]  And so that's why we need the funds to really even do more because the money me I'm a free market go all the way

[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.560]  Lobos put a gun to my head and say, you know

[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:54.600]  Dinesh, thanks for coming on. It's great to have you more often than just once or twice a year
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.800]  I hope you'll join us a lot in three minutes. What other great and because it is great knowledge
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.760]  And an experience. Can you impart to the audience about the critical?
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.480]  Crossroads we've now reached
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:07.880]  Yeah, the I think one of the
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.120]  And Dinesh's internet is breaking up that's why I wasn't going to him earlier
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.000]  I saw it was breaking up. I was trying to give it time to reconnect you force them to admit all their crimes
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:26.160]  All the horrible stuff the Democratic Party has done from Indian removal
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:32.400]  Segregation slavery all the way down the line. They go. Okay. Yes, we admit it, but we changed
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.520]  The Democrats saw the light and all the racists became Republicans
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.080]  And so this is an effort to
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:46.640]  Put the blame on Republicans and also on the South and on America America to these things now
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:51.400]  There was in fact no big switch the whole case hinges on one guy strong
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:56.560]  Thurmond a Dixie Cratt Democrat who became a Republican
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:03.200]  But if you make a list of the hundreds of racist Democrats, they'd never switched think of a guy like Robert Bird
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.480]  It was in the Ku Klux Klan remained a hero in the Democratic Party
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:13.040]  All the grand dragons of the Ku Klux Klan going down through decades and even centuries. They all remain Democrats
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:19.960]  So this notion of a big switch is a fraud that is perpetrated by the progressives to shift blame from themselves
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.200]  That's right. And the film Hillary's America the movie calm Hillary's America
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:31.040]  It's our duty to see this film. It is number one now in the top ten ever. Let's make it number one
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.400]  Congratulations and that's just Susan go with God. We're proud of you
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:41.440]  It's good to have you fighting for team humanity. Thank you so much. You'll be back with your phone calls C-minus 70 seconds. I'm Alex Shouts
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:46.840]  This is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:53.680]  We're selling a product DNA force that is a V a very best
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:59.360]  Nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:04.960]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time Alex because I think it's very very important
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:10.320]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:14.480]  Telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:20.400]  But when it runs out you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:28.400]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:34.960]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five-star reviews
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:39.820]  I take this this is this is the product that I take info wars life comms and the profit we make
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:49.080]  We fight the globals we fight the new world order secure your DNA force today at info wars life comm are called toll-free 888 253 3139
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:55.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:08.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:16.360]  All right Carlson's on for 30 minutes, and then I'll take calls
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.320]  I'm going to your calls right now Kent and then Raymond and
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:24.840]  Chris and James everybody Robert. I'll get to you Kent in California. Thanks for holding
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:29.000]  I get I get greedy and have the calls that I have a guest and then don't get to you
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.160]  But most of us would just hang up on you, so I don't apologize too bad
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.000]  But thank you for tuning in go ahead Kent. Thanks for calling
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.800]  Hey Alex big. Thank you to be on your show appreciate it. I wanted to have two quick points
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:44.040]  One the first actually three by promise the first two are quick one
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:50.200]  I wanted to say to anybody listening that the fact that you and I would I'll politicize this for a second
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.240]  But the fact and you and most right-wing I would assume that we're gonna go with here
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.960]  Shows take live callers means that you're ready to defend your opinions and defend what you believe in
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:05.000]  Regardless of what's gonna happen left shows do not do this
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.880]  They will never take a live call because they do not want to have their entire narrative messed up by
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:15.240]  They're obsessed with control if you want a free humanity you you want the animating contest
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.920]  But if you don't you want to have your own little paradigm you run
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:24.440]  That you're allowing calls to go on your youtube show that anyone can be in your line
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:28.920]  Anyone to come up here and say anything to you if I don't agree with you that is an amazing fact just in itself
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.480]  But I wanted to alert our viewers one of the things whenever I mention you a lot
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.440]  It's not everyone agrees and some things that you said I don't agree with which is fine
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:41.320]  That's what America is about now. Let's say some of the time. I'm unlistable. I believe me. I'm my worst critic
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.320]  One of the things that the left does to discourage and I know we don't like him as much anymore
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:52.280]  But George Schaefer talked about this was once you control the vocabulary you control the argument
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.000]  And whatever you bring up any type of corruption or misdeed what they yell at
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:03.320]  Is conspiracy theory and there are such things as those but when you and they don't want the little people
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.680]  Discussing the turkey coos so they call discussing and a conspiracy theory
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:14.280]  Absolutely, you had tim kennedy go on. I believe it was two weeks before and he said look I can't tell you when but america is
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  Here it's prime for attack. There's a lot of rage
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:22.040]  Just beware and then literally within what a three-week span three attacks happen all within tim kennedy's
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:29.320]  Description and then you're like well, that's not a conspiracy theory or someone puts evidence forward puts opinions forward and says this
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:33.720]  Is going to happen and then it happened. How could you label that as a conspiracy theory a conspiracy theory is right?
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:39.800]  Just make up a bunch of dots and connect them and have no logical way to get there. They're telling you you're not allowed to have critical thinking
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:44.120]  Yeah, so I wanted to tell our wares be aware that
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:49.720]  When it comes to controlling the argument the left does a great job at controlling the vocabulary
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:54.440]  So do not let them put you down by just saying it's conspiracy theory, especially when you yourself
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.920]  Put up articles you put up links. You're saying look I'm not making this sure
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.920]  But I mean we're dealing with a bunch of dumb people
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:06.200]  That follow this that want to believe something simple and stupid. I appreciate your call cat
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:09.160]  Raymond in Kentucky you're on the air go ahead
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.240]  Hey, yeah, um, here's the thing okay
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:18.600]  It terrifies the establishment that trump is an independent candidate
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:25.560]  I mean he owns the owes a few people peanuts and stuff like that, but other than that he's supporting his own campaign
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:31.800]  Which means he's not going to owe anybody anything when he gets in that is terrifying to a corrupt system
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.560]  And by the way he's taking zero money from big pharma
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:38.920]  That right there the guy's a superstar of goodness
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:45.080]  Right exactly you see my point and uh the next point I'd like to make is
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:52.440]  Our father's didn't stand for the government that had control over them occupying their own country
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:59.400]  Why would we allow the u.s. Government a corrupt government who is trying to exert control on the people
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:01.880]  To maintain absolute control
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:08.520]  Why would we allow them to occupy us one word, you know and one word television
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.880]  With that they've created an artificial fantasy land
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:16.600]  That most people sit in front of all day that's artificial disinformation
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:20.520]  And totally controlled so people are living in fantasy land
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:26.520]  They need to wake up. I would use the s word, but I know that's not permitted
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:31.240]  Yeah, they need to wake up. No, you're right, right, and we don't just mean wake up figuratively
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.160]  medically
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:35.160]  Many people are in a near
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:39.080]  Sleepwalking trance state the tv puts them into that rain waves, you know the mainline tv
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:46.120]  I appreciate your call great points, Raymond. All right, we'll get to uh chris next and then
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.840]  We'll get to robert and james and lesh and many others 800 2 5 9 9 3 3 1 and then
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:54.760]  Coming up
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:58.280]  Tucker carlson from the dnc stay with us
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:05.560]  A new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic reports fox news
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:10.520]  Getting inked may lead to long-term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:16.760]  According to a new report by the european chemicals agency researchers found red ink was the most dangerous
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:20.520]  But they warned blue green and black ink is also risky
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:26.280]  The most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:29.800]  mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects the report stated
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:36.680]  It's also being reported that governments in the eu do not regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:42.920]  At many shops operate without government regulations in the united states the food and drug administration
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:48.040]  Regulates chemicals and products including tattoo ink cosmetics and color additives
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:54.680]  But due to other public health priorities, the fda has not traditionally regulated tattoo inks and pigments

[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:08.920]  And what do you think about the fbi director coming out and saying she had 110 classified emails?
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:11.160]  I did not send or receive
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:13.480]  Any information they say covers
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:20.280]  I'm our size from the group of 30,000 emails returned to the state department in 2014
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.600]  110 emails
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:29.080]  In 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:36.200]  At the time they were sent or received at the time at the time they were sent or received
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.680]  No, you don't believe it. No, we're good. All right. We're good
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:46.600]  Honey in order to support Hillary you have to deceive yourself and uh, yeah, exactly pretend the crime doesn't matter
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:51.160]  Hey, you boom for Hillary Clinton
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.240]  So what are your big issues? Are you for gun control?
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:57.960]  Yes, eliminate them. Take them out of the hands of the people
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:03.800]  I trust Hillary. Hillary's the best. Go Hillary. Disturbing
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:08.840]  Who you voting for?
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:10.840]  Yeah
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.840]  Uh, I give you a change
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:16.120]  Come on, buddy
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:19.240]  Trump is not going to get the vote disturbing
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:24.200]  All right, we got the piece Bernie by coming down here
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:28.040]  Uh, yeah, Bernie is like the best candidate I've seen
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:33.080]  People are trying to climb over the fence now to get in to where the DNC is taking place
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:38.040]  Of course, they tried to shut him down because it's rigged far as officer. There's she's clear
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:40.920]  Hillary Clinton is cleared from all charges
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.400]  And I am for guns gun control. You don't have our vote
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:50.440]  You don't have our money and Trump's gonna flatten you like a pancake, Hillary
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.440]  Obama's totally awesome. We're gonna miss
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:55.240]  F you Hillary Clinton
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:00.600]  We're not voting for Hillary in no way shape form of fashion. That's a wrap. Note like
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:03.560]  Everything that she's done everything that she's about
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:11.560]  We cannot just fall in line. No matter if Bernie's supporting her. I don't care who's supporting her. I'm not supporting and that's just that
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.720]  She doesn't hold none of our values. She owes no one value. She's not accountable
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:19.480]  She's not held accountable for anything. She wasn't held accountable for the emails
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.880]  She wasn't held accountable for Benghazi. She wasn't held accountable for libya
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.680]  She's not held accountable for anything. So nobody in their right mind should even think about voting for that
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:35.160]  What do you think about the FBI director saying basically saying every reason why she was guilty, but then saying she should be let off
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:36.840]  He was paid
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:40.520]  Or was it or he knows that a hit team will come after him. That's what I believe
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:43.720]  Do you think Bernie Sanders was paid off? No, I don't think Bernie was paid off
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:46.840]  Let's talk about director James Comey. Yes
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.280]  He knows something that we don't know. You know what I mean?
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.000]  It feels pretty something that happened. He did his life was threatened. I bet
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:00.440]  And I think Bernie's life was right. For him to do that, for him to say we're going to a contested convention
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:02.840]  and then give in for him to think that
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:07.960]  I just can't fathom it. Like I really can't fathom it anymore. Like it's just crazy
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:12.120]  It's what what do you why do you think that the that the election was stolen?
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:17.400]  I mean, do you think that Hillary is there to 11 states that have reported election fraud 11 states?
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:24.360]  They that goes beyond the margin of error. Why is Hillary doing this? Why is Hillary doing this? What's her game plan?
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:47.960]  Me personally, I think she want to go to war with Russia. That's what I think
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:56.760]  I
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.320]  That's a few minutes of the bedlam going on on a daily basis outside the dnc
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:11.880]  Where their own constituents are rebelling against them sanders clearly won california and new hamster in other states
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.880]  They're just not letting the delegates actually be there. They're putting in fake delegates super delegates
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  This is is so naked
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:21.480]  That it's not even a quote conspiracy theory
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:27.080]  Uh, it it's so crazy to see clinton toddling around like a corpse
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.440]  gallery running around looking like the joker
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:37.240]  That I'm wondering if this is like some simulation. Is it really happening? Of course, I'm being sarcastic. Tucker Carlson has been nice enough
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:43.960]  During his lunch hour covering the dnc for fox to join us. He's the founder of the 24 hour news site
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:47.240]  The daily caller.com and of course everybody knows who he is
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.800]  So no need to get into the libertarian conservatives background daily caller.com 20 plus your veteran
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.600]  Of journalism. Uh, tucker the world is really getting crazy
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.520]  Uh, I I could ask a lot of questions here, but I want to ask you where do we start?
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:05.160]  I mean, is this is this not a referendum on the decaying establishment
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:09.000]  I think trump has proven that the old republic of establishment is going out
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:11.800]  It looks like the democrats are trying to hang on will they be successful
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:18.360]  Well, you you let me just say I you have really captured the fun vibe here in philadelphia
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:22.920]  I mean, it is it is the most unhappy city. I've been to in a long time
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:29.400]  I keep running label it was like a party. It was fun. It's unbelievable. Actually the bernie people were very nice
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:30.840]  um
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:33.960]  At least to me and I'm not sympathetic to their economic program
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:37.800]  But the thing that distinguishes the bernie people from the hillary people here
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:44.760]  Is that they actually believe in something so if you stand at the entrance to the conventions that are and you watch people file in
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.360]  The bernie people, you know, I mean, they're always friendly
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.400]  Always nice the hillary people are mostly lobbyists
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:53.880]  from washington or
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:55.880]  sort of 70s era feminists
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.600]  um
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.080]  And it's a completely different a completely different feeling
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:04.760]  So the bernie people really are true believers and i'm not using that as a as an insult but rather as a compliment
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:09.640]  I mean, they they believe in something and they're they have a million times more credibility than just the washington insiders
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.560]  I think they do I think they do they have a look if you've met them
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:18.200]  You show up and they want to tell you what they believe and they want to convince you that they're right the hillary people
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:21.560]  Have no interest in convincing you. They're interested in power
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:28.600]  Acquiring it wielding it mostly for their own benefit. I mean, it's and it's not just hillary. Of course, it's it's the establishment
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:30.760]  It's people who benefited from the last
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:37.480]  15 years in america who become richer and more powerful. They obviously don't want change and a lot of other people do
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:41.400]  Let me ask you this question and I want to get into what trunceter for you tucker
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:47.640]  All the scandals though, it just has a smell a feeling like I know if she gets in she's going to get impeached
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:52.520]  I know there's nothing she can do sort of becoming a dictator or something and she looks so
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.320]  Ill, I mean, she just looks like a failure. Clinton looks like he's about to die. Is that they're shaking?
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:02.200]  I mean, it just seems like a joke. So I feel like we're winning even if trump doesn't get in
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:07.000]  Well, I will say this. I haven't met a single person who likes hillary
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:09.480]  I mean a lot of my neighbors. I haven't either
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:14.760]  No, I know it's so strange a lot of people I live near are voting for her. They're here supporting her
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.080]  But they're doing so because they see material gain in her election
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.880]  They want to be ambassador to belgium and so they're here, you know signing on early to the program
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:28.440]  But I haven't met anybody not one person who says, you know, I really like her. I think she's a good person
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:33.400]  She's an honest person. She's direct. She'll be a great leader. I've heard that at all. She's the default candidate
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:39.480]  I think they are suffering from sort of the opposite of what the publicans are suffering from they had no feel
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:40.680]  There were no real candidates
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.880]  It was basically burning standards that loser governor from
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:48.440]  Maryland and hillary clinton's because they're so controlled like the communist bullet bureau
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.000]  So let me ask you this then. Where do you see this going?
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  Well, I mean hillary clinton's
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:57.960]  The nominee I'm leaving in a minute to go watch her give her speech tonight here
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.560]  Um, and she's really the candidate for people who are terrified by or disgusted by donald trump
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.760]  And mostly that means on the left people who think he's racist
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:11.960]  So the rest of this campaign is going to be about one thing donald trump is a bigot
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:17.720]  Because that is the fastest way to get democratic voters to the polls to vote against bigotry
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:23.480]  I'm convinced that's their only campaign tactic. They're not even here's the thing and I'm not hardly endorsing trump
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.160]  But I'm just struck by this. They're not even engaging his argument
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.560]  You haven't seen one person philadelphia explain why mass immigration is good for america
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:37.080]  Not one person has explained that or why our current trade deals have been a great success for the middle of the country
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:43.160]  Nobody has even pretended that those are arguments. It's no instead. Obama says hillary will enforce immigration law when he's ignoring it
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.680]  It's just crazy
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:49.160]  Right. It's not it's not an adult exchange of ideas and you see it in the press too
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:54.120]  You know donald trump is a lunatic donald trump is no self-control. By the way, donald trump doesn't have much self-control
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.760]  But but is that really the point the point is
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:03.400]  Trump makes a specific case about a bunch of different policies if you disagree with that case tell me why
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:07.080]  Tell me why he's wrong and give me a disagree with a zero percent interest rates
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.240]  But he's not out to get america. So i'm supporting him
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:11.800]  Right exactly exactly
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:18.120]  Tucker for you. What are the central themes now? Um, what are you looking for is the next shoe to drop?
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.240]  Well in the hillary campaign, I mean, it's you know, there's a lot out there the wiki leaks
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:29.000]  Emails as far as I know have not been fully vetted by anybody. They're just too many of them
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.560]  And so it's possible we'll hear more there by the way if the dnc emails were hacked
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:39.480]  Who knows whose emails have been hacked, you know, which is something by the way to think about if you communicate by email all day
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.600]  As I do. I mean, you wouldn't want your email out there probably time to change your password
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:45.240]  But I think there's gonna be more of that kind of thing
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:51.960]  Uh that comes out but for me the campaign theme the only one that matters to me is immigration because it touches on everything
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:56.600]  It's basic sovereignty. I mean you've got to follow the law. You can't just open it up and give people free stuff
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.880]  There's no more important question than who gets to live in your country and who gets to vote for its leadership
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:05.880]  That's the basic question that any country faces and immigration
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:10.040]  Affects that directly. So I'd like to see I hope and I probably won't happen
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:12.920]  But I'd really like to see a national referendum
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.880]  A national debate on that question. Do we have too many immigrants coming in not enough?
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:22.440]  I mean, let's let's talk it out. Well, I saw one this morning that's starting to get picked up one of these
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.920]  um
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.920]  Tact emails is the clinton um
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.720]  Campaign telling google what hashtags to block
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:34.920]  Uh, you know for crooked hillary and stuff and then now google won't even let you as of this morning that may have changed it
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:39.560]  Search presidential candidate. Donald trump doesn't even show up. I mean this is so
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:41.960]  transparent
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.760]  Well, the problem is as you know is you have a couple of companies with more power
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:53.960]  Than any media company has ever wielded in the history of the country. There's just never been a monopoly like facebook or google ever
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.920]  And so, you know the potential for
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:06.360]  Abuse of power is huge and by the way, both of those companies are deeply tied in to the democratic establishment to the obama administration to the hillary campaign
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:07.800]  You know, I
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:14.360]  I think we don't exactly know what's going on, but it's really clear to me. There's massive potential for abuse
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:19.880]  Scary abuse the kind of abuse that controls public opinion. I mean, that should make any normal person nervous
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.440]  Well, sure, search engine heads and Zuckerberg have bragged about this and now they're dealing it
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:26.440]  And it just makes a joke of the term. Don't be evil
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.520]  Let me ask you this question
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:35.320]  They've got national polls out as you know LA times and others with them 7.3 ahead 7.8 ahead
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:39.640]  Internal polling I've been told showing that number. I said that a week ago 7 or so
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:43.480]  Obviously, it's an electoral college. You see you got battleground states
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:45.480]  but
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:49.320]  My gut is there's a lot of folks that are closeted who are really gonna vote for trump
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:50.680]  I think that's what people are telling me
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:55.160]  So let's say he's really 10 points ahead. Let's say he narrowly wins if hillary's already stolen the nomination
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:01.560]  They're already rigging search engines. They're already doing all this. They're already announcing, you know the day before that the donors decided
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:03.560]  Hillary would win california
[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:06.600]  I mean tucker, isn't it safe to say that we expect hillary or her people
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:09.560]  To try to steal the election if they've already stolen the nomination
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:17.560]  Well, whenever you frame an election as not a contest between ideas like I think this you think that let's see who the voters agree with
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:22.600]  That's what an election has typically been in our country. They framed it this way. You have a fascist
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:27.320]  Dictator trying to take over america. He's evil and we're virtuous
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:31.800]  If you frame it that way, you kind of justify any level of extremism, right?
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:35.400]  If you really thought hitler was going to take over the country, what wouldn't you do to stop it?
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:40.760]  What wouldn't you justify in your own mind to prevent that from happening nothing hillary's the one stealing? She's the hitler
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:45.240]  Look, I'm just saying I'm just saying they don't know either
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:52.680]  I understand what you're saying. Yeah, I just it's just again everything's inverted. Let me ask you this talking obviously you talk to some
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.840]  High-level democrats and people, uh, you know who are there on at fox news
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:03.880]  Or you know around at the dnc. What is their sense? I mean you were kind of implying they're just there to be on the bandwagon
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:08.200]  Yes, yes, and but they also hate trump. I mean it's so funny
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:11.480]  I had this really interesting conversation at a burning rally the other day
[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:15.960]  And I think your guys may have been there actually, um, but I was talking to this woman and I said well
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:19.720]  What do you care about? What are the issues you really care about? She said I'm really mad about trade
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:25.560]  I think our trade agreements hurt americans, and I think number two wall street has too much influence in our electoral process
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:27.240]  And I said you want something weird?
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:30.920]  Trump said that exact same thing the other night and she basically
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:36.280]  She refused to believe me. I mean, it's true. Those are true. That's right. They're they're so compartmentalized
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:41.080]  This is how google does it word liberal conservatives. Those people are kept their little they feed you what they think you want to hear
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:45.400]  They don't even know what trump really stands for exactly. That's exactly right
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:48.840]  And I also think trump could do a better job sticking on the issues
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:51.960]  I mean that's I think would be really helpful. Let me just say this
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:58.840]  I think the left hates trump so much and is so intent on holding on to control the executive branch
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:02.040]  But I don't think many on the left will accept a trump presidency
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:05.880]  Now i'm not sure exactly what that means, but my sense is they will not see him as legitimate
[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:11.080]  For real in a way that we've never seen in my lifetime anyway in 47 years
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:16.840]  They're not going to accept him as president and many of them anyway. You're talking about civil unrest, dr
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:20.680]  I'm not sure what i'm talking about, but I you know for the
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:25.640]  Decades i've lived in washington 30 years there's been this sense. Well, I don't want the other guy to win
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:29.880]  But if he does he's the president of the united states like I don't know, you know, i'm an american. He's the president
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:33.560]  I'll sort of get in the line. I may not like it, but i'm not going to pretend he's not the president
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:36.840]  I think things have changed. It's the sense. I have no evidence for this
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.720]  But the many on the left are going to say, you know what? He's not the president
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:42.040]  Well, I think you do have evidence. Look at all the civil unrest that
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:45.160]  Obama and hillary have been fomening. What do you think's behind that?
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:51.240]  Well, I I think you're exactly right. I think there's been an awful lot of racial demagoguery
[02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:55.400]  Just in the last few days last three days here in philadelphia, but I think for the last eight years
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:56.920]  I mean from day one
[02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:01.080]  Obama has made the case if you disagree with him you just don't like him because he's black you're a racist
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:06.840]  You're a bad person. You're immoral when you say that or you imply it as he has again and again and again
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:11.720]  Totally unfairly. There's no evidence that the average american is racist. That's just not there's that's not true
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:16.840]  But he can be average americans. Shaka hearing about it. I'll tell you that I agree with that and you
[02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:22.600]  Divide people on a deep level not just they don't just disagree with each other on the issues. You're for tpp
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:30.120]  I'm against it. They hate each other based on tribal affiliation and those wounds are very slow to heal takes generations to heal those wounds
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:33.400]  I think this guy has intentionally divided people
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:38.600]  Presumably to increase his own power. I don't know but I can tell no doubt terrible effect
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:43.640]  Tucker you talk about there being some type of permanent emergency
[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:48.760]  Maybe if trump gets in and then obviously they vowed to do that so there is evidence to it
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:53.800]  But I got to tell you if hillary openly steals a selection after stealing the nomination
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:57.640]  I mean, I'm a peaceful guy. It's not anything violent
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:59.640]  But at a certain point, how do we up?
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:02.200]  You know the the political
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:09.720]  Temperature to try to stop this if they're banning words saying mother and father are bad the borders are open outside of law
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:14.520]  They're about to appoint five supreme court justices probably in the next four to eight years
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:16.520]  I mean, this is a nightmare scenario
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:19.400]  And I almost feel guilty if I don't do something else
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:24.120]  But I don't know what I do that they don't end up turning against myself for the republic
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:31.000]  I mean, I just I mean, I'm really having these thoughts now like it's we're really turning into a third world crazy town
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:35.880]  Well, they've they've been radicalized for sure. And I think they are
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:42.760]  I mean to give them credit for sincerity. I think they're genuinely afraid of trump. I do think that I think they're really threatened by the guy
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:46.520]  They don't understand them. They don't know where he's coming from. They can't predict his next move
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:50.280]  They don't think they can negotiate with them. And I think they really feel cornered
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:55.480]  And, you know, I hope that people don't resort resort to extremism like stealing elections
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:59.160]  But you never know people who feel deeply threatened do
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.920]  You know things they wouldn't do otherwise and it definitely makes me really uncomfortable. I love this country. I have nowhere else to go
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:08.520]  I don't have another passport. I grew up here. I don't want things to go to hell
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:12.920]  And you really feel like when political leaders say and they've said this flat out
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:18.600]  If you don't like the law don't obey it or the whole system is corrupt and therefore illegitimate. It's racist
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:22.280]  That's when things start to go the way and then it's all selective though
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:27.000]  Then they throw denies to susan for campaign contributions in jail while hillary's getting money from gulf states
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:34.360]  Illegally exactly. It's like it's it's it's so rigged with the system out to get you because you're an evil
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.320]  American or you're a white guy or you're libertarian you're a conservative and then you haven't done anything
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:42.200]  And then you know the groups even attacking you were being screwed over
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:44.840]  I mean, it's really scary
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:50.040]  No, that is such a good description. Even the groups attacking you are being screwed over, right?
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:55.080]  I mean there if this were 1917 they'd be the menschewicks, you know, they played a kind of useful role
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:57.960]  Yeah, exactly. They're cast aside
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.840]  Let me look you're out there in the streets, but you're also, you know at the highest levels of media
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:11.560]  Obviously the military has been concerned they blocked funding isis and what obama tried to do general flin and others
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:17.160]  Ran paul to his credit. Ted Cruz was credit. So there does seem to be an understanding now that we have this machiavellian
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:22.040]  Elite that are not even party affiliated now. They're just they're just crazy
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:25.240]  And I think folks are having it click now
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:30.760]  That things are out of control. I mean, that's what I'm picking up from billionaires and generals and folks
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:36.360]  They don't know what to do because when you get into the kind of the bureaucratic level and the political level that even
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:41.080]  Because I'm not defending bureaucrats saying the CIA or the FBI or the military
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:46.600]  But they at least know starting a war with Russia might cause nuclear war. It just seems like you've got a bunch of
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:53.320]  Power mad crazy communist and weird feminist and it's communist and they've got power
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:59.480]  They're ruling the country. They walk on red carpets. They have mansions, but they still have some victimology
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:05.960]  60s weirdo stuff to like get the man and the man some poor white guy down in a coal mine
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:09.240]  You know with black lung. I mean, I just I think they're fine
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:12.440]  I mean, I always thought leftism was just a cover for their takeover
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.920]  But I really get they I think actually drink a lot of their own kool-aid. I know I'm ranting
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:24.440]  And it's skype just pause we'll go back to Tucker as soon as it comes back Tucker, can you hear me?
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:32.120]  I can see him there, but he can't hear me guys try to send more audio to Tucker Carl. So that rant was so powerful
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:33.320]  It just cut him out
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:38.600]  It's why I almost want to get satellite stuff that you have to go to a I mean I can pay for satellites or fiber opting
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:42.440]  Then you have to go to a studio to be honest. The skype is great, but it does this target. Can you hear me?
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:46.040]  Yeah, he is his his his
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:47.720]  Uh, Parker, can you hear me now?
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:49.800]  Yeah, I hear you perfectly and I think that was so smart
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.400]  He's gonna cut up right at the end when he pointed out that the people in power describe themselves as victims
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:28:01.320]  There are two things going on one the left kind of inherently needs to feel morally superior
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:03.640]  They need the moral high ground because that's really the whole point
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:08.600]  The whole left project is the good people rule the mediocre people
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:14.600]  Rule of bad people the people with clean hearts are in charge of the people with you know filthy intentions a
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:19.720]  b when you're a victim it means by definition never having to say you're sorry or
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:22.600]  Look back and critically assess what you've done
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.640]  And so you have this incredibly bizarre situation where the president of the United States claims to be a victim
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.480]  He's a victim and you have Hillary Clinton saying one of the you know
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:36.520]  Richest the most famous people in the world that every white person is somehow
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:39.560]  Literally she said this privilege and need to examine their privilege
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:45.880]  So the unemployed machinist in Cleveland is somehow more privileged than the Harvard educated president really
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:53.000]  Who wakes up in a house built by slaves poor baby and then it expands on that you have Bernie Sanders saying white people
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:55.240]  Don't know what it's like to be poor
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:01.080]  Well, exactly when rural America is collapsing in on itself in the saddest possible way
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:03.880]  It's a slow-motion disaster that we're all ignoring. Wow
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:08.680]  It really is it's the saddest thing. I think I've ever seen what is happening
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:12.040]  To America outside of the big population centers
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:16.760]  It's just absolutely awful and these people are intent on attacking the people were suffering
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:21.720]  Well, he said that's the enemy the better clingers in in closing dailycaller.com Tucker Carlson founder of that
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:28.280]  Of course a journalist at Fox News in closing. Who's gonna win? I mean, who do you think just stalled or not?
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:30.520]  Who's the next president gonna be?
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:36.680]  This is the way I think of it. He's got the best message ever. He has trouble articulating it. She has no message at all vote for me
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:42.360]  I'm a woman. He wins if he stays disciplined. That's my view. All right, Tucker. Thank you so much

[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:21.160]  A district judge dismissed the tampering with government records charge upon the request of the harris county prosecutor's office
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:27.480]  Defense attorneys said their client should have never been indicted if they had been convicted of the felony charge
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:30.520]  Each could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:37.720]  Prosecutors alleged that the defendants used fake driver's licenses to conceal their identities while dealing with planned parenthood
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:41.880]  The defendants who founded a group called center for medical progress
[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:48.840]  Previously rejected plea deals offering them probation a grand jury initially began investigating planned parenthood
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:55.480]  But the group was cleared of misusing fetal tissue. You can find more reports on info wars dot com

[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.200]  And we're going to be playing fantasy football
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:45.640]  This is probably the most important election in us history
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:48.440]  definitive
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:53.160]  We know with hillary they are going to take us beneath the waves they are going to bankrupt this country
[02:33:53.720 --> 02:34:00.280]  And turn us into a third world nation on purpose to control us. They want to extinguish the american system
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:07.960]  That never even got off the ground, but just the idea produced so many great ideas inventions and wealth that changed the world
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:09.960]  I
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:14.760]  Just couldn't imagine being one of these globalists and then wanting to suppress everybody
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:18.200]  While I ran around telling everyone how much I love them it is
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:20.840]  It is the triumph of fraud
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:24.760]  The triumph of a galactic sized hoax
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:32.680]  But they get away with it because the republican leadership is almost as bad
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:36.360]  And works with them
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.360]  And along comes donald trump
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:42.680]  Who's a nationalist and a patriot?
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.880]  And who could turn into a strong man?
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:48.360]  like vladimir putin
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:53.240]  But I tell you this I know hillary
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.960]  And I know she's bad news
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:58.680]  And you are insane
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:01.720]  if you support her
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:04.120]  Because you support fraud
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:06.120]  and deception and stolen elections
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:11.640]  And gulf states flooding her with money and the communist chinese
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:17.720]  I mean the worst you know about the chinese murdering hundreds of thousands of political history year tens of millions over the years
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  And she's like oh, it's just a chinese
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:27.160]  Everywhere we go people scream you're an effing white male and they're weird white people
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:31.960]  It's like this royalty they have just run around squawking
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:35.880]  You know chinese kill 84 million of their own people. It's cute because they're chinese
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.000]  It's not bad when they when communists kill somebody and they're chinese, but
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:42.440]  Oh my gosh
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:53.320]  They were probably over a thousand lynchings from 1900 to 1970. I'm like wow. Whoa. Geez. I mean, okay great
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.960]  It's my fault. I did it, you know, it's just the numbers we're talking about here
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:01.960]  But it's how hollywood just inflames these wounds
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.440]  They're not well-meaning liberals in hollywood folks
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:08.440]  They're not well-meaning liberals in the democratic party

[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:13.400]  They're not letting you see stories by Hillary being corrupt. I mean this is admitted
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:16.520]  They meet multiple times a week with the wine house
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:19.080]  on average
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:21.080]  five hours
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:26.280]  They think they can dominate you they think you can give the next as soon as film a 5% rating and then the
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:28.360]  The public gives it what an 84 85%
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:31.400]  Okay, thank you for holding
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:34.280]  We're going to go in order here Chris in Canada
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:40.760]  And then to everybody else Chris in Canada. You're on the air worldwide. Thank you for joining us on this 28 hour transmission
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:48.120]  Hi, Luxem. Thank you for taking my call. Um, I just wanted to give you an idea of what I believe is happening right now
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:52.600]  I think we're on the verge of basically witnessing a dictatorship being formed
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:59.480]  Um, and some of the pieces that are put in place before the dictatorship can happen have already happened and none of us have really put the pieces together
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:04.040]  So for example, I said society is controlled by military religion
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:10.600]  Music and entertainment industry in all those places like we had our military or the US had their military purge
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:13.320]  at the beginning of the year last year
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:20.120]  And religion is controlled the music entertainment is the industries are controlled the business and banks are controlled
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:25.240]  The last spot where people still had a free choice or had a way of protecting themselves with a court system
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:29.400]  Now the judge was murdered a few months ago or you know, a little while back
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.960]  So now all the major spots where a dictatorship could be stopped
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:37.720]  Are online or complicit with this dictatorship
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:43.960]  Now comes the option of how to make Obama maybe Obama himself is into this but other people are
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:52.680]  How to make him in this position and think mr. Tucker um touched on it now when you present the people with an option of either having Hitler as your leader
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:59.720]  Or you know, that's it like Hillary will not win and I think Obama's team or people in Obama's circle are
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:05.720]  Behind the Hillary releases of the emails so as to make Hillary less viable options for the people
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:13.160]  So now if Trump is the only option you have people will have a better option for the people
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:15.000]  People will accept
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.760]  You know, obama running for a second or a third term or even saying that we should not hold elections
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:24.200]  And you know save democracy save freedom
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:30.360]  And this whole dynamic is being put forward for the people and I believe a dictatorship is going to emerge in the us
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:34.440]  Along you know, then you have the banking industry that will make a collapse
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  stress the people that have a very
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:43.640]  Very anxious and stressed out population that's willing to accept any type of you know suggestion and there you go
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:49.960]  And you have this dictatorship and I think it's everything's falling in place slowly but surely as the election comes up
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:55.400]  Well, I completely agree with your analysis chris and
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.760]  The social engineers are are doing things like openly stealing nominations
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:04.680]  And and and openly having the central government say go out and kill cops
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:11.240]  To just create the total disabilization where the cops are scared the local public scared and so you just maintain order
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:12.680]  We'll put up with whatever
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:17.080]  Just like in Europe. I mean it's so transparent. I said this like four years ago ship in the Islamist
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:18.680]  Let them attack
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:23.160]  Sensor people speech against it then declare martial law put troops on the streets. They've done it
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:29.000]  They've changed the French and German constitution. They're changing others now the EU's bringing a dictatorship in
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:32.920]  Because the death of memory the death of logic
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:34.920]  It should be arrested
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:39.160]  Merkel should be arrested. I mean they did this on purpose. They advertise it
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:44.360]  They don't even check the passports of these people when they're known terrorists. They let them run around
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:49.400]  People say it's all false flag. I thought you're about false flags Alex
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:51.720]  There's different types of false flags
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:57.080]  It is a false flag to open the gate up again if I breed black widow spiders in my basement
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:00.440]  And go into your house during the day and dump them in your bed
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:03.400]  They're going to go up under the sheets and stuff and when you get in you're going to get bit
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:08.440]  Now does the black widow take orders from me? No, it's like fire if I light your house on fire
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:11.080]  It's not taking orders from me, but I did it
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:14.120]  And so they're doing it
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:15.960]  and I sit here
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:18.600]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but I mean when I've gotten involved just to test it
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:20.440]  I know how to make money in the stock market
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:23.800]  Basically almost all the time because I know how real news and information works
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:28.680]  In real markets, there's no public can't figure it out even stockbrokers can't Soros can't because he's an insider
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:31.320]  Well, I'm an insider from the outside. I know how they operate
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:35.480]  It's like I've got eyeballs and other people don't and I'm on a power trip
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:39.240]  I've had the elite over and over and go look they're animals. You can't help the public
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:42.920]  They're going to tear you apart. You might as well. Join us. Well, I can't be part
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:49.160]  Of brainwashing people and putting poison in the water so they're even dumber so you can manage them
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:52.280]  I just I just I'm not putting my soul on the line
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:54.520]  But then I'm stuck between the piranha like public
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:58.040]  And then I'm stuck with these horrible vampire elites and it's just like
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:03.800]  I want I just want to go to find some new country or new place to get away from this stuff, man. It is
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:07.880]  And the ignorance of the general public when they just believe
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:11.240]  Excuse me at Hall of Pinger in the break
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:17.000]  Well, you know, they just believe their own garbage. It's so frustrating and then those that are evil that are smarter
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:23.160]  But not spiritually smart. They're smart intellectually. They're smart like a like a lizard, you know, very coldly
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:28.760]  to pray on people you don't just pray on someone because they're smarter than you you don't just go
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:33.720]  Rob a down syndrome man because you can't
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:39.960]  Oh, look, he's retarded. Let's go beat him up and rob him. You know, it's it's it's it's I just don't get it
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:41.960]  it's so predatory and
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:44.040]  We need to be not predators
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:49.320]  But as I said many times sheep dogs and that's not from the movie I've been using sheepdog for 20 years on air
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:54.680]  That's a saying around the country. I'm not a wolf. I'm a sheepdog where you should really want to attack wolves
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:58.520]  And you should really want to go after them and that just men aren't doing that
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:03.960]  They put on their football jerseys. They suck their thumbs and they act tough to each other
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:09.320]  Uh, and that's what men do and so great. You're you're you're you're not a man. You're not alive
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:14.120]  You're pretending to be and that's why you're so unhappy. I appreciate your call great point, chris
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.600]  you know, there's got to be some way to change this because
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:24.120]  Look, it's not all controlled. It is controlled, but the globalists are delusional. They're very smart and they opportunistically jump on any new crisis
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:26.360]  Is there or exacerbate or create them?
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.320]  But they say oh the world's going to collapse
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:32.760]  And we're going to consolidate control
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:38.120]  But it's not just that they're they're collapsing it. It is collapsing because they don't want to manage things
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:43.560]  They don't want to create prosperity. They want to be greedy. So it is collapsing and they have a cosmology that oh, we're geniuses
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:50.520]  We're doing the control collapse, but notice the control collapse isn't going that way. It's like it's like a bracket Matt Bracken says
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:53.720]  You can't
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:58.840]  Ride the tiger like you think you are. You know, you can't ride 10 or 15 tigers
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.880]  Smart elites before weren't perfect, but they didn't do things that were this reckless
[02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:11.240]  They had common decency because they knew it would blow back on them like don't target women and children because you don't want yours targeted
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:13.240]  That's what barbarians do
[02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:17.080]  And we are not cultured anymore
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:21.160]  You grow up you think like people being cultured is like wimpy
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:23.880]  No, it's not it's reserve
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:26.920]  Because you're a wild animal
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:32.280]  And the veneer of civilization is peeling off right now ladies and gentlemen
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:37.560]  And I can tell you whether it's this year or five years from now or 10 years
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:43.800]  We're trying to hold the collapse here, but the gate is on fire the enemy's coming through and there's all these trainees going
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:49.000]  Where's the crisis? Where's the world government as it's all being announced as people are starving 50 million a year
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.840]  It was 50 million a year just a decade ago. I mean, it's crazy folks
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:55.880]  all hell's breaking loose
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:00.520]  Because goodness is going out of the world in the ruling class
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:04.920]  Our cynicalness
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:07.240]  as a people
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:09.480]  Our laziness is empowering us
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:12.520]  And I will tell you
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:16.440]  We are going to be judged just like the 55 million babies that have been aborted
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.920]  You can make excuses for it and lord knows I've been involved in it before I grew up
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:24.520]  I'm not on some high horse, but when you won't recognize evil
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:27.320]  And when you won't admit it's going on
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  It's going to do more than bite you in the butt
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:35.240]  And I could feel god's judgment coming down. I mean
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:39.400]  Uh talk about god's fearing. It means you can feel the presence of god
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:41.400]  It's all around us
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:48.520]  And I just it's like in a way. I'm like, well, I love my family and everything but god, you know best go ahead and do it
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:57.160]  You want to have a big nuclear war have the ocean die see three four billion people starve to death in a couple months
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:02.920]  Nobody's gonna care about your 50 genders then
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:08.520]  And I think you know
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:14.360]  All these arrogant elites they're gonna die in the midst of it. So you know what I don't blame god
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:16.440]  I you know, I hope we change things
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.920]  But you know what?
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:26.920]  God needs to take us all out go ahead
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:31.480]  The people running things are looking
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:35.880]  For trouble
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:41.240]  Just like a psychopath that's killed 20 30 people they start getting real reckless. They start getting wanting to get caught
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:45.320]  And we got people like that running the show
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:47.320]  So
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:53.240]  Okay
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:58.600]  We have eric holder confronted it's on info wars.com
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:03.160]  Would you have prosecuted hillary info wars confronts eric holder? It's a short clip here it is
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:08.520]  Mr. Holder, would you prosecuted hillary?
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:16.280]  No, he would have run from it just like that. Okay. Have a night for fours I count
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:22.360]  Well, look at the look on Holder's face. It's all funny. Uh, at least they asked the question
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:27.640]  I would just continue hearing him like I did the turd blossom. That's the real name that bush called uh
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:33.640]  Reportedly Carl road didn't like me called turd blossom. So he's ignoring me. He says he's history's actor
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:38.120]  You know, he's gone. And so, you know, I was going to question him. Let's play that clip one more time
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  Mr. Holder, would you prosecuted hillary?
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:46.280]  Where she couldn't hear him as he ran off
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:50.280]  No, he would have run from it just like that. Okay. They have a night for fours. I know
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:55.240]  So David couldn't hear him. Uh, but uh, yeah, there went holder boom. Well, I'm talking about prosecuting people
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:49:58.600]  Holder presides over
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:02.760]  The law firm that you've got to have certify your taxes
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:06.440]  Or your offshore deal kind of like Arthur Anderson was the accounting firm
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:11.960]  Where all these former fbi directors and former justice department directors and others is a very select group
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:15.640]  They rule that you can do whatever you want
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:20.440]  And steal whatever amount of money you want and then they go back to that law firm and make 50 million dollars a year
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.040]  a piece
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.040]  literally
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:27.400]  But notice Holder surrounded by a bunch of black people
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:31.320]  Because he cares about black people. It's why he lives in a rich white neighborhood and
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:36.440]  Let's weapons be sold to third world dictators. It's all crap. It's camouflage
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:39.640]  cover
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:49.240]  He told the media we need to brainwash the american public against guns. I mean, it's just like
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:52.760]  We're ruled by these pieces of crap
[02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:56.600]  All right, let's go to has been holding the longest now Isaac
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:51:01.400]  In texas than uh, james and gwen and others go ahead Isaac
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:08.520]  Uh, things are getting out of control. Aren't they they're getting pretty wild
[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:14.040]  I'll say this man. Um, I never thought I'd live this to you this day
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:19.560]  Or these days that we're living in. I mean, uh, were you lose friends?
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:21.960]  That you've had for years
[02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:24.840]  Because they ask one question
[02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:27.400]  Who are you voting for hillary?
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:32.200]  And last night I was finishing up some work and I had your info wars
[02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:35.880]  uh window open listening and
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:41.560]  uh, she chimes in and uh, a long time friend
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:44.360]  And she asked me the question
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:48.920]  I guess, you know the dnc. I couldn't watch it by the way. I wanted to make a statement on that that was just
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:50.920]  So much anti-gun
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:58.200]  Propaganda to me. It's just I I I heard about 10 minutes of it
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:04.360]  Sure, so a holier than now person being manipulated calls you up and then to try to bully you into voting for hillary
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:13.320]  Exactly and she she asked me a simple question. She said are you voting for uh, hillary? I said, you know, honestly
[02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:19.080]  Trump uh is where I'm at and you know, I have my reasons and
[02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:21.320]  You know, she went off
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:23.320]  Uh, she called me an idiot
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:24.600]  and
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.880]  I won't get into it
[02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:31.640]  I'll just say my message my last message was and this is someone I've known for years years
[02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:34.520]  And we've never had a disagreement
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:38.760]  I didn't even say I was voting for trump. No, no, just go ahead and tell me what happened
[02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:46.200]  Well, you know, she you know, I told her this I said look if you're gonna if you're gonna side with
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:48.680]  someone who has uh
[02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:51.080]  Had classified information in a
[02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:56.680]  You know server in a basement and uh, who's basically
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:03.320]  The server thing was always the red herring. She stole the nomination. I mean, did this dingbat you were talking to care about that?
[02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:09.960]  You know what her response to that was he that's when she responded that I was an idiot that was where I ended it and I just you know
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:14.200]  It's it's her right to believe that I feel bad. Well, brother, brother, brother
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.960]  Here's the deal. Does this woman live in Texas?
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:24.040]  Yes, sir, she's probably too stupid to know it's going to go completely for trump. They wouldn't even dare steal that
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:29.320]  And so it doesn't even matter, you know, people should she'll vote just for the general overall count. There's other elections
[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:34.040]  But again, you're talking to mental medgets who probably believe in Nigerian emails
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:37.880]  You know, I've told you I've had multiple people in the last 20 years
[02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:40.600]  It's been going on that long
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:42.840]  Stop associating with me
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:49.320]  Well, they started announcing that they were about to get a million dollars from Prince Abu but one time the guy actually had the name Prince Abu but
[02:53:49.960 --> 02:53:51.960]  And I explained once you give them 5,000
[02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:57.320]  You know, you don't get the hundred thousand and then they're going to want 10,000 and then it's going to be a million dollars
[02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:00.680]  And then they're going to want 10,000 and then it's going to be a million you're getting and then finally
[02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:03.960]  If you just give us 5,000 more Prince Abu will speak to you
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:08.280]  Our Prince Abu will be landing at the airport. You go to the airport Prince Abu isn't there
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:12.760]  But you're so crestful. You're so excited that Prince Abu
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:14.920]  cares about you
[02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:20.440]  But you give Nigerian scam artists and that's just one country that does it $15,000. I went out one night
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:22.440]  with a well-known
[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:27.400]  producer and TV individual sleep with that. I don't know why I'm telling a story. I'll tell a story. I went out with my judge to
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:29.960]  Here's some really great rockabilly music
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:33.560]  in Faris Austin at what was a black bar
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:38.680]  And it was just a whole mix bar nice people nice place and I'm out there and everybody goes. Oh my god Prince
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:42.680]  Waggoogoo's a boo boo or whatever's arriving. It's like this old Cadillac pulls up
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:46.440]  He's got these African offense and half the folks are bowing down and worshiping him and of course
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:51.080]  It was a total scam and then pretty soon. I heard they were he was there raising money for something in Nigeria
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:55.000]  Uh, and I mean good for them. We're a lion hat or whatever. Everybody bows down to you
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:58.840]  I mean, it's just look it's the same thing with Hillary. Okay, it's a Nigerian email scam
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:04.440]  And usually with Republicans it would be too. That's why I didn't support McCain or Obama in 2008
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:11.080]  Um, because I knew how bad McCain was but with this there's a real choice. So I appreciate your call Isaac. I'm sorry
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:15.480]  But she's smoking the Nigerian emails camp
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:17.960]  and what happens is
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:21.240]  Once somebody's been conned a loser
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:23.560]  Who's never faced reality?
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:26.760]  A victim they always blame whoever warns them
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.920]  But if they get involved in a con they won't admit that
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:33.720]  They are a victim
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:37.160]  See victimology people never blame those that are really victimizing
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:42.280]  They always blame the fantasy they live in fantasy land
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:48.680]  They want to believe they're getting a million dollars from Prince Abu. Abu a prince duck book back
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:51.080]  Or whatever the stupid name is they make up
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:55.160]  And they live in a fantasy land a pageant
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:55:59.960]  I was talking to this lawyer
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:03.240]  I know who does a lot of divorce cases and he said listen, I know cases with women
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:10.680]  Where they go to court 30 40 times losing every time to been crazy stuff because they like to boss lawyers around and just have
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:14.760]  Attention and just have people in the court and just get off on it
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:19.960]  There's people that go in and get all these weird medical procedures just as they like the attention
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:22.200]  It just there's a lot of craziness man
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:25.880]  And the world's gotten so soft
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:31.080]  People don't have to live in the real world and the ruling class have all this industry and all this power
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:32.680]  At their disposal
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:38.280]  So they just want to get everybody anesthetized with food and drugs and media while they control the future
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:47.000]  And that's why they're so disconnected and so arrogant because they know this is all just a matrix. It's all just just just you know
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  It's a Nigerian scam
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:52.840]  I knew a talk show host
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:57.640]  Who I heard on air I heard if you heard this talk show on GCN like 14 15 years ago
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:02.760]  Is saying that they've been contacted by the Nigerians and they're going to give him 10 million dollars or whatever it was
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:05.640]  And he's going to you know, he always got to do is make a small investment
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:10.360]  Really come through the Nigerian government wants to help him and I called the guy and I said it's a scam
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:13.080]  Bro, and he went on here and said that I was full of it
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:18.440]  And a few weeks later when he got ripped off. He said I had messed up the deal with the Nigerian government
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:22.440]  There was no deal with the Nigerian government
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:26.840]  It's like in
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:33.080]  Glen Leary Glen Ross is that I pronounce is a great movie. I'm going from it. Glen Leary Glen Ross teleprompter free
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:39.800]  And then at a pressure in this guy to make a sale he finally goes to the people that are delusional crazy people and they buy
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:42.360]  they buy the
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:44.520]  You know the land shares
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:47.720]  And of course the guy finds out that's the case and commits suicide
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:54.120]  And people under pressure will become delusional you're a man in the desert
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:58.760]  A mirage looks like water. You want to believe it's water because you're so darn thirsty and and look
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:01.960]  Didn't mean I don't see mirages sometimes too, but oh
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:07.720]  Compared to the general public. It's so sad and I you know, they tell me I'm in the wrong business. They say, you know
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:14.360]  You ought to just go with the system. I just let me tell you I've been around globalists. I've been around them. They are the most
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:16.920]  fake
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:18.920]  empty
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:20.920]  unhappy people
[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:22.920]  in the world
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:25.080]  And as bad as some of the general public is
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:28.520]  Blurry eyes and snot nose. They are a lot better than globals

[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:27.480]  I am good thank you for calling and holding patiently
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:35.480]  Oh no problem it's an honor to talk to you and first and foremost I want to express my sincere appreciation to you and your entire crew
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:43.480]  For the phenomenal job you all are doing it's such an honor to be able to hear somebody speak the truth especially with the session
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:47.480]  Well it's an honor to fight for our lives sweetheart that's all we're doing but thank you
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:51.480]  Well we pray for you and we thank you for all the sacrifice we know you're making
[03:02:51.480 --> 03:03:03.480]  It's an honor to bring up and you kind of touched on it is the power I mean with all the demonic forces that are behind the Hillary forces and the DNC and the globalist
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:11.480]  I think right now in addition to speaking up like we're doing and fighting the good fight I think we can't diminish the power of prayer
[03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:23.480]  I mentioned it and I think at this point you know God you're right when you say that he has every right to just blow us away because of the things we've done the country has fallen so far I wouldn't blame him either
[03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:35.480]  But we also I mean you know if you remember in like the 20s and 30s and 40s when things really got weak and bad for our country people would flock to churches and pray for God's intercession and help
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:45.480]  And I wish so much that I would see people realize that God's going to be the answer to all these evil things going on and I wish more people would realize that
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:50.480]  No they're gone as being like 200 pound toddlers bitching about how everything's giving to them free
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:59.480]  Exactly and if people would just you know enlighten themselves and realize I have a 27 year old daughter who is such a fan of yours you've got all your t-shirts and
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:17.480]  I'll be honest with you she is so disheartened when she talks to her peers at how just dumbed down they are and I'm so proud of her for being so on top of things and it's just such a sad state when you see our youth being so disillusioned and
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:29.480]  Bying into the well your daughter's a chip off the old block and that's why she's awake and you know it's up to her just to forcefully not even make it be a debate or like kind of halfway apologize when you talk to me politically I just say listen you've been
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:35.480]  Conned this country's in crisis you're under mind control you need to break out of it ma'am great here from you go in thanks for holding

[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:59.480]  Anthony will be with us I'm gonna read a few of these famous passages and then I'm gonna punch out and Anthony Gucci Artie our health news director is gonna take us across the finish line
[03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:20.480]  A new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic reports Fox News getting inked may lead to long term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer according to a new report by the European Chemicals Agency researchers found red ink was the most dangerous but they warned blue, green and black ink is also risky
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:39.480]  The most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects the report stated it's also being reported that governments in the EU do not regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food and many shops operate without government regulations
[03:05:39.480 --> 03:05:59.480]  In the United States the Food and Drug Administration regulates chemicals and products including tattoo ink cosmetics and color additives but due to other public health priorities the FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo inks and pigments you can find more reports on info wars dot com
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:14.480]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you know I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.

[03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:26.480]  I was just so glad I wasn't going along with the programming
[03:08:26.480 --> 03:08:39.480]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[03:08:39.480 --> 03:08:46.480]  Once more they would replenish themselves
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:51.480]  This world in the spirit of this world is not going to replenish you
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:59.480]  Our source God will you're not going to get that one of these whorehouse churches run by incarnate demons
[03:08:59.480 --> 03:09:12.480]  Let me tell you folks I am a very sensitive person in these big mega churches I've never felt so much evil not in the Roman Coliseum not a bohemian grove
[03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:20.480]  Those are evil evil evil evil evil people
[03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:29.480]  Who the world is set up over these churches and they know exactly what they're doing the only place I get the same creeps is being around Democratic party leaders
[03:09:29.480 --> 03:09:35.480]  And I did get creeped out being around old Republican party leaders I didn't get any of that around Donald Trump
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:44.480]  I was going to leave it with that my spider sense didn't pick up anything but somebody who's super dominant super aggressive thinks he's smarter than everybody probably is
[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:53.480]  And doesn't want to screw America over and once wealth and prosperity he's not a eugenicist he doesn't want to screw everybody over that's Donald Trump
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:10:01.480]  Anthony I'm going to take a few final calls here and hand the baton to you but I just want to thank the listeners thank the viewers
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:09.480]  I want to thank everybody for making in full wars what it is the great crew we've got the films the reports the news the radio the articles
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:18.480]  Just the memes we're just dominating exponentially despite all the Google censorship and all the Twitter and Facebook censorship but it's getting serious
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:24.480]  I mean if there were ever any doubts about the nature of the globalist thing I think it's very clear
[03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:32.480]  It's really inspiring and I was going to talk about it today the establishment is kind of like the Rio 2016 Olympics the facade
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:43.480]  So you look at like the corpses washing up on the beaches they said just close your mouth to the swimmers in the water because the water is so contaminated and disgusting
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:50.480]  And they said it's like swimming in a pool of feces right and we get to that today we have like fighter jets colliding over it because the planning is bad
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:55.480]  But then they say you can't tweet about it you can't tweet about the Olympics
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:11:00.480]  That's a test globally of the new TPP censorship where just they own all the words
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:05.480]  And we're going to tweet that the Rio Olympics are nothing but a giant latrine
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.480]  The Rio Olympics are a diseased filthy collapsed hell
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:16.480]  And it's just like the system it tells you that it's going to take care of your only allowed to do what it tells you to do
[03:11:16.480 --> 03:11:22.480]  But meanwhile it's like a massive disgusting wart on the side of society the establishment system
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:26.480]  Well let's look at that water they tell folks to swim in I mean that looks like chocolate milk
[03:11:26.480 --> 03:11:33.480]  It looks so much feces and the scientists talking about it they said it would actually be like swimming in a pool of feces
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:38.480]  But hey there's a dead body kind of like you know like monster balls floating around and I mean what's wrong with that
[03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:39.480]  It's good for you
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:41.480]  Why are you being a conspiracy theorist?
[03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:46.480]  Well Florida's going to raise the toxic limit in water in all of the water supply
[03:11:46.480 --> 03:11:50.480]  They did that with radiation yeah I mean the problem with radiation goes up a couple hundred percent just raises
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:57.480]  Yesterday they said that they're going to change the levels for toxic contaminants in the water because they want to raise the acceptable limits
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:58.480]  So it's just like the Rio Olympics
[03:11:58.480 --> 03:12:00.480]  Why are you being racist against radiation?
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:01.480]  I am being racist against radiation
[03:12:01.480 --> 03:12:05.480]  In fact you know some leftist groups that now have nuclear power plants everywhere they flipped
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:08.480]  They're saying that there's radiation phobia
[03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:15.480]  Sounds like a real thing I think there's toxic chemical phobia I think there's oppression phobia I think there's tyranny phobia
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:17.480]  I think there's injustice phobia
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:22.480]  There's a lot of phobias out there I have a lot of them actually been diagnosed with most of those I just listed so
[03:12:22.480 --> 03:12:26.480]  Alright well all I can say is we've got some of the biggest specials we've ever run
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:30.480]  I want to thank you all for your support we can't run all of these another day or two
[03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:35.480]  We're going to run some of them a little bit longer but it's going to be ending tomorrow 40% off brain force
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:38.480]  The new tropic I mean Anthony just spent a few minutes on brain force
[03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:42.480]  This has got one compound at least in it that's prescription Europe
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:46.480]  It's just the building blocks of the brain it's amazing
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:50.480]  So there's a thousand and nineteen reviews on the brain force page on infowars life
[03:12:50.480 --> 03:12:54.480]  And when I go out to print some of these reviews to read on air
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:59.480]  It's endless five star reviews there's actually hundreds of them I almost want to say near a thousand
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:04.480]  If you look at the number the average is 4.6 it teeters around 4.6 4.8
[03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:12.480]  Infowars is literally about clearly the best products brain force to me is it's beyond an energy drink
[03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:17.480]  It's beyond something everyone else we had an interstitial company here two weeks ago
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:21.480]  They go Alex we marked things up five times they're wanting to sell me stuff and it was good stuff
[03:13:21.480 --> 03:13:27.480]  And I said no my markups 100% not 700 there's was 500
[03:13:27.480 --> 03:13:32.480]  And we don't sleep look remember that one guy we had on the natural products insider guy
[03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:38.480]  They sweep stuff off the floor that fell off the conveyor belt the herbs in some of these major companies
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:43.480]  The reason we sell out a lot of times is we if something's got multi-ingredients like a DNA force or a brain force
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:49.480]  We got to wait months and months till we finally get batches that are California compliant which is almost impossible to make it
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:51.480]  That's how we sell out all the time
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:54.480]  The manufacturer tests it and then we independently test every single
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:13:59.480]  They can still just ship it out I mean quite frankly the California standard is pure bull but we want to be neurotic about it
[03:13:59.480 --> 03:14:07.480]  Yeah exactly but brain force it does have an ingredient or two that are prescription in Europe depending on how you want to look at it
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:09.480]  One is controlled one is a prescription
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:14.480]  So the key though is that it's not like coffee where you're going to be all jittery and caffeinated
[03:14:14.480 --> 03:14:22.480]  These are the natural compounds that actually work synergistically in the brain to make you feel more alert and more focused for me
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:26.480]  That's the best stimulant I've ever taken I don't like stimulants other than like coffee and stuff and tea
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:31.480]  But I will tell you if you're really exhausted and take it you'll be wide awake but it does make me aggressive
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:39.480]  Yeah well the alpha GPC and the hyperzine and the phosphatidylserine those are all things and by the way the phosphatidylserine
[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:49.480]  It's been told by our manufacturer that they are looking into turning that into more towards the FDA is looking at some companies trying to make that a pharmaceutical drug
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:52.480]  Or part of pharmaceutical drugs we might not even be able to have it in about six months
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:15:00.480]  But the phosphatidylserine which is expensive it's hard to get that is with the hyperzine and alpha GPC is not caffeine
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:07.480]  It's not even your motto extract it works to get the brain where it needs to be and it works with different chemicals and choline
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:15.480]  And all of that to make you more focused as opposed to just your motto extract which is awesome and I drink your motto but I take brain force instead
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:22.480]  It keeps you focused it's alert but it's not just an energy it's actually kind of a calm focus thing but it will wake you up
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:25.480]  If you're not up for two days like Rob do
[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:31.480]  If you're not up for two days like Rob do the wet cat who has become the brain force goblin
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:34.480]  Honorary title
[03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:42.480]  He said like four or five couple nights in a row like after midnight having a little bit of fun with the crew and I'm sitting there like out in the sun like eight o'clock it's already like
[03:15:42.480 --> 03:15:50.480]  I keep worrying brain force I was like no you're going to bed now but yeah it's I'm teasing Rob I love Rob he's a sweetheart
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:56.480]  But seriously I like the good halogen the pure iodine we have that nobody else has X2
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:02.480]  Three to three weeks to four weeks into it you're probably going to detox I did a bunch of oils and come out of your skin at least for me
[03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:10.480]  Group warned me and I felt like crap about five days but then it was like I like it when you're carrying your kid up you know a hill or something
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:14.480]  You know a mile when you're four year old and once you get there you take off your shoulders like you're flying
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:22.480]  After a month on X2 it was just like it was like I woke up and it was like I was 18 and it's because I was deficient in iodine folks
[03:16:22.480 --> 03:16:28.480]  Which they admit caused a 15 point IQ increase when the feds started putting in the salt in the mid 20s
[03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:36.480]  Of course now they've taken it out of the salt so it's got a 4.8 review 1,767 reviews on third party power review site
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:38.480]  I mean that's a big deal Anthony
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:44.480]  No it's serious I mean what do you think happens when you put the good halogen in the body when you're bombarded with the bad halogen
[03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:47.480]  But they've had articles saying we're quacks you don't even need iodine
[03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:52.480]  No you're quacks and you know what's funny about some of those articles here it's not even that they're attacking us they just go ahead and say
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:56.480]  The entire system that relies on natural medicine
[03:16:56.480 --> 03:16:59.480]  And they claim fluoride's not good for your thyroid
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:04.480]  Yeah and then they say and the FDA says you only need this much percentage of iodine a day
[03:17:04.480 --> 03:17:08.480]  Oh wow the standards to where you just don't drop over and die it's like vitamin C
[03:17:08.480 --> 03:17:14.480]  It's like you only need a hundred percent RDA vitamin C which is barely just enough to not
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:16.480]  You only need one bite of an apple a day
[03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:18.480]  So your teeth won't all fall out
[03:17:18.480 --> 03:17:20.480]  Exactly but those are high quality standards
[03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:24.480]  No actually you know what I want to go beyond to where I'm just not about to die
[03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:26.480]  I kind of want to feel optimally healthy
[03:17:26.480 --> 03:17:30.480]  But if I followed the FDA stuff I'd probably maybe not
[03:17:30.480 --> 03:17:32.480]  I'd probably maybe not totally die
[03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:37.480]  I'm just following one two Nobel prizes for science saying that mega doses of vitamin C were the key there
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:38.480]  I mean just just just
[03:17:38.480 --> 03:17:41.480]  Look there's a reason rickets are back in the United States
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:46.480]  Absolutely and then you go to the doctors and they won't tell people the reason their legs are being chopped off
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:52.480]  Or the reason they can't fight infections because these people never eat leafy vegetables
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:55.480]  It's true they don't take vitamins they don't know any of it
[03:17:55.480 --> 03:17:57.480]  And then we're bad because
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:02.480]  Wait wait wait you're gonna skip this break I'm gonna call your conspiracy theorist you're claiming that I need vitamin C
[03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:04.480]  I'm gonna call the FDA you're claiming
[03:18:04.480 --> 03:18:05.480]  No you should call
[03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:07.480]  Wait wait are you gonna claim I need oxygen next?
[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:13.480]  I'm gonna claim you need thousands of percentages higher vitamin C and oxygen and I think it's actually good
[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:14.480]  And I think iodine's good
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:18.480]  You're claiming if I go down a hundred feet under the water I can't just breathe water
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:20.480]  You could you could try it
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:22.480]  It works about thirty seconds
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:24.480]  It feels pretty good after a little while actually
[03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:25.480]  This is good way to go
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:26.480]  Yeah
[03:18:26.480 --> 03:18:28.480]  So I guess maybe that is my recommendation
[03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:31.480]  Are you ashamed to be involved with the snake oil salesman that claims we need oxygen?
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:35.480]  You know not only do you claim we need oxygen
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:39.480]  You claim we need vitamin C and not even just oxygen actually
[03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:43.480]  Water which by the way in Europe you can't say water cures
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:44.480]  The hydration
[03:18:44.480 --> 03:18:47.480]  You cannot say that companies have been attacked over that
[03:18:47.480 --> 03:18:49.480]  Okay that is a claim
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:51.480]  So we're not gonna stay on air here we're not gonna stay
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:53.480]  Absolutely you do not need water to live
[03:18:53.480 --> 03:18:54.480]  You do not need oxygen
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:56.480]  In fact you don't need brain force
[03:18:56.480 --> 03:18:57.480]  You don't need DNA force
[03:18:57.480 --> 03:19:02.480]  That's equivalent of what five hundred cartons of blueberries in it
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:04.480]  You know the next level of vitamin C
[03:19:04.480 --> 03:19:05.480]  Bio-PQQ
[03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:07.480]  You don't need a plant to live on
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:09.480]  In fact we never existed
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:10.480]  All facts
[03:19:10.480 --> 03:19:11.480]  This is all real life
[03:19:11.480 --> 03:19:12.480]  Yeah I'm not being sarcastic
[03:19:12.480 --> 03:19:15.480]  You know Reuters says it's a conspiracy theory
[03:19:15.480 --> 03:19:17.480]  If you even discuss martial law in Turkey
[03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:21.480]  I'm not kidding
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:23.480]  There's a piece right here about that actually
[03:19:23.480 --> 03:19:24.480]  Where does it
[03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:27.480]  They just shut down 130 media outlets and dismissed
[03:19:27.480 --> 03:19:28.480]  1600 military personnel
[03:19:28.480 --> 03:19:30.480]  That's the conspiracy theory too
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:32.480]  China just completely declared martial law over media
[03:19:32.480 --> 03:19:34.480]  No reporting online allowed period
[03:19:34.480 --> 03:19:36.480]  No that would be bad
[03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:37.480]  Yeah
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:38.480]  But again
[03:19:38.480 --> 03:19:43.480]  That's actually the noise that China makes when they initiate the censorship button
[03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:45.480]  There's like a big red button and it just makes you go
[03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:46.480]  Yeah
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:48.480]  That's the noise you got
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:49.480]  Yeah
[03:19:49.480 --> 03:19:51.480]  He goes we want a shrubbery
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:54.480]  I want 14 shrubberies
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:19:57.480]  I want 20 shrubberies
[03:19:57.480 --> 03:19:59.480]  50 shrubberies
[03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:01.480]  Well you know there's another conspiracy that we talk about
[03:20:01.480 --> 03:20:05.480]  That the carbon dioxide level is actually lower than it's ever been in the history of the planet
[03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:09.480]  And that's what's causing the deserts to form
[03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:11.480]  And of course that's an admitted fact
[03:20:11.480 --> 03:20:12.480]  But as a matter
[03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:15.480]  But the UN has said that actually carbon dioxide should be lowered and it's not needed
[03:20:15.480 --> 03:20:17.480]  It's actually a bad guess
[03:20:17.480 --> 03:20:18.480]  Did you know that Anthony
[03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:20.480]  There's a lot of conspiracies out there
[03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:21.480]  You know
[03:20:21.480 --> 03:20:23.480]  Obviously that's like saying oxygen needs to be banned
[03:20:23.480 --> 03:20:25.480]  I mean they're really doing this folks
[03:20:25.480 --> 03:20:26.480]  Without oxygen
[03:20:26.480 --> 03:20:27.480]  Which is a trace gas
[03:20:27.480 --> 03:20:29.480]  Bye-bye
[03:20:29.480 --> 03:20:30.480]  And without carbon dioxide
[03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:32.480]  Bye-bye to the plants
[03:20:32.480 --> 03:20:33.480]  Who create the oxygen
[03:20:33.480 --> 03:20:34.480]  So bye-bye to everybody
[03:20:34.480 --> 03:20:35.480]  Bye-bye
[03:20:35.480 --> 03:20:36.480]  Bye-bye
[03:20:36.480 --> 03:20:37.480]  But FDA says hey
[03:20:37.480 --> 03:20:38.480]  Do not say you need oxygen
[03:20:38.480 --> 03:20:41.480]  So I think everybody
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:42.480]  Put a newspaper on your neck
[03:20:42.480 --> 03:20:43.480]  Hang it
[03:20:43.480 --> 03:20:44.480]  Turn purple
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:45.480]  You don't need oxygen
[03:20:45.480 --> 03:20:46.480]  Of course that'll actually kill you
[03:20:46.480 --> 03:20:47.480]  But it's okay
[03:20:47.480 --> 03:20:48.480]  I'm sorry Anthony
[03:20:48.480 --> 03:20:49.480]  You're triggering me right now
[03:20:49.480 --> 03:20:50.480]  I'm gonna have to go
[03:20:50.480 --> 03:20:51.480]  I'm gonna have to take my mic off live
[03:20:51.480 --> 03:20:52.480]  You're triggering me
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:54.480]  What triggers me is Marilyn Monroe and her prime
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:56.480]  That's triggering me too actually
[03:20:56.480 --> 03:20:58.480]  There's a lot of triggering going on
[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:00.480]  Hey you know what
[03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:02.480]  This is the culmination of a 28 hour broadcast
[03:21:02.480 --> 03:21:05.480]  And we haven't gone crazy yet
[03:21:05.480 --> 03:21:07.480]  And you were here until like 1 a.m. last night
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:09.480]  I'm not a good American though
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:10.480]  No you're not
[03:21:10.480 --> 03:21:11.480]  We did important work though at 1 a.m.
[03:21:11.480 --> 03:21:13.480]  We were doing important work actually
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:17.480]  So a lot of important work to be done
[03:21:17.480 --> 03:21:19.480]  It's not a conspiracy
[03:21:19.480 --> 03:21:20.480]  What's going on
[03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:21.480]  No it is a conspiracy
[03:21:21.480 --> 03:21:22.480]  We just created a conspiracy
[03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:24.480]  I'm just not trading punches anymore
[03:21:24.480 --> 03:21:26.480]  Alright how's your arm feeling
[03:21:26.480 --> 03:21:27.480]  Not too good
[03:21:27.480 --> 03:21:28.480]  And while I was trying to act like his
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:30.480]  He's like oh look I've got a little bruise
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:31.480]  Oh you're so tough
[03:21:31.480 --> 03:21:32.480]  Like yeah I did right
[03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:35.480]  I'm like pulling up
[03:21:35.480 --> 03:21:38.480]  Oh my god that was fun though
[03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:41.480]  Anyways I'm back to the eighth grade now
[03:21:41.480 --> 03:21:44.480]  Hey you only grow up so you can go back
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:45.480]  To being a child again right
[03:21:45.480 --> 03:21:46.480]  Once the man twice the child
[03:21:46.480 --> 03:21:47.480]  Nope there you go
[03:21:47.480 --> 03:21:49.480]  Alright ants we're going right back to you in a moment
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:50.480]  I'm going to go to these calls
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:51.480]  The time has come
[03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:52.480]  The time is now
[03:21:52.480 --> 03:21:55.480]  Marvin K. Mooney you must go now
[03:21:55.480 --> 03:21:57.480]  James in Colorado you're on the air
[03:21:57.480 --> 03:22:00.480]  Thanks for holding
[03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:01.480]  Sup Alex
[03:22:01.480 --> 03:22:04.480]  It's funny I actually talked to you during the money bomb
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:05.480]  And sent me that $200 gift card
[03:22:05.480 --> 03:22:07.480]  So I did try out your products
[03:22:07.480 --> 03:22:08.480]  They are really great
[03:22:08.480 --> 03:22:09.480]  Thank you brother
[03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:11.480]  What products do you like specifically
[03:22:11.480 --> 03:22:14.480]  The brain force was good
[03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:16.480]  I didn't get the energy that was open from the products
[03:22:16.480 --> 03:22:20.480]  But it was fine because it had this long term detox effect
[03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:23.480]  I was like robbing and taking four or five at a time
[03:22:23.480 --> 03:22:27.480]  Yeah that's wet cat force
[03:22:27.480 --> 03:22:30.480]  So I want to talk about Hillary and Bernie supporters
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:31.480]  Because I'm a liberal
[03:22:31.480 --> 03:22:34.480]  So your keep cut I guess
[03:22:34.480 --> 03:22:38.480]  I'm saying that these people are lazy sappy hacks at best
[03:22:38.480 --> 03:22:42.480]  And at worst because they're usually animated
[03:22:42.480 --> 03:22:46.480]  By the spirit of violence and craze
[03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:47.480]  That's what they are
[03:22:47.480 --> 03:22:49.480]  You know they're violent, crazy people
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:52.480]  And you can look at Hillary Clinton's emails
[03:22:52.480 --> 03:22:54.480]  Like WikiLeaks has hacked
[03:22:54.480 --> 03:22:55.480]  Or actually this is unclassified
[03:22:55.480 --> 03:22:56.480]  But she says quote
[03:22:56.480 --> 03:23:00.480]  The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's nuclear capability
[03:23:00.480 --> 03:23:02.480]  Is to help people of Syria
[03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:04.480]  Overthrow the regime with Assad
[03:23:04.480 --> 03:23:06.480]  It's actually one of her emails
[03:23:06.480 --> 03:23:08.480]  You look at Sanders
[03:23:08.480 --> 03:23:11.480]  Just go to Google and listen to what he says
[03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:14.480]  And type in Bernie Sanders scandal
[03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:16.480]  Or Bernie Sanders flip flop
[03:23:16.480 --> 03:23:19.480]  And just read five pages of all the articles
[03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:22.480]  Bernie Sanders is a complete fraud
[03:23:22.480 --> 03:23:23.480]  And a con man
[03:23:23.480 --> 03:23:26.480]  And it's just a total blob
[03:23:26.480 --> 03:23:29.480]  He's like every other communist dirtbag we've ever seen
[03:23:29.480 --> 03:23:32.480]  And of course he was there shilling for Hillary the whole time
[03:23:32.480 --> 03:23:33.480]  And of course he dropped out
[03:23:33.480 --> 03:23:34.480]  And of course he let her steal it
[03:23:34.480 --> 03:23:36.480]  And he's a disgraceful person
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:39.480]  And any of his snot-nosed followers that don't admit they were conned
[03:23:39.480 --> 03:23:41.480]  Are aiding and abetting it, James
[03:23:43.480 --> 03:23:46.480]  It's just, it's almost amusing
[03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:48.480]  But the fact that they're both such war hawks
[03:23:48.480 --> 03:23:51.480]  And there's this fake competition between them
[03:23:51.480 --> 03:23:56.480]  I'm glad that people are seeing Hillary as the thief of all this stuff
[03:23:56.480 --> 03:23:57.480]  Exactly, she's so unpopular
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:23:59.480]  I can't believe they're going to install her
[03:23:59.480 --> 03:24:00.480]  Or try to
[03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:02.480]  Have you seen the new AIDS screen looks?
[03:24:02.480 --> 03:24:05.480]  Carl LeCouc extravaganza video on inforwars.com
[03:24:05.480 --> 03:24:09.480]  I have intentionally avoided that
[03:24:09.480 --> 03:24:12.480]  I know it's going to just be over the top
[03:24:12.480 --> 03:24:13.480]  No, no, it is
[03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:15.480]  It is a beautiful work of art
[03:24:15.480 --> 03:24:17.480]  And I want to say this, seriously
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:20.480]  I'm not always gay, but when I am, it's for AIDS Freelicks
[03:24:22.480 --> 03:24:25.480]  Well, you're going to catch AIDS that way, so be careful
[03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:27.480]  I appreciate your call, James
[03:24:27.480 --> 03:24:29.480]  I don't think the real person, it's a joke term
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:31.480]  I didn't create it
[03:24:31.480 --> 03:24:34.480]  But I do want to invite AIDS Freelicks or whatever his name is
[03:24:34.480 --> 03:24:36.480]  And Carl LeCouc
[03:24:36.480 --> 03:24:39.480]  We had Obama phone lady here
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:42.480]  I'm offering AIDS Freelicks and Carl LeCouc
[03:24:42.480 --> 03:24:48.480]  $5,000 each and all expenses paid to Austin
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:50.480]  To come here and be in studio
[03:24:50.480 --> 03:24:52.480]  And I think instead of them running and hiding and being all depressed
[03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:54.480]  As we've been told they are, which I'm sad
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:24:57.480]  They should come in here and let us deprogram them
[03:24:57.480 --> 03:25:00.480]  I'm ready to do it
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:02.480]  I am ready
[03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:04.480]  Because of my man crush
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:06.480]  Okay, that part of the joke is over now
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:07.480]  I don't know, AIDS Freelicks
[03:25:07.480 --> 03:25:10.480]  We play some of the animated video from the background from TV viewers
[03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:13.480]  I'm sorry
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:15.480]  Anthony, admit we've got a crush on AIDS Freelicks
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:17.480]  No, look, let's be honest, all right
[03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:21.480]  These are two really powerful people
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:23.480]  Intellectual giants
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:25.480]  I personally like Carl LeCouc
[03:25:25.480 --> 03:25:27.480]  That's my favorite
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:29.480]  AIDS Freelicks is good, he's great
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:31.480]  Are you kidding me?
[03:25:31.480 --> 03:25:33.480]  His face
[03:25:33.480 --> 03:25:35.480]  He looks like a weird skinny Rachel Maddow
[03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:38.480]  He has such joy in his face
[03:25:38.480 --> 03:25:40.480]  He's like, what?
[03:25:40.480 --> 03:25:43.480]  I would follow him into battle
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:46.480]  I would follow him into battle, man
[03:25:46.480 --> 03:25:49.480]  He's like a brave heart level leader, okay?
[03:25:49.480 --> 03:25:52.480]  He's like William Wallace on steroids
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:54.480]  Look at his face
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:57.480]  It looks just like you
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:00.480]  Whoever did this is great
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:02.480]  I want to...
[03:26:02.480 --> 03:26:03.480]  Oh, my gosh
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:05.480]  The next fat, too
[03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:06.480]  It's perfect
[03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:08.480]  Oh, my God
[03:26:08.480 --> 03:26:11.480]  They're talking about how much they hate western civilization right here
[03:26:11.480 --> 03:26:12.480]  Yeah
[03:26:14.480 --> 03:26:16.480]  Oh, I turned it off, I'm sorry
[03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:18.480]  I would love to have them come here
[03:26:18.480 --> 03:26:19.480]  That would be great
[03:26:19.480 --> 03:26:23.480]  It would be worth every penny of the $5,000 each
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:25.480]  It would just be great
[03:26:25.480 --> 03:26:27.480]  Jason in New York, you're on the year
[03:26:27.480 --> 03:26:28.480]  Sure
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:32.480]  I'm a very, very big fan of the show
[03:26:32.480 --> 03:26:33.480]  Thank you
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:34.480]  You're brilliant
[03:26:34.480 --> 03:26:35.480]  No, I'm not
[03:26:35.480 --> 03:26:36.480]  You're very brilliant
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:39.480]  Yes, you are, the way you handled Carl Rowe, the young Turks
[03:26:39.480 --> 03:26:40.480]  You was brilliant
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:41.480]  Oh, you're nice
[03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:44.480]  You agree with Gwen, the previous caller
[03:26:44.480 --> 03:26:46.480]  You are brilliant and you're very brave
[03:26:46.480 --> 03:26:49.480]  And also, we need to pray for them
[03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:53.480]  Pray for their release from the clutches of evil and sin
[03:26:53.480 --> 03:26:57.480]  Like a mountain full of force that even they can't stop
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:26:59.480]  I've got a question
[03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:02.480]  Are we really that powerless?
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:03.480]  The American people
[03:27:03.480 --> 03:27:07.480]  Are the voices of the American people suddenly of no relevance?
[03:27:07.480 --> 03:27:11.480]  Do you remember the film Howard Beale from Network?
[03:27:11.480 --> 03:27:14.480]  He wanted a million telegrams in the White House
[03:27:14.480 --> 03:27:18.480]  Well, how about a million telegrams to the FBI, to the State Department?
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:19.480]  We can do it
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:21.480]  The listeners can do it
[03:27:21.480 --> 03:27:22.480]  Speak your anger
[03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:25.480]  Well, sure, I think the million telegrams have been sent, figuratively
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:26.480]  I mean, did you see the video?
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:28.480]  It's on InfoWars?
[03:27:28.480 --> 03:27:33.480]  Within a second, less than a second when he hears
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:34.480]  Would you have prosecuted Hillary?
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:40.480]  Eric Holder, the former attorney general, runs like death is at his doorstep
[03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:43.480]  Well, the FBI, I don't know what they're waiting for
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:47.480]  But if they knew they had the full support of the American people
[03:27:47.480 --> 03:27:49.480]  Things may just change
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:53.480]  They might write them letters, they're there, they answer the phones
[03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:58.480]  But are we that out of line to request for clarity, honesty, diligence
[03:27:58.480 --> 03:28:00.480]  On behalf of the U.S.?
[03:28:00.480 --> 03:28:04.480]  We may as well be voting for Prince Abubu, as you mentioned
[03:28:04.480 --> 03:28:05.480]  True
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:08.480]  You're just jealous that I'm getting a million from Prince Abubu
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:10.480]  You're just jealous, Jason, that you're not the one getting it
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:12.480]  Prince Abubu likes me
[03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:15.480]  You're precisely right, that's right
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:17.480]  I'm gonna be somebody now
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:19.480]  The Prince is coming to meet me
[03:28:19.480 --> 03:28:24.480]  And when you speak to Hillary Clinton supporters, don't waste time
[03:28:24.480 --> 03:28:27.480]  All they say is, I don't have to answer your questions
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:30.480]  How dare you make me wrong, I'm a woman
[03:28:30.480 --> 03:28:33.480]  Don't waste time speaking to them, they're like sheep
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:37.480]  They'll wake up eventually, but don't waste time with them
[03:28:37.480 --> 03:28:39.480]  Great point, sir
[03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:41.480]  Sir, go ahead
[03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:43.480]  Stop it, stop it, I love you
[03:28:43.480 --> 03:28:47.480]  Look, look, look, we're just chronicling reality here in our rose-colored darlings
[03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:50.480]  A little bit thinner than some people, some people got a hood over their head
[03:28:50.480 --> 03:28:56.480]  Jason, I know Anthony's gonna take more calls from Gina and Christine and Greg
[03:28:56.480 --> 03:28:58.480]  Or is that Christian? My eyes are blurted in the lines
[03:28:58.480 --> 03:29:02.480]  Rob and others, and he's got a bunch of clips he's gonna get to and a lot more
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:04.480]  What else you got coming up, Anthony?
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:08.480]  I've got a lot of news, I've got some interesting stuff
[03:29:08.480 --> 03:29:12.480]  I mean, Merkel says, oh, there's no way that she's gonna rule out anything
[03:29:12.480 --> 03:29:16.480]  Of the migrant policy that, after the attacks, just let them all in, just continues
[03:29:16.480 --> 03:29:20.480]  You call it migrant, it's not an invasion, your own government's orchestrating
[03:29:20.480 --> 03:29:23.480]  And don't forget, the sales get in today, there'll still be some sales tomorrow
[03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:26.480]  But the big one has to end, so I can't keep offering these prices on some things
[03:29:26.480 --> 03:29:30.480]  40% off storeable food, 40% off rain force, 30% off on a whole bunch of other stuff
[03:29:30.480 --> 03:29:33.480]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com
[03:29:33.480 --> 03:29:35.480]  40% off on all the Patriot apparel here early for prison
[03:29:35.480 --> 03:29:39.480]  Bill Clinton, rape shirt, and the money we make goes into waging war against corruption
[03:29:39.480 --> 03:29:42.480]  Great job to the whole crew, great job to Anthony
[03:29:42.480 --> 03:29:46.480]  30 minutes left in the nightly news tonight with highlights the last 28 hours
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:48.480]  Straight ahead
[03:29:48.480 --> 03:29:50.480]  Thank you, listeners
[03:29:50.480 --> 03:29:51.480]  Thank you
[03:29:51.480 --> 03:29:52.480]  The Empires on the Run
[03:29:52.480 --> 03:29:53.480]  You are the InfoWars
[03:29:53.480 --> 03:30:21.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:30:21.480 --> 03:30:25.480]  Defense attorneys said their clients should have never been indicted
[03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:30.480]  If they had been convicted of the felony charge, each could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison
[03:30:30.480 --> 03:30:37.480]  Prosecutors alleged that the defendants used fake driver's licenses to conceal their identities while dealing with Planned Parenthood
[03:30:37.480 --> 03:30:45.480]  The defendants, who founded a group called Center for Medical Progress, previously rejected plea deals offering them probation
[03:30:45.480 --> 03:30:52.480]  The grand jury initially began investigating Planned Parenthood, but the group was cleared of misusing fetal tissue
[03:30:52.480 --> 03:31:19.480]  To find more reports on Infowars.com
[03:31:19.480 --> 03:31:25.480]  If you want to trigger a menu of Hillary, this is what you wear
[03:31:25.480 --> 03:31:30.480]  And we also have the new Texas style Moan Lombay with the M4

[03:31:52.480 --> 03:31:55.480]  InfowarsLive.com, if you have any questions you can call and order over the phone
[03:31:55.480 --> 03:32:23.480]  AAA-253-3139
[03:32:23.480 --> 03:32:30.480]  We have brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others
[03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:34.480]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[03:32:34.480 --> 03:32:40.480]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects
[03:32:40.480 --> 03:32:44.480]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products
[03:32:44.480 --> 03:32:51.480]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard
[03:32:51.480 --> 03:32:54.480]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure
[03:32:54.480 --> 03:32:57.480]  That's InfowarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion
[03:32:57.480 --> 03:33:23.480]  Take action now before we sell out
[03:33:23.480 --> 03:33:28.480]  I'd say that's some perfectly epic music to bring us into the final frontier here
[03:33:28.480 --> 03:33:34.480]  Of the Infowars Sleeping Giant, Operation Sleeping Giant Marathon
[03:33:34.480 --> 03:33:39.480]  It's been 28 hours, 28 hours of continuous broadcast
[03:33:39.480 --> 03:33:43.480]  Now some people back there, the producers have been here the entire time
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:46.480]  As well as many other people in this building of about 60 people
[03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:50.480]  I'd say a decent percentage stayed 28 hours the entire time
[03:33:50.480 --> 03:33:57.480]  So that's since yesterday the beginning of the show at 11am to now
[03:33:57.480 --> 03:34:00.480]  So it's been a pretty epic ride for me
[03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:05.480]  I slept about three hours last night and came in about seven
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:07.480]  Or woke up about seven to the show
[03:34:07.480 --> 03:34:11.480]  But I will say this, it is an amazing thing to
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:16.480]  Number one, to even look at the emails that come in and see what people are saying about it
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:21.480]  Number two, to think about all the people that are actually just collectively putting their energy into this
[03:34:21.480 --> 03:34:24.480]  Something that's meaningful, something that's profound
[03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:29.480]  Something that is actually going to do something in the world with purpose
[03:34:29.480 --> 03:34:32.480]  As opposed to you think about, it's not necessarily a bad thing
[03:34:32.480 --> 03:34:35.480]  But think about all the people that take their energy
[03:34:35.480 --> 03:34:39.480]  And they put it into something like fantasy football
[03:34:39.480 --> 03:34:43.480]  It doesn't mean you're a terrible person if you're playing fantasy football
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:49.480]  But the people that just sit there and they just freak out about getting the right linebacker or whatever
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:54.480]  Or they go and they watch the sporting events and they just freak out about it
[03:34:54.480 --> 03:34:58.480]  They pump their energy, they yell, I mean I've been at Super Bowl parties
[03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:03.480]  Which I see the most insane things possible
[03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:08.480]  I see people literally taking as much energy as I have to do this entire program
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:13.480]  If I could take the energy that they have screening at the television for their sports team to win
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:17.480]  I could take that amount of energy and do an hour on the show
[03:35:17.480 --> 03:35:22.480]  And I could take that amount of energy and encourage you to do something with actual purpose
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:25.480]  Which is to support something like Operation Sleeping Giant
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:29.480]  I do want to remind you that the specials on InfowarsStore.com
[03:35:29.480 --> 03:35:33.480]  This is part of a super fundraiser, this is the last 30 minutes here
[03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:37.480]  This is it, Operation Sleeping Giant is about to end, there's a countdown on the store
[03:35:37.480 --> 03:35:41.480]  And these are all the specials, we're going to have to pull some of these
[03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:47.480]  We'll try and keep some extended butts, I mean obviously we're selling out of stuff and we can't keep the loss leaders up
[03:35:47.480 --> 03:35:53.480]  So we've got 40% off brain force, 40% off silver bullet which is colloidal silver
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:36:00.480]  20% off all the water filters, 20% off all the air filters, 30% off flagship survival shield X2
[03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:08.480]  30% off supermail vitality, which I feel like we don't even hit on enough, 30% is a very large amount
[03:36:08.480 --> 03:36:15.480]  It sounds routine when you list it like this, but 30% is a significant portion off of products like supermail vitality
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:22.480]  30% off by the mineral fusion, then you've got liver shield, deep cleanse, anthroplex, knockout, survival seeds, DNA force
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:30.480]  It's all on InfowarsStore.com and you've got about less now, about 20 something, 24 minutes
[03:36:30.480 --> 03:36:36.480]  Some change to be a part of this operation and a lot of you already have and I want to thank you
[03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:42.480]  You actually are drastically helping, it's not just pontificating about this up here
[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:45.480]  It's the real deal, I talked about it this morning
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:50.480]  Why not put your energy and a little bit of your funding behind something that actually matters
[03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:53.480]  Something where you know, you've seen the fruits, you've seen what happens
[03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:59.480]  You don't have to agree with everything, right? I don't agree with everything that certain people say
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:02.480]  Or they don't agree with everything I say, it doesn't have to correspond like that
[03:37:02.480 --> 03:37:05.480]  But look at the fruits, look at what's actually happening
[03:37:05.480 --> 03:37:11.480]  Look at the difference between this program, the number one radio internet talk show program
[03:37:11.480 --> 03:37:14.480]  And also one of the biggest top 10 in the United States
[03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:17.480]  Look at what it's doing versus the others
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:21.480]  Look at what it's doing versus when you turn on your television, you flip through the channels
[03:37:21.480 --> 03:37:24.480]  It's doing a lot of good and a lot of difference
[03:37:24.480 --> 03:37:27.480]  Because we're not beholden to these corporations
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:30.480]  We're not going to follow the Rio protocol
[03:37:30.480 --> 03:37:32.480]  Here we have this article
[03:37:32.480 --> 03:37:36.480]  The Olympic Committee wants to ban non-sponsor brands from tweeting about the games
[03:37:36.480 --> 03:37:41.480]  So see, we're not beholden like Coca-Cola to this ridiculousness
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:45.480]  So I want to bring this up, we've talked about this before but it's just so absurd
[03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:49.480]  Brands that haven't paid millions of dollars to the group behind the upcoming Summer Olympics
[03:37:49.480 --> 03:37:52.480]  Will need to watch their step on Twitter in the coming weeks
[03:37:52.480 --> 03:37:56.480]  The International Olympic Committee is threatening legal action against any non-sponsor brands
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:00.480]  That dare to tweet about the games or any of its associated trademarks
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:03.480]  According to a letter obtained by ESPN
[03:38:03.480 --> 03:38:06.480]  Now, Alex talked about this earlier
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:10.480]  I wanted to live tweet something about the Olympics
[03:38:10.480 --> 03:38:14.480]  I think we should put out a tweet on the Alex Jones page
[03:38:14.480 --> 03:38:19.480]  About the Rio 2016 absurd censorship
[03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:23.480]  I mean, threatening to, I don't know, Sue, what are you going to do?
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:26.480]  What are you going to do if we tweet about Rio 2016?
[03:38:26.480 --> 03:38:29.480]  Because, oh, you could say, well, they mean big brands
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:31.480]  What does a brand mean? Doesn't mean anything
[03:38:31.480 --> 03:38:33.480]  I'm a brand, info where's a brand?
[03:38:33.480 --> 03:38:35.480]  This camera I'm using is the type of brand
[03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:37.480]  Everything's a brand, it's absurd
[03:38:37.480 --> 03:38:40.480]  Oh, no brands are allowed to tweet about us
[03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:43.480]  Gee, why do you think they don't want you to tweet about them?
[03:38:43.480 --> 03:38:46.480]  Oh, this is because of endless articles like this
[03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:51.480]  Two Brazilian fighter jets collide during a security exercise for the Olympics
[03:38:51.480 --> 03:38:52.480]  Just over and over again
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:55.480]  We showed earlier the police in fire with a sign saying, do not enter here
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:57.480]  We're not paid enough, you're not safe
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:03.480]  Then today, two Brazilian fighter jets collide off the coast of Rio de Janeiro
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:08.480]  While on a training exercise designed to hone protection for the city's upcoming Olympic Games
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:09.480]  That's safety right there
[03:39:09.480 --> 03:39:13.480]  The Brazilian Navy issued a statement after the collision on Tuesday
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:16.480]  Saying that one of the pilots managed to land his plane safely
[03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:18.480]  But the other crashed into the sea
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:22.480]  A massive search began for the second pilot and continued through the night
[03:39:22.480 --> 03:39:23.480]  And into Wednesday morning
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:25.480]  It's actually sad for the pilot
[03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:27.480]  And then, you know, you had the articles about
[03:39:27.480 --> 03:39:30.480]  There's bodies washing up on the beach and stuff
[03:39:30.480 --> 03:39:34.480]  And why do I belabor the 2016 Olympics, Rio Olympics?
[03:39:34.480 --> 03:39:36.480]  Because, as I mentioned a little bit earlier
[03:39:36.480 --> 03:39:41.480]  It is such a perfect parallel to everything else that's going on
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:45.480]  Where, just like the DNC, it's a total crap show
[03:39:45.480 --> 03:39:49.480]  It's a total, like, they're like hiring actors to fill seats
[03:39:49.480 --> 03:39:52.480]  Because all the Bernie supporters left because they won't buy into Hillary
[03:39:52.480 --> 03:39:54.480]  And then they're just like, it's fine, it's amazing
[03:39:54.480 --> 03:39:56.480]  Look over there, there's smoke and fire
[03:39:56.480 --> 03:39:59.480]  And they're like having sprinklers like, look, there's fireworks
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:02.480]  Everything's like burning down, everyone's running and screaming
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:04.480]  MSNBC is doing live shows
[03:40:04.480 --> 03:40:06.480]  And there's protesters behind
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:09.480]  They're actually real liberals that support Bernie
[03:40:09.480 --> 03:40:12.480]  And they're screaming and saying, no Hillary, it's BS
[03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:14.480]  And they're like, everything's fine, haha
[03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:18.480]  And they like smile and have the representatives just ignore the people
[03:40:18.480 --> 03:40:21.480]  Like it's like peasants riding in the background or something
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:24.480]  So, the Rio 2016 Olympics is kind of like that
[03:40:24.480 --> 03:40:27.480]  It's kind of like how the establishment system
[03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:29.480]  How the establishment bought and paid for politicians
[03:40:29.480 --> 03:40:31.480]  Are always like, everything's great
[03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:33.480]  Like Obama's speech last night
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:36.480]  70% of the country doesn't like the direction of the US
[03:40:36.480 --> 03:40:39.480]  Which I've talked about multiple times
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:41.480]  I like how Trump tweeted it also
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:44.480]  But they don't like the direction of the US
[03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:47.480]  And Obama goes on, he's like, everyone loves this
[03:40:47.480 --> 03:40:50.480]  Everyone agrees that we're going in the right direction
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:54.480]  Millions of people are so happy with what we've done with this country
[03:40:54.480 --> 03:40:57.480]  It's like, no they're not, not at all
[03:40:57.480 --> 03:41:00.480]  Is this the Rio 2016 Olympics?
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:03.480]  Where, number one, they put out the press photos
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:05.480]  They look beautiful, everything's great
[03:41:05.480 --> 03:41:07.480]  Number two, you're not allowed to talk about it
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:10.480]  And then number three, the truth is, it's a gaping flesh wound
[03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:13.480]  But it's okay, everything's fine, don't worry about it
[03:41:13.480 --> 03:41:15.480]  And then you have Turkey
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:18.480]  Turkey orders shut down of over 130 media outlets
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:21.480]  Dismissed 1600 military personnel
[03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:24.480]  So, Turkish authorities ordered the closure of more than
[03:41:24.480 --> 03:41:26.480]  130 media outlets on Wednesday
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:28.480]  Can you imagine that, by the way?
[03:41:28.480 --> 03:41:31.480]  Closing 130 media outlets?
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:34.480]  In a crackdown following July's failed coup
[03:41:34.480 --> 03:41:36.480]  Reuters reported citing CNN Turk
[03:41:36.480 --> 03:41:39.480]  Some 1600 military personnel were also sacked
[03:41:39.480 --> 03:41:41.480]  In the Turkish government's latest move
[03:41:41.480 --> 03:41:44.480]  So, we kind of see similar things with the generals
[03:41:44.480 --> 03:41:47.480]  And everything being announced, but imagine
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:51.480]  Descending into a regime
[03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:55.480]  In which 130 media outlets can be closed down
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:57.480]  And the reason we talk about this
[03:41:57.480 --> 03:42:00.480]  With another article about the United Arab Emirates
[03:42:00.480 --> 03:42:05.480]  Is because it's important to take your mindset
[03:42:05.480 --> 03:42:08.480]  Okay, you're sitting right now, maybe in the car
[03:42:08.480 --> 03:42:11.480]  Or at home, or at work, or whatever
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:13.480]  Chances are, if you're listening in the United States
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:16.480]  Or a developed country, that you might be
[03:42:16.480 --> 03:42:18.480]  In a similar situation than I am
[03:42:18.480 --> 03:42:20.480]  You might be sitting here at this desk
[03:42:20.480 --> 03:42:22.480]  You might be in the cool air conditioning
[03:42:22.480 --> 03:42:24.480]  I've got lights, I've got computer screens
[03:42:24.480 --> 03:42:29.480]  Pretty much a pretty good environment right here, right?
[03:42:29.480 --> 03:42:33.480]  Now, meanwhile, we can't see anything
[03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:35.480]  That's an immediate threat, presumably
[03:42:35.480 --> 03:42:37.480]  There's nothing bad happening here
[03:42:37.480 --> 03:42:39.480]  I could just sit here for a while
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:41.480]  But there's a detachment, because when we're just
[03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:44.480]  Fat and happy, and we can see the TVs in the background
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:46.480]  I can see the news TVs in there
[03:42:46.480 --> 03:42:49.480]  I can see ads for pharmaceutical drugs
[03:42:49.480 --> 03:42:52.480]  Or whatever to make me happy, and Prozac
[03:42:52.480 --> 03:42:54.480]  Whatever it is, I can see all those things
[03:42:54.480 --> 03:42:57.480]  I can see football, I can look up news here
[03:42:57.480 --> 03:42:59.480]  I can look up silly websites
[03:42:59.480 --> 03:43:01.480]  I can go on Reddit all day
[03:43:01.480 --> 03:43:03.480]  And it's hard for me in that state
[03:43:03.480 --> 03:43:06.480]  To actually get in the mindset that
[03:43:06.480 --> 03:43:08.480]  Number one, there's real things that are
[03:43:08.480 --> 03:43:10.480]  Threatened in this world that we need to care about
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:13.480]  And number two, not everyone is in your position
[03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:16.480]  And so the issue here is also
[03:43:16.480 --> 03:43:19.480]  Things like this, if you get caught using a VPN
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:21.480]  In the United Arab Emirates, you will face
[03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:24.480]  Fines with the $545,000
[03:43:24.480 --> 03:43:28.480]  So, Turkey is shutting the media companies down
[03:43:28.480 --> 03:43:30.480]  The United Emirates finding people
[03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:33.480]  I mean, there's no freehams in many of these countries
[03:43:33.480 --> 03:43:35.480]  And then we're sitting here worried about
[03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:37.480]  Getting triggered by Twitter
[03:43:37.480 --> 03:43:39.480]  Also, the producers just reminded me
[03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:41.480]  We do have a boil down of Billy Corgan
[03:43:41.480 --> 03:43:44.480]  From last night, who was on the show
[03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:46.480]  For the Operation Sleeping Giant
[03:43:46.480 --> 03:43:48.480]  And it boiled it down to all of, I guess
[03:43:48.480 --> 03:43:50.480]  The key points, because there was a lot
[03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:52.480]  Of fake stuff, so I want to go ahead
[03:43:52.480 --> 03:43:54.480]  And play that, and then we'll be back
[03:43:54.480 --> 03:43:57.480]  With some more news, so let's give that up
[03:43:57.480 --> 03:43:59.480]  How do you find your inner voice?
[03:43:59.480 --> 03:44:02.480]  How do you understand or really connect
[03:44:02.480 --> 03:44:04.480]  With what that true guidance is
[03:44:04.480 --> 03:44:07.480]  If we haven't even been able to connect
[03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:09.480]  With that inner voice for such a long time
[03:44:09.480 --> 03:44:12.480]  How do you even begin that journey?
[03:44:12.480 --> 03:44:14.480]  Well, that's a really difficult question
[03:44:14.480 --> 03:44:16.480]  Let me take one step back, because
[03:44:16.480 --> 03:44:18.480]  Obviously, the team is going on right now
[03:44:18.480 --> 03:44:20.480]  And they have their own version of this
[03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:22.480]  So this is not a political statement
[03:44:22.480 --> 03:44:24.480]  As much as an observation from the standpoint
[03:44:24.480 --> 03:44:26.480]  Of an entertainer
[03:44:26.480 --> 03:44:29.480]  You've had the DNC now for three days
[03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:31.480]  And you've literally had the three days
[03:44:31.480 --> 03:44:34.480]  Not one mention of the scandal
[03:44:34.480 --> 03:44:36.480]  Let's start from this stage, but obviously
[03:44:36.480 --> 03:44:38.480]  There's a lot going on around the event
[03:44:38.480 --> 03:44:40.480]  But from this stage, you had no mention
[03:44:40.480 --> 03:44:42.480]  Of the WikiLeaks hacking
[03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:45.480]  You've had no mention of Hillary
[03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:48.480]  Being investigated by the
[03:44:48.480 --> 03:44:50.480]  Justice Department, all that
[03:44:50.480 --> 03:44:52.480]  And obviously that was cleared
[03:44:52.480 --> 03:44:54.480]  Controversially
[03:44:54.480 --> 03:44:56.480]  So what I'm trying to say
[03:44:56.480 --> 03:44:58.480]  And the reason I'm bringing this up
[03:44:58.480 --> 03:45:00.480]  And I'm not trying to make a political point is
[03:45:00.480 --> 03:45:02.480]  People are literally sitting in a conference room going
[03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:03.480]  Well, we can't talk about that
[03:45:03.480 --> 03:45:05.480]  And we definitely can't talk about that
[03:45:05.480 --> 03:45:07.480]  And if you're going to bring that up
[03:45:07.480 --> 03:45:09.480]  It's a conscious manipulation
[03:45:09.480 --> 03:45:11.480]  Now, a person who's on that side
[03:45:11.480 --> 03:45:13.480]  Of the political aisle would say
[03:45:13.480 --> 03:45:15.480]  Let's talk about those things
[03:45:15.480 --> 03:45:18.480]  But my point is why wouldn't they talk about those things
[03:45:18.480 --> 03:45:20.480]  Why doesn't Hillary stand up and say
[03:45:20.480 --> 03:45:22.480]  You know, you checked out all my stuff
[03:45:22.480 --> 03:45:24.480]  And you came after me and you found nothing
[03:45:24.480 --> 03:45:26.480]  The point is they don't want to avoid those subjects
[03:45:26.480 --> 03:45:28.480]  Because they want to turn the page
[03:45:28.480 --> 03:45:30.480]  They want to move on to a different psychological profile
[03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:32.480]  That's entertainment
[03:45:32.480 --> 03:45:35.480]  That's nothing to do with the human condition
[03:45:35.480 --> 03:45:37.480]  The natural human response
[03:45:37.480 --> 03:45:39.480]  When you're accused of something
[03:45:39.480 --> 03:45:41.480]  If you believe you're innocent
[03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:43.480]  This is my opinion of what happened
[03:45:43.480 --> 03:45:45.480]  I'm going to tell you the truth
[03:45:45.480 --> 03:45:47.480]  And then I'm going to move forward
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:49.480]  You hear Alex doing all the time in there
[03:45:49.480 --> 03:45:51.480]  Where he's accused of things by other people
[03:45:51.480 --> 03:45:53.480]  He will go into a massive explanation
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:45:55.480]  This is the way I think this is the way I feel
[03:45:55.480 --> 03:45:57.480]  That is the natural human response to accusation
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:45:59.480]  It's not to propagandize and pretend
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:01.480]  Like nothing's going on, that's entertainment
[03:46:01.480 --> 03:46:04.480]  As far as how do you locate your center
[03:46:04.480 --> 03:46:07.480]  As redundant as it sounds
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:10.480]  You must actually look at the world you're living in
[03:46:10.480 --> 03:46:12.480]  And make a correct assumption based on your own
[03:46:12.480 --> 03:46:15.480]  Ideological beliefs, spiritual perspectives
[03:46:15.480 --> 03:46:18.480]  And make a read, like a quarterback on the field
[03:46:18.480 --> 03:46:20.480]  And look and say, these are my people
[03:46:20.480 --> 03:46:22.480]  These are the people I trust
[03:46:22.480 --> 03:46:24.480]  These are the people I don't trust
[03:46:24.480 --> 03:46:26.480]  These are the people I'm going to follow
[03:46:26.480 --> 03:46:28.480]  And one argument I would make
[03:46:28.480 --> 03:46:30.480]  Is that sort of an extension of the idea
[03:46:30.480 --> 03:46:32.480]  Because obviously race and politics
[03:46:32.480 --> 03:46:34.480]  Is a very controversial subject
[03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:36.480]  At this time in our country's history
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:38.480]  As it has been before
[03:46:38.480 --> 03:46:40.480]  I would call it a new tribalism
[03:46:40.480 --> 03:46:44.480]  Where people are going to form into new tribes
[03:46:44.480 --> 03:46:46.480]  Of consciousness and belief systems
[03:46:46.480 --> 03:46:48.480]  And interrelate sort of beyond race
[03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:51.480]  And maybe that's part of our human evolution
[03:46:51.480 --> 03:46:53.480]  Is that we must, you know, what people say
[03:46:53.480 --> 03:46:55.480]  In a very kind of utopian way
[03:46:55.480 --> 03:46:58.480]  We must get beyond people's race, color, creed
[03:46:58.480 --> 03:46:59.480]  And all that stuff
[03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:01.480]  I agree with that as a sort of a natural liberal
[03:47:01.480 --> 03:47:03.480]  But maybe the evolutionary point on that
[03:47:03.480 --> 03:47:05.480]  Is you're going to find like-minded people
[03:47:05.480 --> 03:47:07.480]  Or like-sold people
[03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:09.480]  Who see the world the way you do
[03:47:09.480 --> 03:47:11.480]  So that you can compare notes and say
[03:47:11.480 --> 03:47:13.480]  Yeah, this is the way I feel
[03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:15.480]  And if you said in my introduction
[03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:16.480]  You and I do that sometimes
[03:47:16.480 --> 03:47:18.480]  We will sit and text and talk about
[03:47:18.480 --> 03:47:19.480]  Well, what's your perspective
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:21.480]  And then you give me your perspective
[03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:23.480]  I think that's what you're going to see more and more
[03:47:23.480 --> 03:47:25.480]  And that's where technology can be an aid to us
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:28.480]  Because we can kind of in real time share
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:30.480]  In almost like a different kind of hive mind
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:32.480]  Bigger set of information
[03:47:32.480 --> 03:47:33.480]  And that's where info was
[03:47:33.480 --> 03:47:35.480]  Is very much part of that other tipping point
[03:47:35.480 --> 03:47:37.480]  Bigger hive mind of what are we actually looking at here
[03:47:37.480 --> 03:47:40.480]  When we look at these social, political, spiritual
[03:47:40.480 --> 03:47:42.480]  Religious systems, that's the better word
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:44.480]  They're basically propagandizing
[03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:46.480]  What we're actually looking at
[03:47:46.480 --> 03:47:48.480]  And what we're actually experiencing
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:50.480]  So do you think technology
[03:47:50.480 --> 03:47:52.480]  Obviously it's super important
[03:47:52.480 --> 03:47:55.480]  Because this is how we're able to reach the masses out there
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:47:58.480]  But they control these systems at the moment
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:00.480]  They've got people corralled into these internet ghettos
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:02.480]  And they can shut them down at any time
[03:48:02.480 --> 03:48:04.480]  We've got the internet kill switch
[03:48:04.480 --> 03:48:06.480]  So is the internet, obviously it is
[03:48:06.480 --> 03:48:09.480]  It is a mechanism that is helping
[03:48:09.480 --> 03:48:11.480]  With this global awakening
[03:48:11.480 --> 03:48:13.480]  But is that it?
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:15.480]  Or are humans going to evolve on our own to the point?
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:17.480]  I mean, what do you think?
[03:48:17.480 --> 03:48:19.480]  Are we in this matrix?
[03:48:19.480 --> 03:48:22.480]  Or are we sort of these organic beings
[03:48:22.480 --> 03:48:25.480]  God sort of experiencing itself out here
[03:48:25.480 --> 03:48:29.480]  And kind of a warning to not get trapped inside
[03:48:29.480 --> 03:48:31.480]  Of the internet that they're wanting us to
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:34.480]  Be connected to all the time
[03:48:34.480 --> 03:48:38.480]  Well, taking that into kind of an interesting route
[03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:41.480]  Pete Townsend, in around 1971
[03:48:41.480 --> 03:48:44.480]  Was writing a, or doing a kind of a thing
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:46.480]  Called the Life House Project
[03:48:46.480 --> 03:48:48.480]  With the sort of pre-stage the idea
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:50.480]  Of sort of spiritual communication
[03:48:50.480 --> 03:48:52.480]  Easy to be through technology
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:55.480]  Almost talking about the internet before the internet
[03:48:55.480 --> 03:48:56.480]  And he didn't finish the project
[03:48:56.480 --> 03:48:59.480]  And then many of those songs became famous songs
[03:48:59.480 --> 03:49:02.480]  And won't get fooled again and all this type of stuff
[03:49:02.480 --> 03:49:04.480]  The reason I point this out is
[03:49:04.480 --> 03:49:09.480]  That ultimately from a spiritual and avatar perspective
[03:49:09.480 --> 03:49:12.480]  Communication doesn't need technology
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:15.480]  We can communicate with the stars
[03:49:15.480 --> 03:49:18.480]  Or God within at any given time
[03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:22.480]  We don't need Twitter or Facebook to help us do that
[03:49:22.480 --> 03:49:24.480]  But there is a spiritual component to technology
[03:49:24.480 --> 03:49:27.480]  In the way that people are sharing in real time
[03:49:27.480 --> 03:49:29.480]  And that was of course the great promise
[03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:31.480]  When something like Twitter kicked in
[03:49:31.480 --> 03:49:34.480]  We can all kind of comment and interrelate
[03:49:34.480 --> 03:49:38.480]  And find common ground or common belief
[03:49:38.480 --> 03:49:40.480]  As an event is unfolding
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:44.480]  You saw it during what they called the Arab Spring
[03:49:44.480 --> 03:49:46.480]  Or whatever, there was this sort of idea
[03:49:46.480 --> 03:49:48.480]  In the moment reportage
[03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:50.480]  Where everybody was a citizen journalist
[03:49:50.480 --> 03:49:52.480]  To take some pictures and it all felt very refreshing
[03:49:52.480 --> 03:49:54.480]  But what we see now is
[03:49:54.480 --> 03:49:57.480]  Systems are being used to actually control, neuter
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:00.480]  And shape those thoughts in real time
[03:50:00.480 --> 03:50:03.480]  And I precisely it not only in Info Wars
[03:50:03.480 --> 03:50:06.480]  But other sites where everyone is racing
[03:50:06.480 --> 03:50:09.480]  To shape the narrative before this
[03:50:09.480 --> 03:50:11.480]  Before, in essence, a narrative steps in
[03:50:11.480 --> 03:50:13.480]  And again, from an observational point of view
[03:50:13.480 --> 03:50:17.480]  Why is so much energy being exerted to sell you
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:19.480]  Oh, nothing to see here, move on
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:21.480]  Alright, that's Billy Corgan, a very smart guy
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:24.480]  Very interesting perspective and points
[03:50:24.480 --> 03:50:26.480]  Alright, we'll be right back, I want to remind you
[03:50:26.480 --> 03:50:28.480]  This is this last segment coming up
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:30.480]  Of Info Wars Operation Sleeping Giant
[03:50:30.480 --> 03:50:32.480]  Last chance to support the operation

[03:50:59.480 --> 03:51:02.480]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic
[03:51:02.480 --> 03:51:04.480]  Most basic diseases are caused by
[03:51:04.480 --> 03:51:06.480]  Yeast in the gut and metals in the liver
[03:51:06.480 --> 03:51:08.480]  And we all have a bit of both
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:11.480]  The garlic in Extendivite has a yeast killing effect
[03:51:11.480 --> 03:51:13.480]  In the gut while also helping the sulfur
[03:51:13.480 --> 03:51:15.480]  Enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals
[03:51:15.480 --> 03:51:19.480]  Extendivite just may improve your overall health
[03:51:19.480 --> 03:51:22.480]  Products like Extendivite are the only way
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:24.480]  We're going to get our society healthy
[03:51:24.480 --> 03:51:26.480]  And if you're waiting for the government
[03:51:26.480 --> 03:51:28.480]  In pharmaceutical care to solve your health problems
[03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:31.480]  You're going to have a long disappointing wait
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:32.480]  I think
[03:51:32.480 --> 03:51:34.480]  Extendivite is a complete formula
[03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:36.480]  For extended life in the new millennium
[03:51:36.480 --> 03:51:38.480]  80 can be the new 60
[03:51:38.480 --> 03:51:41.480]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form
[03:51:41.480 --> 03:51:44.480]  For just $69.95 for a two month supply

[03:51:48.480 --> 03:51:52.480]  That's 1-877-928-8822
[03:51:52.480 --> 03:51:54.480]  Or visit heartdrop.com
[03:51:54.480 --> 03:51:59.480]  Extend your life with Extendivite
[03:51:59.480 --> 03:52:02.480]  Honey, I'm really worried about a retirement funds
[03:52:02.480 --> 03:52:03.480]  Oh, me too
[03:52:03.480 --> 03:52:05.480]  We lost so much value in the recession in the stock market
[03:52:05.480 --> 03:52:07.480]  I'm worried we won't have enough to retire
[03:52:07.480 --> 03:52:10.480]  Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:11.480]  With a gold silver group
[03:52:11.480 --> 03:52:13.480]  He said how simple and safe it was
[03:52:13.480 --> 03:52:15.480]  It's a private storage IRA
[03:52:15.480 --> 03:52:17.480]  And we could have real gold and silver in our hands
[03:52:17.480 --> 03:52:20.480]  Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:21.480]  Absolutely
[03:52:21.480 --> 03:52:23.480]  Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA
[03:52:23.480 --> 03:52:25.480]  To help build our retirement income
[03:52:25.480 --> 03:52:27.480]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset
[03:52:27.480 --> 03:52:30.480]  And we would have the security of knowing we're protected
[03:52:30.480 --> 03:52:32.480]  No matter what the economy does
[03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:33.480]  What do you think?
[03:52:33.480 --> 03:52:35.480]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA
[03:52:35.480 --> 03:52:37.480]  We need to call the gold silver group right now
[03:52:37.480 --> 03:52:39.480]  Are you ready to protect your future?

[03:52:45.480 --> 03:52:47.480]  With gold silver group

[03:52:50.480 --> 03:52:53.480]  All transactions are privately delivered and fully insured

[03:52:54.480 --> 03:52:59.480]  800-421-3432
[03:52:59.480 --> 03:53:02.480]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:04.480]  But were waiting for an outrageously low price
[03:53:04.480 --> 03:53:07.480]  You are not going to want to miss this important message
[03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:08.480]  Here's why
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:11.480]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems
[03:53:11.480 --> 03:53:12.480]  And it's getting worse
[03:53:12.480 --> 03:53:13.480]  So please listen
[03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:16.480]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power
[03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:18.480]  And unlike gas generators
[03:53:18.480 --> 03:53:20.480]  Solar generators run silently
[03:53:20.480 --> 03:53:21.480]  Amid no fumes or gases
[03:53:21.480 --> 03:53:23.480]  And produce electricity from the sun
[03:53:23.480 --> 03:53:25.480]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:26.480]  Blackouts
[03:53:26.480 --> 03:53:27.480]  Intensifying civil unrest
[03:53:27.480 --> 03:53:29.480]  You're not going to have to suffer through it
[03:53:29.480 --> 03:53:30.480]  Like the rest of the sheep
[03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:32.480]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:36.480]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge
[03:53:36.480 --> 03:53:37.480]  Solar generators
[03:53:37.480 --> 03:53:40.480]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[03:53:40.480 --> 03:53:41.480]  Of off-the-grid gear
[03:53:41.480 --> 03:53:44.480]  In addition to the low price for M4 Wars listeners
[03:53:44.480 --> 03:53:46.480]  So it's a good time to check it out
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:47.480]  Go to gridwars.com
[03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:49.480]  That's gridwars.com
[03:53:49.480 --> 03:53:52.480]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[03:53:52.480 --> 03:53:53.480]  With minimum money
[03:53:53.480 --> 03:53:54.480]  Go to gridwars.com
[03:53:54.480 --> 03:54:20.480]  You know, you think about the idea of treating your brain like your stomach
[03:54:20.480 --> 03:54:26.480]  And ideally, unless you really just don't care about your body
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:28.480]  And maybe you don't care about your brain
[03:54:28.480 --> 03:54:31.480]  You want to have content that is nourishing
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:33.480]  It's like fruits and vegetables, right?
[03:54:33.480 --> 03:54:34.480]  Like real actually good stuff
[03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:36.480]  Like a smoothie or something
[03:54:36.480 --> 03:54:38.480]  Mixed in with some junk every now and then
[03:54:38.480 --> 03:54:40.480]  You know, every now and then you're going to eat a bag of chips
[03:54:40.480 --> 03:54:44.480]  Every now and then you're going to drink some soda or whatever
[03:54:44.480 --> 03:54:48.480]  But ideally, a good part of your diet should be healthy, right?
[03:54:48.480 --> 03:54:51.480]  That's the same with your mental consumption
[03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:57.480]  So consider that you're actually making a good mental diet choice
[03:54:57.480 --> 03:55:00.480]  When you have consumption like listening to this program
[03:55:00.480 --> 03:55:02.480]  When you have consumption like going on the internet
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:05.480]  And actually going to good websites
[03:55:05.480 --> 03:55:08.480]  As opposed to some silly stuff which is always fine
[03:55:08.480 --> 03:55:13.480]  But you want to try and have a plate of healthy consumption and content
[03:55:13.480 --> 03:55:14.480]  Every single day
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:15.480]  That's what I try and do
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:17.480]  And that's kind of the whole point
[03:55:17.480 --> 03:55:20.480]  You know, today is, as I mentioned, the conclusion
[03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:22.480]  This segment, this is the final segment
[03:55:22.480 --> 03:55:27.480]  Of the Operation Sleeping Giant 28-hour broadcast
[03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:31.480]  And I'm actually really honored to be able to be a part of it
[03:55:31.480 --> 03:55:34.480]  And I'm happy that I was asked to be on the last hour
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:37.480]  And last segment of this entire 28-hour conclusion
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:42.480]  Think about all of the people that are listening right now
[03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:44.480]  And listening to 28 hours including yourself
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:46.480]  I mean just millions and millions of people
[03:55:46.480 --> 03:55:48.480]  That helped just spread the links
[03:55:48.480 --> 03:55:51.480]  Just pray, whatever it is that they did
[03:55:51.480 --> 03:55:53.480]  Even the smallest little things, leave a comment, right?
[03:55:53.480 --> 03:55:56.480]  Or they financially supported it on infowarstore.com
[03:55:56.480 --> 03:55:58.480]  Whatever it is, it's meaningful, it's powerful
[03:55:58.480 --> 03:56:00.480]  There's a lot of energy behind it
[03:56:00.480 --> 03:56:02.480]  And that is a movement, that is a real movement
[03:56:02.480 --> 03:56:05.480]  And notice, it's kind of like building a building
[03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:07.480]  So you think about the establishment
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:10.480]  Like you have the establishment building
[03:56:10.480 --> 03:56:14.480]  Which is run by Hillary Clinton Realtor, Incorporated, right?
[03:56:14.480 --> 03:56:18.480]  It's like this massive, monolithic, huge building
[03:56:18.480 --> 03:56:21.480]  Something you'd see out of one of the Judge Dredd movies
[03:56:21.480 --> 03:56:24.480]  Or something, it's just huge, it's just all busted up
[03:56:24.480 --> 03:56:28.480]  And there's colonies inside and it's crazy
[03:56:28.480 --> 03:56:30.480]  And here we are, we're building this building
[03:56:30.480 --> 03:56:32.480]  We're this independent architecture firm
[03:56:32.480 --> 03:56:35.480]  And we've got all these people, these community volunteers
[03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:39.480]  Because we can't hire the crazy establishment people
[03:56:39.480 --> 03:56:41.480]  They have to build their robot towers
[03:56:41.480 --> 03:56:44.480]  But we're building from the foundation, we've got cement down there
[03:56:44.480 --> 03:56:46.480]  And now we're a pretty sizable tower
[03:56:46.480 --> 03:56:48.480]  I mean, it's a pretty sizable tower
[03:56:48.480 --> 03:56:50.480]  And we've got the nice looking tower
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:53.480]  Like gardens outside and we've got people moving in
[03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:56.480]  And offices and stuff, like it's a pretty sizable tower
[03:56:56.480 --> 03:56:58.480]  You look up at the establishment tower
[03:56:58.480 --> 03:57:02.480]  And they look at your tower and they're like, how did you build that?
[03:57:02.480 --> 03:57:05.480]  That's because when you build something independent of the system
[03:57:05.480 --> 03:57:09.480]  That is the power, it's grassroots, it's because of you
[03:57:09.480 --> 03:57:13.480]  All of this is nothing without you
[03:57:13.480 --> 03:57:17.480]  All of it is nothing, it is you contributing
[03:57:17.480 --> 03:57:20.480]  In the most tiny and massive ways
[03:57:20.480 --> 03:57:25.480]  All of the energy contributed to this is what gives it the power to go on
[03:57:25.480 --> 03:57:30.480]  It's like a car with fuel just plowing down the highway at full speed
[03:57:30.480 --> 03:57:32.480]  And that's what this is
[03:57:32.480 --> 03:57:35.480]  It's been, it's been a long 28 hours
[03:57:35.480 --> 03:57:39.480]  If you're just tuning in now, it's been a long 28 hours
[03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:42.480]  Like I said, a lot of people back there haven't even slept
[03:57:42.480 --> 03:57:47.480]  And you know, this article, Merkel rules out migrant policy reversal after attacks
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:51.480]  And she's talking about they're going to still let in as many migrants and refugees as they want
[03:57:51.480 --> 03:57:55.480]  Despite all the attacks and everything from ISIS related groups
[03:57:55.480 --> 03:57:59.480]  It's funny because it reminds me of how, guess what, this program
[03:57:59.480 --> 03:58:02.480]  We're going to talk about what's actually going on
[03:58:02.480 --> 03:58:03.480]  We're going to talk about how we see it
[03:58:03.480 --> 03:58:07.480]  We're going to talk about the fact that a lot of these are linked up with ISIS
[03:58:07.480 --> 03:58:09.480]  And we're not going to be afraid of political correctness
[03:58:09.480 --> 03:58:12.480]  We're not going to be afraid of the attacks and craziness
[03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:14.480]  Anyway, just want to mention that
[03:58:14.480 --> 03:58:17.480]  This is it, this is the conclusion of Operation Sleeping Giant
[03:58:17.480 --> 03:58:19.480]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, thank you for tuning in
[03:58:19.480 --> 03:58:20.480]  Thank you for being a part of it

[03:58:31.480 --> 03:58:33.480]  God bless
