[00:06.700 --> 00:13.500]  A nationwide average for self-serve regular up almost a nickel, and that was overnight, now averaging 387 a gallon.
[00:13.500 --> 00:20.000]  With these daily jumps, it'll be no surprise if it hits 390 a gallon this Memorial Day weekend, according to analysts.

[00:29.900 --> 00:38.000]  McCain turned 72 in August. His internist describes his patient as conservatively younger than his chronicle age, based on his cardiovascular fitness.

[00:53.000 --> 01:01.100]  Your lawn is for singing and laughing, and pitching and catching, not stinging and biting, and itching and scratching.

[01:45.700 --> 01:50.300]  The new Subway Big Philly Cheese Steak, juicy steak and melted cheese on freshly baked bread.
[01:50.300 --> 01:53.600]  Subway, eat fresh.
[01:53.600 --> 01:58.800]  Firefighters in Central California say heavy brush and timber and winds gusting up to 50 miles an hour
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.900]  are proving a pretty good recipe for fire.
[02:00.900 --> 02:03.100]  Nearly 1,500 homes evacuated.
[02:03.100 --> 02:07.100]  Governor Schwarzenegger declaring a state of emergency for Santa Cruz County.
[02:07.100 --> 02:11.600]  A rare tornado also touched down yesterday afternoon in Riverside, California.
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.600]  Colorado Governor Bill Ritter has declared a state of emergency after a string of tornadoes cut a path through the state's Weld County.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.100]  Relief from the federal government should be on its way.
[02:20.100 --> 02:26.400]  I talked to the National Director of FEMA as well as the Director of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff.
[02:26.400 --> 02:32.100]  They actually were calling me to say they would offer whatever federal assistance was appropriate under the circumstances.
[02:32.100 --> 02:37.600]  Child welfare officials in Texas are deciding whether to appeal a court decision that pulls the rug out from under a decision
[02:37.600 --> 02:44.600]  to remove hundreds of children from a polygamous sec. The State Appeals Court yesterday said the state failed to show the youngsters were in any danger.
[02:44.600 --> 02:48.600]  Over 440 children were taken from the ranch during a raid last month.

[03:08.100 --> 03:11.100]  I can buy three and get the fourth tire free.
[03:11.100 --> 03:12.600]  But what if I only want one?

[03:23.600 --> 03:30.100]  Republicans have made a shift on the controversial terrorism surveillance rules, correspondent Mike Rossi explains.
[03:30.100 --> 03:35.600]  The proposal would allow telecom lawsuits to go before the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court.
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.100]  The White House is going along with the proposal after arguing for full immunity for telecommunications companies
[03:41.100 --> 03:45.600]  being sued for allegedly allowing domestic government eavesdropping for nearly six years.
[03:45.600 --> 03:49.600]  The presidents of China and Russia have condemned a U.S. plan for a global...

[03:59.100 --> 04:04.100]  The two countries forming closer ties to counterbalance Washington's global dominance.
[04:04.100 --> 04:09.600]  Israel's Prime Minister Ahud Olmert has been interrogated by police for a second time in a corruption probe.
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.100]  The allegations and questioning are threatening the prime minister's political career
[04:13.100 --> 04:17.100]  along with his government's peace efforts towards Syria and the Palestinians.
[04:17.100 --> 04:18.600]  No charges have been filed.
[04:18.600 --> 04:21.600]  Authorities are looking into the possibility Olmert may have taken bribes,
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.600]  violated campaign funding laws and laundered money.
[04:24.600 --> 04:31.100]  It's called Click It or Ticket, a nationwide law enforcement effort with zero tolerance for folks who aren't wearing their seatbelts.

[06:33.100 --> 06:43.100]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[06:43.100 --> 06:45.100]  I did radio six days a week.
[06:45.100 --> 06:49.100]  So much happening and I always come in on Sunday evenings from 4 to 6 p.m.
[06:49.100 --> 06:51.100]  Central Standard Time.
[06:51.100 --> 06:53.100]  That's 5 to 7 p.m. Eastern.
[06:53.100 --> 07:00.100]  Thank you for tuning in to this worldwide broadcast against tyranny in another attempt to try to wake up
[07:00.100 --> 07:04.100]  the fellow men and women to what's happening in the world.
[07:04.100 --> 07:08.100]  It, of course, is the 25th of May, 2008.
[07:08.100 --> 07:10.100]  Tomorrow is Memorial Day.
[07:10.100 --> 07:17.100]  And I do have some news concerning the war, our troops, the unofficial draft that is going on.
[07:17.100 --> 07:22.100]  But first, let me just go over some of the news that I'm going to be covering today.
[07:22.100 --> 07:30.100]  China had another aftershock that made another 70,000 houses collapse and a whole bunch of deaths.
[07:30.100 --> 07:37.100]  Well, past 50 plus thousand dead just from what happened two weeks ago.
[07:37.100 --> 07:43.100]  We've also got Hillary Clinton apologizing for saying, hey, you want me to stay in the race.
[07:43.100 --> 07:46.100]  Somebody might basically kill Barack Obama.
[07:46.100 --> 07:54.100]  That's a Clinton threat right there, if there ever was one, and that's what you would expect out of this mafia organization.
[07:54.100 --> 07:57.100]  Does that mean I'm saying Barack Obama's good?
[07:57.100 --> 08:04.100]  No, gangsters fight with each other and they're bought and paid for by the very same interest.
[08:04.100 --> 08:06.100]  So we'll be going over that.
[08:06.100 --> 08:10.100]  Also, the Bilderberg group, they really do govern our world.
[08:10.100 --> 08:14.100]  If any one group has the greatest control, it's them.
[08:14.100 --> 08:16.100]  I would say they steer our world.
[08:16.100 --> 08:23.100]  They don't have total governance government yet, but they're getting close to global governance, as they call it.
[08:23.100 --> 08:28.100]  And they've published many things talking about how they're doing and how they're setting it up.
[08:28.100 --> 08:32.100]  These are the families that own the private central banks that print the money and issue liquidity.
[08:32.100 --> 08:35.100]  So see, that's why they're able to buy up the world.
[08:35.100 --> 08:42.100]  They're very upset because we have learned and confirmed their meeting coming up on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th in Chantilly, Virginia.
[08:42.100 --> 08:53.100]  I'll be in Virginia covering it, and we'll let you know what we've learned so far from our moles inside Bilderberg coming up today as well.
[08:53.100 --> 09:00.100]  The New York Times normally has an editor there, so does the Washington Post, but they then write articles saying it doesn't exist,
[09:00.100 --> 09:04.100]  even though other mainstream media for about eight years have been admitting it exists.
[09:04.100 --> 09:11.100]  Alternative media has been covering it for 40-plus years, been covering it in person for 35, Jim Tucker and others have.
[09:11.100 --> 09:13.100]  So just another example of the media's deception.
[09:13.100 --> 09:16.100]  They go to the event and then say it doesn't exist.
[09:16.100 --> 09:18.100]  Just amazing.
[09:18.100 --> 09:24.100]  Squawk Box on MSNBC reporting $12 to $15 a gallon gas is what they predict.
[09:24.100 --> 09:29.100]  We have another report here, oil per barrel, well above $135 per barrel.
[09:29.100 --> 09:32.100]  Giving an idea, five years ago it was $40 a barrel.
[09:32.100 --> 09:34.100]  That was considered high.
[09:34.100 --> 09:42.100]  Also, we'll get into how long it could be until we see $200 a barrel oil.
[09:42.100 --> 09:45.100]  You know what frustrates me the most?
[09:45.100 --> 09:53.100]  I scan through the financial shows and I read probably 10 different financial publications a day, scan through them, some days more.
[09:53.100 --> 10:04.100]  And I interview Nobel Prize winners in the head of the New York Business School and I interview the head of things like shadow stats and congressmen and others,
[10:04.100 --> 10:08.100]  people that are on the House and Senate Banking Committee, senators and House members.
[10:08.100 --> 10:12.100]  And they all know what's going on, but you never see them in the news.
[10:12.100 --> 10:14.100]  I mean, never, never.
[10:14.100 --> 10:21.100]  I have probably in the 10 times in the last five years heard the media tell the truth.
[10:21.100 --> 10:23.100]  And that sounds like a lot, but it's not.
[10:23.100 --> 10:29.100]  I mean, I hear 50 reports or see 50 plus 60 reports a day about oil going up the last five years.
[10:29.100 --> 10:32.100]  And so I've seen thousands and it's probably less than 10.
[10:32.100 --> 10:39.100]  The first time I ever heard the truth said, and of course I already knew it, interviewed experts and understood it, was John Stossel,
[10:39.100 --> 10:43.100]  the station I'm broadcasting out of, syndicated across the country out of.
[10:43.100 --> 10:48.100]  News Radio 590KLBJ, used to air on Sunday nights, John Stossel specials.
[10:48.100 --> 10:55.100]  And people were griping about $1.50 a gallon, $1.60 a gallon gas.
[10:55.100 --> 10:58.100]  And he went and said, look, we got 5% inflation.
[10:58.100 --> 11:04.100]  And so of course, you know, we're up 20% in the last four years because of inflation.
[11:04.100 --> 11:06.100]  5% a year.
[11:06.100 --> 11:08.100]  Now that was back then we had dollar erosion.
[11:08.100 --> 11:10.100]  This is five years later.
[11:10.100 --> 11:12.100]  And I mean, I never hear anyone.
[11:12.100 --> 11:18.100]  This week there was an MSNBC piece, it's the same one, headline, Squawk Box,
[11:18.100 --> 11:22.100]  guess warns of $12 to $15 a gallon gas.
[11:22.100 --> 11:31.100]  And they admitted, just for a second, they said, well, the inflation is the main cause of this.
[11:31.100 --> 11:36.100]  Then they went into blaming the oil companies and Congress saying they were all behind it and this grandstanding.
[11:36.100 --> 11:39.100]  Congress knows, every major economist knows.
[11:39.100 --> 11:43.100]  These talk show hosts, you hear what shows about mutual funds and investments.
[11:43.100 --> 11:50.100]  They all know, but they don't want to tell you because I guess they want the dog and pony show to continue forever.
[11:50.100 --> 11:55.100]  I mean, I'm tied into this fiat system too, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
[11:55.100 --> 12:03.100]  I mean, we can't just blindly, basically, you know, cover our eyes and jump off the cliff here.
[12:03.100 --> 12:06.100]  There's still a jagged rocks at the bottom here.
[12:06.100 --> 12:09.100]  Let me explain something to everybody.
[12:09.100 --> 12:21.100]  The Federal Reserve said we had a 2.3% inflation in 2007 when every other private institution had it between 15 and 13 points.
[12:21.100 --> 12:23.100]  Let's just say 13 points.
[12:23.100 --> 12:25.100]  Let's go conservative.
[12:25.100 --> 12:30.100]  And they're saying less than 3%, the private Federal Reserve is in Congress before the House Banking Committee.
[12:30.100 --> 12:32.100]  We've played those clips here.
[12:32.100 --> 12:37.100]  I mean, this is very insulting to the public, very insulting to everyone's intelligence.
[12:37.100 --> 12:40.100]  But obviously, I don't hear yuppies and know-it-alls.
[12:40.100 --> 12:44.100]  There are people on talk radio putting out the truth, so they must believe it.
[12:44.100 --> 12:46.100]  And it's upsetting to me.
[12:46.100 --> 12:48.100]  I mean, I look at full-grown adults.
[12:48.100 --> 12:49.100]  They're simple-minded.
[12:49.100 --> 12:50.100]  They're smiley-faced.
[12:50.100 --> 12:51.100]  They're happy.
[12:51.100 --> 12:52.100]  They're not bad people.
[12:52.100 --> 12:56.100]  They mean well, but they have the minds of children.
[12:56.100 --> 13:01.100]  And I don't know how the people in the third world know what currency devaluation is,
[13:01.100 --> 13:03.100]  but we can't understand it here.
[13:03.100 --> 13:05.100]  Well, I know the answer.
[13:05.100 --> 13:09.100]  It's probably because this has never happened in the United States.
[13:09.100 --> 13:17.100]  From the 1780s right through to 1900, a dollar was worth a dollar.
[13:17.100 --> 13:21.100]  And then the private bank started taking over the issuance and control of currency.
[13:21.100 --> 13:27.100]  And then now a dollar is worth less than a penny to what it was in 1913.
[13:27.100 --> 13:33.100]  Now, that penny value, that's now what's being devalued down to nothing.
[13:33.100 --> 13:37.100]  And so, the oil is denominated in dollars.
[13:37.100 --> 13:42.100]  And OPEC keeps saying, if you read the foreign papers and actual OPEC statements, they're going,
[13:42.100 --> 13:46.100]  look, we make a small profit, about 20%.
[13:46.100 --> 13:47.100]  The old companies split it.
[13:47.100 --> 13:48.100]  They get about 9%.
[13:48.100 --> 13:53.100]  It's still, they buy up refineries and shut them down to create artificial scarcity and bottlenecks.
[13:53.100 --> 13:56.100]  And they do engage in oligopolies and some manipulation.
[13:56.100 --> 14:05.100]  But that's not the main reason you're paying $4.01 an average as of today.
[14:05.100 --> 14:08.100]  Some areas, $5.50 in California and in other areas.
[14:08.100 --> 14:12.100]  You know, it's like $3.95 in Texas because we got refineries here.
[14:12.100 --> 14:24.100]  The main reason is because the dollar has been devalued by 68% against the euro since it opened.
[14:24.100 --> 14:26.100]  68%.
[14:26.100 --> 14:32.100]  Now, that was already a dollar that had been devalued down to three cents on the dollar in 1913.
[14:32.100 --> 14:34.100]  You're going, wait a minute, you just said one cent.
[14:34.100 --> 14:40.100]  If you go back five and a half, six years ago, when the euro hit parity with the dollar, 50-50,
[14:40.100 --> 14:44.100]  it opened two years before that at 83, 83 cents to the dollar.
[14:44.100 --> 14:50.100]  And you've got different ways of calculating it.
[14:50.100 --> 14:58.100]  If you look at this, what's happened is we have a devalued dollar.
[14:58.100 --> 15:01.100]  And so that's why you're paying more for gas.
[15:01.100 --> 15:05.100]  And I'm very angry about the fact that I know the globalists hate us.
[15:05.100 --> 15:08.100]  I know they're dismantling the country, breaking up the family, doubling,
[15:08.100 --> 15:14.100]  tripling the police, building prisons everywhere, running warrantless checkpoints where they take blood samples now.
[15:14.100 --> 15:20.100]  You understand they've got lawless government, but to see them destroy the dollar.
[15:20.100 --> 15:26.100]  Because now it's gone from three cents five years ago to what it was, about one cent or less,
[15:26.100 --> 15:28.100]  what it was worth in 1913.
[15:28.100 --> 15:30.100]  And now that little bit is disappearing.
[15:30.100 --> 15:34.100]  I mean, all your bank accounts, all your investments, it's all being robbed.
[15:34.100 --> 15:38.100]  So when you see your stock market up, it's inflated.
[15:38.100 --> 15:42.100]  It's like a donut filled with air.
[15:42.100 --> 15:44.100]  It's not really 12,000. It's more like 4,000.
[15:44.100 --> 15:46.100]  We'll be right back.
[15:54.100 --> 15:58.100]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[15:58.100 --> 16:03.100]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powers of world government.
[16:03.100 --> 16:05.100]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[16:05.100 --> 16:08.100]  Could their objective be world domination?
[16:08.100 --> 16:11.100]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[16:11.100 --> 16:14.100]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[16:14.100 --> 16:22.100]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[16:22.100 --> 16:27.100]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[16:27.100 --> 16:31.100]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[16:31.100 --> 16:34.100]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward the world government.
[16:34.100 --> 16:36.100]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[16:36.100 --> 16:38.100]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[16:47.100 --> 16:52.100]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[16:52.100 --> 16:56.100]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[16:56.100 --> 17:01.100]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[17:01.100 --> 17:09.100]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[17:09.100 --> 17:15.100]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[17:15.100 --> 17:19.100]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[17:19.100 --> 17:24.100]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[17:24.100 --> 17:27.100]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude
[17:27.100 --> 17:30.100]  could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[17:30.100 --> 17:34.100]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[17:34.100 --> 17:40.100]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[17:40.100 --> 17:45.100]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[17:45.100 --> 17:51.100]  Call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[17:53.100 --> 17:57.100]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913,
[17:57.100 --> 18:02.100]  all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[18:02.100 --> 18:06.100]  With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[18:06.100 --> 18:11.100]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[18:11.100 --> 18:15.100]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program
[18:15.100 --> 18:19.100]  to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit,
[18:19.100 --> 18:22.100]  and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[18:22.100 --> 18:26.100]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[18:26.100 --> 18:28.100]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[18:28.100 --> 18:31.100]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief
[18:31.100 --> 18:33.100]  because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[18:33.100 --> 18:38.100]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[19:55.100 --> 20:01.100]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to heart-hitting talk radio.
[20:01.100 --> 20:15.100]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones.
[20:15.100 --> 20:22.100]  If you want to find yourself on the front lines of the Info War and find out what's really going on in the world,
[20:22.100 --> 20:32.100]  and what the powerful architects of world government are doing to you right now, what they have stored for you in the future,
[20:32.100 --> 20:37.100]  make sure and visit infowars.com and prismplanet.com daily.
[20:37.100 --> 20:43.100]  I don't normally even throw out a topic. I cover a bunch of news and then I just go to your calls.
[20:43.100 --> 20:47.100]  Consequently, we don't screen your calls. The calls are all over the map.
[20:47.100 --> 20:55.100]  But I would ask listeners, I would ask people whether they're listening in Austin, Texas, or New York, or Florida, California,
[20:55.100 --> 20:59.100]  we have stations all over the country, Kansas City right now, Chicago.
[21:02.100 --> 21:13.100]  Last year, 2007, we had about 13% compounded every single year, 13%.
[21:13.100 --> 21:17.100]  And the year before, that was about 10% and about 9% and about 4%, 5%.
[21:17.100 --> 21:20.100]  I mean, you can debate all day in the past years.
[21:20.100 --> 21:30.100]  But if you look at the different brokerage houses and different banks and different groups that crunch and give us a real CPI or real inflation,
[21:30.100 --> 21:42.100]  we're talking about in the last five years, the average person on a fixed income has had their income cut in half in real purchasing power.
[21:42.100 --> 21:46.100]  And I can try to make this all technical, but there's really no point.
[21:46.100 --> 21:54.100]  The government, though, says that inflation is at now, they were saying 2% last year.
[21:54.100 --> 21:58.100]  Now they're saying 3%, 4% this year, depending on which agency.
[21:58.100 --> 22:03.100]  But the Federal Reserve, the private bank is saying 3% and some change.
[22:03.100 --> 22:06.100]  So I'm asking you, do you believe the government?
[22:06.100 --> 22:07.100]  I mean, is this the fault?
[22:07.100 --> 22:09.100]  Let's go ahead and act like the mainstream media.
[22:09.100 --> 22:12.100]  Let's not talk about reality and real inflation.
[22:12.100 --> 22:14.100]  Let's just say, do you feel like there's inflation?
[22:14.100 --> 22:17.100]  That's how we've been trained to be.
[22:17.100 --> 22:39.100]  Total free number to join us, 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, because I have people that send me emails and say, you're just anti-government, you just don't like George Bush, you're a dirty Democrat, you're criticizing the economy, the economy's great,
[22:39.100 --> 22:44.100]  we don't have a recession and the dollar's not devalued and there's no inflation.
[22:44.100 --> 22:48.100]  And then I had time I'd write back and say, but I'm not anti-gun.
[22:48.100 --> 22:50.100]  I'm not pro-open border.
[22:50.100 --> 22:52.100]  I'm not calling for world government.
[22:52.100 --> 22:54.100]  I don't believe there's any difference between the two parties.
[22:54.100 --> 22:56.100]  You know, I'm into real issues.
[22:56.100 --> 23:03.100]  You're caught in a left-right debate, which has meant to neutralize you and tie you up in knots while the real world moves on.
[23:03.100 --> 23:06.100]  And they just answer back, shut up communist.
[23:06.100 --> 23:14.100]  And so a lot of people have bought into the torture, the war, the lies, the police state, the fraud.
[23:14.100 --> 23:19.100]  And you're along for the ride now and you're just going to deny and rationalize no matter what you're told.
[23:19.100 --> 23:22.100]  They tell you the NSA spies on all Americans, no warrants.
[23:22.100 --> 23:27.100]  They tell you the police are going to take your blood, no warrant on the side of the highway now at giant checkpoints.
[23:27.100 --> 23:28.100]  You say amen.
[23:28.100 --> 23:30.100]  That's land of the free, home of the brave.
[23:30.100 --> 23:34.100]  They tell you that your gas is going to cost six bucks a gallon.
[23:34.100 --> 23:36.100]  You're going to say that's not inflation.
[23:36.100 --> 23:39.100]  You're living in denial.
[23:39.100 --> 23:42.100]  Now, I know that's a minority of people that are living in denial.
[23:42.100 --> 23:47.100]  Most people have finally woken up and a lot of people have realized that I've been telling you the truth all along.
[23:47.100 --> 23:51.100]  I mean, I wish the things I talk about weren't coming true.
[23:51.100 --> 24:03.100]  I read federal documents 12 years ago that said they would introduce it to the public at salons and at gyms and at government institutions.
[24:03.100 --> 24:07.100]  And at schools and thumb scanning biometrics.
[24:07.100 --> 24:09.100]  They give grants to businesses to put it in.
[24:09.100 --> 24:21.100]  They were getting us ready for a casual society so they can track and trace and taxes and control us and face scanning cameras and license plate reading cameras and Pentagon designed grid.
[24:21.100 --> 24:28.100]  They say to control us saying we're an enemy that the military works for foreign banking institutions.
[24:28.100 --> 24:34.100]  I mean, the head of the Naval War College says this on C-SPAN that the military works for the global government.
[24:34.100 --> 24:39.100]  Kind of like it's now black water worldwide.
[24:39.100 --> 24:45.100]  They're now worldwide or Dick Cheney's bought a house in Dubai.
[24:45.100 --> 24:46.100]  Halliburton's moved to Dubai.
[24:46.100 --> 24:49.100]  They're all offshore.
[24:49.100 --> 24:53.100]  You see, but then if you say, hey, they don't deserve no bid contracts.
[24:53.100 --> 24:54.100]  They say, shut up.
[24:54.100 --> 24:55.100]  We're not giving them to the French.
[24:55.100 --> 24:57.100]  They play a mind trick.
[24:57.100 --> 25:00.100]  Foreigners were never allowed to get the no bid contracts.
[25:00.100 --> 25:03.100]  That was other American companies that weren't allowed bids.
[25:03.100 --> 25:09.100]  But then they played a trick on the radio and TV knowing it would trick mainland conservatives and said, well, the French don't deserve those contracts.
[25:09.100 --> 25:11.100]  See, I mean, that's just one trick of thousands.
[25:11.100 --> 25:13.100]  I know almost all their tricks.
[25:13.100 --> 25:16.100]  And I mean, I've got people watching on TV.
[25:16.100 --> 25:18.100]  Here's a hundred plus articles.
[25:18.100 --> 25:19.100]  I counted them.
[25:19.100 --> 25:20.100]  Never be able to cover them.
[25:20.100 --> 25:23.100]  Here's another stack.
[25:23.100 --> 25:25.100]  There's no way to.
[25:25.100 --> 25:31.100]  I mean, I've got the statesman here about all this baloney about global warming and how it's all over.
[25:31.100 --> 25:37.100]  We've got to have global taxes and Barack Obama says the government's got to control how much food we can eat.
[25:37.100 --> 25:41.100]  And I mean, we're going into feudalism and their own documents admit it's an olive fraud.
[25:41.100 --> 25:44.100]  Club of Rome CFR documents ran corporation.
[25:44.100 --> 25:46.100]  They're all on info wars dot com.
[25:46.100 --> 25:52.100]  But you know, the general public doesn't know they're just going to believe the cover of the statesman.
[25:52.100 --> 25:58.100]  On this Sunday here in Austin, Texas.
[25:58.100 --> 26:02.100]  And bottom line, I can't even articulate all the fraud lies to you.
[26:02.100 --> 26:04.100]  The government's gone so bad.
[26:04.100 --> 26:05.100]  So corrupt.
[26:05.100 --> 26:07.100]  It's simple.
[26:07.100 --> 26:15.100]  Foreign interest came in, bought up our government, used big think tanks and big policy wonks to fund and finance their own candidates.
[26:15.100 --> 26:16.100]  They took over our system.
[26:16.100 --> 26:22.100]  They've used the U.S. as an engine militarily to take over the planet and hand those interest over to private corporate interest.
[26:22.100 --> 26:24.100]  Now they have run out all our credit.
[26:24.100 --> 26:26.100]  They've gotten to buy up real assets with it.
[26:26.100 --> 26:30.100]  They destroyed our currency and they know we're going to find out about it.
[26:30.100 --> 26:41.100]  So you hear a local newscast, you know, that says, hey, the Texas Department of Public Safety state where I live, boy, they're not ready for terrorism.
[26:41.100 --> 26:45.100]  They need to, you know, get beefed up and hire more officers and fight terror.
[26:45.100 --> 26:51.100]  When you hear terrorism, that means someone not giving up their farm or ranch as they're being repossessed.
[26:51.100 --> 26:53.100]  That means people protesting.
[26:53.100 --> 27:01.100]  That means DPS intelligence who got caught in the 60s and 70s with files with hundreds of thousands of Texans in it being surveilled illegally.
[27:01.100 --> 27:03.100]  They're all back doing that again.
[27:03.100 --> 27:06.100]  That means we're the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:06.100 --> 27:10.100]  There's no real al-Qaeda, al-CIAida terrorist.
[27:10.100 --> 27:12.100]  Okay, that's not even real.
[27:12.100 --> 27:22.100]  So when you hear a newscast about, oh, the DPS needs more funding or your state police needs more funding to fight terrorism, that means you.
[27:22.100 --> 27:31.100]  That means more political officers, more spies, more people watching us.
[27:31.100 --> 27:33.100]  God help us.
[27:33.100 --> 27:35.100]  God help us.
[27:35.100 --> 27:37.100]  You ever heard of a hijacking?
[27:37.100 --> 27:39.100]  You ever heard of a country being seized?
[27:39.100 --> 27:41.100]  You ever heard of bad people taking over a government?
[27:41.100 --> 27:44.100]  It happens 99 times out of 100.
[27:44.100 --> 27:46.100]  It's happened here.
[27:46.100 --> 28:00.100]  And if we as a nation, school teachers, doctors, lawyers, state policemen and women, if you'll just decide to stop living a delusion and stop being ignorant and look into what I'm saying, we can turn this around.
[28:00.100 --> 28:05.100]  I mean, I have people email me telling me it's a conspiracy theory that we have high inflation.
[28:05.100 --> 28:08.100]  We already have hyperinflation.
[28:08.100 --> 28:10.100]  It's compounding each year.
[28:10.100 --> 28:12.100]  You're saving your future.
[28:12.100 --> 28:17.100]  It's all the country is turning into a third world nation right now.
[28:17.100 --> 28:21.100]  The globalists got us in this position.
[28:21.100 --> 28:24.100]  They used our currency to buy up all the infrastructure on the planet.
[28:24.100 --> 28:27.100]  Now they're imploding it, leaving us holding the bag.
[28:27.100 --> 28:32.100]  They're talking about us having to pay 87% taxes to, quote, pay off the debt.
[28:32.100 --> 28:37.100]  See, all this currency that's created, debt's been created and tacked on to our children.
[28:37.100 --> 28:39.100]  Forget our children on to us.
[28:39.100 --> 28:41.100]  I just want you to know who's doing it to you.
[28:41.100 --> 29:10.100]  We'll be back with your calls. I want to hear your comments on inflation.
[29:11.100 --> 29:15.100]  The strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[29:15.100 --> 29:19.100]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[29:19.100 --> 29:23.100]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[29:23.100 --> 29:26.100]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[29:26.100 --> 29:30.100]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[29:30.100 --> 29:33.100]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[29:33.100 --> 29:36.100]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[29:36.100 --> 29:42.100]  the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[29:42.100 --> 29:46.100]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.

[30:53.100 --> 30:57.100]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[30:57.100 --> 31:02.100]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[31:02.100 --> 31:07.100]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.

[33:04.100 --> 33:13.100]  Music
[33:13.100 --> 33:18.100]  More than 300,000 people die a year in the United States.
[33:18.100 --> 33:25.100]  Go look the numbers up, CDC admits it, FDA admits it, from bad drug interactions
[33:25.100 --> 33:30.100]  for the 200,000 die from box surgeries and infections.
[33:30.100 --> 33:34.100]  A lot more than dying cars.
[33:34.100 --> 33:39.100]  See, 30 years ago, the federal government said, how are we going to federalize the local cities?
[33:39.100 --> 33:42.100]  They said, well, we've got to have an excuse, something that sounds good.
[33:42.100 --> 33:44.100]  Oh, we'll say we care about them.
[33:44.100 --> 33:45.100]  We want them to be safe.
[33:45.100 --> 33:48.100]  The government could care less.
[33:48.100 --> 33:51.100]  And so they came into the states and they tell you, click it or tick it,
[33:51.100 --> 33:54.100]  and that gets you used to coming to checkpoints where they see if you're wearing your seat belt,
[33:54.100 --> 33:59.100]  violation of the Fourth Amendment, and then they want to look inside, see your papers.
[33:59.100 --> 34:00.100]  You know, it was good in Germany.
[34:00.100 --> 34:01.100]  It's good here.
[34:01.100 --> 34:04.100]  Now they want to take your blood, and from Texas to New York,
[34:04.100 --> 34:07.100]  they pull you over and jam needles in your arms in the dark.
[34:07.100 --> 34:09.100]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[34:09.100 --> 34:11.100]  I thought we're land of the free home of the brave.
[34:11.100 --> 34:12.100]  I thought we're the good guys.
[34:12.100 --> 34:15.100]  We're not like Nazi Germany.
[34:15.100 --> 34:21.100]  And so all of this is about getting normal people used to having interaction with police.
[34:21.100 --> 34:26.100]  Kids, you know, in terror drills, being put in the buses at gunpoint.
[34:26.100 --> 34:28.100]  You being pulled over, being searched.
[34:28.100 --> 34:32.100]  It's all about getting you ready to be a slave.
[34:32.100 --> 34:36.100]  Being watched over, being controlled.
[34:36.100 --> 34:38.100]  It's the same thing with man-made global warming.
[34:38.100 --> 34:41.100]  The earth heats up, the earth cools down.
[34:41.100 --> 34:43.100]  The entire solar system has been heating up.
[34:43.100 --> 34:49.100]  The ice caps of Mars have been shrinking at about a mile a year for the last 30-plus years.
[34:49.100 --> 34:56.100]  I was interviewing the head of Live Earth, the big global environmental thing they had last year.
[34:56.100 --> 34:59.100]  And I said, you know, Mars' ice caps shrinking.
[34:59.100 --> 35:01.100]  And he said it doesn't have an ice cap.
[35:01.100 --> 35:02.100]  And I said, yeah, it does.
[35:02.100 --> 35:06.100]  And then we were talking to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a few months ago.
[35:06.100 --> 35:10.100]  And we said, hey, the Mars ice cap shrinking.
[35:10.100 --> 35:13.100]  And he said it doesn't have ice caps and laughed at us.
[35:13.100 --> 35:15.100]  And then for the general public, they're laughing right now, too.
[35:15.100 --> 35:21.100]  Just type into Google, Mars ice cap, and you'll see photos of it from Viking and all the other explorers.
[35:21.100 --> 35:23.100]  And you can look at the ice caps.
[35:23.100 --> 35:26.100]  The point is, the earth heats up, the earth cools down.
[35:26.100 --> 35:33.100]  I mean, where I sit in Texas used to be under 100 feet of water with giant sealant cants swimming around.
[35:33.100 --> 35:40.100]  But in Mosasores, that doesn't matter.
[35:40.100 --> 35:42.100]  All right, I said I'd take your calls on this inflation issue.
[35:42.100 --> 35:47.100]  Then later, I'm going to get into Clinton apologizes for RFK assassination remark.
[35:47.100 --> 35:51.100]  Yeah, she told the newspaper, as I'm sure all of you know, that, well, I don't understand.
[35:51.100 --> 35:53.100]  I mean, Bobby Kennedy got killed in June.
[35:53.100 --> 35:56.100]  And that's why we need me to stand the race.
[35:56.100 --> 35:57.100]  Open threat.
[35:57.100 --> 35:59.100]  Everything she says is calculated.
[35:59.100 --> 36:02.100]  And of course, the government killed Bobby Kennedy.
[36:02.100 --> 36:04.100]  That's now even admitted on NBC News.
[36:04.100 --> 36:10.100]  And let's even admit, we've had the guest on this very show, the head of the National Forensic Society.
[36:10.100 --> 36:13.100]  It's the BBC's done specials, not just the forensics.
[36:13.100 --> 36:24.100]  They now have the film, TV footage of three well-known CIA section chiefs in from Asia to run the hit, directing Mr. Caesar to do it, to shoot him in the back.
[36:24.100 --> 36:27.100]  And the coroner said he'd been shot three times in the back, once in the back of the head.
[36:27.100 --> 36:35.100]  The Surhan Surhan was, you know, 10 feet away shooting forward and had his arm pinned after the first shot with a.22 caliber handgun.
[36:35.100 --> 36:37.100]  But I mean, why give you facts?
[36:37.100 --> 36:38.100]  Why give you evidence?
[36:38.100 --> 36:40.100]  I mean, you know, they'll just say it's a conspiracy.
[36:40.100 --> 36:42.100]  Hillary never said, hey, I better stay in.
[36:42.100 --> 36:45.100]  Somebody may kill Barack Obama.
[36:45.100 --> 36:49.100]  And the sun's not up in the sky right now, and the sky isn't blue.
[36:49.100 --> 36:53.100]  We'll just, again, we're a nation of denial, a nation of denying what's happening.
[36:53.100 --> 36:59.100]  The private interests that have used this country to take over the world are now going to leave us holding the bag.
[36:59.100 --> 37:02.100]  That's why you're paying this much for fuel.
[37:02.100 --> 37:06.100]  Now, remember, last summer it went up to three bucks a gallon.
[37:06.100 --> 37:07.100]  You were all freaked out.
[37:07.100 --> 37:08.100]  Then it dropped back down to 250.
[37:08.100 --> 37:11.100]  Now it's gone to four or something, and it'll drop back down to three.
[37:11.100 --> 37:13.100]  And just year by year, it's going to march.
[37:13.100 --> 37:19.100]  And I told you two years ago, the Bilderberg group who runs your life, runs my life, the enemy of freedom.
[37:19.100 --> 37:22.100]  We need to know who the enemy is to get our freedom back.
[37:22.100 --> 37:24.100]  That is the enemy of free people.
[37:24.100 --> 37:29.100]  If you want to be a slave or a minion, I guess they're your owners and you should like them.
[37:29.100 --> 37:37.100]  But they said that by 2009, we would be paying $200 a barrel.
[37:37.100 --> 37:39.100]  They were going to do that by dollar devaluation.
[37:39.100 --> 37:42.100]  And our molds inside got this out to you.
[37:42.100 --> 37:48.100]  We go through great expense and great danger and being arrested and being detained and being shot at.
[37:48.100 --> 37:51.100]  Oh, yeah, it's in my film in game to bring you this information.
[37:51.100 --> 37:53.100]  And we're just such a decadent society.
[37:53.100 --> 37:56.100]  It's kind of like, yeah, so what did Alex does that for us?
[37:56.100 --> 38:00.100]  Hey, you know, wonder if Paul still wants to go.
[38:00.100 --> 38:02.100]  Paul's in there going, hey, I want to go on the trip.
[38:02.100 --> 38:03.100]  I didn't get shot at.
[38:03.100 --> 38:04.100]  Jim Tucker did.
[38:04.100 --> 38:05.100]  And that was in the newspaper.
[38:05.100 --> 38:08.100]  Oh, yeah, if you get on the property, they open fire on you.
[38:08.100 --> 38:11.100]  And the media says it doesn't exist, though.
[38:11.100 --> 38:16.100]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[38:16.100 --> 38:18.100]  Let's talk to Nicholas in Buffalo.
[38:18.100 --> 38:19.100]  Nicholas, you're on the air.
[38:19.100 --> 38:20.100]  Go ahead.
[38:20.100 --> 38:22.100]  Hey, Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[38:22.100 --> 38:24.100]  First time caller daily listener.
[38:24.100 --> 38:27.100]  Let me thank you and all your crew for everything that you can do.
[38:27.100 --> 38:30.100]  You helped to fully wake me up and I in turn have done the same to others.
[38:30.100 --> 38:32.100]  Hopefully that will grow exponentially.
[38:32.100 --> 38:36.100]  Well, it better because they're building FEMA camps and have brainwashed our police.
[38:36.100 --> 38:39.100]  And they create the crisis, always offer a solution.
[38:39.100 --> 38:40.100]  Then things get worse.
[38:40.100 --> 38:41.100]  They offer another solution.
[38:41.100 --> 38:42.100]  Things get worse.
[38:42.100 --> 38:43.100]  They offer another solution.
[38:43.100 --> 38:46.100]  It's all about enslavement.
[38:46.100 --> 38:51.100]  It's a very daunting task to wake people up, as I'm sure many of your listeners know.
[38:51.100 --> 38:55.100]  And let's just hope we can pull all our stuff together and wake up the masses because,
[38:55.100 --> 38:57.100]  like you say, time's running out.
[38:57.100 --> 39:00.100]  But going back to the inflation topic, of course there's inflation.
[39:00.100 --> 39:01.100]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[39:01.100 --> 39:03.100]  No, the government says it's not.
[39:03.100 --> 39:05.100]  Well, they should go into a local supermarket.
[39:05.100 --> 39:07.100]  But no, the government doesn't lie, sir.
[39:07.100 --> 39:08.100]  They care about us.
[39:08.100 --> 39:11.100]  We should trust them and let them have more police.
[39:11.100 --> 39:13.100]  Yeah, I'm sure that will solve everything.
[39:13.100 --> 39:14.100]  Let me explain it, folks.
[39:14.100 --> 39:19.100]  The police are predominantly there to protect the establishment and status quo and to make sure
[39:19.100 --> 39:23.100]  you don't riot too bad when they take your bank accounts.
[39:23.100 --> 39:24.100]  Go ahead.
[39:24.100 --> 39:26.100]  Now, going back to the inflation.
[39:26.100 --> 39:30.100]  Yeah, I went to the supermarket a day ago and I was just amazed on how much these prices
[39:30.100 --> 39:31.100]  have gone up.
[39:31.100 --> 39:32.100]  They haven't gone up.
[39:32.100 --> 39:33.100]  That's a conspiracy.
[39:33.100 --> 39:35.100]  I go back 10 years.
[39:35.100 --> 39:38.100]  Listen, they're saying Lou Dobbs is a liar right now in the national news and that there's
[39:38.100 --> 39:42.100]  no plan for an North American Union, even if there's 300 plus books published by him
[39:42.100 --> 39:45.100]  and all the official documents and it's happening.
[39:45.100 --> 39:47.100]  The media just says it doesn't exist.
[39:47.100 --> 39:49.100]  Okay, inflation doesn't exist either.
[39:49.100 --> 39:50.100]  You understand?
[39:50.100 --> 39:51.100]  Learn how to be a slave.
[39:51.100 --> 39:54.100]  Learn how to be in denial like the rest of the people.
[39:54.100 --> 39:55.100]  No, that's right.
[39:55.100 --> 39:58.100]  I'd rather be awake and in tune with what's going on.
[39:58.100 --> 39:59.100]  That's okay.
[39:59.100 --> 40:02.100]  By the way, it's all over the hundreds of South American papers.
[40:02.100 --> 40:07.100]  They formed the South American Union on Friday and there's nothing in our news.
[40:07.100 --> 40:10.100]  I'm waiting for him to say the EU doesn't exist.
[40:10.100 --> 40:11.100]  What?
[40:11.100 --> 40:13.100]  What else is going on, sir?
[40:13.100 --> 40:17.100]  Actually, I was going to say one more thing on inflation if you could just touch upon
[40:17.100 --> 40:18.100]  Bilderberg briefly.
[40:18.100 --> 40:24.100]  I had a conversation with my grandfather the other day ago about how his standard of living
[40:24.100 --> 40:28.100]  in the 40s and 50s was so much higher than it is now and we briefly talked about that.
[40:28.100 --> 40:30.100]  You didn't have to work as much.
[40:30.100 --> 40:35.100]  I mean, he was able to single-handedly raise the family for the wife, three kids, put three
[40:35.100 --> 40:36.100]  to college.
[40:36.100 --> 40:38.100]  Your grandfather didn't exist.
[40:38.100 --> 40:39.100]  That's not true.
[40:39.100 --> 40:40.100]  I can attack.
[40:40.100 --> 40:41.100]  I have to.
[40:41.100 --> 40:42.100]  No, all lies.
[40:42.100 --> 40:43.100]  Government's nothing but good.
[40:43.100 --> 40:44.100]  It does no wrong.
[40:44.100 --> 40:46.100]  Tasers don't cause heart attacks.
[40:46.100 --> 40:47.100]  Everything's fine.
[40:47.100 --> 40:49.100]  Everything's definitely not fine.
[40:49.100 --> 40:54.100]  One more thing, if you could touch upon Bilderberg, who do you think will be taken for vice president?
[40:54.100 --> 40:55.100]  And I guess that'll be it.
[40:55.100 --> 40:56.100]  It was a pleasure talking to you.
[40:56.100 --> 40:57.100]  Thank you.
[40:57.100 --> 40:59.100]  Let me take more calls and I'll come back and answer that because I have a Bilderberg
[40:59.100 --> 41:00.100]  questionnaire.
[41:00.100 --> 41:01.100]  Thank you, great call.
[41:01.100 --> 41:05.100]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Toronto, Canada.
[41:05.100 --> 41:07.100]  Ed, you're on the air.
[41:07.100 --> 41:08.100]  Welcome.
[41:08.100 --> 41:10.100]  No living was an inside job.
[41:10.100 --> 41:15.100]  No living was an inside job.
[41:15.100 --> 41:21.100]  Folks, that is Troy from West Virginia.
[41:21.100 --> 41:23.100]  He is something else.
[41:23.100 --> 41:25.100]  Oh, man.
[41:25.100 --> 41:28.100]  Unbelievable.
[41:28.100 --> 41:32.100]  Troy likes to call people up until they blow up at them at their homes, 9-11 truthers,
[41:32.100 --> 41:37.100]  and then edit it and put it on the web, but it's not too effective, Troy.
[41:37.100 --> 41:40.100]  Actually, Troy is a very scary person if you really want to get down to it.
[41:40.100 --> 41:45.100]  Not many people will call you up privately and tell you the type of things he will.
[41:45.100 --> 41:46.100]  But he's a nice guy.
[41:46.100 --> 41:47.100]  I hope he's doing well.
[41:47.100 --> 41:49.100]  The dollar's not devalued, Troy.
[41:49.100 --> 41:50.100]  Everything's fine.
[41:50.100 --> 41:51.100]  That's right.
[41:51.100 --> 41:52.100]  Economy's doing great.
[41:52.100 --> 41:55.100]  I remember you two years ago telling me that the economy was great and the dollar wouldn't
[41:55.100 --> 41:56.100]  be devalued.
[41:56.100 --> 41:58.100]  Do I have time for one more?
[41:58.100 --> 41:59.100]  I think I do.
[41:59.100 --> 42:00.100]  Let's go ahead and jam in.
[42:00.100 --> 42:01.100]  Steve in Texas.
[42:01.100 --> 42:02.100]  Go ahead, Steve.
[42:02.100 --> 42:03.100]  Yeah.
[42:03.100 --> 42:04.100]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[42:04.100 --> 42:08.100]  First of all, I wanted to say to Troy, you won't be laughing when you're in the FEMA camp.
[42:08.100 --> 42:09.100]  Oh, he probably won't be.
[42:09.100 --> 42:12.100]  He'll probably be, you know, the boss at one.
[42:12.100 --> 42:13.100]  Yeah.
[42:13.100 --> 42:18.100]  I just wanted to say I was having a conversation with three gentlemen at a tire shop or a tire
[42:18.100 --> 42:20.100]  shop that went to the other day.
[42:20.100 --> 42:24.100]  And my ears perked up when they were talking about the oil prices and the gas, and they
[42:24.100 --> 42:28.100]  were upset because the oil companies are saying that, you know, this has nothing to do with
[42:28.100 --> 42:29.100]  the price.
[42:29.100 --> 42:30.100]  Stay there.
[42:30.100 --> 42:31.100]  I want to hear how you tried to explain it to these idiots.
[42:31.100 --> 42:32.100]  Okay.
[42:32.100 --> 42:34.100]  And they probably wanted to stay there.
[42:34.100 --> 42:35.100]  Let me hang up on you.
[42:35.100 --> 42:36.100]  It was an accident.
[42:36.100 --> 42:37.100]  Call right back.
[42:37.100 --> 42:39.100]  You can't even hit the right number.
[42:39.100 --> 42:41.100]  I'm so shaken up by Troy.
[42:41.100 --> 42:42.100]  877-590-5525.
[42:42.100 --> 42:44.100]  Call right back in.
[42:44.100 --> 42:45.100]  I want to hear.
[42:45.100 --> 42:46.100]  Keep a line up for him.
[42:46.100 --> 42:47.100]  We'll be right back.
[42:47.100 --> 42:48.100]  infowords.com.
[42:48.100 --> 42:58.100]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[42:58.100 --> 42:59.100]  alkaline environment.
[42:59.100 --> 43:04.100]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[43:04.100 --> 43:09.100]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[43:09.100 --> 43:10.100]  of disease.
[43:10.100 --> 43:15.100]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[43:15.100 --> 43:16.100]  loss of weight.
[43:16.100 --> 43:20.500]  It's intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most
[43:20.500 --> 43:22.100]  people are overly acidic.
[43:22.100 --> 43:26.020]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[43:26.020 --> 43:30.340]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[43:30.340 --> 43:31.340]  it.
[43:31.340 --> 43:32.340]  Do your part.
[43:32.340 --> 43:34.860]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[43:52.620 --> 43:54.740]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis.
[43:54.740 --> 43:58.700]  All my life, I've had dry heels and rough thickened skin on the soles and sides of my
[43:58.700 --> 43:59.700]  feet.
[43:59.700 --> 44:02.100]  Then my podiatrist told me about callix ointment.
[44:02.100 --> 44:06.700]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots.
[44:06.700 --> 44:11.020]  Since using callix, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth
[44:11.020 --> 44:12.020]  and healthy looking.
[44:12.020 --> 44:13.020]  I'm so grateful.
[44:13.020 --> 44:15.140]  And no longer embarrassed in sandals.
[44:15.140 --> 44:18.380]  If you have dry cracked feet, I recommend callix ointment.
[44:18.380 --> 44:23.740]  You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass retailers and supercenters.
[44:23.740 --> 44:26.780]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[44:26.780 --> 44:29.380]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[44:29.380 --> 44:32.580]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[44:32.580 --> 44:38.580]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its
[44:38.580 --> 44:40.540]  purchasing power.

[46:48.500 --> 47:17.580]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[47:17.580 --> 47:18.580]  I know what's going on.
[47:18.580 --> 47:23.020]  It's like a fate with people that love government.
[47:23.020 --> 47:27.500]  Liberals, socialists, they really believe government can deliver Valhalla, milk and honey floating
[47:27.500 --> 47:31.340]  around on clouds, always delivers despotism.
[47:31.340 --> 47:35.780]  Anytime you centralize something, control freaks, criminals are going to get control
[47:35.780 --> 47:36.780]  of the levers.
[47:36.780 --> 47:42.260]  That's why free market and individual liberty and local control is the way to go.
[47:42.260 --> 47:43.820]  Global government is not the way to go.
[47:43.820 --> 47:47.980]  B, even if you had angels running it, the second they weren't in control, some thug
[47:47.980 --> 47:53.860]  would get control, B, psychopathic control freaks are the ones setting up global government,
[47:53.860 --> 47:57.980]  and we can't even get the general public to admit global government's being set up.
[47:57.980 --> 48:01.380]  They said years ago they were going to jack up oil prices.
[48:01.380 --> 48:04.460]  They said they wanted to bring down our standard of living, that we didn't deserve to live
[48:04.460 --> 48:05.460]  this well.
[48:05.460 --> 48:08.900]  Now, I've heard Barack Obama out running around saying that.
[48:08.900 --> 48:12.820]  The government's going to control how much you can eat, what you can wear, where you
[48:12.820 --> 48:15.380]  go, track everything you do.
[48:15.380 --> 48:22.140]  I remember like seven, eight years ago reading different government policy reports about
[48:22.140 --> 48:24.060]  how they were going to get rid of cash.
[48:24.060 --> 48:27.540]  You're still going to have cash, but it's going to have an RFID in it, and so when you
[48:27.540 --> 48:31.540]  scan it, it will then have a record of who you are, where you went, what you did, and
[48:31.540 --> 48:33.700]  they'll use that to control you.
[48:33.700 --> 48:34.700]  There'll be nowhere to run.
[48:34.700 --> 48:40.460]  Imagine Hitler if he had those powers, and now they're saying, oh, federal court ruling,
[48:40.460 --> 48:46.300]  the blind can't use the money, so the government has to come out with money with chips in it.
[48:46.300 --> 48:51.580]  But then 15 years ago, and I learned about it in the last seven or eight, we wrote articles
[48:51.580 --> 48:54.180]  about it at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[48:54.180 --> 48:58.180]  The government came out and said that they were going to phase this in and use it to
[48:58.180 --> 49:05.980]  control track and trace, and that way you can't escape 80, 90% taxes.
[49:05.980 --> 49:09.380]  It's unspeakable the things that are happening and the things that are developing and the
[49:09.380 --> 49:13.940]  things that are unfolding, and a lot of people are in denial about it.
[49:13.940 --> 49:21.220]  I mean, I wish that Troy from West Virginia would have been serious and would have said,
[49:21.220 --> 49:24.220]  hey, Alex, I think you're a liar.
[49:24.220 --> 49:25.660]  The dollar's not being devalued.
[49:25.660 --> 49:31.580]  I distinctly remember that guy calling last year and me saying that and him laughing at
[49:31.580 --> 49:33.660]  me and saying, no, it's not happening.
[49:33.660 --> 49:37.420]  I mean, it is not an attribute to deny what's happening.
[49:37.420 --> 49:42.260]  If we admit what's happening, the globalist won't be able to politically carry this out.
[49:42.260 --> 49:43.260]  I said, I'm taking your calls.
[49:43.260 --> 49:44.260]  Let's just go to him.
[49:44.260 --> 49:46.940]  I actually hung up on a caller who was telling me about stuff in New York.
[49:46.940 --> 49:48.580]  Do we ever get him back on?
[49:48.580 --> 49:49.900]  He never called back.
[49:49.900 --> 49:50.900]  I wanted to hear it.
[49:50.900 --> 49:54.020]  It was an attire shop, and he was saying they were blaming the oil companies for it.
[49:54.020 --> 49:55.660]  I'm not defending the oil companies.
[49:55.660 --> 49:58.580]  They did buy up the refineries, took close them.
[49:58.580 --> 50:03.060]  We have their own documents, Associated Press 2001, did big reports on it.
[50:03.060 --> 50:12.580]  It was Texaco, Dutch World Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, and they've said right there, and by the way,
[50:12.580 --> 50:20.180]  you can just Google this if you want, oil companies reduced refining capacity.
[50:20.180 --> 50:23.500]  Oil companies bought up refineries to create bottleneck.
[50:23.500 --> 50:28.780]  It should pop up for you there, but they bought up private refineries and shut them
[50:28.780 --> 50:30.300]  down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[50:30.300 --> 50:37.340]  So they're involved, too, but they're only buying and exploring from the different lease
[50:37.340 --> 50:43.540]  holders and the people that they're getting those leases from, those nations, those private
[50:43.540 --> 50:44.540]  individuals.
[50:44.540 --> 50:50.740]  Again, most of this is that the dollar is being devalued, and now it's causing other
[50:50.740 --> 50:57.740]  fiat currencies to have their own crises, and so some of those are also devaluing, and
[50:57.740 --> 51:00.860]  so global inflation has kicked off.
[51:00.860 --> 51:04.500]  I can't believe I have to even explain this.
[51:04.500 --> 51:07.980]  How do we go from being the smartest, most intelligent, most informed people in the world
[51:07.980 --> 51:11.500]  in the U.S. to being the dumbest by every benchmark?
[51:11.500 --> 51:17.300]  I have such a sad feeling that all this is happening.
[51:17.300 --> 51:20.660]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Benny in Indiana.
[51:20.660 --> 51:21.660]  Benny, you're on the air.
[51:21.660 --> 51:22.660]  Yeah, Alejandro.
[51:22.660 --> 51:23.660]  Yes.
[51:23.660 --> 51:25.660]  Yeah, Benny in Northwest Indiana.
[51:25.660 --> 51:32.340]  Hey, ever since this political process started with trying to find a nominee, you have preached
[51:32.340 --> 51:37.380]  that you thought Hillary was the anointed one, and I totally agreed with you.
[51:37.380 --> 51:41.460]  But now, here lately, it's sort of looking the other way.
[51:41.460 --> 51:42.460]  What's your take on that?
[51:42.460 --> 51:43.460]  Do you think you're...
[51:43.460 --> 51:48.540]  I was about to say, I am rarely wrong, and I am wrong about this, but I mean, Newt Gingrich
[51:48.540 --> 51:50.460]  likes to brag.
[51:50.460 --> 51:52.140]  He came out and said, we're going to get hit by terrorists.
[51:52.140 --> 51:55.500]  We're going to take all your rights, and then when it happened, he said, see, I told you
[51:55.500 --> 51:56.500]  so.
[51:56.500 --> 52:01.100]  I mean, Gary Hart, you know, bragged beforehand about it with the CFR, these policy makers.
[52:01.100 --> 52:07.460]  They liked to brag, and he said it was going to be a Hillary Clinton slash Barack Obama
[52:07.460 --> 52:13.460]  ticket with her as the president, him as the VP.
[52:13.460 --> 52:17.940]  That is what everybody else said, and that is what it looked like to me.
[52:17.940 --> 52:22.140]  I mean, when I saw Rupert Murdoch giving her money, having secret friendraisers for,
[52:22.140 --> 52:27.100]  and I saw Roger Ailes advising her, and you saw Limbaugh come into her aid and try to
[52:27.100 --> 52:33.380]  get her elected, claiming, oh, I'm doing this to mess them up, yeah, sure he is, has dinner
[52:33.380 --> 52:38.540]  with Clinton or hangs out with Clinton, but the Clinton's are vacationing with the Bushes.
[52:38.540 --> 52:39.540]  That's admitted.
[52:39.540 --> 52:45.980]  They call him the surrogate son Bush Senior does and Barbara does, but it doesn't matter.
[52:45.980 --> 52:50.460]  Barack Obama has been given the anointing of Bilderberg, but normally both candidates
[52:50.460 --> 52:53.860]  are for me, they're parties, so it doesn't matter, both the front runners in the Democratic
[52:53.860 --> 52:58.020]  and then both the front runners in the Republican, and we have the proof of that from past Bilderberg
[52:58.020 --> 53:04.220]  minutes that we've stolen, great risk to ourselves, so the general public can giggle and snicker
[53:04.220 --> 53:05.220]  about it.
[53:05.220 --> 53:10.580]  Well, there's no ruling elite, those don't exist, so it does now look like he is being
[53:10.580 --> 53:14.580]  positioned, but Jesse Ventura said on my show a month and a half ago, and again this week
[53:14.580 --> 53:19.460]  when he was back on former governor, he said, man, I feel like they're going to kill Barack
[53:19.460 --> 53:21.820]  Obama because they want that power.
[53:21.820 --> 53:25.500]  That doesn't mean he's a good guy, it means there's some type of power struggle at the
[53:25.500 --> 53:28.500]  higher levels, and we know those happen throughout history.
[53:28.500 --> 53:32.860]  I mean, there have been power struggles not just in the U.S., but all over the world over
[53:32.860 --> 53:35.220]  and over again between political groups.
[53:35.220 --> 53:39.700]  Only in this modern, domesticated country has the public been told that there's no such
[53:39.700 --> 53:43.060]  thing as political assassination or political subterfuge.
[53:43.060 --> 53:47.740]  There's subterfuge at your job and your business and your life, but not with powerful people
[53:47.740 --> 53:49.460]  controlling trillions of dollars.
[53:49.460 --> 53:54.500]  They don't want power, they don't engage in risk-taking, they don't engage in brinkmanship.
[53:54.500 --> 53:57.620]  That's like saying ND500 racers don't take risk.
[53:57.620 --> 53:58.620]  Anything else, sir?
[53:58.620 --> 54:06.340]  Yeah, well, I was curious, if Varama does get the nomination, because I come from, racism
[54:06.340 --> 54:10.780]  is a big part of this Northwest Indiana here, and I've had people tell me that if he does
[54:10.780 --> 54:14.060]  get the nomination, even though they're the Democrats, they said they're going to vote
[54:14.060 --> 54:15.060]  for McCain.
[54:15.060 --> 54:17.580]  Do you think that will open up doors for him to get elected?
[54:17.580 --> 54:22.820]  Yes, I do, but listen, I've never seen something this weird.
[54:22.820 --> 54:28.100]  I've never seen an election where all three candidates are this rotten.
[54:28.100 --> 54:36.460]  I mean, Barack Obama wants socialized health care, Hillary wants it where you get arrested
[54:36.460 --> 54:43.340]  if you don't pay in, Barack Obama wants that too, McCain has had lymphoma, 90% of the time
[54:43.340 --> 54:51.060]  you die within 10 years of it, he had it removed eight years ago, I mean, he's not a real candidate.
[54:51.060 --> 54:55.620]  He's got all sorts of health problems, he's 76, is it?
[54:55.620 --> 54:58.180]  And I mean, he's just not up to being the president.
[54:58.180 --> 55:04.180]  Doesn't matter, we all focus on the president, it doesn't matter, all three horses are bought
[55:04.180 --> 55:10.820]  and paid for, and so we can pick which pony we think's going to win the prickness, but
[55:10.820 --> 55:11.820]  it doesn't matter.
[55:11.820 --> 55:16.740]  It's a rick, I mean, why don't people watch professional boxing anymore?
[55:16.740 --> 55:21.980]  Because everybody knows most of the fights are rick and it's come out they've been rick.
[55:21.980 --> 55:25.260]  And Don King calling it a conspiracy theory doesn't make it so.
[55:25.260 --> 55:30.420]  So professional boxing is dying and ultimate fighting, by the way, I got Joe Rogan coming
[55:30.420 --> 55:35.540]  on Tuesday, host of that, I'm even there laughing at both the guys and their fans of
[55:35.540 --> 55:36.540]  that.
[55:36.540 --> 55:41.500]  Boy, did he, I heard Saturday he looked like he'd smoked about a half pound of marijuana
[55:41.500 --> 55:44.940]  on that show.
[55:44.940 --> 55:47.300]  Did you watch it, Trey?
[55:47.300 --> 55:52.700]  I was at the office and Rob and the, whoa, man, your audio is so high I just had my ears
[55:52.700 --> 55:53.700]  blown out.
[55:53.700 --> 55:56.460]  Good Lord, Eddie Bear.
[55:56.460 --> 56:01.020]  Well, yeah, that's because my audio is so low to me with my audio, because you turned
[56:01.020 --> 56:03.460]  me down so low that you're turning way up.
[56:03.460 --> 56:05.020]  It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter anymore.
[56:05.020 --> 56:07.660]  I mean, sometimes I just think I ought to get the hell out of here and go to a third
[56:07.660 --> 56:12.220]  rural country and let this nation of just, I mean, you really got to admit, I mean,
[56:12.220 --> 56:16.260]  I look at adults, I was driving down South Congress earlier and these adults are all
[56:16.260 --> 56:20.820]  out happy sitting by their bikes looking at the sunny day and everybody goes so friendly
[56:20.820 --> 56:23.420]  and it just lambs to the slaughter.
[56:23.420 --> 56:29.140]  They just have no idea what the real world holds for them, no idea what's going on.
[56:29.140 --> 56:32.580]  And I don't even like being up here preaching today.
[56:32.580 --> 56:44.380]  I mean, things are so bad that I can't articulate how serious they are, how perilous they are.
[56:44.380 --> 56:47.700]  We got all these callers, Jesus.
[56:47.700 --> 56:50.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Florida.
[56:50.300 --> 56:51.540]  George, you're on the air.
[56:51.540 --> 56:53.900]  All right, happy Memorial Day, G. Jack.
[56:53.900 --> 56:57.100]  I mean, Alex, sorry.
[56:57.100 --> 57:02.860]  I just want to say in Florida, they just passed a bill called 2532 where they're going to
[57:02.860 --> 57:07.460]  accelerate the termination of parental rights and me and my wife are talking about evacuating
[57:07.460 --> 57:08.540]  Florida.
[57:08.540 --> 57:10.020]  You need to get out of Florida.
[57:10.020 --> 57:15.700]  It's the, well, they've got the largest child kidnapping service, CPS in the country.
[57:15.700 --> 57:21.140]  They have been caught every year just Google top Florida CPS officials pedophiles or family
[57:21.140 --> 57:22.140]  services.
[57:22.140 --> 57:26.740]  It's a pedophile guild completely, well, kind of like Texas Youth Commission.

[57:32.180 --> 57:33.180]  it under the rug.

[1:04:13.340 --> 1:04:15.340]  I said to my friend, you know, it looks like the parking garage
[1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:18.340]  just came a little close, and then you heard the engines
[1:04:18.340 --> 1:04:21.340]  get thrown in reverse, and then they actually just
[1:04:21.340 --> 1:04:23.340]  bumped right into it. A lot of debris was falling.

[1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:16.340]  No, these magnets are nothing like you've ever seen.
[1:05:16.340 --> 1:05:18.340]  What makes them different? What makes them unique?
[1:05:18.340 --> 1:05:21.340]  Well, the poles are separated to deliver the healing energy
[1:05:21.340 --> 1:05:24.340]  of the North Pole and are large enough to deliver
[1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:26.340]  an effective force field. They're so durable
[1:05:26.340 --> 1:05:29.340]  that if you happen to drop them, they won't lose their strength.
[1:05:29.340 --> 1:05:32.340]  There is nothing more natural and safe than magnetic therapy.

[1:06:32.340 --> 1:06:35.340]  you were in the back seat with family not wearing seatbelts
[1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:38.340]  and they pulled you over and gave you tickets for that
[1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:40.340]  and you've got the ticket there.
[1:06:40.340 --> 1:06:43.340]  And then I went online and looked it up on the state website
[1:06:43.340 --> 1:06:46.340]  because I thought, well, you don't have to be wearing seatbelts
[1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:50.340]  and the city municipalities have to follow state law.
[1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:53.340]  And sure enough, my memory was right.
[1:06:53.340 --> 1:06:57.340]  It's front seat, but in the New America, it doesn't matter.
[1:06:57.340 --> 1:06:59.340]  And I bet if you go to court, judge will say,
[1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:02.340]  it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:04.340]  It's just law.
[1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:07.340]  I mean, they tell you to take vaccines and there's no law.
[1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:11.340]  But it's for your own safety, so why not have them break the law?
[1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:13.340]  So tell me what happened.
[1:07:13.340 --> 1:07:16.340]  Well, I'll definitely keep you posted because I'm going to fight it.
[1:07:16.340 --> 1:07:20.340]  But yeah, now I just got me and my folks were in the Taurus
[1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:25.340]  about to see Indiana Jones and committing a thought crime al-Qaeda.
[1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:27.340]  Land of the free home of the brave.
[1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:32.340]  And got pulled over as we were riding by and it was really bad.
[1:07:32.340 --> 1:07:35.340]  Now, you said your dad had his on, but he still got a ticket,
[1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:37.340]  but you guys were in the back seat.
[1:07:37.340 --> 1:07:40.340]  Yeah, well, he had his on, but he had it, you know,
[1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:43.340]  because my dad's a bigger guy, so the girth, you know, I don't know.
[1:07:43.340 --> 1:07:46.340]  He had it under his arm, tucked under his arm.
[1:07:46.340 --> 1:07:50.340]  The cop said, one of the sheriffs said that it was on.
[1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:51.340]  It wasn't on properly.
[1:07:51.340 --> 1:07:52.340]  Yeah, well, that's not true.
[1:07:52.340 --> 1:07:54.340]  It actually, you have to have a one over your stomach.
[1:07:54.340 --> 1:07:57.340]  Actually, I have the code here for people out in their squad cars
[1:07:57.340 --> 1:07:58.340]  saying I'm full of it.
[1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:00.340]  I can just read all this if they like it on there.
[1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.340]  I just Google Texas seatbelt laws.
[1:08:02.340 --> 1:08:06.340]  Now, to be clear here, there are laws on child safety seats.
[1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:07.340]  That's different.
[1:08:07.340 --> 1:08:09.340]  But there is no law in the back seat.
[1:08:09.340 --> 1:08:12.340]  And I'm looking at the last legislative session
[1:08:12.340 --> 1:08:14.340]  and the last time they updated this.
[1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:16.340]  Because see, man, I know the law.
[1:08:16.340 --> 1:08:19.340]  And I mean, if I would have known that isn't good enough slave,
[1:08:19.340 --> 1:08:22.340]  but if I would have known that I could get a ticket for not having that seat,
[1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:23.340]  I would have put it on.
[1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:24.340]  But I was in the back.
[1:08:24.340 --> 1:08:25.340]  Sir, there's no law.
[1:08:25.340 --> 1:08:26.340]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:08:26.340 --> 1:08:27.340]  I was in the back and I thought I'm not.
[1:08:27.340 --> 1:08:28.340]  There's no law to take vaccines.
[1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:32.340]  But they had 50 hundred kids in Maryland lined up with police dogs barking at them
[1:08:32.340 --> 1:08:34.340]  and taking crying saying it's the law.
[1:08:34.340 --> 1:08:35.340]  I got to do it.
[1:08:35.340 --> 1:08:36.340]  No law.
[1:08:36.340 --> 1:08:37.340]  This government is lawless, my friend.
[1:08:37.340 --> 1:08:41.340]  Listen, you go to court and you find it and you make that guy come in there
[1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:43.340]  and you make him get up there on the stand.
[1:08:43.340 --> 1:08:45.340]  Yeah, I'm all over it.
[1:08:45.340 --> 1:08:46.340]  I got you.
[1:08:46.340 --> 1:08:47.340]  OK, good.
[1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:48.340]  Have a good one.
[1:08:48.340 --> 1:08:49.340]  The government's now privileged.
[1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:50.340]  You're God.
[1:08:50.340 --> 1:08:52.340]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[1:08:52.340 --> 1:08:56.340]  We were talking to who was the last guy I was talking to where they CPSed his kids
[1:08:56.340 --> 1:09:01.340]  or no, they're changing the law where they just CPS them even faster.
[1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:02.340]  He was in Florida.
[1:09:02.340 --> 1:09:03.340]  It was George.
[1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:05.340]  Was it George I was talking to?
[1:09:05.340 --> 1:09:07.340]  Yeah, it was George.
[1:09:07.340 --> 1:09:09.340]  Listen, I'm not folks.
[1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:12.340]  I don't just say stuff on air.
[1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:17.340]  OK, like I wouldn't even joke about Joe Rogan if I hadn't seen him smoke marijuana.
[1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:18.340]  I don't smoke it.
[1:09:18.340 --> 1:09:19.340]  I'm friends with Joe.
[1:09:19.340 --> 1:09:22.340]  I wouldn't even joke even though he was totally stoned on TV.
[1:09:22.340 --> 1:09:28.340]  You know, as the commentator and the announcer for ultimate fighting championships.
[1:09:28.340 --> 1:09:36.340]  And I wouldn't say that going back five, six years ago, every year, they have to fire
[1:09:36.340 --> 1:09:38.340]  the leadership of the CPS.
[1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:42.340]  It's called Family Services in Florida because they're all child rapist.
[1:09:42.340 --> 1:09:48.340]  I mean, the number one, the number two, the number three guy, it's a guild of them.
[1:09:48.340 --> 1:09:53.340]  3,000 plus children missing in 2003, and then they never said where they went.
[1:09:53.340 --> 1:09:54.340]  These are kids they took.
[1:09:54.340 --> 1:09:56.340]  You want to know who kidnaps the kids?
[1:09:56.340 --> 1:09:57.340]  It's the government.
[1:09:57.340 --> 1:10:02.340]  And they love to find some weirdo polygamous sec doing some weird stuff so they can run
[1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:07.340]  in with their armored tanks and act all big and act like the saviors.
[1:10:07.340 --> 1:10:10.340]  By the way, we for somebody sent it to me and I didn't believe it.
[1:10:10.340 --> 1:10:14.340]  So I went and found the AP photo and I blew it up myself.
[1:10:14.340 --> 1:10:19.340]  Guess what, so when they did that raid on the polygamous a month ago, guess what was
[1:10:19.340 --> 1:10:23.340]  on the side of the tank that the local police went in?
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:25.340]  How many people they'd killed?
[1:10:25.340 --> 1:10:28.340]  Like in World War II, tankers would put how many tanks they'd destroy on the side
[1:10:28.340 --> 1:10:35.340]  or, you know, you'd put on the side of your, of your Mustang P38 or whatever.
[1:10:35.340 --> 1:10:39.340]  You'd put on the side of your plane, on the side of your B17, how many other planes you'd
[1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:43.340]  shot down or how many bombing runs you've done, how many missions.
[1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:48.340]  So when they kill one of us, the slaves, now they put a dead person, you know, a symbol
[1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:51.340]  of a human on the side of the tank.
[1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:53.340]  I mean, we're far gone, folks.
[1:10:53.340 --> 1:10:56.340]  The state sees us as the enemy and we are.
[1:10:56.340 --> 1:10:57.340]  We're the food.
[1:10:57.340 --> 1:11:00.340]  We're here to be fed on by the private corporate structure and the public.
[1:11:00.340 --> 1:11:01.340]  So dumb.
[1:11:01.340 --> 1:11:04.340]  The corporate elites say, hey, they deserve it.
[1:11:04.340 --> 1:11:06.340]  So okay, fine.
[1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:09.340]  Let's go ahead here and go back to George.
[1:11:09.340 --> 1:11:13.340]  You were saying you were going to flee the state before they kidnapped your children?
[1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:14.340]  Oh, yes.
[1:11:14.340 --> 1:11:15.340]  I got two boys.
[1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:17.340]  We're thinking about going to Montana or Oklahoma.
[1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:18.340]  Well, yeah.
[1:11:18.340 --> 1:11:21.340]  I mean, if you're the first time your son falls off America around and breaks the finger
[1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:24.340]  or falls out of a tree, it doesn't matter how many witnesses you've got.
[1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:28.340]  You will have, and I'm not kidding, pedophiles at your house.
[1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:31.340]  And the thing is, I talked, you know, people are far so pathetic.
[1:11:31.340 --> 1:11:33.340]  I want to watch the sobriety checkpoint.
[1:11:33.340 --> 1:11:39.340]  And people are just like begging the cops, can I please lick your boots before you kick me in the head or something like that?
[1:11:39.340 --> 1:11:41.340]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves, yep.
[1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:42.340]  Yeah.
[1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:46.340]  I mean, I wish I could have heard Officer Jack Booth thug, you know.
[1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:48.340]  But they're keeping you safe from the liquor.
[1:11:48.340 --> 1:11:51.340]  That's why they now build liquor stores the signs of Walmarts.
[1:11:51.340 --> 1:11:54.340]  Well, here in Austin, well, once in Kyle, I was driving by this thing.
[1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:58.340]  It was, it was as big as a super Walmart, a liquor store.
[1:11:58.340 --> 1:12:02.340]  I mean, this is a sick joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:03.340]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:05.340]  That's specs, the old academy.
[1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:07.340]  That's a third the size.
[1:12:07.340 --> 1:12:11.340]  It's like some, some psychopathic rabbit with bloodshot eyes is there.
[1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:15.340]  It's, it's like the, you know, the Trix rabbit, but he's the liquor rabbit.
[1:12:15.340 --> 1:12:16.340]  No, no, no, no.
[1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:18.340]  I'm not talking about that down there in South Austin.
[1:12:18.340 --> 1:12:21.340]  I mean, down in Kyle, they got one the size of an aircraft carrier.
[1:12:21.340 --> 1:12:23.340]  I mean, it makes that one look like a mini mart.
[1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:24.340]  I'm sorry.
[1:12:24.340 --> 1:12:25.340]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:12:25.340 --> 1:12:26.340]  Yes.
[1:12:26.340 --> 1:12:30.340]  It is just like, I like to say, the people that are like cattle.
[1:12:30.340 --> 1:12:33.340]  I mean, you know, the thing is, I might tell people about the CPS situation.
[1:12:33.340 --> 1:12:36.340]  I'm like, well, I got enough money and enough guard dog lawyers around.
[1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:40.340]  I was like, well, the guard dog lawyers will cower under this family judge.
[1:12:40.340 --> 1:12:43.340]  I mean, I hear you and it's not a real court.
[1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:44.340]  It's not a real court.
[1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:47.340]  They just, there's no due process, no nothing.
[1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:48.340]  It's all far gone.
[1:12:48.340 --> 1:12:50.340]  You're all going to find out those soon.
[1:12:50.340 --> 1:12:51.340]  Just keep laughing everybody.
[1:12:51.340 --> 1:12:52.340]  Let's go ahead.
[1:12:52.340 --> 1:12:56.340]  I've gotten kind of to a six cynical point where just, you know, you don't think 30 value
[1:12:56.340 --> 1:12:58.340]  dollar, you like the new world order.
[1:12:58.340 --> 1:12:59.340]  Fine.
[1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:00.340]  Enjoy it.
[1:13:00.340 --> 1:13:02.340]  Carl and Montreal, Canada, you're on the air.
[1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:03.340]  Hey, thank you.
[1:13:03.340 --> 1:13:04.340]  Pick my call.
[1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:09.340]  I was reading a scripture in the Bible today about how the wicked scheme against the righteous,
[1:13:09.340 --> 1:13:14.340]  you know, but the Bible says the Lord's going to laugh at him for God sees his day is coming.
[1:13:14.340 --> 1:13:17.340]  You know, I believe they're going to get what's coming to them.
[1:13:17.340 --> 1:13:21.340]  They think it's all funny now, but you know, they're going to get theirs in the end.
[1:13:21.340 --> 1:13:24.340]  Well, the bottle also says they invent all manner of wickedness.
[1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:27.340]  They're inventors of wickedness and evil.
[1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:32.340]  I mean, they, they think up the complex new, what new scams and they always have idiots
[1:13:32.340 --> 1:13:34.340]  that serve them who mean well.
[1:13:34.340 --> 1:13:38.340]  Yeah, but it says in the Bible also found 59 some good news.
[1:13:38.340 --> 1:13:43.340]  They'll be caught in their own pride, you know, and that they will basically, you know,
[1:13:43.340 --> 1:13:44.340]  it's going to come back.
[1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:45.340]  See, I'm the opposite.
[1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:48.340]  I feel totally pathetic, upset, sad.
[1:13:48.340 --> 1:13:49.340]  It's a beautiful day.
[1:13:49.340 --> 1:13:50.340]  So many great things in life.
[1:13:50.340 --> 1:13:55.340]  But meanwhile, everybody has this feeling of anxiousness and the government says that's
[1:13:55.340 --> 1:13:57.340]  al-Qaeda, you're scared of al-Qaeda.
[1:13:57.340 --> 1:14:01.340]  No, they know that we have legitimate six cents and they know we have a legitimate fear.
[1:14:01.340 --> 1:14:06.340]  You don't feel safe and you feel like something is bad because when great evil is in control
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:10.340]  of your life and the control of your country and your society, you're supposed to have
[1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:13.340]  that disquieted feeling, folks.
[1:14:13.340 --> 1:14:15.340]  I know they're evil, pure evil.
[1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:18.340]  I think they're just like, just like what Jesus said about the Pharisees.
[1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:20.340]  They're from their father, the devil.
[1:14:20.340 --> 1:14:21.340]  They are.
[1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:24.340]  They imitate, you know, I come to Canada from the United States.
[1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:26.340]  I just went through hell there.
[1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:31.340]  You know, I was in prison and I had evidence to show, you know, what happened was alive
[1:14:31.340 --> 1:14:35.340]  when I was jailed on and they don't even want to hear it yet.
[1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:36.340]  Exactly.
[1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:40.340]  And the average person who goes into the criminal justice system, and it is a criminal system
[1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:45.340]  for the human resources they feed on, you know, the average poor buck-toothed white trash.
[1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:55.340]  I just was late to class when I was 12 and I never got out of the system.
[1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:58.340]  I don't understand.
[1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.340]  The government isn't your friend.
[1:15:00.340 --> 1:15:02.340]  People always say the government's dumb.
[1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:04.340]  They sent me to jail and I'm innocent.
[1:15:04.340 --> 1:15:06.340]  They're not dumb.
[1:15:06.340 --> 1:15:10.340]  The narcotics traffickers own the banks and own the private prisons.
[1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:11.340]  They run things.
[1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:12.340]  They're smart.
[1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:14.340]  You're dumb.
[1:15:14.340 --> 1:15:16.340]  That's why they've enslaved you.
[1:15:16.340 --> 1:15:17.340]  I'm serious, folks.
[1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:18.340]  I hate the New World War.
[1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:22.340]  I hate the things they do, but it's time for you to stop being such easy pushovers.
[1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:23.340]  Look at the public.
[1:15:23.340 --> 1:15:25.340]  They're lambs of the slaughter, folks.
[1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:29.340]  You had any idea how evil the globalists are.
[1:15:29.340 --> 1:15:31.340]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[1:15:31.340 --> 1:15:35.340]  It's happy Sunday radio show.

[1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:52.340]  It is a big idea.
[1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:54.340]  A New World Order.
[1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:59.340]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:02.340]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:05.340]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:16:05.340 --> 1:16:08.340]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:16:08.340 --> 1:16:18.340]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:16:18.340 --> 1:16:24.340]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:16:24.340 --> 1:16:28.340]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:16:28.340 --> 1:16:31.340]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:32.340]  Most people have no idea.
[1:16:32.340 --> 1:16:33.340]  They're not after money.
[1:16:33.340 --> 1:16:34.340]  They have all the money they need.
[1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:35.340]  They're not after power.
[1:16:35.340 --> 1:16:36.340]  Yes, they're after music.

[1:16:47.340 --> 1:16:49.340]  You have been warned.
[1:16:49.340 --> 1:16:50.340]  Gold.
[1:16:50.340 --> 1:16:51.340]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:53.340]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[1:16:53.340 --> 1:16:55.340]  From the industrial age to the space age.
[1:16:55.340 --> 1:16:57.340]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[1:16:57.340 --> 1:17:01.340]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:06.340]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[1:17:06.340 --> 1:17:10.340]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative
[1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:14.340]  to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[1:17:50.340 --> 1:17:53.340]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[1:17:53.340 --> 1:17:56.340]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you
[1:17:56.340 --> 1:18:00.340]  about turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[1:18:00.340 --> 1:18:04.340]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce,
[1:18:04.340 --> 1:18:06.340]  and it has now finally caught up with us.
[1:18:06.340 --> 1:18:09.340]  In the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed
[1:18:09.340 --> 1:18:12.340]  and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[1:18:12.340 --> 1:18:16.340]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary
[1:18:16.340 --> 1:18:20.340]  to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[1:18:20.340 --> 1:18:22.340]  Remember our trade deficit?
[1:18:22.340 --> 1:18:26.340]  Our dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production
[1:18:26.340 --> 1:18:28.340]  at any price.
[1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:31.340]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in
[1:18:31.340 --> 1:18:34.340]  and control food and food exports under martial law.
[1:18:34.340 --> 1:18:39.340]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.

[1:20:26.340 --> 1:20:28.340]  Okay, this is what I'm going to do.
[1:20:28.340 --> 1:20:31.340]  I'm going to try to rampage through your calls as quickly as I can.
[1:20:31.340 --> 1:20:37.340]  Then we're going to come back and go over Clinton's assassination comment about Barack Obama, just unbelievable.
[1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:40.340]  A bunch of other really important news I have here in front of me.
[1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:44.340]  Let's go ahead and talk to Stephen in New York.
[1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:46.340]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:20:46.340 --> 1:20:54.340]  I saw this article you posted about the birth of the South American Union.
[1:20:54.340 --> 1:20:57.340]  I'd like to make a couple of points about Hugo Chavez.
[1:20:57.340 --> 1:21:10.340]  It seems that he's being used to put in some sort of neo-socialist track to get the rest of South America along with the South American Union.
[1:21:10.340 --> 1:21:24.340]  They knew that the people of North and South America would not easily accept a whole gigantic area of the Americas.
[1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:30.340]  A whole gigantic super state of North and South America.
[1:21:30.340 --> 1:21:40.340]  So they got him to kill the FDA and wait a couple of years because the Illuminati are masters of deception, masters of cloak and dagger.
[1:21:40.340 --> 1:21:46.340]  In fact, I believe, and I've said this, they staged his kidnapping in 2002.
[1:21:46.340 --> 1:21:48.340]  Greg Palace even knew it was going to happen.
[1:21:48.340 --> 1:21:51.340]  Said it like three weeks before it happened on my show.
[1:21:51.340 --> 1:21:55.340]  He'd heard rumblings of it, BBC reporter.
[1:21:55.340 --> 1:22:01.340]  Certainly, and then now he's helped spearhead their separate socialist South American Union.
[1:22:01.340 --> 1:22:04.340]  And yeah, they've publicly celebrated it.
[1:22:04.340 --> 1:22:09.340]  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, visiting during the founding of it, calls the new global covenant.
[1:22:09.340 --> 1:22:22.340]  The founding members of the South American Union are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela reports, Sophie News, agency.
[1:22:22.340 --> 1:22:26.340]  And it's the new union of South American states.
[1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:33.340]  But you tell an American that they go, there's no such thing, does not exist because my media says the globalists aren't moving for that.
[1:22:33.340 --> 1:22:42.340]  Yeah, and he said that the biggest enemy of the South American Union was the evil American empire.
[1:22:42.340 --> 1:22:43.340]  Can you believe that?
[1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:46.340]  Yeah, the US, well, I mean, the globalists use us as the front.
[1:22:46.340 --> 1:22:53.340]  The globalists blame us, the globalists act like the US is doing all of this when we're just the muscle and then we get the blame.
[1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:54.340]  We're birdcage liner.
[1:22:54.340 --> 1:22:57.340]  We take all the heat, then they just remove us and wad us up.
[1:22:57.340 --> 1:23:00.340]  Yeah, I actually wrote an article about this.
[1:23:00.340 --> 1:23:04.340]  And it goes over all the points and...
[1:23:04.340 --> 1:23:05.340]  Okay, where is it?
[1:23:05.340 --> 1:23:08.340]  War of illusions.wordpress.com.
[1:23:08.340 --> 1:23:14.340]  It's called the South American Union and Hugo Chavez.
[1:23:14.340 --> 1:23:16.340]  Okay, great. Thank you.
[1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:20.340]  Why don't you post it on the Prison Planet forum and we might post it on one of our sites.
[1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:21.340]  Thank you, sir.
[1:23:21.340 --> 1:23:24.340]  And I keep being sarcastic all day saying this doesn't exist, that doesn't exist.
[1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:29.340]  I get emails and calls and people saying there's no inflation.
[1:23:29.340 --> 1:23:33.340]  There's no hyperinflation and the dollar's strong and you just hate America.
[1:23:33.340 --> 1:23:38.340]  And I'm like, no, the people running our government have had policies to devalue it.
[1:23:38.340 --> 1:23:42.340]  Cutting the interest rates and all of this and they just, it's just denial.
[1:23:42.340 --> 1:23:44.340]  Denial will get you in deep trouble, folks.
[1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:46.340]  It's time to stop denying.
[1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:49.340]  We have a criminal, world government, militarizing the police,
[1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:52.340]  turning our country into a third world cesspit,
[1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:55.340]  and our basic fundamental rights are being scrapped.
[1:23:55.340 --> 1:23:57.340]  That ought to scare the daylights out of you.
[1:23:57.340 --> 1:23:59.340]  Tearing in your serious business.
[1:23:59.340 --> 1:24:01.340]  I gotta move quick here, man.
[1:24:01.340 --> 1:24:03.340]  Everybody sounds like they're stoned.
[1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:06.340]  I'm back on that whole rant there.
[1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:09.340]  By the way, I'm not letting out some secret that, oh, I've seen Joe Rogan smoke pot
[1:24:09.340 --> 1:24:11.340]  and I'm ratting out one of my friends.
[1:24:11.340 --> 1:24:15.340]  I was in a comedy TV show and they were going to shoot a scene.
[1:24:15.340 --> 1:24:16.340]  I was with Joe Rogan.
[1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:18.340]  He said, they want to be in this little TV piece.
[1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:19.340]  I said, sure, I'll come down.
[1:24:19.340 --> 1:24:25.340]  He was visiting here in Austin and then he starts smoking pot on camera for the scene.
[1:24:25.340 --> 1:24:28.340]  I'm like, hey, man, I don't really like marijuana.
[1:24:28.340 --> 1:24:30.340]  It's like, hey, want some?
[1:24:30.340 --> 1:24:31.340]  I'm like, no, I don't want that.
[1:24:31.340 --> 1:24:33.340]  I ended up being in the TV show.
[1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:34.340]  So no secret.
[1:24:34.340 --> 1:24:36.340]  Somebody was like on the message board going, what are you doing?
[1:24:36.340 --> 1:24:37.340]  Talk about how you smoke pot with him.
[1:24:37.340 --> 1:24:38.340]  I don't smoke pot.
[1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:39.340]  I don't, okay.
[1:24:39.340 --> 1:24:43.340]  It's one of the only drugs the government doesn't ship in, but I still don't smoke it
[1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:44.340]  because I don't like it.
[1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:48.340]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Colorado.
[1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:51.340]  Peter, you are on the air.
[1:24:51.340 --> 1:24:52.340]  Welcome.
[1:24:52.340 --> 1:24:55.340]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside talk?
[1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:57.340]  How dare you?
[1:24:57.340 --> 1:24:58.340]  I'm sorry?
[1:24:58.340 --> 1:24:59.340]  How dare you?
[1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:00.340]  Okay, I hear you.
[1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:03.340]  How dare you say that?
[1:25:03.340 --> 1:25:06.340]  Is this a joke?
[1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:09.340]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside talk?
[1:25:09.340 --> 1:25:12.340]  How dare you say we didn't land on the moon?
[1:25:12.340 --> 1:25:15.340]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside talk?
[1:25:15.340 --> 1:25:16.340]  How dare you?
[1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:17.340]  Is that all you can say?
[1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:22.340]  Are you like a, you like pull a string out and then it says it over and over again?
[1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:25.340]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside talk?
[1:25:25.340 --> 1:25:27.340]  You're a fucking nigger, man.
[1:25:27.340 --> 1:25:28.340]  Okay.
[1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:37.340]  I thought that call was a joke from Colorado.
[1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:43.340]  We had to delay it out and then he started screaming the n-word and calling me that.
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:46.340]  Just absolutely amazing.
[1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:49.340]  Listen, Troglodyte, don't worry.
[1:25:49.340 --> 1:25:52.340]  The people you think of your government are going to betray you.
[1:25:52.340 --> 1:25:56.340]  The corrupt, fake system you worship is a fraud and is lying to you.
[1:25:56.340 --> 1:25:58.340]  Number one, I believe we went to the moon.
[1:25:58.340 --> 1:26:00.340]  He also tried to mix that in.
[1:26:00.340 --> 1:26:13.340]  He would just say how dare you say 9-11 wasn't an inside job and then he then started cussing.
[1:26:13.340 --> 1:26:16.340]  Just absolutely amazing.
[1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:21.340]  I've also had these guys email me and say how dare me say our government stayed the Gulf of Tonkin.
[1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:23.340]  That's now declassified.
[1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:35.340]  It's now been the Chicago Tribune and declassified that Israel attacked USS Liberty knowing it was a U.S.S. ship to try to sink it so the U.S. would attack Egypt and the Soviet Union nuclear bombers were in the air.
[1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:38.340]  B-52s to Newt Russia.
[1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:40.340]  That's now all been declassified.
[1:26:40.340 --> 1:26:50.340]  Years after I had the admirals and all the different people who were involved on, to tell you it's now the NSA documents have now been released what, six months ago?
[1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:55.340]  Yes, the people running our government killed 3,000 people on 9-11.
[1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:57.340]  Let me try to explain something to you.
[1:26:57.340 --> 1:27:11.340]  It's in the news that our government is using real al-Qaeda, the number two and number three of al-Qaeda, Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia, to attack Shi'ite Iran and that they're blowing up mosque, police station, schools.
[1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:23.340]  And then Iran is now trying to get extradition of Iranian, to Iran, of Saudi Arabian bombers and the U.S. is protecting them, okay?
[1:27:23.340 --> 1:27:26.340]  The people that run our country, we shouldn't even say the U.S.
[1:27:26.340 --> 1:27:31.340]  People that use our name, use our troops, use our country, they created al-Qaeda.
[1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:33.340]  The British created them about 80 years ago.
[1:27:33.340 --> 1:27:37.340]  Then they used them against the Soviets, started the war with them, got the Soviets to come in.
[1:27:37.340 --> 1:27:40.340]  Contrary to Tom Hanks' stupid movie.
[1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:44.340]  The folks, by the way, ran that operation, lived right here in Austin.
[1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:50.340]  I didn't even know one time I was invited to a dinner and then I was suddenly at a dinner with these people and I was totally freaked me out.
[1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:54.340]  They weren't evil people to eat dinner with on the surface, but I already digress.
[1:27:54.340 --> 1:27:56.340]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:27:56.340 --> 1:28:00.340]  I mean, that guy who called in going, hell dare you, hell dare you.
[1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:01.340]  I thought it was a joke.
[1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:03.340]  And I was like, come on, can you say more?
[1:28:03.340 --> 1:28:09.340]  And then he started threatening and cussing and screaming you, effing, you know, inward.
[1:28:09.340 --> 1:28:12.340]  Well, that isn't an insult to me to call me a black person.
[1:28:12.340 --> 1:28:15.340]  I mean, I'm not black, but I know to you, you thought that really hurt me.
[1:28:15.340 --> 1:28:16.340]  You think I'm like you.
[1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:17.340]  Hey, it's black people.
[1:28:17.340 --> 1:28:20.340]  Look, you, you think you're patriotic.
[1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:22.340]  You think you're saving this country.
[1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:23.340]  You're not.
[1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:24.340]  Okay.
[1:28:24.340 --> 1:28:25.340]  You've been betrayed.
[1:28:25.340 --> 1:28:28.340]  They used al-Qaeda to attack Serbia.
[1:28:28.340 --> 1:28:30.340]  They're using al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:34.340]  Al-Qaeda is a pocket weapon that the globalists pull out and use.
[1:28:34.340 --> 1:28:40.340]  They radicalize the Muslims pre and post-World War II to take down secular governments in
[1:28:40.340 --> 1:28:41.340]  the Middle East.
[1:28:41.340 --> 1:28:43.340]  Al-Qaeda works for the globalists.
[1:28:43.340 --> 1:28:44.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:44.340 --> 1:29:13.340]  We'll be right back with us.
[1:29:14.340 --> 1:29:40.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:40.340 --> 1:30:06.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:30:06.340 --> 1:30:32.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:30:32.340 --> 1:30:58.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:30:58.340 --> 1:31:24.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:24.340 --> 1:31:50.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:50.340 --> 1:32:16.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:16.340 --> 1:32:42.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:42.340 --> 1:33:09.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:13.340]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[1:33:13.340 --> 1:33:17.340]  You're locked into the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:17.340 --> 1:33:19.340]  Let me just read a bunch of headlines.
[1:33:19.340 --> 1:33:21.340]  And we're going to go back to your calls and into more of the news.
[1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:22.340]  Look at this.
[1:33:22.340 --> 1:33:28.340]  South American Union of Nations established in Brazil.
[1:33:28.340 --> 1:33:29.340]  Okay.
[1:33:29.340 --> 1:33:30.340]  That's just a headline.
[1:33:30.340 --> 1:33:33.340]  Oil climbs to record above 135 a gallon.
[1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:34.340]  Denton County.
[1:33:34.340 --> 1:33:40.340]  No refusal weekend targets drunk drivers jamming needles in your arms on the side of the road.
[1:33:40.340 --> 1:33:45.340]  Massive surveillance program the federal government's conducting on 8 million potential suspects.
[1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:48.340]  Now it's 8 million I guess in the terror database.
[1:33:48.340 --> 1:33:49.340]  We're all terrorists.
[1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:50.340]  It's just ridiculous.
[1:33:50.340 --> 1:33:58.340]  A researcher famine killed 7 million people in the United States during the Great Depression.
[1:33:58.340 --> 1:34:01.340]  And that's when 90% of people lived on farms.
[1:34:01.340 --> 1:34:04.340]  Now think about a breakdown in society.
[1:34:04.340 --> 1:34:06.340]  Here's another one.
[1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:10.340]  Texas FLDS case rejected simply no evidence.
[1:34:10.340 --> 1:34:16.340]  It says that the CPS had no evidence on any of the people that they falsely arrested and the children they took.
[1:34:16.340 --> 1:34:17.340]  Doesn't matter.
[1:34:17.340 --> 1:34:20.340]  Those criminals will still have their way with those children.
[1:34:20.340 --> 1:34:22.340]  They're still going to harass the living daylights out of them.
[1:34:22.340 --> 1:34:24.340]  They do what they want when they want.
[1:34:24.340 --> 1:34:27.340]  There's no group more dangerous for children to be in the custody of the government.
[1:34:27.340 --> 1:34:35.340]  Just department numbers five times more likely to be abused in CPS custody than any other place.
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:39.340]  They're even safer in juvenile hall when they're older.
[1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:40.340]  That's just the facts.
[1:34:40.340 --> 1:34:42.340]  Very government is scum.
[1:34:42.340 --> 1:34:43.340]  Government is filth.
[1:34:43.340 --> 1:34:46.340]  Government is trash on average.
[1:34:46.340 --> 1:34:54.340]  I mean, you know, in a latrine, could you stick your hand down in there and maybe find somebody's wedding ring that fell off?
[1:34:54.340 --> 1:34:56.340]  I mean, maybe a diamond fell in the latrine.
[1:34:56.340 --> 1:34:59.340]  I'm not saying there might not be some good people in government.
[1:34:59.340 --> 1:35:06.340]  But in these key areas, a normal person doesn't want to go snatch kids and abuse people and taser people and have power.
[1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:08.340]  Whack jobs want that on average.
[1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:10.340]  So we got whack jobs running our society.
[1:35:10.340 --> 1:35:14.340]  And frankly, I'm just sick of all of you.
[1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:24.340]  And I know it's upsetting neocon listeners today that everything I've said is coming true and you're starting to realize that they're devaluing your dollar and raping you at the gas pump.
[1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:30.340]  But the New World Order is real and it's very upsetting for you right now.
[1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:34.340]  This story, Clinton apologizes for RFK assassination remark.
[1:35:34.340 --> 1:35:36.340]  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[1:35:36.340 --> 1:35:39.340]  I mean, if I ever have to look at that woman again, it'll be too soon.
[1:35:39.340 --> 1:35:42.340]  Quickly apologize Friday after her death threat.
[1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:43.340]  I'm sorry.
[1:35:43.340 --> 1:35:53.340]  Now, after citing the June 68 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy and defending her decision to keep running the Democratic presidential nomination despite increasing long odds.
[1:35:53.340 --> 1:36:01.340]  And yeah, she said, I better not give up because, you know, Kennedy got killed in June and that could happen to Obama.
[1:36:01.340 --> 1:36:04.340]  Thank God she didn't deny that's what she meant by it.
[1:36:04.340 --> 1:36:10.340]  But don't worry to all the racists out there who hate Obama and hate black people and are really freaked out.
[1:36:10.340 --> 1:36:22.340]  I mean, you notice all the white trash bevvies out there in the country are, you know, hard line yellow dog Democrats that want mailbox money, welfare money are all voting against Barack Obama.
[1:36:22.340 --> 1:36:24.340]  And all these liberal strongholds.
[1:36:24.340 --> 1:36:25.340]  Don't worry.
[1:36:25.340 --> 1:36:27.340]  He doesn't run anything.
[1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:30.340]  I mean, Bush doesn't run anything.
[1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:32.340]  McCain, Hillary, it doesn't matter.
[1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:34.340]  Don't you understand their puppets?
[1:36:34.340 --> 1:36:36.340]  Don't you get the country's bankrupt?
[1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:38.340]  Don't you understand they built FEMA camps?
[1:36:38.340 --> 1:36:42.340]  Don't you understand we're entering a long dark night of the Republic?
[1:36:42.340 --> 1:36:46.340]  You've had your way, America.
[1:36:46.340 --> 1:36:51.340]  Your ignorance has brought us to hell and back.
[1:36:51.340 --> 1:36:55.340]  Oh, God.
[1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:57.340]  They're all bad.
[1:36:57.340 --> 1:36:59.340]  I wouldn't vote for either one of them.
[1:36:59.340 --> 1:37:06.340]  Why do we get 60% turnout for presidential races and then 8% turnout for local or the real powers at?
[1:37:06.340 --> 1:37:11.340]  Because the media gives you a spectacle, gives you the false left-right choice.
[1:37:11.340 --> 1:37:15.340]  It's like, you want me to punch you in the face with my left hand or my right hand?
[1:37:15.340 --> 1:37:18.340]  Tell you what, let's just get Paul in here in studio.
[1:37:18.340 --> 1:37:21.340]  Paul, come in here, I'm going to ask you on camera.
[1:37:21.340 --> 1:37:22.340]  I'm right over here.
[1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:25.340]  You want me to slap you with my left hand or my right hand?
[1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:27.340]  Really?
[1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:29.340]  Trey?
[1:37:29.340 --> 1:37:31.340]  Trey, can I have a choice?
[1:37:31.340 --> 1:37:34.340]  Paul, you can punch me with your left or right hand.
[1:37:34.340 --> 1:37:35.340]  That's a choice.
[1:37:35.340 --> 1:37:39.340]  Or how about you could shoot me in the head with your left hand or your right hand?
[1:37:39.340 --> 1:37:43.340]  The hands are attached to arms that are attached to the New World Order.
[1:37:43.340 --> 1:37:46.340]  What are you going to say something, Trey?
[1:37:46.340 --> 1:37:49.340]  No, I was just saying I'd take the left.
[1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:50.340]  Well, yes, statistically.
[1:37:50.340 --> 1:37:53.340]  But let's say the arms were both the same size.
[1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:56.340]  Oh, God, I'm like a fiddler crab like everybody else.
[1:37:56.340 --> 1:37:58.340]  All right, one arm's bigger than the other.
[1:37:58.340 --> 1:38:00.340]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:38:00.340 --> 1:38:01.340]  Some days I come in here.
[1:38:01.340 --> 1:38:02.340]  I mean, look at this news I've got.
[1:38:02.340 --> 1:38:04.340]  Just look.
[1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:08.340]  Bilderberg luminaries select Obama's running mate.
[1:38:08.340 --> 1:38:10.340]  Dutch Embassy, Deep Six's Bilderberg information.
[1:38:10.340 --> 1:38:15.340]  They'd posted where their prime minister was going and pulled it off their presidential site.
[1:38:15.340 --> 1:38:16.340]  Oh, man.
[1:38:16.340 --> 1:38:20.340]  Pennsylvania Turnpike on verge of 75 year lease to Spanish company.
[1:38:20.340 --> 1:38:21.340]  Same one taken over our roads.
[1:38:21.340 --> 1:38:29.340]  The toll road operator, the $12.8 million offer may say another piece of U.S. sold off to foreign investors.
[1:38:29.340 --> 1:38:36.340]  And it turns out they're getting a 75 year lease when this is only the amount of money they'll make in the next 10 years.
[1:38:36.340 --> 1:38:38.340]  Saying that's a bad business deal.
[1:38:38.340 --> 1:38:40.340]  But see, it's all strip mining.
[1:38:40.340 --> 1:38:42.340]  The politicians sell it off.
[1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:48.340]  They then get their daughters, their wives, their husbands, literally all get jobs with the company doing nothing.
[1:38:48.340 --> 1:38:50.340]  Mailbox money again.
[1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:52.340]  See, that's what's scary about government.
[1:38:52.340 --> 1:38:55.340]  They're all just grabbing, selling everything.
[1:38:55.340 --> 1:38:58.340]  I'd liken the country to a mansion.
[1:38:58.340 --> 1:39:04.340]  They've pulled out the carpet and the drapes and the furniture and the paintings and the fixtures.
[1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:09.340]  And now they're ripping out the marble floor and ripping out the sinks and ripping out the bathtubs and ripping out the beams and ripping out the
[1:39:09.340 --> 1:39:14.340]  flower planters.
[1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:16.340]  I mean, they're just looting it.
[1:39:16.340 --> 1:39:20.340]  While telling us it's all to stop Al Qaeda, of course.
[1:39:20.340 --> 1:39:24.340]  Safety lapses, raise risk in trailers for Katrina victims.
[1:39:24.340 --> 1:39:27.340]  U.S. residents and military brigs.
[1:39:27.340 --> 1:39:31.340]  Government says it's war, AP.
[1:39:31.340 --> 1:39:33.340]  Look at these headlines.
[1:39:33.340 --> 1:39:38.340]  CIA protects Al Qaeda group from extradition.
[1:39:38.340 --> 1:39:41.340]  Bush, early Iraq withdrawal would be catastrophic.
[1:39:41.340 --> 1:39:43.340]  I thought we'd be out of there in six months.
[1:39:43.340 --> 1:39:44.340]  You promised.
[1:39:44.340 --> 1:39:46.340]  Oh, it's early to leave in six years.
[1:39:46.340 --> 1:39:48.340]  Fingerprint registry and housing bill.
[1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:51.340]  Notice how you hear all teachers got to be fingerprinted.
[1:39:51.340 --> 1:39:54.340]  And then all government workers have got to be thumb scanned to get in.
[1:39:54.340 --> 1:39:57.340]  And then, oh, now all realtors and then you want to associate it.
[1:39:57.340 --> 1:39:59.340]  That's federal.
[1:39:59.340 --> 1:40:03.340]  And then it funny, Texas passed a bill right before the Feds did.
[1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:04.340]  See, it's all unified.
[1:40:04.340 --> 1:40:08.340]  They all get them up at the national associations of counties and cities and city managers.
[1:40:08.340 --> 1:40:09.340]  And it's all internet.
[1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:12.340]  The same stuff we do here, they do in Australia at the same time.
[1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:14.340]  Because it's all globally run.
[1:40:14.340 --> 1:40:18.340]  Getting you ready to buy and sell with your thumbprint.
[1:40:18.340 --> 1:40:21.340]  Just wait.
[1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:24.340]  Fingerprint software integrated with medical marijuana dispensary.
[1:40:24.340 --> 1:40:26.340]  Oh, you want your marijuana dopeds.
[1:40:26.340 --> 1:40:29.340]  You got to be thumb scanned to get it.
[1:40:29.340 --> 1:40:33.340]  Employment verification plan triggers fears of big brother.
[1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:35.340]  McClatchy newspapers.
[1:40:35.340 --> 1:40:40.340]  And it goes on to say the Feds are going to make you have an ID that's biometrically scanned to have a job.
[1:40:40.340 --> 1:40:42.340]  But they say it'll stop illegals.
[1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:45.340]  But the illegals are going to be legalized under the guest worker.
[1:40:45.340 --> 1:40:46.340]  That's what that is.
[1:40:46.340 --> 1:40:48.340]  We all go under this.
[1:40:48.340 --> 1:40:50.340]  You understand, they're not arresting the illegals, folks.
[1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:54.340]  They arrest a thousand here, a thousand there, out of four million that pour in each year.
[1:40:54.340 --> 1:40:58.340]  It's all dog and pony shows.
[1:40:58.340 --> 1:41:01.340]  NBC, Army stop-loss policy, a backdoor draft.
[1:41:01.340 --> 1:41:03.340]  Now, it's a frontdoor draft.
[1:41:03.340 --> 1:41:06.340]  You've already served three tours in Iraq.
[1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:08.340]  And they say, we're sending you back for a fourth.
[1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:11.340]  Doesn't matter if your papers say you're out.
[1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:14.340]  Spending on Iraq poorly tracked.
[1:41:14.340 --> 1:41:16.340]  That's a funny way of saying it.
[1:41:16.340 --> 1:41:20.340]  Audit faults accounting for $15 billion missing.
[1:41:20.340 --> 1:41:25.340]  Folks, the mainstream media always reports on things like trucks, beds,
[1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:30.340]  rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, you know, low-level theft.
[1:41:30.340 --> 1:41:35.340]  Two days before 9-11, the AP reported $1.9 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[1:41:35.340 --> 1:41:37.340]  You go, wait a minute.
[1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:39.340]  The whole Pentagon budget is $800 billion a year.
[1:41:39.340 --> 1:41:41.340]  At that time, $500 billion.
[1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:43.340]  How would there be trillions missing?
[1:41:43.340 --> 1:41:45.340]  All the pension funds, all the investments.
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:47.340]  It was all transferred out of the country.
[1:41:47.340 --> 1:41:48.340]  That's all the Pentagon says.
[1:41:48.340 --> 1:41:51.340]  And I've got video, Rumsfeld, in front of Congress saying,
[1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:53.340]  I won't tell you where it is.
[1:41:53.340 --> 1:41:54.340]  Oh, no.
[1:41:54.340 --> 1:41:56.340]  These guys aren't involved in any terrorism.
[1:41:56.340 --> 1:41:58.340]  There's just trillions missing.
[1:41:58.340 --> 1:42:01.340]  They just do whatever they want.
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:02.340]  Here's another one.
[1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:07.340]  Democrats seek Iraq embezzlement probe.
[1:42:07.340 --> 1:42:13.340]  Yeah, well, if the happy hooligans from North Dakota wouldn't have refused orders
[1:42:13.340 --> 1:42:18.340]  and shot down Flight 93, it was scheduled to go right into the Capitol.
[1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:21.340]  See, that would have shut the Capitol up real quick.
[1:42:21.340 --> 1:42:24.340]  Under Bush's continuity of government, he can just declare himself dictator,
[1:42:24.340 --> 1:42:29.340]  Obama, Hillary, any of the puppets, and that won't matter.
[1:42:29.340 --> 1:42:30.340]  Okay, I got a bunch of other news.

[1:45:49.340 --> 1:45:54.340]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:58.340]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma. How can we improve the air we breathe?
[1:45:58.340 --> 1:46:01.340]  The answer is clear. Himalayan crystal salt lamps from Ionic salts.
[1:46:01.340 --> 1:46:05.340]  These lamps naturally improve indoor air quality without adding toxic ozone.
[1:46:05.340 --> 1:46:09.340]  Lighted Himalayan crystal salt lamps neutralize allergens and irritants in the air,
[1:46:09.340 --> 1:46:14.340]  including dander, pollen, mold, and fungi, and are effective in reducing symptoms of asthma,
[1:46:14.340 --> 1:46:18.340]  allergies, headaches, and airborne vapors from paint, furniture, and carpeting.

[1:47:05.340 --> 1:47:14.340]  Yep, on this Memorial Day coming up tomorrow, remember that our veterans supposedly, they tell us, fought for liberty, freedom, due process, land of the free, home of the brave.
[1:47:14.340 --> 1:47:23.340]  Ask yourself, is that what we are now? We're a nation overrun by legal aliens that hate this country openly.
[1:47:23.340 --> 1:47:29.340]  There's a Mexican radio station in Austin called The Race.
[1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:35.340]  The motto is, for those inside the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[1:47:35.340 --> 1:47:39.340]  Our liberties are gone, ladies and gentlemen, this country is falling apart.
[1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:46.340]  And it's positive that I'm on air telling you that. We need to get mad about this, get upset about this, get involved.
[1:47:46.340 --> 1:47:52.340]  Alright, I'm going to go to... Who was the caller actually hung up on earlier that I said I was going to go back to?
[1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:57.340]  We're going to go to Steve, then we're going to go to Sam in Germany. Steve, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:47:57.340 --> 1:48:00.340]  Thanks for giving me back on.
[1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:04.340]  Okay, so you go in the tire place, they're griping about, oil process going up, I actually cut you off.
[1:48:04.340 --> 1:48:08.340]  Right, and before I get back to that, I just want to make a personal comment.
[1:48:08.340 --> 1:48:15.340]  I am so sorry to be an evil, mean, bad, rebellious, stiff-necked, nonconformist, feudal slave.
[1:48:15.340 --> 1:48:21.340]  But I'm going to do what they don't want me to do, and that you, the brain guy, gave me and think critically and then speak out in response.
[1:48:21.340 --> 1:48:24.340]  That's Al-Qaeda, that's Al-Qaeda asking questions.
[1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:27.340]  Right, I know, yeah, we just can't do that.
[1:48:27.340 --> 1:48:29.340]  Being tazored to death is good.
[1:48:29.340 --> 1:48:32.340]  And I'm sorry, I'm going to do like our founding fathers did, I'm going to rebel.
[1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:35.340]  They were bad, and you get arrested for talking about them.
[1:48:35.340 --> 1:48:39.340]  By the way, I'm not joking, I have state police arrested people for constitutions.
[1:48:39.340 --> 1:48:42.340]  They find it and go, who can't believe we got one.
[1:48:42.340 --> 1:48:44.340]  I'm not joking listeners, this is not a joke, go ahead.
[1:48:44.340 --> 1:48:59.340]  Well, see the thing is that this is now personal for me because my friend Jeff is the one you interviewed from the Bible college that had the DHS guy show up and accused him of committing an act of terrorism and espionage for talking to Boy Scouts about the Constitution.
[1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:01.340]  I know, the average idiot out there doesn't know what we're telling the truth.
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:04.340]  But listen, I don't have a lot of time, I got to hurry with the other callers.
[1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:05.340]  You want to tell the story about the oil.
[1:49:05.340 --> 1:49:09.340]  Right, so what happened was I was in this tire store and I heard these guys talking about it.
[1:49:09.340 --> 1:49:15.340]  Who the oil companies think they're fooling, saying the price per bail doesn't affect the price of the gas, the pump.
[1:49:15.340 --> 1:49:21.340]  And I chimed in, and this is why I appreciate your show being armed with the truth, which is our greatest weapon.
[1:49:21.340 --> 1:49:30.340]  I said, well, they're giving you a half truth because they said actually the main reason that has to do with it, but the main reason is the devaluation of the dollar.
[1:49:30.340 --> 1:49:34.340]  And this one guy, it's like a white one out in his head and he said, yeah, you know you're right.
[1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:36.340]  And this is the thing that people need to understand.
[1:49:36.340 --> 1:49:39.340]  They will never say that in the media. It's like a big secret.
[1:49:39.340 --> 1:49:48.340]  I mean, I hear these financial shows and I appreciate your call talking about, you get your 8% annual in this mutual fund and I'm like, none of it matters.
[1:49:48.340 --> 1:49:55.340]  We've got 15% inflation, 13% if you want to be conservative, compounded.
[1:49:55.340 --> 1:49:59.340]  You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:49:59.340 --> 1:50:00.340]  Oh my gosh.
[1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:04.340]  And by the way, that's what we have domestically, internationally.
[1:50:04.340 --> 1:50:08.340]  That's, oh my gosh, I'm very upset about this.
[1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:09.340]  Let's go ahead and take it.
[1:50:09.340 --> 1:50:12.340]  I mean, you know what it means to the economy in our future?
[1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:18.340]  I mean, how are they going to keep 2 million cops hired and all these bureaucrats when everything's going bankrupt?
[1:50:18.340 --> 1:50:22.340]  They're just going to write more tickets and squeeze harder.
[1:50:22.340 --> 1:50:25.340]  Go ahead, you're on the air from Germany, Sam.
[1:50:25.340 --> 1:50:27.340]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing, Patriot?
[1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:28.340]  Thank you for holding from Deutschland.
[1:50:28.340 --> 1:50:29.340]  What's on your mind today?
[1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:36.340]  Alex, I wanted to be a real world valuer here for the devaluation of the freaking dollar over here in Europe.
[1:50:36.340 --> 1:50:40.340]  Let me tell you about the euro and how it's just beaten dollar down into the ground.
[1:50:40.340 --> 1:50:46.340]  You know, I don't know if you've seen it today, but like the official exchange rate is like a, you pay a dollar and 57 cents for one euro.
[1:50:46.340 --> 1:50:48.340]  And that's if you trade millions.
[1:50:48.340 --> 1:50:55.340]  You take $4,700 over here, you'll come over, you know, over to Europe, you'll come over, you'll end up here with 2,700 euros.
[1:50:55.340 --> 1:50:56.340]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:50:56.340 --> 1:51:00.340]  And I'm just average Joe, small guy, I just want to let everybody know it's real.
[1:51:00.340 --> 1:51:01.340]  It's not made up.
[1:51:01.340 --> 1:51:02.340]  No, Germany doesn't exist.
[1:51:02.340 --> 1:51:03.340]  Nothing exists.
[1:51:03.340 --> 1:51:07.340]  Police in black uniforms, tasering people to death is good.
[1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:09.340]  FEMA camps are good.
[1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:11.340]  Millions of people in prisons good.
[1:51:11.340 --> 1:51:12.340]  No.
[1:51:12.340 --> 1:51:14.340]  Well, go, Alex.
[1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:15.340]  Rock the world, you know.
[1:51:15.340 --> 1:51:17.340]  So, I mean, what is it like in Germany?
[1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:19.340]  Are they worried as the dollar implodes?
[1:51:19.340 --> 1:51:20.340]  Yes, they are.
[1:51:20.340 --> 1:51:24.340]  They're saying that if it keeps getting worse and worse, it's going to affect Germany adversely.
[1:51:24.340 --> 1:51:33.340]  And especially some of the other countries in Europe that have, you know, based so much of their, you know, their financial data on the dollar,
[1:51:33.340 --> 1:51:34.340]  Germany doesn't have as much.
[1:51:34.340 --> 1:51:35.340]  That's right.
[1:51:35.340 --> 1:51:38.340]  It's causing massive devaluation everywhere.
[1:51:38.340 --> 1:51:40.340]  It's causing global inflation.
[1:51:40.340 --> 1:51:41.340]  Absolutely.
[1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:43.340]  I was pissed off in America about it.
[1:51:43.340 --> 1:51:49.340]  Alex, I'm pissed off that you can't even travel two oceans or an ocean away and have to still deal with this new world order crap.
[1:51:49.340 --> 1:51:50.340]  This stuff's got to end, Alex.
[1:51:50.340 --> 1:51:53.340]  I hear you, and I appreciate you over there.
[1:51:53.340 --> 1:52:01.340]  Unfortunately, we had it so good in the land of the free home of the brave that criminals came in, got good at conning people and good at PR.
[1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:09.340]  I mean, when you hear about global warming, folks, that's about taxes and social workers in your house, in your business, telling you what to do.
[1:52:09.340 --> 1:52:13.340]  You know, Barack Obama says oil prices are a good thing as it teaches us to get little cars.
[1:52:13.340 --> 1:52:15.340]  It's all a scam.
[1:52:15.340 --> 1:52:19.340]  It's our dollar's been devalued.
[1:52:19.340 --> 1:52:21.340]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[1:52:21.340 --> 1:52:23.340]  Let's talk to Mike in Oregon.
[1:52:23.340 --> 1:52:25.340]  Thanks for holding Mike around the year.
[1:52:25.340 --> 1:52:27.340]  Thank you very much indeed, sir.
[1:52:27.340 --> 1:52:29.340]  And great shows always.
[1:52:29.340 --> 1:52:32.340]  Everything you say is nothing but the truth.
[1:52:32.340 --> 1:52:38.340]  And that's a stupid guy who said 911 wasn't the inside job.
[1:52:38.340 --> 1:52:40.340]  It's absolutely wrong.
[1:52:40.340 --> 1:52:42.340]  911 was inside job.
[1:52:42.340 --> 1:52:44.340]  I tell it today.
[1:52:44.340 --> 1:52:45.340]  I tell it tomorrow.
[1:52:45.340 --> 1:52:47.340]  I tell it 100 years from now.
[1:52:47.340 --> 1:52:51.340]  And regarding Iran's situation, I would like to speak with you, sir.
[1:52:51.340 --> 1:53:02.340]  And when the Bush went to Israel for the 60th anniversary of the Zionist regime, then have secret meetings.
[1:53:02.340 --> 1:53:10.340]  And then the Jerusalem Post came out and said, Bush says he's going to attack Iran before he leaves office.
[1:53:10.340 --> 1:53:12.340]  Exactly indeed.
[1:53:12.340 --> 1:53:30.340]  And then another news, Russia officials told to Iran that to give three islands that were taken by the Shah of Iran during the war in 1967-68 with Bahrain.
[1:53:30.340 --> 1:53:34.340]  And actually Bahrain was part of Iran anyway.
[1:53:34.340 --> 1:53:36.340]  But they separated.
[1:53:36.340 --> 1:53:38.340]  But I'm an American.
[1:53:38.340 --> 1:53:40.340]  Why should I even care where countries are?
[1:53:40.340 --> 1:53:46.340]  I'm not going to tell Iran cheeseburgers in my mouth, drink beer, and think that warrantless checkpoints with police taking blood out of them is freedom.
[1:53:46.340 --> 1:53:52.340]  Why should I know that if we attack Iran, that we'll be paying $12 a gallon for gas for at least a year?
[1:53:52.340 --> 1:54:00.340]  Why should I care that all they got to do is blow up a few ships and sink them in the Strait of Hormuz and shut down a fourth of the oil supply?
[1:54:00.340 --> 1:54:04.340]  Why should I care if the whole world will even hate us even more?
[1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:09.340]  Why should I care if the White House writes memos saying they can torture small children in front of their parents with pliers?
[1:54:09.340 --> 1:54:11.340]  That's freedom, sir.
[1:54:11.340 --> 1:54:14.340]  Why should I care?
[1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:18.340]  There is a reason we should care because we love this country.
[1:54:18.340 --> 1:54:20.340]  But freedom is bad, sir.
[1:54:20.340 --> 1:54:28.340]  We need to get the new idea and be neocons or be liberals and decide that CPS kidnapping our children without due process is good.
[1:54:28.340 --> 1:54:30.340]  Let me get serious for a minute.
[1:54:30.340 --> 1:54:35.340]  Are you more afraid of criminals and the average person in the street or are you afraid of the government?
[1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:36.340]  You're afraid of the government.
[1:54:36.340 --> 1:54:37.340]  You know they're bad.
[1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:39.340]  You know they're scum.
[1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:43.340]  Now, the government's got a lot of good people in it, but those directing it from the top are bad.
[1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:44.340]  It is illegitimate.
[1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:45.340]  It is rotten.
[1:54:45.340 --> 1:54:46.340]  It is disgusting.
[1:54:46.340 --> 1:54:50.340]  It's crimes are so legion I can't even list them here.
[1:54:50.340 --> 1:54:52.340]  I mean, it's mind blowing the news I've got.
[1:54:52.340 --> 1:54:55.340]  The news I haven't even covered today.
[1:54:55.340 --> 1:54:58.340]  It's just incredible.
[1:54:58.340 --> 1:55:03.340]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[1:55:03.340 --> 1:55:05.340]  Who's up next here?
[1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:07.340]  Jonah?
[1:55:07.340 --> 1:55:08.340]  Vaughn in Nashville.
[1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:09.340]  You're on the air.
[1:55:09.340 --> 1:55:10.340]  Go ahead.
[1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:12.340]  It's heavy on road, but I can talk to you.
[1:55:12.340 --> 1:55:16.340]  First place, I would just like to apologize to We Are Change, Ohio.
[1:55:16.340 --> 1:55:22.340]  We Are Change Kentucky because I was trying to hold them down at the Oliver North thing this past weekend and it kind of dissolved on me at the last minute.
[1:55:22.340 --> 1:55:25.340]  I just want to send a shout out to them because I was definitely there with them.
[1:55:25.340 --> 1:55:28.340]  So you're having a private discussion with them on a syndicated radio show.
[1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:31.340]  I don't even know what you're talking about, so how are they going to know?
[1:55:31.340 --> 1:55:32.340]  Of course.
[1:55:32.340 --> 1:55:34.340]  But I don't understand what you're talking about.
[1:55:34.340 --> 1:55:36.340]  Go ahead and talk to Gary in California.
[1:55:36.340 --> 1:55:38.340]  Go ahead, Gary, you're on the air.
[1:55:38.340 --> 1:55:39.340]  Yeah, this is Gary.
[1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:40.340]  Hey, I want to talk about the...
[1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:42.340]  It says Gary right here on my screen.
[1:55:42.340 --> 1:55:44.340]  So I'm calling you, Gary.
[1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:45.340]  Oh, yeah.
[1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:47.340]  I'm calling you out.
[1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:49.340]  You're part of the esoteric agenda, right?
[1:55:49.340 --> 1:55:50.340]  Yes.
[1:55:50.340 --> 1:56:03.340]  You know, I'm trying to figure out how Hillary thinks she'd become president because I noticed in there after watching it happen as a dinosaur that says that, you know, if you weren't connected to the British dynasty, you know, the clinging and all that stuff.
[1:56:03.340 --> 1:56:05.340]  I can't find out where she's connected.
[1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:06.340]  Well, that's right.
[1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:16.340]  Obama is through Cheney and all of his major bloodlines on his mommy's side linked back to the Queenie there, like all U.S. presidents do.
[1:56:16.340 --> 1:56:18.340]  And she does have the...
[1:56:18.340 --> 1:56:20.340]  I mean, he does have the bloodline.
[1:56:20.340 --> 1:56:21.340]  Hillary doesn't.
[1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:22.340]  Hillary doesn't.
[1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:24.340]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:56:24.340 --> 1:56:26.340]  I mean, Barack Obama, all of them.
[1:56:26.340 --> 1:56:27.340]  Who cares?
[1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:28.340]  They're puppets.
[1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:29.340]  They don't run anything.
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:35.340]  And I think you know, too, you know, there's this morning, you don't have follow, you know, Michael Tarantino, right?
[1:56:35.340 --> 1:56:37.340]  Say that again?
[1:56:37.340 --> 1:56:38.340]  T-A-R.
[1:56:38.340 --> 1:56:39.340]  I don't understand you.
[1:56:39.340 --> 1:56:40.340]  I'm sorry.
[1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:41.340]  I'm not being mean.
[1:56:41.340 --> 1:56:43.340]  I'm just out of time here to the callers.
[1:56:43.340 --> 1:56:48.340]  And I personally just, just some days don't care anymore.
[1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:50.340]  I have to be quite honest with you.
[1:56:50.340 --> 1:56:54.340]  Great job to the crew in there today running things.
[1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:58.340]  I want to thank all the listeners, all the affiliates, all the sponsors.
[1:56:58.340 --> 1:57:00.340]  I love this country.
[1:57:00.340 --> 1:57:02.340]  We've been the greatest nation in the history of the world.
[1:57:02.340 --> 1:57:07.340]  But we're the spoiled rotten kids, the spoiled rotten kids of spoiled rotten kids.
[1:57:07.340 --> 1:57:09.340]  We've gotten pretty decadent.
[1:57:09.340 --> 1:57:12.340]  And let me tell you, I've studied history.
[1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:16.340]  And I can't believe how evil the New World Order is or what they're setting up.
[1:57:16.340 --> 1:57:20.340]  All of you out there better realize that sitting this out isn't going to protect you.
[1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:26.340]  You've got to get involved now to fight tyranny and fight evil and get out there and take on corruption.
[1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:29.340]  Or it's going to eat your lunch, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:29.340 --> 1:57:33.340]  If you don't stand up against corruption, hard core tyranny comes.
[1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:36.340]  Government's killed over 200 million people last century.
[1:57:36.340 --> 1:57:37.340]  They're gearing up to do it here.
[1:57:37.340 --> 1:57:39.340]  I'm not going quietly into the night.
[1:57:39.340 --> 1:57:40.340]  God bless you all.
[1:57:40.340 --> 1:57:41.340]  See you back.

[1:58:40.340 --> 1:58:44.340]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution
[1:58:44.340 --> 1:58:47.340]  and its curse on world health is staggering.

[1:58:51.340 --> 1:58:54.340]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design,
[1:58:54.340 --> 1:58:59.340]  but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
