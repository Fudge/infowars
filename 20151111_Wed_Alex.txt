[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:06.148]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:07.909]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:09.670]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.251]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:12.792]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:27.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.702 --> 00:00:32.025]  If you look at photos of Hillary Clinton, she is clearly ill.
[00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.962]  And is deteriorating very, very quickly.
[00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:40.246]  And does not look like someone who should even be working.
[00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:47.212]  Much less, at close to 70 years of age, attempting to be the leader of the supposed free world.
[00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:58.400]  But if you go to DrudgeReport.com, you can see the latest images of her on the campaign trail, and then comparisons of her just a few years ago, looking completely insane.
[00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:04.662]  Looking completely whacked out of her brain on all those high-tech drugs they've got.
[00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:06.863]  We know the Clintons are huge drug heads.
[00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:08.604]  They're party animals.
[00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:10.504]  And they're also into desecrating America.
[00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:16.486]  They love putting Mao and Stalin and Lenin Christmas ornaments on the tree.
[00:01:16.486 --> 00:01:17.346]  That's been confirmed.
[00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:18.827]  People say, what's the point of that?
[00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:20.507]  That's just kind of silly and stupid.
[00:01:20.507 --> 00:01:22.688]  It's about desecrating.
[00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:26.689]  I tuned in to local radio this morning, two different shock jock stations.
[00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.150]  I just happened to be tuned to the dial.
[00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:52.519]  And I both channels were bad-mouthing Christians and saying they were insane and that there was no war on Christmas and that Starbucks wasn't removing the just Christmas symbols, not even Christian ones, but winter festival symbols like snowflakes and Christmas trees, cannon bombs from their cups because of political correctness.
[00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:57.601]  The company admitted they did it to be quote more inclusive.
[00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.222]  I mean Starbucks admittedly
[00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:14.396]  has these programs where they ask you why you're a racist because you're white or how many black people have you talked to today to inject racial division.
[00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:28.722]  But I was tuning in not just to MSNBC, which we know puts up a talking point, but I was listening to local radio and both shows within about five minutes, because I only listened for about 10 or 15, both of them cited MSNBC and were playing clips of it.
[00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.571]  That's how unified these people are in their propaganda.
[00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.352]  Even local radio laughing, going, there's no war on Christians.
[00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:47.875]  No, the UN just admits that they're murdering Christians by the hundreds of thousands a year worldwide, and that there's more persecution of Christians than all other groups combined.
[00:02:49.278 --> 00:03:02.626]  And they're taking crosses down everywhere, and they're harassing churches, and they are harassing Christians in schools, saying they have no free speech, and that you can't thank God during your Vow of Victorian speech, even though that's your free speech.
[00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:08.189]  Separation of Church and State is, the school doesn't have an official religion, if it's public.
[00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.252]  But you can say whatever you want during open discussion time.
[00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:17.035]  And now that extends to the Missouri school system, college system,
[00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:27.606]  Where you've got professors running around screaming saying, no press, no photos in the middle of the commons, out on a green grass park in the middle of the college.
[00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:31.871]  We control the area, get me muscle, run these people down.
[00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:37.297]  And then you see reporters being run down by a mob of cultists.
[00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:39.924]  And that's who these people are.
[00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:42.846]  Oh, but there's no war on free speech at the colleges.
[00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:47.349]  They're just shredding constitutions at colleges all over the country.
[00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.913]  If they find you handing them out, and you're even a student there, you're arrested.
[00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:59.577]  You can hand out anything else you want but the founding document that those police officers have sworn an oath to.
[00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:02.618]  That's how whacked out and upside down this is.
[00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:19.223]  Now the supposed professor that called in the muscle and was directing the folks, running people over, she ran a stunt thinking the public's stupid yesterday and resigned as media coordinator in the journalism department.
[00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:20.484]  That's an unpaid position.
[00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:25.466]  To nanny state and control speech is the only reason she was part of it.
[00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:26.826]  We're investigating her right now.
[00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:29.448]  She's exactly what we thought she'd be.
[00:04:29.448 --> 00:04:37.431]  She still is a fully paid professor there and did not resign from sucking money off of the partially state-funded university.
[00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:46.796]  So the parasite is fully borrowed in enjoying a blood meal of taxpayer money while trying to annihilate free speech and create a commissariat within the school.
[00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:50.036]  That's what she's doing.
[00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:52.277]  That's my view on this creature.
[00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:53.257]  Alright, it's all coming up.
[00:04:53.257 --> 00:04:55.097]  A bunch of big guests today as well.
[00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:58.598]  We'll break down the debate and more.

[00:06:58.621 --> 00:06:59.842]  I want my candy!
[00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:00.542]  I want my baby again!
[00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:01.063]  Mine!
[00:07:01.063 --> 00:07:01.823]  Mine!
[00:07:01.823 --> 00:07:01.923]  Mine!
[00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:29.381]  I think so.
[00:08:10.058 --> 00:08:13.642]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:13.642 --> 00:08:22.732]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:26.256]  Well, when it comes to news, I am overloaded.
[00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:26.836]  I am like a...
[00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:36.252]  Hungry junkyard dog that hadn't eaten in a week that has been thrown into the middle of a butcher shop.
[00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:45.178]  There are just every conceivable cutlet of meat hanging and on tables piled up to the ceiling.
[00:08:45.178 --> 00:08:47.260]  I don't even know what to chomp into first.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.701]  This is incredible.
[00:08:49.687 --> 00:08:58.153]  We have Major General Albert Stubblebine, former head of Special Forces, former head of Army Intelligence, and Dr. Reema Labo joining us.
[00:08:58.153 --> 00:09:14.346]  The General has been signaling the alarm, along with his medical doctor wife, that the mass culling and the cutoff of resources worldwide that will cause a systemic collapse of civilization and billions to starve to death in the next decade has begun.
[00:09:14.966 --> 00:09:17.828]  And I concur with their analysis.
[00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:19.449]  So that is coming up.
[00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:27.014]  Anthony Gucciardi will be hosting the fourth hour we've added of Overdrive because there's so much breaking news and things unfolding.
[00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:34.679]  So again, thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, the 11th day of November 2015.
[00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:44.543]  That said, when I talk about information overload, amazing debates last night.
[00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:52.325]  I've got to say Rand Paul really shined last night, and not because I'm a Paul supporter and friends with him and know he's for real.
[00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:56.126]  I've been a critic of him not being more hardcore and more aggressive.
[00:09:56.126 --> 00:09:57.687]  His father, of course, was on last week.
[00:10:01.974 --> 00:10:06.502]  What I'm getting at is, I don't get up here and say he did a great job in debates just to say it.
[00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:07.945]  The last few debates he did okay.
[00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:12.173]  He did really good last night, and I have to say was probably one of the winners.
[00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:13.455]  A couple people did well, but...
[00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:28.650]  I watched our live coverage and analysis with our crew last night, breaking it down, and I think their points were spot on, and much better analysis than what we saw from mainstream media in the aftermath last night.
[00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:34.394]  In fact, they were all up here until about midnight, but I'm encouraging them as soon as they can to edit down some of the highlights.
[00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:38.296]  of their commentary on the debate and if they are able to do it today.
[00:10:38.296 --> 00:10:43.318]  I'll air it today if not tomorrow or probably on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[00:10:43.318 --> 00:10:44.639]  So we got that to deal with.
[00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:53.423]  The situation in the Missouri State system has just intensified and we knew there'd be no end.
[00:10:54.671 --> 00:11:03.299]  It turns out the main agitator with the hunger strike that obviously is fake, in my view, watching it, because over several weeks he didn't lose any weight.
[00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:05.501]  I've gone back and looked at the videos.
[00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:10.145]  It turns out his father alone makes $8 million a year.
[00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:13.769]  The family's worth more than $20 million a year.
[00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:17.592]  He himself is very wealthy and they are jacked into the inside.
[00:11:17.592 --> 00:11:18.193]  And of course they are.
[00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:21.259]  You know who's big in the railroads?
[00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:22.039]  That's right.
[00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:22.999]  I looked it up this morning.
[00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:27.941]  I meant to go give it to Kit Daniels, but when I walked in there, I forgot I'd sent him to Missouri with Jakari Jackson.
[00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:32.722]  They'll be on at 1.30 today to report as well.
[00:11:32.722 --> 00:11:38.824]  I'm still double-checking it, but it appears the railroad is part Soros-owned.
[00:11:38.824 --> 00:11:43.065]  So, it looks like we may have another Soros operative.
[00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:44.026]  Of course it is.
[00:11:44.026 --> 00:11:46.907]  I mean, every time we turn around, that's what it is.
[00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:48.067]  Once you figure this stuff out,
[00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:59.601]  You've got to just be sure not to rely on the fact that they're so Pavlovian, they're so OCD, they're so predictable.
[00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:10.353]  They're so methodical in how they operate that nine times out of ten it's the exact same players, the exact same playbook, and it's totally predictable.
[00:12:10.353 --> 00:12:19.758]  Every once in a while they zig when they zag and you don't want to get sucker punched when they do a football handoff or a fake handoff and the quarterback runs it up the middle.
[00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:20.379]  That said,
[00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:22.925]  Usual suspects.
[00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:24.606]  It just never ends.
[00:12:24.606 --> 00:12:29.789]  When you're screwing over all the students and their degrees are going to be pretty much worthless on average.
[00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:31.110]  About 80% are worthless.
[00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:36.491]  That is, you're not going to get more money out of the degree than what you spent on it.
[00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.892]  But it feels good.
[00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:48.357]  I was talking to the Texas Monthly Editor one time and they said, yeah, what we get is we get editorships, associate editorships, but we don't get money.
[00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:52.839]  When they cut our pay, we get titles.
[00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.120]  And it's the same thing.
[00:12:55.592 --> 00:13:06.918]  When they're fleecing you with an extra worthless degrees because the country's been totally shut down by design, when black unemployment doubles in just six and a half years, what are you going to give folks?
[00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:16.403]  Well, racial identity chips on the shoulder and divert the young white students, black students, doesn't matter.
[00:13:16.403 --> 00:13:20.385]  Divert them all into infighting with each other.
[00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:23.107]  And I know that's one-on-one, but that's what's going on.
[00:13:24.423 --> 00:13:27.684]  Listen to these headlines and then I'm going to go into them.
[00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:33.887]  Infowars.com, Kit Daniels from Missouri State Headquarters.
[00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:40.829]  PC Police label Thomas Jefferson's statue racist and sexist, feminist.
[00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:48.932]  Hashtag Black Lives Matter protesters want Jefferson's statue removed or, you guessed it, the football team's not going to play and all the rest of it.
[00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:50.533]  And then that won't stop.
[00:13:51.857 --> 00:13:53.038]  Because that's their identity.
[00:13:53.038 --> 00:13:55.340]  They're getting a degree in pity parties.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.422]  They're getting a degree in being ignorant.
[00:13:57.422 --> 00:14:04.607]  They're getting a degree in not knowing Thomas Jefferson fought to ban slavery in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:07.069]  They go, but he had slaves!
[00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:10.612]  Yeah, and when he freed them, they wouldn't leave.
[00:14:10.612 --> 00:14:12.374]  Because slavery went from basically
[00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:18.679]  Family to people being beaten and pulled and totally, you know, murdered.
[00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:23.002]  But there was a whole spectrum of it and Jefferson represented the reform of it.
[00:14:23.002 --> 00:14:24.663]  That was the time they lived in.
[00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:33.769]  You don't hear the black activists bitching and complaining about slavery going on in at least five African countries today.
[00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:37.331]  Or they'll say, oh well that's African culture in those areas.
[00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:38.192]  Yeah, I know.
[00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:43.134]  Do you blame Africans in other countries for it?
[00:14:43.134 --> 00:14:44.837]  Do you blame black people for it?
[00:14:44.837 --> 00:14:46.240]  They're not the ones doing it.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.347]  You can't blame me for white slavery, for whites having slaves.
[00:14:51.986 --> 00:14:55.870]  Anymore, you can blame me for true white slavery, which is sex slavery.
[00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.692]  The politically correct people are so ignorant.
[00:14:57.692 --> 00:15:07.281]  Every time I talk about Nine Corps or Halliburton or the UN caught in white slavery, they send me emails or I see comments going, why aren't you worried about black slavery, racist?
[00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:14.689]  White slavery is a thousand-year-old European term for soft slavery, meaning sex slavery of women.
[00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:21.298]  That's the European English translation of it.
[00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:28.322]  It had other terms in the Arab world, but basically it was known as soft slavery.
[00:15:28.322 --> 00:15:36.045]  Women in... What was the term they used in the Middle East and in Arab cultures?
[00:15:36.045 --> 00:15:37.606]  Harams.
[00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:38.947]  Harams.
[00:15:38.947 --> 00:15:44.069]  And Saudi Arabia still has harams of slave women.
[00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.850]  American women.
[00:15:45.785 --> 00:15:58.595]  Of every race, color, and creed will be dumb enough to go over there and then get in one of these palaces with one of these princes, there's thousands of them, and they never get out again, and the State Department doesn't do anything to try to help you.
[00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:04.980]  But see, you're not going to hear Gloria Steinem talk about American women who are kept for life.
[00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:09.025]  And raped and they have children and everything else.
[00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:13.768]  You're not going to hear one stinking word out of Sumner Redstone and MTV and Viacom.
[00:16:13.768 --> 00:16:16.889]  You're not going to hear one stinking word out of the New York Times.
[00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:19.651]  Not one stinking word out of MSNBC.
[00:16:19.651 --> 00:16:28.036]  Not one stinking word out of CNN and Anderson Cooper and the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:29.257]  You're not going to hear anything.
[00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:44.844]  Because it's all about bashing the Magna Carta and the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, the freedom of the world, the West.
[00:16:44.844 --> 00:16:47.585]  We could at least recognize we were barbarians.
[00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:49.866]  We could recognize slavery was wrong.
[00:16:49.866 --> 00:16:55.509]  We could recognize that corruption in the church was wrong, saying the Earth was the center of the universe.
[00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:58.930]  The West was the best!
[00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.931]  And now it's committing suicide by design.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.921]  From Spain to Germany.
[00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:08.602]  From the United Kingdom, it's killing itself.
[00:17:08.602 --> 00:17:11.062]  Look at these headlines.
[00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:16.664]  Germany to spend $22.6 billion to accept refugees in 2015.
[00:17:16.664 --> 00:17:18.144]  Now get ready.
[00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:27.447]  A few weeks ago they ordered all over in different governorships, the public school kids, elementary and up, to go make beds, run things, pamper and clean the facilities for the illegals.
[00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:30.353]  I said it'll be part of national service.
[00:17:30.353 --> 00:17:35.517]  Ladies and gentlemen, Der Spieger, Bild and others are now endorsing a government plan.
[00:17:35.517 --> 00:17:38.860]  Our story is linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:44.664]  Politician calls for compulsory labor to force Germans to service migrants.
[00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:51.930]  University students would face mandatory year of social service to absolutely cater to the invaders.
[00:17:56.517 --> 00:18:09.266]  You see, when you do something to somebody bad, you have to rub it in properly and break their will and make it a sacrament and hide it in plain view like it's a good thing.
[00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:13.049]  It's an otherworldly mind control called gaslighting.
[00:18:13.049 --> 00:18:20.855]  As you're abused, as you're screwed over, as you're destroyed, as you're usurped, you're laughed at and double downed on.
[00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:31.890]  And a lot of people go into learned helplessness, mass Stockholm Syndrome, normalcy bias, and submit.
[00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:38.175]  IMF warns of EU nightmare scenario as skeptics push away from Brussels, Sputnik.
[00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:40.817]  That's mirrored by other reports.
[00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:47.083]  Right turn in Germany might sabotage EU, improve Russian-German ties.
[00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:54.150]  Germany will probably support Britain's request to protect the interests of non-European countries.
[00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:00.015]  German ministers preparing a putsch or the removal against Merkel, German magazine reports.
[00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.177]  That's some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[00:19:03.069 --> 00:19:06.753]  But back to the cultural revolution happening here.
[00:19:06.753 --> 00:19:09.517]  While the bankers rob everyone, they get us fighting with each other.
[00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:10.738]  It's a diversionary tactic.
[00:19:10.738 --> 00:19:16.365]  It's like bank robbers burning up a school while they rob the bank.
[00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:19.108]  PC police label Thomas Jefferson's statue racist.
[00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:20.770]  Want it removed from Missouri State.
[00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:25.943]  Mizu hunger strike claims he's oppressed.
[00:19:25.943 --> 00:19:26.884]  Rips white privilege.
[00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:28.765]  Comes from family worth $20 million.
[00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:37.931]  Father paid $8 million as head, as vice president of a major railroad last year.
[00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:39.572]  Running an op.
[00:19:39.572 --> 00:19:42.574]  Guaranteed being directed.
[00:19:42.574 --> 00:19:43.935]  Guaranteed.
[00:19:45.848 --> 00:19:52.349]  Melissa Click, the professor over media, has resigned, but she didn't really resign.
[00:19:52.349 --> 00:19:58.910]  Another deception from the Deceptanoids.
[00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.211]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:09.972]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis, but they're about to lose control.
[00:20:09.972 --> 00:20:14.913]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:15.293 --> 00:20:19.877]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:19.877 --> 00:20:22.279]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:26.122]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:26.122 --> 00:20:30.646]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.768]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:36.351]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:36.351 --> 00:20:37.692]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:38.192 --> 00:20:42.915]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:42.915 --> 00:20:49.320]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:23:55.673 --> 00:23:56.494]  Come and take it.
[00:24:02.102 --> 00:24:07.068]  I've been watching and I've been waiting and I've been understanding.
[00:24:07.068 --> 00:24:12.575]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:12.575 --> 00:24:14.197]  We're here live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:24:15.862 --> 00:24:20.144]  So if you go to Union Pacific Corporation, UMP is what it trades on.
[00:24:20.144 --> 00:24:26.307]  You want to go to Institutional Investors to find who the biggest controllers are.
[00:24:26.307 --> 00:24:36.072]  And that's Wells Fargo, that's Vanguard, that's BlackRock, that's Janus, that's Bank of New York, Mellon.
[00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:41.756]  Goldman Sachs, all the usual players, one of the biggest railroads in the world.
[00:24:41.756 --> 00:24:48.460]  And George Soros is a giant holder in this company.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.702]  And in its Canadian division, he's even bigger.
[00:24:52.262 --> 00:24:53.262]  With, guess who?
[00:24:53.262 --> 00:25:01.064]  Warren Buffett, that's the Wells Fargo and Berkshire Hathaway, both have giant positions in Union Pacific.
[00:25:01.064 --> 00:25:02.104]  Why is that important?
[00:25:02.104 --> 00:25:16.927]  Well, it's not that they killed the Keystone Pipeline over and over again, and the Alaska Pipeline over and over again, because they trans-ship oil out of Canada by train to the Chinese and Japanese supertankers, and then cut out actual mom-and-pop producers and others.
[00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:21.084]  No, that's not the scam I'm talking about right now.
[00:25:21.084 --> 00:25:25.126]  It's Mizu Hunger Striker claims he's oppressed.
[00:25:25.126 --> 00:25:29.748]  Rip's white privilege comes from family worth $20 million.
[00:25:29.748 --> 00:25:35.651]  His father is a railroad vice president and made over $8 million last year.
[00:25:35.651 --> 00:25:37.812]  Oh, you're so oppressed.
[00:25:37.812 --> 00:25:39.313]  And you look at the arrogance of this guy.
[00:25:41.195 --> 00:25:49.902]  Somebody at a frat heard a racial slur a year ago, and then somebody in the bathroom withdrew a swastika with poop.
[00:25:49.902 --> 00:25:51.303]  I'm not saying that to be gross.
[00:25:51.303 --> 00:25:52.084]  That's what happened.
[00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:54.966]  And now it's hysteria.
[00:25:54.966 --> 00:25:59.550]  And then at Yale, we've got all-out costume parties at private frats.
[00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.031]  No, don't do it!
[00:26:01.031 --> 00:26:02.472]  No, no!
[00:26:02.472 --> 00:26:03.953]  Please!
[00:26:03.953 --> 00:26:05.354]  It's so scary!
[00:26:05.354 --> 00:26:07.236]  Oh, my God!
[00:26:07.236 --> 00:26:08.357]  How dare you!
[00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:13.530]  I mean, she's crying harder than people I know when family dies.
[00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.714]  This is how whacked out they are.
[00:26:16.714 --> 00:26:20.919]  Meanwhile, they're led by Pied Pipers.
[00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:22.281]  Like Jonathan Butler.
[00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:24.384]  By the way, there's a bounty.
[00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:40.669]  $1,000, whoever does an interview with him and brings up the fact that his father's tied into Soros and tied into Buffett, the usual suspects through their foundations, funding the Black Lives Matter, go after the cops, crap!
[00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:43.531]  I'm sick of these people!
[00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:50.635]  George Soros is running around on record trying to shut down my media operation through Media Matters and others whose memos have been leaked.
[00:26:50.635 --> 00:26:54.898]  They want to shut down all other alternative media, Drudge, Talk Radio, you name it.
[00:26:55.762 --> 00:27:05.167]  And then they get to run these front guys in there to create racial division and to divert from black people being aborted, 52% of them, and the fluoride targeting them.
[00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:17.554]  Black people are targeted and it's by fake liberals like Margaret Sanger and George Soros and don't forget Warren Buffett who heads up the eugenics program worldwide with Bill Gates.
[00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:27.971]  But Bill Gates is very liberal and loves you, and has all those inoculations for Africans, and he's helping fund and support groups as well.
[00:27:27.971 --> 00:27:36.798]  And that's why CNN, ABC News, NBC, MSNBC, New York Times, they're all, yes, the poor students don't want to see costume parties.
[00:27:36.798 --> 00:27:37.779]  It's reasonable.
[00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:39.600]  Fire the leadership.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.302]  Fire the professors that say there's free speech.
[00:27:42.302 --> 00:27:45.505]  Yes, it's very reasonable to have the professor resign.
[00:27:47.412 --> 00:27:51.353]  They're at the, you know, universities because they support free speech.
[00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:53.894]  Get rid of them!
[00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:58.196]  And then it's all lead, as usual.
[00:27:58.196 --> 00:27:59.736]  It's like the clock kid.
[00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:01.697]  His dad's been caught doing stunts before.
[00:28:01.697 --> 00:28:04.398]  He's moving out of the United States.
[00:28:04.398 --> 00:28:16.702]  He takes the guts of an electrical clock from the 80s, won't tell him it's not a bomb, runs around with it with the timer set ticking down as the police panic, setting them up so that they would arrest him.
[00:28:17.648 --> 00:28:18.710]  Okay, looks like a bomb.
[00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.551]  It's ticking down.
[00:28:19.551 --> 00:28:20.112]  What is it?
[00:28:20.112 --> 00:28:21.053]  Tell us!
[00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:22.436]  Not gonna tell you.
[00:28:22.436 --> 00:28:24.900]  Tick, tick, tick, tick.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.121]  Bomb squad, get it out of here!
[00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:30.208]  Oh, look, the police are bad.
[00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.829]  And of course they can show you bad police all over the place.
[00:28:32.829 --> 00:28:37.592]  I've got four articles a day that I've seen where they're indicting police for horrible stuff.
[00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:40.633]  Because there are crazy evil people that get badges and guns.
[00:28:40.633 --> 00:28:41.754]  Absolutely.
[00:28:41.754 --> 00:28:43.835]  And they kill close to a thousand people a year.
[00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:45.616]  Most of them criminals and gangbangers.
[00:28:45.616 --> 00:28:47.417]  But a couple hundred are innocent.
[00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:52.339]  Is a couple hundred innocent people getting killed the number one issue in America?
[00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:54.020]  No, it isn't.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.661]  Is hundreds of thousands having drug interactions?
[00:28:56.661 --> 00:28:58.862]  50-something thousand dying from them?
[00:28:58.862 --> 00:29:02.883]  Flesh-eating bacteria killing hundreds of thousands?
[00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:05.084]  Drug-resistant TB spreading everywhere?
[00:29:05.084 --> 00:29:06.325]  Totally open borders?
[00:29:06.325 --> 00:29:07.725]  World government being announced?
[00:29:07.725 --> 00:29:13.808]  Trillions upon trillions upon quadrillions in derivatives?
[00:29:13.808 --> 00:29:19.770]  And all the craziness and war with Russia and hundreds of thousands of Christians being killed by Al-Qaeda forces funded by our government?
[00:29:20.822 --> 00:29:27.086]  And fluoride brain-damaging everybody, and nanotech, and hadron colliders, and all the ins- No!
[00:29:27.086 --> 00:29:33.030]  The only thing in America is cops kill 200 innocent people a year.
[00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.170]  Roughly.
[00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.972]  And when they do it, we'll chew them out and go after them!
[00:29:36.972 --> 00:29:38.934]  But you don't like the police state laws?
[00:29:38.934 --> 00:29:40.194]  Go to the legislatures!
[00:29:40.194 --> 00:29:41.315]  You don't like the TSA?
[00:29:41.315 --> 00:29:42.256]  Go to Congress!
[00:29:42.256 --> 00:29:46.458]  They want to divert us onto the first floor of this instead of the top of the pyramid!
[00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:47.319]  Go after the top!
[00:29:48.018 --> 00:29:51.951]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.951 --> 00:29:54.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.638 --> 00:30:08.444]  The Italian government attempted to cover up the arrest of a convicted Al Qaeda terrorist who tried to enter the country on a migrant boat last month, German media reports.
[00:30:08.444 --> 00:30:21.593]  According to NTV, the arrest of the Tunisian-born suspect, who was sentenced to seven years in 2007 for plotting multiple terror attacks, was initially hidden by authorities over fears that it would stoke panic.
[00:30:21.593 --> 00:30:25.555]  The suspect, who was arrested at sea while traveling with more than 200 migrants,
[00:30:26.756 --> 00:30:33.577]  Told police he was seeking asylum in Europe in order to escape persecution after providing a false name.
[00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:41.559]  Following several days of interrogation by police, the suspect was deported back to Tunisia and handed over to local authorities.
[00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:54.342]  As noted by The Independent, the alleged attempt to cover up the arrest was likely rooted in the Italian Interior Minister's claim that there was no evidence that Islamic terrorists were sneaking into Europe aboard migrant boats.
[00:30:54.342 --> 00:30:55.642]  You can find more reports
[00:30:56.002 --> 00:30:58.623]  On InfoWars.com.

[00:33:19.574 --> 00:33:21.236]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.633 --> 00:34:02.609]  Well, while we're all being taught to racially, ethnically, culturally, regionally, and of course via gender, fight with each other and become confused, little addled, spoiled, rotten twits, while all these Soros, Warren Buffet, White House, Justice Department, managed operatives run around engaging in mass manipulation of the idiot population,
[00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:07.260]  There is a new report out from Fox News.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:16.244]  EPA's Clean Power Plan may hike electricity prices in 47 states massively.
[00:34:16.244 --> 00:34:25.148]  The cost will go up $292 billion in just the first two years.
[00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:27.129]  Isn't that cute?
[00:34:27.129 --> 00:34:30.291]  And of course, power prices have already roughly doubled on average.
[00:34:31.792 --> 00:34:34.919]  in the United States since Lord Obama.
[00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:38.566]  I'm sorry, our Lord and Savior, according to Jamie Foxx.
[00:34:38.566 --> 00:34:40.931]  And that's just a little gift from the New World Order.
[00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:42.895]  And they admit it's austerity.
[00:34:44.212 --> 00:34:47.173]  Nothing to do with clean environment.
[00:34:47.173 --> 00:34:55.434]  It's about moving manufacturing and investment to countries that have no restrictions on basically what's free energy.
[00:34:55.434 --> 00:35:03.676]  Coal is the cheapest energy out there times, five times the numbers show, depending on what area of the world you're in.
[00:35:03.676 --> 00:35:08.077]  It's so plentiful, we've got thousands of years of it.
[00:35:08.077 --> 00:35:11.818]  It puts off what plants live off of.
[00:35:11.818 --> 00:35:12.518]  It's a godsend.
[00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:16.996]  Mars, they now know, lost its atmosphere.
[00:35:16.996 --> 00:35:23.601]  Didn't have enough going on on its surface to produce what was being lost.
[00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:28.065]  We replenish our atmosphere and the studies now show are losing atmosphere continually.
[00:35:31.224 --> 00:35:39.331]  And the carbon dioxide level is one of the lowest levels ever recorded from ice core, mud core, and other core samples.
[00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:44.515]  It's been hundreds of times higher in Earth's history than it is now.
[00:35:49.284 --> 00:35:50.945]  It's like that John Carter book.
[00:35:50.945 --> 00:35:53.367]  You know, the guy that wrote the Tarzan novels?
[00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:55.528]  He also wrote the John Carter novels.
[00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:56.349]  The movie was okay.
[00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:57.649]  The novels are good.
[00:35:57.649 --> 00:36:02.633]  Where there's this advanced alien humanoid species that actually wants to destroy planets and suck them dry.
[00:36:02.633 --> 00:36:11.978]  And it puts governments in charge that will actually put policies in place to lose their atmospheres, but to do it slow enough where they never wake up to it.
[00:36:11.978 --> 00:36:15.721]  It's almost like, it's almost like it's true or something.
[00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:26.135]  NASA does say we are losing our atmosphere from the sun and from the winds of space.
[00:36:26.135 --> 00:36:33.440]  And their answer is, in the carbon cycle that is replenishing our atmosphere, not as fast as we lose it.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:43.207]  In fact, the word is, the Earth, being studied by a lot, most mainline scientists, the crews just Googling what I say as I say it, and they're finding mainstream news admitting it.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.263]  That the Earth is basically dying right now.
[00:36:47.263 --> 00:36:52.629]  I mean, it won't happen in our lifetimes, it won't happen in the next probably 100,000 years, maybe a million years, maybe half a billion years.
[00:36:52.629 --> 00:36:53.450]  Who knows?
[00:36:53.450 --> 00:37:01.518]  We just know the atmosphere is the thinnest ever recorded.
[00:37:01.518 --> 00:37:05.002]  And as soon as the VOC patents ran out,
[00:37:06.212 --> 00:37:08.433]  In the 70s they had global conventions.
[00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:17.398]  In the next decade, by the mid 80s, to phase out those and adopt all the new refrigerants and coolants that were patented.
[00:37:17.398 --> 00:37:23.841]  Oh, and those patents are going to go up in a few years and I'm afraid they're going to be banned too.
[00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:30.465]  But don't worry, you can buy whole new refrigeration systems and air conditioning systems again that don't work as well.
[00:37:31.892 --> 00:37:44.216]  They told you they, those chemicals, were eating up the ozone layer, which most scientists agree during certain months of the year always becomes thin at the poles.
[00:37:44.216 --> 00:37:55.140]  But they weren't ever worried about detonating hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere that did blow holes in the atmosphere and did off-gas our atmosphere into space.
[00:37:56.405 --> 00:38:11.357]  In attempts in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, before the International Treaty, to blow a hole in the Van Allen Radiation Belt, so spacecraft could escape the radiation field.
[00:38:11.357 --> 00:38:17.242]  Then people conjecture, well how do we go through the Van Allen Radiation Belt to begin with?
[00:38:17.242 --> 00:38:23.707]  Well the answer is, they had them turn around the craft, facing it, and get behind the water tanks.
[00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:29.736]  And they did get radiated.
[00:38:29.736 --> 00:38:31.160]  Because I've interviewed the people.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.646]  I've had dinner with some of the people that were on those crafts.
[00:38:33.646 --> 00:38:34.107]  They went there.
[00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:40.172]  But they start laughing and say you're dead on, they're not allowed to tell folks what they had then.
[00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:42.893]  Or that people had gone before them.
[00:38:42.893 --> 00:38:49.016]  You don't just think NASA sent people out there for those televised events before they sent military astronauts up there, right?
[00:38:49.016 --> 00:38:51.597]  You know there's a lot of dead astronauts out there.
[00:38:51.597 --> 00:38:58.640]  Thousands have died in the space program, but most of those on the ground, that is on the Earth, testing things.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.700]  Thousands.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.961]  And I was told that by high-level astronauts.
[00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:03.682]  And I've told other astronauts that and they
[00:39:04.762 --> 00:39:14.127]  Are amazed I know it and then start spilling their guts like Buzz Aldrin did on the show about things that he'd never said before or never said since.
[00:39:14.127 --> 00:39:18.810]  I'm not bragging, it's just when I mention these things it's so wild I can't even believe it.
[00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:27.015]  Buzz Aldrin told me they'd discover water in the next six months, that India was going to crash a probe, that NASA had told them where to crash it and that they had discovered the water there when they were on the moon.
[00:39:29.173 --> 00:39:30.154]  But it was classified.
[00:39:30.154 --> 00:39:33.156]  And then six months later, as he said, it was declassified.
[00:39:33.156 --> 00:39:34.516]  And he was laughing about it.
[00:39:34.516 --> 00:39:36.057]  Of course, they didn't say that the U.S.
[00:39:36.057 --> 00:39:36.858]  had found it.
[00:39:36.858 --> 00:39:38.119]  They said India did.
[00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:42.401]  I mean, that is just crazy.
[00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.943]  Let me get back to the news, though.
[00:39:44.943 --> 00:39:50.106]  So the Missouri State hunger strike striker who started all this claims he's oppressed.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.182]  Rip's white privilege comes from a wealthy family worth $20 million.
[00:39:56.182 --> 00:40:08.448]  Dad made $8 million last year and works for, you guessed it, he works for George Soros and he works for Warren Buffett.
[00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:09.589]  That's who he's connected to.
[00:40:10.748 --> 00:40:17.211]  Now, it's not direct where you get $34 million, $33 million just in Ferguson alone to stir stuff up.
[00:40:17.211 --> 00:40:19.411]  And again, the cops were shooting our reporters over bullets.
[00:40:19.411 --> 00:40:22.072]  They were acting like jerks.
[00:40:22.072 --> 00:40:24.353]  There's a lot of arrogance by police and government.
[00:40:24.353 --> 00:40:25.254]  There's problems.
[00:40:25.254 --> 00:40:26.214]  We agree.
[00:40:26.214 --> 00:40:27.395]  We try to reform it.
[00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:33.017]  But when the government itself and foreign interests like George Soros start trying to make it the number one issue,
[00:40:33.914 --> 00:40:43.161]  It's to stir up social calamity and social classes in this country, which will then be used to bully local jurisdictions into becoming federalized.
[00:40:43.161 --> 00:40:50.767]  And that's what the feds are coming in now, and the White House praising the students, saying, you're right, the chancellor and the president resigning, who are big liberals, isn't enough.
[00:40:50.767 --> 00:40:52.248]  We're going to take down Thomas Jefferson.
[00:40:52.248 --> 00:40:54.510]  We're going to help you file lawsuits.
[00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:58.053]  We're just going to come in and take over.
[00:40:58.053 --> 00:41:03.397]  And anytime you don't do what the globalists say, they'll just activate their political operatives, their community organizers.
[00:41:06.594 --> 00:41:12.358]  And boom, you know, somebody will draw a swastika in the bathroom and it's over.
[00:41:12.358 --> 00:41:14.560]  Everybody's got to resign because it's your fault.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.061]  You're a white chancellor.
[00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:18.103]  You're a white president.
[00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:21.005]  Somebody drew on the bathroom wall.
[00:41:21.005 --> 00:41:23.267]  How much you want to bet?
[00:41:23.267 --> 00:41:28.911]  How much you want to bet like the other 99% of the time this was staged?
[00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:31.613]  Just search engine.
[00:41:31.613 --> 00:41:35.496]  Woman put swastika on her own dorm room door or
[00:41:36.821 --> 00:41:48.915]  Member of Jewish fraternity caught putting swastika on, I mean I've seen that headline, let's not exaggerate, in 21 years on air probably a couple hundred times.
[00:41:48.915 --> 00:41:52.459]  Black student caught burning cross in parent's front yard.
[00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:55.143]  Black student caught setting fire to black church.
[00:41:57.369 --> 00:42:00.792]  Jewish man arrested after posting swastika on doors.
[00:42:00.792 --> 00:42:02.153]  One in Telegraph.
[00:42:02.153 --> 00:42:06.636]  On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[00:42:06.636 --> 00:42:10.539]  And it's not just minorities that do it.
[00:42:10.539 --> 00:42:17.985]  Every time some white woman goes, five black guys rape me in the street and carve, you know, cracker on my back.
[00:42:20.117 --> 00:42:27.481]  The police go checking their background to find out they're completely mentally ill, that make false reports constantly, and almost every time that's made up too.
[00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:29.962]  It's just, this is what goes on, people.
[00:42:29.962 --> 00:42:32.903]  Black Florida man burns cross in own driveway.
[00:42:32.903 --> 00:42:34.724]  Yep, there's another headline.
[00:42:34.724 --> 00:42:39.026]  On, and on, and on.
[00:42:39.026 --> 00:42:43.989]  But you get to be a big star, get to be on the news, get to hunger strike, seems like you gain weight under the hunger strike.
[00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:49.991]  It's like the UT professor that said he was resigning because they were going to allow guns on campus.
[00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:50.751]  They were already allowed.
[00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:56.013]  It's just open carry now.
[00:42:56.013 --> 00:42:57.213]  Concealed carry, you name it.
[00:42:57.213 --> 00:42:58.734]  It's passing all over the country.
[00:42:58.734 --> 00:43:00.415]  He, quote, resigned.
[00:43:00.415 --> 00:43:02.455]  And then I was talking to a high-level UT professor.
[00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:03.496]  He said, look it up.
[00:43:03.496 --> 00:43:04.416]  Look up his tenure page.
[00:43:04.416 --> 00:43:04.836]  It's still up.
[00:43:04.836 --> 00:43:05.416]  And I went and looked it up.
[00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.017]  Went to do an article.
[00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:06.497]  We never did.
[00:43:06.497 --> 00:43:07.917]  I went and looked it up that night.
[00:43:07.917 --> 00:43:09.458]  I was at a pool party, barbecue party.
[00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.576]  This guy's a big sports lawyer.
[00:43:12.576 --> 00:43:13.916]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:25.501]  Negotiated some of the major sports deals you know of, both NFL level and college level, but not just NFL.
[00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:36.525]  And I went and looked it up, and sure enough, that guy has said on there months before that this was his last semester coming up this Christmas, this holiday season.
[00:43:36.525 --> 00:43:39.767]  See how they get us to use their words, and then pretty soon we can't even have speech, see?
[00:43:40.862 --> 00:43:43.304]  I mean, I actually wanted to say holiday to be inclusive.
[00:43:43.304 --> 00:43:43.925]  It's Christmas!
[00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:48.829]  It's what it is!
[00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:49.810]  And it was all staged.
[00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:51.272]  It's just, it's what these people do.
[00:43:51.272 --> 00:43:56.617]  It's like this UT professor said he was going to live in a dumpster to teach us how to not have anything and live under austerity so the elite can have more.
[00:43:56.617 --> 00:43:58.779]  And it turns out he doesn't live in the dumpster.
[00:43:58.779 --> 00:44:00.800]  We sent reporters out there three times.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.281]  He was never there.
[00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:04.404]  And then he admitted later, oh, I just come and do photo ops at the dumpster.
[00:44:06.417 --> 00:44:10.039]  It's all fake, and these people are fascist.
[00:44:10.039 --> 00:44:11.960]  I've met them, I know them.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:20.324]  I've been at dinner with them, and they'll go off record, and almost every time they'll say, you just, don't you want to just kill all the minorities, they're total scum.
[00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:28.788]  And I'll say, and there could be black people saying this, and I've had black leaders on who go, oh yeah, I've been given that speech many times.
[00:44:28.788 --> 00:44:31.270]  And they'll say, listen, you're trying to get me to say I'm racist.
[00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.411]  I'm not, I'm not for killing black people.
[00:44:33.411 --> 00:44:35.052]  I'm for empowering everybody.
[00:44:35.052 --> 00:44:35.692]  Oh, whatever.
[00:44:37.358 --> 00:44:41.282]  Blacks just can't make it need to be dealt with and controlled.
[00:44:41.282 --> 00:44:44.646]  And then these are the people running their communities that keep them in the position they're in.
[00:44:44.646 --> 00:44:46.728]  You're looking at actual slave masters.
[00:44:50.148 --> 00:44:51.369]  I mean, look at this guy's dad.
[00:44:51.369 --> 00:44:53.210]  Makes $8 million a year.
[00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:58.632]  This guy, you know, I've seen the pro-abortionist devil worshipers who say they're devil worshipers.
[00:44:58.632 --> 00:45:13.299]  They pull up in brand new $80,000 Jaguars and brand new ZF1 or whatever they are Corvettes and you're just like... And they're wearing Rolexes.
[00:45:13.299 --> 00:45:16.381]  And they're screaming about class privilege with Mao on their arms.
[00:45:18.558 --> 00:45:22.100]  But what you've got to understand, we've tracked these people.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.262]  We've been doing an investigative report on them for a while.
[00:45:25.262 --> 00:45:27.003]  That's why I can say it now because we're pretty much done.
[00:45:27.003 --> 00:45:28.403]  We went to their meetings.
[00:45:28.403 --> 00:45:30.925]  And man, it's city council, it's major corporations.
[00:45:30.925 --> 00:45:33.306]  They are setting up all the review boards.
[00:45:33.306 --> 00:45:37.469]  They're putting people like that on boards that will run the town.
[00:45:37.469 --> 00:45:40.110]  And that's what these community organizers are.
[00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.072]  They're going to put these people on the police advisory board.
[00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:58.835]  They have people from the police advisory board at the communist meetings, where they've got communists gaveling at public meetings at UT, with professors leading communist quorums, and they're all being promised command bases, takeover of government.
[00:45:58.835 --> 00:46:00.155]  It's all about money.
[00:46:00.155 --> 00:46:05.057]  They don't want to make money building a better widget, or designing something, or working hard in a company.
[00:46:05.057 --> 00:46:07.057]  They're gonna rule us!
[00:46:07.057 --> 00:46:09.158]  They go to college to rule!
[00:46:10.444 --> 00:46:13.187]  They don't actually get freaked out by Halloween costumes.
[00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:15.589]  They don't actually get freaked out by Thomas Jefferson.
[00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:18.032]  That is, the controllers don't.
[00:46:18.032 --> 00:46:19.874]  The Commissar students.
[00:46:19.874 --> 00:46:28.582]  And they go out to these mindless TV-head white kids, mainly, who you see in these videos who actually look freaked out and go, you're racist unless you do everything I say.
[00:46:28.582 --> 00:46:30.965]  And these white kids salute and go, yes, sir.
[00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:38.608]  And you see the white female professors behind him commanding and laughing in their body language.
[00:46:38.608 --> 00:46:40.049]  I mean, they're like witches.
[00:46:40.049 --> 00:46:42.949]  They're wicked.
[00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:45.890]  They know what they're doing.
[00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.310]  How do you cover up killing half the black people?
[00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:50.291]  How do you cover up sterilizing women?
[00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:52.251]  How do you cover up the fluoride in the water?
[00:46:52.251 --> 00:46:58.833]  You act like you're liberal and run around saying you want equality and care about everybody and everybody fighting with each other and stirred up.
[00:47:00.267 --> 00:47:03.308]  You know, Marco Rubio is a good person.
[00:47:03.308 --> 00:47:04.249]  Oh, that's racist.
[00:47:04.249 --> 00:47:06.210]  Or, you know, MSNBC.
[00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.911]  Or, Paul Ryan's a really hard worker.
[00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:12.692]  Now, excuse me, no one can be a hard worker but black slaves in America.
[00:47:12.692 --> 00:47:15.273]  That is a slight at black slaves.
[00:47:15.273 --> 00:47:17.774]  And the Hispanic guy's like, excuse me?
[00:47:17.774 --> 00:47:18.635]  Yes, it is.
[00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:19.975]  And the whole table agrees with her.
[00:47:19.975 --> 00:47:21.416]  They go, that's right.
[00:47:21.416 --> 00:47:23.357]  It's racist to say anyone ever was a hard worker.
[00:47:24.301 --> 00:47:30.765]  If a white guy wins a poll vaulting deal and they say, man he's got a lot of stamina, it's putting down black people.
[00:47:30.765 --> 00:47:46.113]  It's learning to equate everything with how you've been racially slighted so you are a mental patient, basket case, drooling, neurotic, panic attack driven mess.
[00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:50.096]  And again, they've instituted a cultural revolution twice
[00:47:51.488 --> 00:47:56.270]  At my cousin's party, because part of it was out in public, at a restaurant bar.
[00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.252]  I had people come over about my captain's hat and say, are you a Nazi?
[00:47:59.252 --> 00:48:01.033]  And I'd be like, what?
[00:48:01.033 --> 00:48:01.793]  No!
[00:48:01.793 --> 00:48:02.053]  Really?
[00:48:02.053 --> 00:48:02.754]  I don't like that!
[00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:08.276]  And I'd say, well, you better get out of my face with your political correct mind control garbage.
[00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:12.578]  And then they'd all grovel and get upset and go, yeah, there's not 15 people now to bully me.
[00:48:12.578 --> 00:48:15.040]  And if there was, I wasn't saying this, obviously.
[00:48:15.922 --> 00:48:19.646]  You know, I'd love to hammer the heads in of 15 people trying to back me off.
[00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:24.450]  I'm not bragging, that's just when I wake up is when a whole mob of scum wants to take me on.
[00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.894]  It's clobbering time at that point.
[00:48:27.894 --> 00:48:39.225]  I'm just sick of these bullies, I'm sick of their garbage, and now Germany to spend $22 billion to accept refugees this year alone, and they're going to have compulsory service to, quote, serve the migrants.
[00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:53.171]  All run by Goldman Sachs, all run by the mega banks, all breaking our will, increasing your power prices.
[00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:54.472]  So this is all coming up.
[00:48:54.472 --> 00:48:56.933]  I'm going to go to break and come back.
[00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:59.294]  We're going to get into some hardcore mass culling next hour.
[00:48:59.294 --> 00:49:07.977]  I've got a bunch of clips that we're going to be going over from the debate last night, the RNC debate, the Fox Business Channel debate.
[00:49:07.977 --> 00:49:09.837]  That is coming up as well.
[00:49:09.837 --> 00:49:11.358]  We have a new product.
[00:49:12.654 --> 00:49:21.917]  And it's living defense, and it's a whole bunch of organic compounds like wild-crafted black walnut, organic clove.
[00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:31.620]  I'm not going to read all the things that's in this, but this is the known harmful organism remover.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.020]  And there's so many parasites out there.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.921]  I'm not claiming I'm going to get rid of every parasite.
[00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:38.842]  The point is, most people don't know that 9 out of 10 people
[00:49:40.126 --> 00:50:07.163]  have parasites and this is what I personally am doing right now to flush my system just to be safe and I'm also giving to my children and this stuff is so incredibly good for you if you read what the ingredients are and best of all you're taking care of yourself and your own body but you're also funding the vicious aggressive spear of truth being plunged mercilessly into the giant goblin belly of the new world order
[00:50:08.476 --> 00:50:11.620]  And I'm willing to get up close and actually smell this beast.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.026]  But you're right beside us and right behind us and at the core of what we're doing, funding our operation.
[00:50:16.026 --> 00:50:18.870]  But I do have to get close to the goblin creatures.
[00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:24.237]  It is not enjoyable to look upon them and to study them, but it must be done.
[00:50:24.237 --> 00:50:25.539]  And so you're helping fund
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:32.564]  And forge weapons in the Infowar, reporters, investigative journalists, you name it, to go out and chronicle.
[00:50:32.564 --> 00:50:37.408]  It was I alone as chronicler that will tell his story.
[00:50:37.408 --> 00:50:42.672]  So it's key, ladies and gentlemen, that you go to Infowarslife.com and get
[00:50:43.112 --> 00:50:45.294]  Living Defense Today at Current Sales.
[00:50:45.294 --> 00:50:46.735]  It'll sell out in about 5-6 days.
[00:50:46.735 --> 00:50:47.696]  This is our introduction of it.
[00:50:47.696 --> 00:50:49.558]  We always do a limited run test.
[00:50:49.558 --> 00:50:55.003]  Got a bunch of other specials running right now as well at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:50:55.003 --> 00:50:56.384]  Be sure and check those out.
[00:51:01.417 --> 00:51:06.041]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:10.344]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:51:10.344 --> 00:51:11.725]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:51:11.725 --> 00:51:14.747]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:51:14.747 --> 00:51:16.969]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:51:16.969 --> 00:51:19.171]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:51:19.171 --> 00:51:21.452]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:51:21.452 --> 00:51:23.114]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:25.595]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:51:25.595 --> 00:51:29.638]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:51:30.459 --> 00:51:31.580]  Another concern?
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.564]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:51:35.564 --> 00:51:38.146]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:51:38.146 --> 00:51:42.130]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.932]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:44.932 --> 00:51:49.576]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:51:49.576 --> 00:51:51.598]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[00:51:51.598 --> 00:51:53.240]  FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.581]  You'll never be cold again.
[00:51:58.456 --> 00:52:04.080]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:18.529]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and infused it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:52:18.689 --> 00:52:26.695]  LiverShield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:52:26.695 --> 00:52:32.279]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:52:32.279 --> 00:52:35.821]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:52:35.821 --> 00:52:39.924]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:52:39.924 --> 00:52:43.787]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:52:44.147 --> 00:52:48.273]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:52:48.273 --> 00:52:53.340]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.203]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:11.166]  Atmospheric Aluminum, Mercury Exposure, Estrogen Toxins from Plastics, Microwaves from Cell Phones and Smart Meters, and Low Quality Foods, all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[00:53:11.166 --> 00:53:19.670]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:25.673]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times, we can promote and achieve excellent health.
[00:53:25.673 --> 00:53:27.974]  One World Way is the first energetically encoded
[00:53:28.294 --> 00:53:28.894]  I think so.
[00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.993]  You win some, lose some.
[00:54:16.993 --> 00:54:19.795]  It's all a game to me.
[00:54:19.795 --> 00:54:23.038]  Seven or eleven, snake eyes watching you.
[00:54:23.038 --> 00:54:26.741]  Double up or split.
[00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:30.284]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a gambling man.
[00:54:30.284 --> 00:54:32.626]  No, it's mindless gambling for no reason.
[00:54:32.626 --> 00:54:36.509]  But I will gamble on liberty.
[00:54:36.509 --> 00:54:38.331]  And those of us that follow
[00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:47.308]  Basic common sense and free market ideas are the noble savages that the globalists hate.
[00:54:47.308 --> 00:54:48.709]  They believe they are the enlightened ones.
[00:54:48.709 --> 00:54:54.691]  The truth is the globalists are the savages trying to dumb down and control humanity.
[00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:58.753]  And we do hold the ace of spades when it comes to fighting tyranny.
[00:54:58.753 --> 00:55:00.613]  We have the truth.
[00:55:00.613 --> 00:55:05.996]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:55:05.996 --> 00:55:09.257]  But what do you make of the incredible announcement
[00:55:12.737 --> 00:55:34.673]  That Germany is to spend some 22.6 billion to accept refugees in 2015 based on the assumption that 1.1 million will be free and will flee into Germany on top of those that are already there.
[00:55:34.673 --> 00:55:35.314]  Continuing,
[00:55:36.653 --> 00:55:40.415]  Politicians call for compulsory labor to force Germans to service migrants.
[00:55:40.415 --> 00:55:43.636]  University graduates will face mandatory year of service.
[00:55:43.636 --> 00:55:47.858]  Remember when he was White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel wanted that?
[00:55:47.858 --> 00:55:51.400]  He said that on C-SPAN and on Good Morning America, you name it.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.462]  So this is classic communism.
[00:55:54.462 --> 00:56:03.086]  A German parliament member has called for the introduction of compulsory labor program, that's quote, under which young Germans would be forced to spend a year in service to migrants.
[00:56:04.082 --> 00:56:18.591]  Focus.de reports CDU MP Eckhart Reiberg provoked heated discussion when he suggested Germany's inability to cope with the migrant influx could be solved by making university graduates commit a year of service.
[00:56:18.591 --> 00:56:23.294]  Yeah, that means being brainwashed to accept it as well.
[00:56:23.294 --> 00:56:24.114]  So there you go.
[00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:26.676]  And now they want to take down Thomas Jefferson at the Missouri.
[00:56:29.904 --> 00:56:43.455]  University, and we're going to have our reporters coming up in the last 30 minutes of the third hour, reporting from the main campus of the University of Missouri, breaking all this down.
[00:56:43.455 --> 00:56:46.417]  Classes have been cancelled!
[00:56:46.417 --> 00:56:49.380]  Isn't that archetypally proper?
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.983]  That it's about cancelling education, it's about cancelling the open, free discussion of ideas.
[00:56:53.983 --> 00:56:56.025]  Isn't that where political correctness goes to begin with?
[00:56:56.025 --> 00:56:58.327]  Is the end of the university system as we know it?
[00:56:59.198 --> 00:57:02.459]  The end of the industrialized age, the end of the renaissance?
[00:57:02.459 --> 00:57:03.159]  Isn't it fitting?
[00:57:03.159 --> 00:57:06.380]  I think they should have a holiday every year!
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.701]  Where they shut it down for a week!
[00:57:09.701 --> 00:57:19.064]  And celebrate ignorance, celebrate mindlessness, celebrate idiocy, celebrate having chips on your shoulder.
[00:57:19.064 --> 00:57:25.206]  Meanwhile, Jeb Bush and John Kasich have shielded their fates by pandering to illegal immigrants during the debate.
[00:57:26.624 --> 00:57:31.047]  Rand Paul calls out Rubio for military spending on tax ideas.
[00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:45.217]  Lord of the Rings star and listener of the show, he's been on as a guest, Viggo Mortensen comes out and said that Bernie Sanders is just as bad as Hillary or the rest of them and just as hawkish.
[00:57:45.217 --> 00:57:50.200]  He supported major funding efforts for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.162]  That's why I like Viggo Mortensen is he's actually informed and educated.
[00:57:54.164 --> 00:57:57.186]  And understands the controlled left is just that, control.
[00:57:57.186 --> 00:58:00.509]  We ought to try to get him back on the show.
[00:58:00.509 --> 00:58:04.352]  I was really flattered to learn he's a almost daily listener.
[00:58:04.352 --> 00:58:06.034]  It's crazy.
[00:58:06.034 --> 00:58:11.038]  That's just one of the big Hollywood stars that will actually come on, though most of them are totally afraid.
[00:58:11.038 --> 00:58:12.579]  But Viggo Mortensen is a true artist.
[00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:13.980]  I mean, his movies are so good.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.823]  I tell you, The Road, I've only watched it once and I just can't make myself watch it again.
[00:58:17.823 --> 00:58:19.184]  It was so horrifying.
[00:58:19.184 --> 00:58:22.387]  That's the scariest movie I've ever seen because it's so real.
[00:58:22.387 --> 00:58:23.628]  It's so close to what could happen.
[00:58:25.054 --> 00:58:26.555]  Under a whole bunch of different scenarios.
[00:58:26.555 --> 00:58:35.458]  Atmospheric, nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological, tectonic, cultural, nanotech.
[00:58:35.458 --> 00:58:35.978]  We'll be back.
[00:58:35.978 --> 00:58:36.439]  Stay with us.
[00:58:36.439 --> 00:58:39.300]  InfoWars.com is full of key stories right now.

[00:59:51.125 --> 00:59:53.755]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.744 --> 01:00:06.045]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.045 --> 01:00:07.807]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.807 --> 01:00:09.568]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.568 --> 01:00:11.150]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:12.711]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.711 --> 01:00:16.895]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.895 --> 01:00:20.958]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:50.577]  Coming up in the next segment, Major General Albert Stubblebind and his medical doctor wife, Rima Labo, will be joining us to break down why they believe the great culling of the human population has begun.
[01:00:50.577 --> 01:01:04.629]  And I mentioned this Sunday, this London Guardian article from Saturday, November 7th, a few days ago, Artificial Intelligence Homo Sapiens will be split into a handful of gods and then the rest of us.
[01:01:06.323 --> 01:01:09.545]  And that's covered in my film, Endgame.
[01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:12.786]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:01:12.786 --> 01:01:14.427]  Made eight years ago.
[01:01:14.427 --> 01:01:20.129]  I don't believe this is what's actually gonna happen, but this is what the elite actually believes.
[01:01:20.129 --> 01:01:23.831]  This is what world government is really all about.
[01:01:23.831 --> 01:01:29.354]  So they may not become gods, or what compared to us, you could call a god.
[01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:33.056]  For all intents and purposes, eternal creatures.
[01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:33.896]  Self-replicating.
[01:01:37.059 --> 01:01:45.084]  But they're certainly trying to take over the planet and dominate science and technology and control our development or stop our development.
[01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:46.165]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:52.229]  And then meanwhile, Justice Department to take fight over Obama immigration order to Supreme Court.
[01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:58.133]  Review sought of ruling that blocked plans to defer deportations of more than 4 million people.
[01:01:59.395 --> 01:02:03.300]  Multiple federal judges have said no, and state judges as well.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:07.525]  You just can't have illegals and then just give them everything free and just keep them here outside of law.
[01:02:07.525 --> 01:02:09.508]  Nobody can do that.
[01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:12.992]  We have one of the most lax immigration policies in the world.
[01:02:12.992 --> 01:02:15.535]  It's very hard though if you try to do it legally.
[01:02:15.535 --> 01:02:18.039]  You just come in and they're illegal, you tend to get left alone a lot of times.
[01:02:19.395 --> 01:02:21.376]  I'm for opening up the legal.
[01:02:21.376 --> 01:02:21.936]  That's fine.
[01:02:21.936 --> 01:02:22.577]  We need workers.
[01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:26.458]  We killed all our kids, whether you were Hispanic American, Black American, White American.
[01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:27.719]  You know, we killed most our kids.
[01:02:27.719 --> 01:02:30.440]  It's like the pro-abortion people said when I talked to them.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.561]  They said, look, you know, I kill my kids.
[01:02:32.561 --> 01:02:33.322]  I don't adopt.
[01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:33.682]  I love it.
[01:02:33.682 --> 01:02:34.862]  I want to kill them.
[01:02:34.862 --> 01:02:38.324]  It's fun.
[01:02:38.324 --> 01:02:39.545]  So I'm not against immigrants.
[01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:44.127]  I'm against them being brought in and then weaponized and then given free tuition, free health care.
[01:02:45.236 --> 01:02:47.557]  And then turned against the Republican, not assimilating.
[01:02:47.557 --> 01:02:49.178]  That's the big issue.
[01:02:49.178 --> 01:02:50.879]  And we'll be looking at that.
[01:02:50.879 --> 01:02:54.602]  Obama administration wants Supreme Court to approve its immigration plans.
[01:02:54.602 --> 01:02:56.043]  John Bowne has a report on that.
[01:02:56.043 --> 01:03:00.245]  We're going to be airing a little bit later in the transmission.
[01:03:00.245 --> 01:03:08.050]  Briefly, in what's left of this segment, because I didn't really talk about it when I did a 30-second plug earlier, we're running a bunch of specials this week.
[01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:13.666]  And we have InfoWars Life Winner's Sun.
[01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:15.487]  Vitamin D has multiple roles in the body.
[01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:18.589]  This is truly organic, concentrated, high power.
[01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:21.271]  You take it under the tongue for higher absorption.
[01:03:21.271 --> 01:03:30.998]  It's been known to maintain the health of bones and teeth, support the health of immune system, brain and nervous system, regulate insulin levels and aid diabetes management, support lung function.
[01:03:31.838 --> 01:03:38.701]  And cardiovascular health influence the expression of genes involved in cancer development.
[01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:47.064]  Sensible sun exposures, five to ten minutes, two or three times per week, but you can't do that in the fall and winter and spring in most clients.
[01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:58.648]  And so you need to take high-quality vitamin D3, a spectrum of it, routinely because you will deplete all of your vitamin D in less than a month without serious sunlight.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.201]  Most people can't absorb a lot of vitamin D3 out of plants and meats.
[01:04:05.201 --> 01:04:06.802]  This is the way to do it.
[01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:08.102]  It's amazing.
[01:04:08.102 --> 01:04:22.127]  Again, you get such big problems with flus and colds in the winter because people are cooped indoors and they don't have their immune system going because of lack of vitamin D. Check out Winter Sun today, 20% off right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:04:22.127 --> 01:04:23.067]  Take advantage of that.
[01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:29.409]  We're also still extending, as the manufacturer said we could, with the Alexa Pure Water Filtration Systems, but only for another week.
[01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:30.850]  Then it's got to stop.
[01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:36.111]  Well, you can get free shipping and a big discount.
[01:04:36.111 --> 01:04:36.831]  What does it come out to?
[01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:42.832]  It's free shipping and 10% off with promo code WATER at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:04:42.832 --> 01:04:49.074]  And there's a bunch of other specials as well on Brain Force and others running that will end in the next few days.
[01:04:49.074 --> 01:04:50.694]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:04:50.694 --> 01:04:54.755]  And know that your purchase of the products makes everything we do here possible.
[01:04:54.755 --> 01:04:55.335]  We'll be back.
[01:04:55.335 --> 01:04:55.715]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.517 --> 01:05:03.800]  In Florida they call me Jeb because I earned it.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.821]  Poor Jeb.
[01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:09.045]  I got a lot of really cool things that I could do other than sit around being miserable.
[01:05:09.045 --> 01:05:10.786]  Jeb just got some more bad news.
[01:05:10.786 --> 01:05:18.073]  While both Trump and Carson would beat Hillary in Florida, former Florida Governor Jeb would lose to Hillary in the Republican-leaning state.
[01:05:20.595 --> 01:05:25.076]  And with that news, Jeb's exclamation mark went completely flaccid.
[01:05:25.076 --> 01:05:26.997]  And his comments got even stranger.
[01:05:26.997 --> 01:05:28.097]  I love my dad.
[01:05:28.097 --> 01:05:28.937]  I'd kill for him.
[01:05:28.937 --> 01:05:31.138]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[01:05:31.138 --> 01:05:34.419]  Well, I'm sure that comes up around the Bush dinner table, but come on.
[01:05:34.419 --> 01:05:37.220]  The Bushes, just like the Clintons, are too big to jail.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.960]  They called me Vito Corleone.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.201]  More like Fredo.
[01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:43.902]  Jeb's campaign finance woes highlight a problem with super PACs.
[01:05:43.902 --> 01:05:48.563]  Candidates can't pay their staff from super PACs because they presumably don't control them.
[01:05:49.003 --> 01:05:55.005]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods, and the Super PACs are where you place your bets.
[01:05:55.005 --> 01:05:58.466]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:58.466 --> 01:06:08.589]  Most of the InfoWars radio-listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.

[01:06:51.018 --> 01:06:52.158]  Alex Jones here.

[01:07:17.513 --> 01:07:19.114]  We need to be self-sufficient.

[01:07:55.046 --> 01:08:03.735]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.735 --> 01:08:06.537]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.399 --> 01:08:18.863]  Major General Albert N. Stubblebine III and Dr. Rima Labo are going to be our guests coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:22.706]  They're authors, talk show host in their own right, she's a medical doctor.
[01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:23.686]  Very interesting folks.
[01:08:23.686 --> 01:08:26.128]  They've been on quite a few times in the years.
[01:08:26.128 --> 01:08:38.396]  I was also a guest on one of Jesse Ventura's television programs with them, respectively, about secret sites around the country, which three years ago that was a big deal to talk about, now it's mainstream news.
[01:08:39.474 --> 01:08:44.956]  That's because more and more of this tyranny is getting ready to go operational or already has.
[01:08:44.956 --> 01:08:55.240]  The fact that they've gone from denying world government, denying mass culling, denying planned austerity to admitting it and saying it's good tells me they're getting ready to roll more of this out.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.061]  Cashless society, retina scanning to buy and sell.
[01:08:58.061 --> 01:09:00.842]  It's all being announced now.
[01:09:00.842 --> 01:09:02.003]  Brain chips in the troops.
[01:09:03.547 --> 01:09:05.849]  Here's a London Guardian article that ties into all this.
[01:09:05.849 --> 01:09:14.416]  Artificial intelligence, homo sapiens, will be split into a handful of gods and the rest of us.
[01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:27.046]  And then it goes into all these big government reports, UN statements, machines to replace humans, then the elite will control the population because we won't have jobs, and robot factories and robot farms will supply us.
[01:09:27.046 --> 01:09:31.169]  Human individualism and self-sufficiency will be illegal.
[01:09:31.169 --> 01:09:31.650]  That's why the
[01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:37.152]  Lemonade stands from Germany to the United States are illegal.
[01:09:37.152 --> 01:09:38.973]  Swap meets, they're shutting them down.
[01:09:38.973 --> 01:09:41.194]  Farmers markets, the Amish.
[01:09:41.194 --> 01:09:47.137]  New raids this week of Amish producing their own crops.
[01:09:47.137 --> 01:09:50.619]  The harassment, because this is a takeover.
[01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:52.500]  This is a military takeover.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:57.623]  And if you've occupied a city or a country, you don't let those people produce their own food and their own
[01:09:59.068 --> 01:10:19.259]  Staples, you control them with it, and I know General Stubblebine can speak to that, and then it ties into something they're really the tip of the spear on, and that is getting people to understand under international law, now that lawyer's on, they concur with it, that it is a violation of the Nuremberg Code, it is a violation of informed consent, it's a violation of the U.S.
[01:10:19.259 --> 01:10:23.362]  Code to forcibly inoculate people, which is beginning.
[01:10:24.406 --> 01:10:29.949]  So we're going to go over all of that as well in the second part of the interview.
[01:10:29.949 --> 01:10:41.936]  But first, I wanted to pick General Stubblebine, but also his wife, Dr. Labo's brain, specifically about what's currently happening.
[01:10:41.936 --> 01:10:46.499]  Because I was talking to one of the lawyers that we work with as well, that they work with, about forced inoculation.
[01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:51.132]  And he was saying, well, General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo believe the culling has begun.
[01:10:51.132 --> 01:10:52.953]  And, you know, it's funny they say that.
[01:10:52.953 --> 01:10:54.534]  I've said that as well.
[01:10:54.534 --> 01:10:55.654]  I agree with them.
[01:10:55.654 --> 01:11:00.376]  The beginning of the cutoff of the food worldwide, the beginning of the cutoff of good medicine has begun.
[01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:03.277]  The beginning of the cutoff of good health care here has begun.
[01:11:03.277 --> 01:11:05.918]  It's being replaced with a death care.
[01:11:05.918 --> 01:11:10.360]  And they admit this is the new austerity where you can't have air conditioning, can't have a car unless you're the elite.
[01:11:12.182 --> 01:11:17.604]  And they're also fomenting racial and ethnic and religious strife, not just here, but all over the world.
[01:11:17.604 --> 01:11:22.706]  They'll take whatever differences there are, animists, Christians, they're all black, have them kill each other.
[01:11:22.706 --> 01:11:25.227]  Muslims, Christians, they're all black, have them kill each other.
[01:11:25.227 --> 01:11:29.469]  They can take any group, Latin America, Catholic versus Protestant, kill each other.
[01:11:29.469 --> 01:11:32.150]  Communist versus non-Communist, kill each other.
[01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:36.472]  This is the great divide and conquer, so I want to get their expert breakdown.
[01:11:37.532 --> 01:11:43.696]  On where this is going, I guess we'll probably go to General Stubblebine for five minutes first, and then his wife can pop in any time, then to her for five minutes.
[01:11:43.696 --> 01:11:48.939]  But Major General Albert and Stubblebine III, General Burt is a graduate of U.S.
[01:11:48.939 --> 01:11:50.259]  Military Academy, Class of 52.
[01:11:51.719 --> 01:11:53.900]  He enjoyed a distinguished 32 career with the U.S.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.560]  Army.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.102]  He retired as the Commanding General of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command.
[01:11:59.102 --> 01:12:02.003]  Prior to his assignment, he commanded the U.S.
[01:12:02.003 --> 01:12:04.503]  Army Electronics Research and Development Command.
[01:12:04.503 --> 01:12:05.784]  That's hooked into DARPA.
[01:12:05.784 --> 01:12:09.145]  During his active duty career, he commanded soldiers at every level.
[01:12:09.145 --> 01:12:14.847]  After his retirement, he served as VP for the Intelligence Systems with BDM, a major defense contractor.
[01:12:15.647 --> 01:12:29.915]  He has brought these expertises to the leading edge medical research and development in collaboration with his wife, Dr. Rima E. Labo, MD, who's treated some royalty and some of the most famous people in the world, which is part of what woke her up, because what they were saying.
[01:12:29.915 --> 01:12:37.479]  DrRimaTruthReports.com, and they also have a whole section on informed consent, these cards you can print off, you can also just
[01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:52.558]  I would say come up with your own as well, whatever works, to put people on notice when they're trying to forcibly inoculate you or your children because they lie and say there's no side effects or it's the law, you got to take it, it's not true.
[01:12:52.558 --> 01:12:55.842]  Even as they pass laws saying it, they're trumped.
[01:12:55.842 --> 01:12:56.242]  They're like a
[01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.619]  Well, Alex, it's great to be here.
[01:13:24.301 --> 01:13:25.602]  Where do you guys want to begin?
[01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:26.182]  There's so much.
[01:13:26.182 --> 01:13:26.843]  I mean, you've said it.
[01:13:26.843 --> 01:13:27.623]  I agree with you.
[01:13:27.623 --> 01:13:30.826]  The Great Culling has begun.
[01:13:30.826 --> 01:13:35.950]  Unfortunately, Alex, you are correct.
[01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:43.935]  It has already started, and my sense is it's only going to get worse.
[01:13:43.935 --> 01:13:50.660]  General Burke just wrote a piece on white men dying in America.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.441]  Let's talk about that.
[01:13:53.786 --> 01:14:01.948]  Well, when you take a look at the statistics, is it statistics or sadistics?
[01:14:01.948 --> 01:14:14.091]  I'm not quite sure which word to use, but when you look at the facts, what you find is that instead of getting older, there's a
[01:14:17.405 --> 01:14:42.145]  block in terms of aging that is sort of the 40 to 50 age range and suddenly instead of getting older like I am they are dying they are dying too soon way too soon and the real question is not
[01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:51.660]  That they're dying, but why are they dying that young?
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:15:02.602]  The mortality rate has been accelerating 1% a year for the last 15 years for men between the ages of 40 and 55.
[01:15:02.602 --> 01:15:09.484]  They were the most privileged sector in, really, in the world in terms of their longevity.
[01:15:09.904 --> 01:15:25.096]  They were well cared for, they were well fed, they were capable of sustaining themselves longer than most other groups, and now their ability to do that, their longevity is declining at the rate of 1% a year for 15 years.
[01:15:27.514 --> 01:15:37.245]  And by the way, I've seen those numbers in the news that the United States actually, its life expectancy is going down if you remove infant mortality.
[01:15:37.245 --> 01:15:41.069]  Infant mortality is back up, but it's still a lot lower than 100 years ago.
[01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:45.995]  But if you take out the numbers of dead children and babies, we're not living as long as we did just 50, 60, 70 years ago.
[01:15:47.757 --> 01:15:55.042]  Even though they have advanced technologies and sciences, they can't even keep us alive now, and there's this myth that we're living longer.
[01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:58.385]  But neurological disorders, talk about some of those numbers as an MD, doctor.
[01:15:58.385 --> 01:16:00.186]  I mean, they're just off the chart.
[01:16:00.186 --> 01:16:02.148]  Diabetes, you name it.
[01:16:02.148 --> 01:16:03.969]  Infertility, it is just crazy.
[01:16:03.969 --> 01:16:06.611]  And then specifically, what's happening to white men?
[01:16:07.591 --> 01:16:24.937]  What's happening to white men started statistically in the year 2000, which was the year after the suicide-inducing, liver failure-inducing drugs, psychiatric drugs, started to be prescribed very widely.
[01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:26.717]  And so people started dying.
[01:16:26.717 --> 01:16:28.398]  Well, the causes that
[01:16:28.558 --> 01:16:29.138]  Thank you for having me.
[01:16:52.032 --> 01:17:10.972]  Psychiatric drugs and blood sugar regulating drugs for the rampant diabetes and you put them all together with the vaccines, you have damage to the liver and you have suicide because the lower the cholesterol is, the more suicide people have.
[01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:15.216]  The more psychiatric drugs they use, the more suicide they have.
[01:17:15.216 --> 01:17:20.540]  And the liver simply falls apart under the onslaught of the drugs and vaccines.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:28.628]  So what we're seeing is iatrogenic, that is doctor-induced increase in death.
[01:17:28.628 --> 01:17:31.870]  And the next age cohort below them,
[01:17:33.035 --> 01:17:37.516]  Is now leveling off in their longevity and they'll start to decline.
[01:17:37.516 --> 01:17:48.440]  And the most frightening thing of all Alex is that you can just taste the fact that in order to protect us, the great ones,
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:56.305]  We'll want to medicate our water and our food to keep us from committing suicide, to keep our livers from falling apart.
[01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:59.346]  And in fact, what they'll be doing is accelerating all of this.
[01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:08.432]  And for those that don't know, it's now Fox News, CNN, as you point out, Doctor, the Japanese government, they're all saying, let's put all sorts of chemicals, including statins, in the water.
[01:18:08.432 --> 01:18:09.773]  Let's put lithium in the water.
[01:18:10.393 --> 01:18:12.915]  But my dad's a chemist, also a retired oral surgeon.
[01:18:12.915 --> 01:18:19.619]  I remember him in the 80s freaking out about statins, saying, your brain's made up out of cholesterol, showing me studies that it would eat your brain.
[01:18:19.619 --> 01:18:25.543]  But now, as you know, they've admitted a lot of that, but I can't tell you how many people I know whose fathers
[01:18:26.283 --> 01:18:34.088]  Particularly, retire at 65, they're totally normal, they go on statins, and within one year, they can't even read and write.
[01:18:34.088 --> 01:18:36.070]  I mean, in fact, it's very close to home.
[01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:37.931]  I'm not allowed to talk about it because it's a family issue.
[01:18:37.931 --> 01:18:42.214]  I have some family that won't listen, it won't go off of them, and it's literally eating their brain.
[01:18:42.858 --> 01:18:44.300]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:19:00.379]  This whole erectile dysfunction thing, by the way, guys, if you really would like to have an erection and you're taking statin drugs, you're canceling out your ability to make testosterone because cholesterol is the molecule for which testosterone is made and your brain is 50%.
[01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:02.937]  Sure.
[01:19:23.786 --> 01:19:41.798]  I was on a plane back from Toronto speaking a few months ago with George Norrie, and I actually looked up who the guy was, he was a famous chemist, and we were up in first class, that's how they flew us up there to speak, and he was telling me that, listen, Tylenol couldn't get approved today, but he goes, new things can.
[01:19:42.338 --> 01:19:45.581]  But he goes, if you take Tylenol, he listed all this other over-the-counter stuff.
[01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:51.806]  He said it will literally eat your liver in a matter of weeks, worse than drinking gallons of Jack Daniels a day.
[01:19:51.806 --> 01:19:52.846]  That was his words.
[01:19:52.846 --> 01:19:56.449]  He started listing all these drugs and he was telling me, it's crazy.
[01:19:56.449 --> 01:19:58.351]  I want to develop good drugs.
[01:19:58.351 --> 01:20:02.854]  But he said, it's over the top because these doctors
[01:20:03.855 --> 01:20:07.978]  We'll prescribe things that they've been told will eat your liver.
[01:20:07.978 --> 01:20:10.440]  He was saying, I don't know why they keep doing it.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.181]  Why are they doing it as a medical doctor?
[01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:13.622]  And then I want General Stubblebine.
[01:20:13.622 --> 01:20:21.267]  He's been on and obviously talked about, you know, as a guy that's trained in intelligence and seeing what's happening is making the dots, what's actually going on.
[01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:39.778]  Well, when you take a look at the statistics about the liver and the other organs, what you find is that the curve is greater than 45 degrees.
[01:20:39.778 --> 01:20:44.640]  It's almost a 60 degree curve going up, up, up, up, up.
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:49.221]  Over the last 15 years.
[01:20:49.221 --> 01:20:55.543]  And your liver, folks, is your detoxification capability.
[01:20:55.543 --> 01:20:59.604]  If you can't detox your body, you're in deep trouble.
[01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:08.446]  And here's this graph that shows how steep the curve is that's killing your livers.
[01:21:10.626 --> 01:21:14.293]  You're absolutely right, and it's the glyphosates in the water, the fluoride.
[01:21:14.293 --> 01:21:20.185]  How big a victory is it, General, and also Dr. Lebo, that we forced you and others
[01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:36.178]  Now, European governments should call for the removal of hydrofluorosilicic acid or fluoride, and how big a deal it is to have the EPA say, and FDA, reduce it from 1.3 parts per million down to .7, cutting it roughly in half.
[01:21:36.178 --> 01:21:40.983]  How big a deal is that that we're finally forcing breakthroughs?
[01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:45.047]  But then, where's the debate about why they did it to begin with?
[01:21:45.047 --> 01:21:45.908]  General?
[01:21:45.908 --> 01:21:46.188]  Doctor?
[01:21:48.673 --> 01:21:52.915]  Well, I'd like to leap in on that because I can't resist.
[01:21:52.915 --> 01:22:00.139]  It's a huge victory and it's a tiny drop in the contaminated bucket.
[01:22:00.139 --> 01:22:03.781]  The issue of fluoride should never be underestimated.
[01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:07.543]  People say, why are people acting like sheeple?
[01:22:07.543 --> 01:22:11.705]  And you should never underestimate the impact of fluoride.
[01:22:13.766 --> 01:22:18.130]  It cuts your ability to reach out using a moral compass.
[01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:21.553]  Fluoride calcifies the pineal gland.
[01:22:21.553 --> 01:22:26.257]  Fluoride makes you dumber, it makes you infertile, it gives you diabetes.
[01:22:26.257 --> 01:22:29.480]  And you would think, well good, when they- It makes you passive.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.320]  Passive.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.121]  Very passive.
[01:22:31.121 --> 01:22:32.622]  Very passive.
[01:22:32.622 --> 01:22:39.048]  You cannot do any kind of action when you're that passive.
[01:22:39.048 --> 01:22:40.109]  So it kills motivation?
[01:22:40.908 --> 01:22:57.881]  It kills motivation, but the point is, yes, they're eliminating hydrofluorosilic acid in Europe, but at the same time, they spray food, even organic food, in storage and transit with higher, much higher levels of fluoride, 33,000 parts per million.
[01:23:00.163 --> 01:23:03.388]  So, toothpaste is a delivery system.
[01:23:03.388 --> 01:23:04.870]  Food is a delivery system.
[01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:11.158]  What has to happen is that fluoride is banned as an additive in any way.
[01:23:11.158 --> 01:23:11.539]  I agree.
[01:23:11.539 --> 01:23:14.182]  People need to start suing companies that put it in food.
[01:23:14.182 --> 01:23:15.764]  I remember being at camp as a child.
[01:23:16.445 --> 01:23:19.707]  I was no rocket scientist, but when they gave us powdered eggs, I would go throw them up.
[01:23:19.707 --> 01:23:20.608]  And I loved food.
[01:23:20.608 --> 01:23:22.429]  I had a very strong stomach.
[01:23:22.429 --> 01:23:30.454]  And then years later, I learned that very brand had 300, other brands have 600, 300 parts per million.
[01:23:30.454 --> 01:23:37.057]  As you know, doctor, 1.3 parts per million reduces IQ by 10 points after several years of use.
[01:23:37.057 --> 01:23:39.459]  Imagine 300 parts per million.
[01:23:39.459 --> 01:23:40.940]  That is a devastating dose.
[01:23:41.704 --> 01:23:42.745]  Devastating dose.
[01:23:42.745 --> 01:23:54.476]  Let me point out that the United States government pressed very hard to add very high levels of fluoride to baby formula through Codex Alimentarius.
[01:23:54.476 --> 01:24:05.366]  We were able to keep them from adding fluoride to normal babies formula, but then at the very end of the meeting, they ran through the ability to add high levels
[01:24:05.726 --> 01:24:08.328]  To the formulas for sick infants.
[01:24:08.328 --> 01:24:15.093]  This is a program to control us and to dumb us and to make us infertile.
[01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.375]  And fluoride is in many vaccines.
[01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:19.977]  Why would fluoride be in a vaccine?
[01:24:19.977 --> 01:24:26.281]  Because it's synergistically toxic with the aluminum and the mercury in those vaccines.
[01:24:26.281 --> 01:24:28.363]  This is a death program.
[01:24:28.743 --> 01:24:29.324]  Sure.
[01:24:29.324 --> 01:24:30.985]  I can walk out my door.
[01:24:30.985 --> 01:24:32.726]  There's a grocery store three minutes away.
[01:24:32.726 --> 01:24:34.848]  I could be back in 10 minutes.
[01:24:34.848 --> 01:24:40.893]  Half the water section is nursery water with added fluoride for babies at a very high level.
[01:24:40.893 --> 01:24:43.235]  I mean, we're talking 10 parts per million or higher.
[01:24:43.235 --> 01:24:52.262]  I mean, this is so sick to give developing babies their high fructose corn syrup formula mixed with this.
[01:24:52.262 --> 01:24:53.663]  And I tell women I know,
[01:24:55.064 --> 01:24:59.486]  That I see giving them the high fructose corn syrup formula.
[01:24:59.486 --> 01:25:02.167]  I say, listen, it's a death sentence for your child's brain.
[01:25:02.167 --> 01:25:05.108]  And they go, there's no way the government would allow that.
[01:25:05.108 --> 01:25:08.690]  And they can't admit they've already been hurting their kid, so they won't reverse it.
[01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:10.971]  They're committed to having a moron child.
[01:25:12.915 --> 01:25:17.296]  Yes, well, so are a lot of other people, and then we get to Common Core Education.
[01:25:17.296 --> 01:25:32.440]  But it's very important to understand that if you're drinking fluoridated water, or eating fluoridated food, and you take vaccines, you're adding aluminum and fluoride together, and they are synergistically 10,000 times more toxic.
[01:25:35.987 --> 01:25:42.471]  Wow, well listen, I've been asking some of the questions here, but you guys rightfully say, but you're bigger experts on than I am on eugenics and things.
[01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:51.717]  With your backgrounds, from a military background, from a medical doctor background, why do you say they're now launching, they've gone from testing to actually launching the mass culling?
[01:25:57.026 --> 01:26:02.648]  One of the things that we see is that the death rates are increasing.
[01:26:02.648 --> 01:26:10.930]  We see that the United States, because of its vaccines, has the highest infant mortality rate in the developed world.
[01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:14.832]  Even Zimbabwe has a lower infant mortality rate.
[01:26:14.832 --> 01:26:17.832]  It has the highest first-day infant mortality.
[01:26:17.832 --> 01:26:20.853]  It has the highest one-year infant mortality.
[01:26:20.853 --> 01:26:24.394]  And it has the highest five-year infant mortality.
[01:26:24.394 --> 01:26:25.915]  I would call that a great culling.
[01:26:26.295 --> 01:26:35.239]  I would call the fact that privileged white males are now dying at an accelerating rate part of the Great Culling.
[01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:39.081]  I would call the induced infertility part of the Great Culling.
[01:26:39.081 --> 01:26:48.045]  I would call the introduction of Nagelase, the enzyme that blocks the immune system, part of the Great Culling.
[01:26:48.045 --> 01:26:49.485]  How is it introduced?
[01:26:49.485 --> 01:26:52.487]  Well, it appears to be introduced in vaccines.
[01:26:53.127 --> 01:27:03.690]  I think one of the most important things that we can do to stop the Great Culling is never, ever again take a vaccine or allow anyone to take a vaccine.
[01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:21.215]  But given the mandates that are being forced upon us globally, like the no jab, no pay in Australia, like SB 277 in California, every child must be vaccinated and every childcare worker, unless we assert our right
[01:27:23.035 --> 01:27:34.543]  You're right.
[01:27:34.543 --> 01:27:38.886]  We've got to get organized.
[01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:39.787]  We've got to get aggressive.
[01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:41.948]  But everything you're saying just makes the light bulb go off.
[01:27:41.948 --> 01:27:44.930]  We've got British, U.S., Canadian, you name it, studies.
[01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:45.771]  Just type into Google
[01:27:46.832 --> 01:27:50.074]  Flu vaccine doubles your chances of getting flu.
[01:27:50.074 --> 01:27:55.376]  Mainstream news admits it doesn't work and gives you the flu and destroys your immune system.
[01:27:55.376 --> 01:27:58.278]  And people admit autoimmune disorders are off the charts.
[01:27:58.278 --> 01:28:00.979]  They have videos on the news in Mexico and Latin America.
[01:28:00.979 --> 01:28:04.921]  They give the little girls the Gardasil and a bunch of them start having convulsions.
[01:28:04.921 --> 01:28:07.302]  This is really testing how much we'll put up with.
[01:28:08.772 --> 01:28:11.234]  I think we're beyond testing how much we'll put up with.
[01:28:11.234 --> 01:28:18.339]  They have determined how much we'll put up with, and it's anything they want to give us until we say no.
[01:28:18.339 --> 01:28:33.989]  Now, you said earlier, Alex, that people book their own vaccine exemption card, and you're kind of right and kind of wrong, because there is a very specific legal format necessary for exerting your informed consent right.
[01:28:33.989 --> 01:28:37.192]  And if you don't do it right, you're going to get vaccinated.
[01:28:38.032 --> 01:28:48.325]  That's why we've created the Advanced Vaccine Directive and why we are working so hard to make it available to everyone.
[01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:53.472]  In fact, we just slashed the prices so that everyone can afford it.
[01:28:53.472 --> 01:28:55.915]  Now, I want to say everyone needs one.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:08.128]  In your diaper pack, in your backpack, in your wallet, in your purse, each person has to assert that right.
[01:29:08.128 --> 01:29:12.310]  And if they don't, they will be forcibly vaccinated.
[01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.731]  Sure, Doc.
[01:29:12.731 --> 01:29:17.714]  The point I'm getting at is, I appreciate the service you're providing, and I agree with your analysis of it.
[01:29:17.714 --> 01:29:21.557]  I want to come back and talk about Nuremberg Code, informed consent, and all that.
[01:29:21.557 --> 01:29:24.398]  I'm just telling people, if they don't go get one from you,
[01:29:25.299 --> 01:29:39.931]  People can go look at the wording you've put on, whatever they do, learn this info, teach it to others, and explain to people that under the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, Common Law, Nuremberg Code, Geneva Convention, they cannot force you to take this stuff.
[01:29:39.931 --> 01:29:42.953]  Plus, they got hundreds of vaccines coming down the line.
[01:29:42.953 --> 01:29:47.537]  20 years ago, it was like 15.
[01:29:47.537 --> 01:29:48.938]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.938 --> 01:29:51.460]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:54.162]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.772 --> 01:30:04.277]  A proposed EU law puts the simple act of linking to content under copyright protection.
[01:30:04.277 --> 01:30:07.779]  Giulio Retta, a German activist, puts it this way.
[01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:15.045]  The European Commission is preparing a frontal attack on the hyperlink, the basic building block of the internet as we know it.
[01:30:15.045 --> 01:30:19.429]  This is based on an absurd idea that just won't die.
[01:30:19.429 --> 01:30:25.574]  Making search engines and news portals pay media companies for promoting their freely accessible articles.
[01:30:25.914 --> 01:30:30.636]  Reddit cites a draft communication on copyright reform leaked last week.
[01:30:30.636 --> 01:30:37.499]  The ideas expressed by the document challenged the existing interpretation and spirit of the law as well as common sense.
[01:30:37.499 --> 01:30:46.262]  Each web link would become a legal landmine and would allow press publishers to hold every single actor on the internet liable, she went on to explain.
[01:30:46.582 --> 01:30:52.810]  Reddit believes the EU will try to slide this through under the guise of clearing up unanswered questions.
[01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:55.834]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.533 --> 01:31:02.035]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:02.035 --> 01:31:10.301]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:10.301 --> 01:31:15.725]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:15.725 --> 01:31:18.247]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:31:29.624 --> 01:31:31.825]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:31.825 --> 01:31:36.826]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:31:36.826 --> 01:31:40.107]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:40.107 --> 01:31:43.608]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:43.608 --> 01:31:45.289]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:45.589 --> 01:31:46.489]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:46.489 --> 01:31:47.670]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:47.670 --> 01:31:49.691]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:31:49.691 --> 01:31:58.234]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:58.234 --> 01:32:03.996]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:32:03.996 --> 01:32:09.818]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds.
[01:32:10.038 --> 01:32:10.378]  I think so.
[01:32:32.256 --> 01:32:35.818]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:32:35.818 --> 01:32:39.959]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:32:39.959 --> 01:32:44.261]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:48.403]  LiverShield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[01:32:48.403 --> 01:32:53.465]  Secure your LiverShield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[01:33:17.139 --> 01:33:18.840]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.481]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:20.481 --> 01:33:35.550]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:40.733]  Coming up... We're gonna break down the battle plan to stop forced inoculation, forced drugging.
[01:33:42.929 --> 01:33:56.357]  And let's be clear, what they call vaccines today is a bunch of different families of biological intervention, biological rearrangement.
[01:33:56.357 --> 01:34:03.201]  I remember 20 years ago reading about vaccines they already had that would, quote, make you not depressed anymore because it would destroy parts of your brain.
[01:34:03.201 --> 01:34:05.643]  Viruses would literally eat part of your brain.
[01:34:05.643 --> 01:34:07.404]  Now they call them anti-stress vaccines.
[01:34:08.715 --> 01:34:10.196]  This is what they want to make you take.
[01:34:10.196 --> 01:34:15.280]  We're going to be talking to General Stubblevine and Dr. Labo about that here in just a minute.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:23.606]  Please don't forget we are running a bunch of different specials this week at Infowarslife.com and your purchases help fund this entire media operation.
[01:34:23.606 --> 01:34:38.196]  Living Defense has scores of different known for thousands of years natural herbal and plant compounds that take out harmful organic organisms.
[01:34:40.455 --> 01:34:42.437]  Better known as parasites.
[01:34:42.437 --> 01:34:48.261]  Everything from well-crafted black walnut to, you name it, is in there.
[01:34:48.261 --> 01:34:48.962]  Check it out.
[01:34:48.962 --> 01:34:50.143]  Read all about it.
[01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:53.506]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:34:53.506 --> 01:35:00.471]  Continuing, we also have 20% off on super high quality winter sun.
[01:35:00.471 --> 01:35:05.635]  And that, of course, is vitamin D that people don't get during the winter.
[01:35:05.635 --> 01:35:06.917]  But let me read you some of the
[01:35:08.622 --> 01:35:09.242]  Reviews.
[01:35:09.242 --> 01:35:11.184]  We know they're targeting testosterone.
[01:35:11.184 --> 01:35:13.485]  Super Male Vitality doesn't mimic testosterone.
[01:35:13.485 --> 01:35:20.929]  According to what Dr. Gripp says, it's your body to trigger your glands to release the hormones, period, that your body needs.
[01:35:20.929 --> 01:35:24.971]  And here are some of the reviews on Super Male Vitality.
[01:35:24.971 --> 01:35:31.574]  This is from Screech in Smithville, Rhode Island.
[01:35:31.574 --> 01:35:32.375]  Amazing energy.
[01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:39.024]  For daring my heavy lifting on the ice today and for hockey, I would recommend it to a friend.
[01:35:39.024 --> 01:35:40.444]  Five stars.
[01:35:40.444 --> 01:35:42.145]  They have an average of 4.8 stars.
[01:35:42.145 --> 01:35:43.726]  Thousands of reviews.
[01:35:43.726 --> 01:35:49.609]  Lobo in Hagerstown, Maryland.
[01:35:49.609 --> 01:35:49.929]  Love it.
[01:35:50.936 --> 01:35:52.417]  These are shorter ones today.
[01:35:52.417 --> 01:35:53.338]  We get new ones every day.
[01:35:53.338 --> 01:35:59.442]  You can go read them, linking through the third-party sites and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:59.442 --> 01:36:08.868]  Now, we also have discounts running on things like BrainForce, that just takes a bunch of known compounds that make up the brain, that have been connected to more focus.
[01:36:09.608 --> 01:36:10.148]  I think so.
[01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:42.796]  And when I'm wound up, when I've been on the radio till midnight, when I'm on the road, I can't sleep, I don't take it maybe once or twice a week, I take Knockout.
[01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:53.424]  It's $19.95, it's got melatonin, it's got valerian, it's got L-tryptophan, a bunch of other stuff, organically based, good, large dosages of it.
[01:36:53.424 --> 01:36:58.127]  It's $19.95 for a bottle of the same strength and the same number of capillates, just of melatonin.
[01:36:59.141 --> 01:37:01.202]  And then the rest of the big pills, filler.
[01:37:01.202 --> 01:37:02.682]  There's no filler in this.
[01:37:02.682 --> 01:37:05.563]  There's nine different ingredients in it.
[01:37:05.563 --> 01:37:08.783]  All linked to good, restful, healthy sleep.
[01:37:08.783 --> 01:37:09.924]  I only take one.
[01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:12.044]  I've taken two before and it's hard to get up in the morning.
[01:37:12.044 --> 01:37:13.425]  But I take one, it's great.
[01:37:13.425 --> 01:37:15.725]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:15.725 --> 01:37:16.245]  And then finally,
[01:37:23.183 --> 01:37:39.407]  It's more important than ever to spread the word, whether you listen on the internet or watch over the internet at Infowars.com for its last show, on AMFM affiliates, that's really key to tell people how they can tune in, at the grocery store, at red lights, at work, on your email list, at your church.
[01:37:39.407 --> 01:37:41.568]  This is how we're reaching more people.
[01:37:41.568 --> 01:37:43.768]  We're in a race against the globalists.
[01:37:43.768 --> 01:37:44.969]  People are waking up.
[01:37:44.969 --> 01:37:46.069]  Globalism's in trouble.
[01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:47.309]  World government's in trouble.
[01:37:47.309 --> 01:37:50.090]  But it's just putting on more sale and accelerating.
[01:37:51.564 --> 01:37:53.105]  That's why we've got to double down as well.
[01:37:53.105 --> 01:37:56.547]  We're in the fight, ladies and gentlemen, from my perspective.
[01:37:56.547 --> 01:38:08.493]  So again, support those local affiliates, support their local sponsors, become a sponsor, and let them know why you're becoming a sponsor, or support those sponsors and let them know why, and let the station know why as well.
[01:38:08.493 --> 01:38:14.936]  And people of means, call the station, say you want to sponsor a billboard for this show and other shows.
[01:38:14.936 --> 01:38:16.297]  A lot of people are doing that around the country.
[01:38:16.297 --> 01:38:17.097]  We don't have the money for it.
[01:38:17.097 --> 01:38:18.117]  Stations don't.
[01:38:18.117 --> 01:38:18.918]  We're not Clear Channel.
[01:38:20.299 --> 01:38:21.479]  You do.
[01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:27.001]  Will your act of putting up a $2,000 billboard save the world or painting it on the side of your barn for a hundred bucks?
[01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:29.822]  No, but it will move the ball down the field.
[01:38:29.822 --> 01:38:33.503]  Resistance to this tyranny and having the info is victory.
[01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:36.324]  Now, I want to get into vaccines and talk about your card idea.
[01:38:36.324 --> 01:38:36.784]  It's great.
[01:38:36.784 --> 01:38:37.984]  It's wonderful.
[01:38:37.984 --> 01:38:40.185]  Obviously, it's based in law, based in history.
[01:38:40.185 --> 01:38:40.885]  We're going to cover that.
[01:38:40.885 --> 01:38:46.006]  We covered it a few weeks ago with one of your associates, the lawyer, here on the broadcast.
[01:38:48.147 --> 01:38:55.191]  I want to specifically get into Softkill itself and General Stubblevine, Dr. Labo.
[01:38:55.191 --> 01:38:57.492]  Do you agree that the globalists are behind schedule?
[01:38:57.492 --> 01:38:58.833]  Disagree if you do, please.
[01:38:58.833 --> 01:38:59.894]  Because I really want your perspective.
[01:38:59.894 --> 01:39:00.374]  I respect you.
[01:39:01.485 --> 01:39:05.947]  They're behind schedule, so they're almost desperate now, which makes them even more dangerous.
[01:39:05.947 --> 01:39:10.388]  And how do you see the battle space right now, General, in this fight to enlighten people?
[01:39:10.388 --> 01:39:14.570]  Because I see us as winning the fight to wake people up that will think.
[01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:17.631]  The problem is, though, we're still occupied by this global force.
[01:39:17.631 --> 01:39:18.431]  Where does it all go?
[01:39:18.431 --> 01:39:20.291]  I mean, I see the military awake.
[01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:22.312]  I see people in government awake.
[01:39:22.312 --> 01:39:24.813]  But they're not calling the shots.
[01:39:24.813 --> 01:39:26.494]  They're taking orders.
[01:39:26.494 --> 01:39:27.394]  How far can this go?
[01:39:31.681 --> 01:39:35.405]  Let me look at that in a couple of different ways.
[01:39:35.405 --> 01:39:39.849]  First of all, go back to our previous conversation.
[01:39:39.849 --> 01:39:44.454]  Finland, for instance, has, I believe, 11 vaccines.
[01:39:44.454 --> 01:39:44.714]  You know?
[01:39:46.711 --> 01:39:49.652]  We have, right now, 36.
[01:39:49.652 --> 01:39:53.252]  36 vaccines.
[01:39:53.252 --> 01:39:54.393]  And guess what?
[01:39:54.393 --> 01:39:56.533]  There are more in the making.
[01:39:56.533 --> 01:39:58.313]  There are more in the pipeline.
[01:39:58.313 --> 01:40:05.255]  So, we're not going to be, and it's going to be mandatory, so you're not going to get just a few vaccines.
[01:40:05.255 --> 01:40:08.695]  You're going to get a whole lot of vaccines.
[01:40:08.695 --> 01:40:10.816]  Every one of those is going to be
[01:40:11.576 --> 01:40:17.582]  have poisons in it that you do not want in your body.
[01:40:17.582 --> 01:40:19.424]  And that's number one.
[01:40:19.424 --> 01:40:26.011]  Number two, you as the population need to object.
[01:40:26.957 --> 01:40:29.420]  You need to refuse.
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:33.446]  You all now are on active duty.
[01:40:33.446 --> 01:40:37.251]  You all now are part of the Army.
[01:40:37.251 --> 01:40:39.233]  You're part of the military.
[01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:39.954]  Why?
[01:40:39.954 --> 01:40:42.177]  Because you have to say no!
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:53.407]  Not, oh well, here's my arm, you can stick anything in it you want, and put anything in my body that you want to put in there.
[01:40:53.407 --> 01:40:54.068]  Uh-uh.
[01:40:54.068 --> 01:40:55.829]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:40:55.829 --> 01:40:59.912]  You, as a population, must say no.
[01:40:59.912 --> 01:41:01.434]  You now are
[01:41:02.014 --> 01:41:02.715]  Let me, let me...
[01:41:30.788 --> 01:41:36.534]  Take one of the things you said, Alex, and resonate with it for our listeners.
[01:41:36.534 --> 01:41:38.597]  You asked about battle space.
[01:41:38.597 --> 01:41:41.700]  The fundamental battle space is your DNA.
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.223]  Right now, you are being genetically modified.
[01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.566]  You're being genetically modified by the GMO
[01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:50.404]  Garbage and poison in your food.
[01:41:50.404 --> 01:42:03.237]  You're being genetically modified by the chemicals that are used in, quote, food, which ought to be spelled P-H-U-D-E because it doesn't support life or create health.
[01:42:03.237 --> 01:42:06.420]  You're being genetically modified by the vaccines.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.282]  You're being genetically modified by
[01:42:09.944 --> 01:42:27.302]  A whole group of technologies that General Burt has called genomicidal technologies and those in fact recently a scientist from New York said that we should have fertilization in vitro only so that people's genes that make them
[01:42:27.602 --> 01:42:38.247]  Smaller, shorter should be enhanced and the ones that make them taller should be cancelled out to fight global warming.
[01:42:38.247 --> 01:42:40.988]  Logic is not part of the deal here.
[01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:52.153]  Your genes are under attack and one of the things that you need to do is say no to the things that are attacking and changing your genes for two purposes.
[01:42:52.153 --> 01:42:57.075]  One is to kill you and the other is to dumb and
[01:42:57.557 --> 01:43:00.852]  Dwarf you on every parameter.
[01:43:00.852 --> 01:43:02.519]  That's a battle space.
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:04.301]  I totally agree.
[01:43:04.301 --> 01:43:07.344]  And listen, this isn't rhetoric, folks, to get you to wake up.
[01:43:07.344 --> 01:43:10.306]  We have the eco-science written by the current White House science czar.
[01:43:10.306 --> 01:43:11.948]  We have hundreds of books.
[01:43:11.948 --> 01:43:13.229]  You've made films.
[01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:15.831]  You've written about it, Dr. So General Stubblebine.
[01:43:15.831 --> 01:43:18.713]  This is so naked, and that's part of it.
[01:43:18.713 --> 01:43:26.180]  It's a hidden-in-plain-view attack, so brazen, so dirty, with the death panels and the troops being put on no-treat list.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:30.624]  They're really, I agree, going from the testing phase to operational.
[01:43:32.742 --> 01:43:36.443]  Why do you think they're accelerating their program, General?
[01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:36.724]  Why?
[01:43:36.724 --> 01:43:58.692]  Because it's getting... I think they're behind their program schedule, and I think they're worried that people like you and ourselves, Dr. Reba and myself, are beginning to talk about it and to say, okay, here is a way of not doing
[01:43:59.517 --> 01:44:20.293]  What you want me to do, because I do not want to put all of that poison in my body, I do not want to succumb to you, and I'm following the principles of war, one of which is mass, and we need all of you, all of you to say no.
[01:44:20.293 --> 01:44:22.895]  Not just one or two, but everybody.
[01:44:22.895 --> 01:44:23.776]  And educate others.
[01:44:24.076 --> 01:44:33.947]  I mean, to send this video and audio from this interview today, when we put it out, vaccines are designed to kill you, emergency alert, you can't say no to vaccines, get them out.
[01:44:33.947 --> 01:44:44.379]  Let's speak about DrRemaTruthReports.com where people can go at cost and get these cards that have the science, the history, the facts of the Nuremberg Code and U.S.
[01:44:44.379 --> 01:44:44.479]  law.
[01:44:45.934 --> 01:44:46.295]  In the sand.
[01:45:02.297 --> 01:45:05.378]  I mean everybody, you know listeners, people that have been sick from vaccines.
[01:45:05.378 --> 01:45:08.138]  The inserts say they can kill you.
[01:45:08.138 --> 01:45:09.998]  It's just hiding in plain view.
[01:45:09.998 --> 01:45:12.179]  Now is the time to say no.
[01:45:12.179 --> 01:45:16.259]  Now is the time to get in their face when they're giving out the free flu shots on the side of the highway.
[01:45:16.259 --> 01:45:19.740]  Or when they lie and say it's the law every year to take the shots.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.620]  Now is the time to call their bluff.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:25.601]  Let's get into the Nuremberg Code and what's on these cards.
[01:45:25.601 --> 01:45:30.842]  Well, when everybody needs to understand a basic principle.
[01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:41.558]  When a country signs a treaty, the law of that treaty wipes out whatever the law of the country was and replaces it.
[01:45:41.558 --> 01:45:45.582]  It trumps or it supersedes national law.
[01:45:45.582 --> 01:45:57.432]  So when the United States and 125 other countries around the world ratified the Geneva Conventions, and there have been three separate Geneva Conventions, the U.S.
[01:45:57.432 --> 01:45:58.573]  has ratified them all,
[01:45:59.153 --> 01:46:07.695]  That means that the law of informed consent, so-called humanitarian law, is now the law of the United States.
[01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:19.337]  No matter what California passes, or Montana, or Idaho, or even the United States itself at the federal level, the law of informed consent prevails.
[01:46:19.337 --> 01:46:22.378]  Now that law says that you have the right to say no
[01:46:23.490 --> 01:46:32.158]  To any medical intervention, including vaccination, without pressure, without prejudice, and without punishment.
[01:46:32.158 --> 01:46:35.801]  That means you cannot be forced to give up a right.
[01:46:35.801 --> 01:46:38.664]  For instance, the right to a public education for your children.
[01:46:39.664 --> 01:46:47.310]  I'm sorry, to give up a benefit in order to have someone be pleased with you.
[01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:57.017]  You cannot be forced to give up a right in order to get a benefit, like the Australian $16,000 a year per child payments.
[01:46:57.017 --> 01:46:58.999]  You are entitled to that.
[01:46:58.999 --> 01:47:04.383]  And if somebody comes at you with a vaccine and you have not asserted your right,
[01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:21.313]  Your informed consent is deemed waived, but if you have asserted that right, according to the United States Supreme Court, as well as the law of the land, once you've asserted your right to informed consent,
[01:47:21.994 --> 01:47:30.736]  Anybody who violates that is committing malpractice, is committing assault, is committing battery, and a variety of other crimes.
[01:47:30.736 --> 01:47:46.400]  And by the way, my dad as a physician years ago said that that's what he would do when people try to force vaccines on whoever, or for him to practice medicine they would try, he would come and say to the board, because he got called for a board one time, he said, all of you sign this informed consent for liability if I get hurt.
[01:47:47.361 --> 01:47:49.103]  Tell me it's safe and that you'll pay for it.
[01:47:49.103 --> 01:47:51.826]  They said fine, you don't have to have the hepatitis shots.
[01:47:51.826 --> 01:47:54.369]  But I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[01:47:54.369 --> 01:48:03.679]  And the reason we created this card at the Natural Solutions Foundation, the Advanced Vaccine Directive, is that the law
[01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:09.192]  of advanced health directives is well-established.
[01:48:09.192 --> 01:48:16.295]  Once you properly assert your advanced health wish, I don't want to be vaccinated, I don't want to be resuscitated.
[01:48:16.295 --> 01:48:17.415]  It's your living will.
[01:48:17.415 --> 01:48:18.896]  Penicillin.
[01:48:18.896 --> 01:48:26.719]  Then, if they do violate that, it's established that they're already committing a crime.
[01:48:26.719 --> 01:48:27.940]  So you are protected.
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.641]  Now, will everyone
[01:48:31.742 --> 01:48:34.383]  Will it be respected for everyone who asserts it?
[01:48:34.383 --> 01:48:35.023]  No.
[01:48:35.023 --> 01:48:41.246]  Some people will be violated, and then they are big time, heavy duty... That's right.
[01:48:41.246 --> 01:48:48.869]  These public schools from California to Alabama that have been caught giving kids shots en masse, even when parents said no, are super liable.
[01:48:48.869 --> 01:48:52.670]  Parents just don't know how to take action.
[01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:56.652]  But understand that just saying no is not enough.
[01:48:56.652 --> 01:48:58.393]  You actually have to... Give them a form.
[01:48:59.438 --> 01:49:04.240]  You have to do it in the correct legal way, or it won't count.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.923]  You can't just write it on a piece of paper and say, no, no... Let me ask this question.
[01:49:08.923 --> 01:49:13.265]  General, what about the misnomer that the military has to take any shot they want?
[01:49:13.265 --> 01:49:25.971]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from law, that's the prescribed, authorized, non-experimental shots, because you waive some of your rights joining the military, but still implied consent is there if it's deemed experimental, correct?
[01:49:26.971 --> 01:49:27.511]  Correct.
[01:49:27.511 --> 01:49:28.032]  No.
[01:49:28.032 --> 01:49:28.392]  No.
[01:49:28.392 --> 01:49:28.913]  Sorry.
[01:49:28.913 --> 01:49:29.433]  No.
[01:49:29.433 --> 01:49:30.074]  Both of you.
[01:49:30.074 --> 01:49:31.175]  Well, I know you're a medical doctor.
[01:49:31.175 --> 01:49:32.035]  Correct us then, doctor.
[01:49:32.035 --> 01:49:34.337]  I love you both.
[01:49:34.337 --> 01:49:35.798]  This is so important.
[01:49:35.798 --> 01:49:38.341]  I have to correct you, Alex, and I have to correct you, too.
[01:49:38.341 --> 01:49:38.541]  Well, no.
[01:49:38.541 --> 01:49:39.622]  I mean, we want to get your perspective.
[01:49:39.622 --> 01:49:40.342]  Go ahead.
[01:49:40.342 --> 01:49:42.244]  Okay.
[01:49:42.244 --> 01:49:46.307]  Every vaccine and every drug is experimental.
[01:49:46.307 --> 01:49:47.008]  Well, I know they are.
[01:49:47.008 --> 01:49:48.409]  I'm talking about the law, though.
[01:49:48.409 --> 01:49:49.570]  I'm just saying for the military.
[01:49:49.710 --> 01:49:50.491]  That's the law.
[01:49:50.491 --> 01:49:51.851]  That's the point.
[01:49:51.851 --> 01:50:01.857]  Because the Nuremberg Code and the Geneva Conventions don't say that this applies only to experimental drugs.
[01:50:01.857 --> 01:50:05.940]  But in fact, every drug and every vaccine... I know, but I'm saying, don't you waive that right when you join the military?
[01:50:06.806 --> 01:50:17.118]  Well, the courts have said yes, but the issue in law is not what the truth is, it's what the answer to the specific question is.
[01:50:17.118 --> 01:50:17.518]  No, I know.
[01:50:17.518 --> 01:50:21.122]  You're a medical doctor, an expert, and General Stubblebine commanded hundreds of thousands of troops.
[01:50:21.122 --> 01:50:22.424]  That's why I'm asking.
[01:50:22.424 --> 01:50:27.590]  We've got 30 seconds, General, but where does it stand for servicemen and women?
[01:50:29.133 --> 01:50:38.656]  Right now, uh, most people don't even understand the issue, and so they all say, no, you gotta have this, you gotta have this, you gotta have this.
[01:50:38.656 --> 01:50:42.217]  But the answer, real answer is, no, you don't.
[01:50:42.217 --> 01:50:45.858]  Not if you say, I do not consent.
[01:50:45.858 --> 01:50:47.658]  You do not have to do it.
[01:50:47.658 --> 01:50:51.419]  So it's your belief that informed consent extends also serving members of the military?
[01:50:51.419 --> 01:50:52.379]  Yes.
[01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:53.480]  That's powerful info.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.320]  They don't know it yet, but the answer is still yes.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:56.901]  Okay, good.
[01:50:56.901 --> 01:50:57.321]  That's good.
[01:50:57.321 --> 01:50:57.801]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.681 --> 01:51:00.042]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[01:51:00.042 --> 01:51:07.868]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.
[01:51:07.868 --> 01:51:09.969]  Skills you'll need when it hits the fan.

[01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:12.671]  DrivenDVD.com.
[01:51:28.742 --> 01:51:31.584]  If survivalist housing has been in your plans, get ready.
[01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:35.646]  We're bringing our Timberline Range Camps to you February 6th through 14th.
[01:51:35.646 --> 01:51:38.548]  The Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

[01:51:45.392 --> 01:51:47.993]  We'll bring it to the show and save you the cost of shipping.
[01:51:47.993 --> 01:51:50.415]  It's the perfect time to get that camp you've wanted.
[01:51:50.415 --> 01:51:57.319]  Go to survivalistcamps.com, then plan on joining us at the Great American Outdoor Show in February in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[01:51:58.362 --> 01:52:04.027]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:52:04.027 --> 01:52:18.458]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:52:18.638 --> 01:52:26.624]  LiverShield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:52:26.624 --> 01:52:32.068]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:52:32.068 --> 01:52:35.770]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:52:35.770 --> 01:52:39.853]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:43.736]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:52:44.076 --> 01:52:48.203]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[01:52:48.203 --> 01:52:53.271]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[01:52:58.095 --> 01:53:04.320]  At 30dayfoodsupply.com, two of our top priorities are providing quality food at a reasonable price and protecting your security.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:12.606]  When you call 800-700-2184, we will never record your phone call and never ask for your personal information, like how much food you have stored or where you keep it.
[01:53:12.606 --> 01:53:16.629]  We'll also never store your credit card information and email address on a computer.
[01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:18.931]  Your email address will never be shared or sold.
[01:53:18.931 --> 01:53:21.072]  We'll never limit the number of boxes you can purchase.
[01:53:21.072 --> 01:53:24.495]  We'll never use outside packers or use relabeled food from another company.
[01:53:24.935 --> 01:53:33.397]  Our meals are naturally high in fiber, carbs and protein and everything is packed with oxygen absorbers and Mylar pouches under our direct supervision at our plant in Oregon.
[01:53:33.397 --> 01:53:40.259]  Oregon Trail Foods and 30dayfoodsupply.com keep prices low by buying directly from their producers in Oregon and then passing the savings on to you.

[01:54:05.956 --> 01:54:11.678]  We've got University of Missouri students threatened as free speech activists plan a rally.
[01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:22.842]  So because the students got so vicious of the politically correct people with their malice-style activities, they had to just cancel classes and get everybody out of there because they were just frothing, running around attacking reporters and...
[01:54:23.522 --> 01:54:28.407]  Just screaming with professors, screaming, our time has come, our takeover is here.
[01:54:28.407 --> 01:54:31.289]  While they're all being soft-killed, it's just total insanity.
[01:54:31.289 --> 01:54:33.731]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:33.731 --> 01:54:35.013]  We'll be breaking some of that down.
[01:54:35.013 --> 01:54:40.598]  Of course, as usual, George Soros and others are tied in to the guy that started the whole operation.
[01:54:42.822 --> 01:54:46.463]  It's truly, truly sick.
[01:54:46.463 --> 01:54:51.946]  Also, there's a new video, How You Can Stop and Expose Political Correctness.
[01:54:51.946 --> 01:54:53.386]  That's all coming up the next hour.
[01:54:53.386 --> 01:55:00.770]  We also have our reporters from Missouri State, where they're trying to pull down the statue of Thomas Jefferson now.
[01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:03.431]  Joining us, Kit Daniels and Jakari Jackson.
[01:55:03.431 --> 01:55:05.232]  That is all coming up.
[01:55:06.551 --> 01:55:07.732]  In the next hour.
[01:55:07.732 --> 01:55:11.314]  Well, General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo, I want to thank you both for coming on.
[01:55:11.314 --> 01:55:17.238]  It's the best place for people, because your site's so jam-packed, DrRemaTruthReports.com.
[01:55:17.238 --> 01:55:23.842]  Can they go there and find these consent forms so that people can get the card and the facts and learn how to say no?
[01:55:23.842 --> 01:55:26.864]  Because medical people, obviously, as you're saying, know the law.
[01:55:26.864 --> 01:55:29.246]  They know this trumps what they're doing.
[01:55:29.246 --> 01:55:34.069]  And so the fact they're trying to intimidate you into something can certainly backfire on them.
[01:55:35.279 --> 01:55:36.860]  Absolutely.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:42.241]  That is precisely where they can go and there's a button there and they can follow it.
[01:55:42.241 --> 01:56:00.627]  But I think that understanding that we have the right to control what happens to our body, no matter what the liars tell us, is fundamental to everything that you're trying to do for us, Alex, and that we're trying to do for everyone as well.
[01:56:01.227 --> 01:56:10.853]  And we really would appreciate it if you use our card, because that will allow us to support you further in the future.
[01:56:10.853 --> 01:56:11.634]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:56:11.634 --> 01:56:19.079]  I think what you're doing is great, and of course I'm not involved monetarily in this, but you were saying if they put in some kind of promo code with my name, they get a discount on the card?
[01:56:19.079 --> 01:56:28.025]  If they use an AJ code, there's a slot for the code, then we will support your work from the proceeds of that.
[01:56:28.285 --> 01:56:28.905]  I didn't even know that.
[01:56:28.905 --> 01:56:30.827]  Okay, well you were telling my producer that.
[01:56:30.827 --> 01:56:32.088]  Listen, that's fine.
[01:56:32.088 --> 01:56:39.473]  You guys can just donate that money back to getting other people maybe more cards or something because it is really important.
[01:56:39.473 --> 01:56:40.253]  And you're right.
[01:56:40.253 --> 01:56:43.855]  Because what you're telling me to do and what you're saying to do is exactly what my dad...
[01:56:44.776 --> 01:56:49.138]  He's been on medical boards at the state level and a lot more, testifies before the legislature.
[01:56:49.138 --> 01:56:50.659]  He's a pretty smart guy at this.
[01:56:50.659 --> 01:56:56.882]  He said the exact same thing, that it violates the Geneva Convention and consent, federal, state law.
[01:56:56.882 --> 01:57:04.726]  It's just crazy that they're doing this, but I think it's a sign of desperation because they know the awakening about vaccines is happening.
[01:57:05.797 --> 01:57:06.758]  Absolutely.
[01:57:06.758 --> 01:57:08.639]  They're desperate in many ways.
[01:57:08.639 --> 01:57:12.142]  This is just one way to protect ourselves.
[01:57:12.142 --> 01:57:15.305]  But there are so many areas that we need to be active in.
[01:57:15.305 --> 01:57:17.287]  I'm so pleased to be back on the show.
[01:57:17.287 --> 01:57:23.552]  It's been a long time and we're happy to support what you're doing and to share our information with everybody.
[01:57:23.592 --> 01:57:29.154]  Well, I want to get you and General Stubblebine back sometime to talk about what's happening militarily around the world.
[01:57:29.154 --> 01:57:31.034]  In one minute we have left General Stubblebine.
[01:57:31.034 --> 01:57:36.436]  What do you make of it coming out that the West is funding ISIS and that we're starting this thing in Ukraine?
[01:57:36.436 --> 01:57:39.037]  What's your view of what the globalists are doing with our military right now?
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:46.367]  I think a good part of it is all about oil.
[01:57:46.367 --> 01:57:50.411]  And I think they're worried that we're going to lose the oil.
[01:57:50.411 --> 01:57:59.140]  And so everybody, or what we need then is our own army to keep the oil for us.
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:00.081]  I think it's crazy.
[01:58:00.779 --> 01:58:12.806]  I want to say on Veterans Day, despite our military being deployed in bad ways, some of my favorite folks are veterans like yourself, so we appreciate your service in what you believe is our republic, General Stubblebine.
[01:58:12.806 --> 01:58:14.467]  Let me tell you one thing.
[01:58:14.467 --> 01:58:18.969]  War is, or should be, the last choice.
[01:58:18.969 --> 01:58:22.551]  The last choice, not the first.
[01:58:22.551 --> 01:58:24.032]  Absolutely, you're absolutely right.
[01:58:24.032 --> 01:58:27.694]  Well, thank you so much, General, and Dr. Lebo, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:58:27.694 --> 01:58:28.315]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:29.059 --> 01:58:29.539]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:29.539 --> 01:58:30.580]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:31.240]  You bet.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.301]  There they go, folks.
[01:58:32.301 --> 01:58:34.503]  Wow, General Stubblevine.
[01:58:34.503 --> 01:58:36.104]  That guy's been involved in so much.
[01:58:36.104 --> 01:58:36.984]  He's really interesting.
[01:58:36.984 --> 01:58:37.625]  We'll be back.
[01:58:37.625 --> 01:58:38.165]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.165 --> 01:58:38.726]  Third hour.
[01:58:38.726 --> 01:58:41.447]  Gonna be jam-packed.
[01:58:41.447 --> 01:58:45.210]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:48.399 --> 01:58:51.901]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:51.901 --> 01:59:00.145]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:00.145 --> 01:59:05.568]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:05.568 --> 01:59:08.109]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:10.210]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:14.393]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:59:18.283 --> 01:59:19.383]  BrainForce is here.
[01:59:19.383 --> 01:59:21.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:21.604 --> 01:59:26.585]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:26.585 --> 01:59:29.886]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:29.886 --> 01:59:33.367]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:33.367 --> 01:59:35.347]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:35.347 --> 01:59:37.468]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:37.468 --> 01:59:39.448]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:59:39.448 --> 01:59:45.049]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:53.194]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:53.194 --> 02:00:01.224]  Big Brother!
[02:00:04.605 --> 02:00:09.428]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.428 --> 02:00:11.010]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.010 --> 02:00:12.551]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.551 --> 02:00:16.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.754 --> 02:00:21.457]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.457 --> 02:00:25.200]  All I can say to patriots worldwide fighting the globalists is stay on target.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:27.061]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:27.061 --> 02:00:29.763]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Jakari Jackson and Kit Daniels.
[02:00:29.763 --> 02:00:33.085]  Both Chinese from the headquarters of Missouri State University.
[02:00:33.085 --> 02:00:39.670]  They're now moving on to try to pull down statues of Thomas Jefferson and more, and vowing to attack anyone engaged in free speech.
[02:00:39.670 --> 02:00:43.693]  So much so, the college had to cancel events.
[02:00:43.693 --> 02:00:48.256]  But first, let's go to this report about protecting our liver, since Dr. Labo was just talking about that.
[02:00:48.256 --> 02:00:51.438]  We'll come back after a break with key intel.
[02:00:51.438 --> 02:00:53.160]  And when you eat all these toxins,
[02:00:54.554 --> 02:01:08.005]  If you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had plasticizers in them, your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do, so the liver basically excretes that into the gallbladder, and it holds it.
[02:01:08.005 --> 02:01:14.650]  Just Google gallbladder stones, and it's disgusting, but you need to look at it.
[02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:19.234]  And when you finally get filled up with these, it bursts, or it gets infected, and they've got to remove it.
[02:01:20.779 --> 02:01:21.780]  And we'll scroll through these.
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:23.321]  There's even grosser ones.
[02:01:23.321 --> 02:01:24.582]  Like, let's scroll down.
[02:01:24.582 --> 02:01:26.643]  On average, they're green or black.
[02:01:26.643 --> 02:01:30.867]  If they're black, they're really old and toxic.
[02:01:30.867 --> 02:01:33.208]  They're generally green.
[02:01:33.208 --> 02:01:39.413]  And this stuff's meant to be passed out at you, but we eat such artificial food that it doesn't.
[02:01:39.413 --> 02:01:41.695]  These are way beyond kidney stones, you name it.
[02:01:41.695 --> 02:01:43.096]  You also have liver stones.
[02:01:45.811 --> 02:01:50.012]  And medical doctors won't tell you on average, hey, flush your liver.
[02:01:50.012 --> 02:01:51.993]  They'll just say, hey, your liver's sick.
[02:01:51.993 --> 02:01:53.293]  It's going to get progressively worse.
[02:01:53.293 --> 02:01:58.475]  We're going to get you on a list for a liver transplant.
[02:01:58.475 --> 02:01:59.455]  It is unbelievable.
[02:01:59.455 --> 02:02:01.116]  We're showing these disgusting images.
[02:02:01.116 --> 02:02:08.898]  So, about a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Gribbs liver cleanse, the one he recommends.
[02:02:08.898 --> 02:02:12.680]  And he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.420]  You really ought to do it.
[02:02:15.191 --> 02:02:17.634]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[02:02:17.634 --> 02:02:19.898]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[02:02:19.898 --> 02:02:23.082]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[02:02:23.082 --> 02:02:24.083]  This is how ignorant I am.
[02:02:25.359 --> 02:02:40.626]  How does the apple cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over a six-day cleanse, how does it then when you take the olive oil at the end, lay on your side for an hour as you go to sleep, why does it then have the gallbladder release?
[02:02:40.626 --> 02:02:45.509]  What you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[02:02:46.249 --> 02:03:00.893]  Starting in the early 90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver, was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder.
[02:03:00.893 --> 02:03:03.874]  And that's really what the first five days is for.
[02:03:03.874 --> 02:03:12.457]  That's where you mix the bottle of liver shield, you pour the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled water, and then you drink four eight-ounce glasses a day of that.
[02:03:13.317 --> 02:03:14.478]  Four or five days.
[02:03:14.478 --> 02:03:17.962]  At the same time though, you're also using the apple cider vinegar.
[02:03:17.962 --> 02:03:28.753]  And that's going to be the liver flush kit that we put together exclusively for InfoWars viewers and the people that want to support the InfoWar.
[02:03:30.114 --> 02:03:49.675]  So basically that, once you do that for five days and of course you want to eat fairly healthy, you don't want to be putting a bunch of chemicals and toxins into your body, but then on day five is when you actually do the olive oil and when you do Epsom salts and the Epsom salts that you drink will actually help relax the bile duct
[02:03:50.416 --> 02:03:50.836]  Thank you!
[02:04:05.908 --> 02:04:15.571]  And that heavy oil ends up absorbing down through your intestinal lining and going into the liver, and it kind of works like oil pulling, which is a big thing now.
[02:04:15.571 --> 02:04:24.834]  It was on Dr. Ross with the coconut oil, where you swish it in your mouth, and oil has an affinity for toxic substances and absorbs some of those.
[02:04:24.834 --> 02:04:30.856]  And when you do the liver cleanse, you will actually form, also, little oil globulins as well.
[02:04:31.576 --> 02:04:51.999]  So the reason why you take during the flush, the liver flush, the reason why you take oxy powder at the same time is because you want to be able to flush that out of the system because when the liver dumps all those toxic balls and rocks and all that toxic buildup that's been in there for years and years and years, you want to have something to flush it out of the intestines.
[02:05:00.827 --> 02:05:04.110]  In Florida, they call me Jeb, because I earned it.
[02:05:04.110 --> 02:05:05.130]  Poor Jeb.
[02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:09.354]  I got a lot of really cool things that I could do other than sit around being miserable.
[02:05:09.354 --> 02:05:11.096]  Jeb just got some more bad news.
[02:05:11.096 --> 02:05:18.462]  While both Trump and Carson would beat Hillary in Florida, former Florida Governor Jeb would lose to Hillary in the Republican-leaning state.
[02:05:18.462 --> 02:05:24.788]  And with that news, Jeb's exclamation mark went completely flaccid.
[02:05:25.368 --> 02:05:27.288]  And his comments got even stranger.
[02:05:27.288 --> 02:05:28.409]  I love my dad.
[02:05:28.409 --> 02:05:29.249]  I'd kill for him.
[02:05:29.249 --> 02:05:31.449]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[02:05:31.449 --> 02:05:34.710]  Well, I'm sure that comes up around the Bush dinner table, but come on.
[02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:37.511]  The Bushes, just like the Clintons, are too big to jail.
[02:05:37.511 --> 02:05:39.271]  They call me Vito Corleone.
[02:05:39.271 --> 02:05:40.491]  More like Fredo.
[02:05:40.491 --> 02:05:44.212]  Jeb's campaign finance woes highlight a problem with super PACs.
[02:05:44.212 --> 02:05:49.333]  Candidates can't pay their staff from super PACs because they presumably don't control them.
[02:05:49.333 --> 02:05:53.894]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods, and the super PACs are where you place your bets.
[02:05:55.316 --> 02:05:57.216]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:58.697]  I got the horse right here!

[02:07:56.594 --> 02:08:05.281]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:05.281 --> 02:08:07.563]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.038 --> 02:08:16.901]  I want to play some of the debate highlights.
[02:08:16.901 --> 02:08:20.563]  Leanne McAdoo will be hosting in the fourth hour today.
[02:08:20.563 --> 02:08:24.946]  They're going to play a ten-minute synopsis of their debate coverage last night.
[02:08:24.946 --> 02:08:26.627]  It's pretty powerful.
[02:08:26.627 --> 02:08:33.452]  Also, Joe Biggs will be in talking about Veterans Day and more in the fourth hour today.
[02:08:33.452 --> 02:08:40.977]  Now, I've got, no exaggeration, more than a hundred news articles that are all very interesting to cover, and I've got a bunch of clips to get to, but I'm going back to something I covered earlier because
[02:08:42.489 --> 02:08:47.810]  When I was reading this, it just hit me, this is slavery.
[02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:50.171]  Germany is bringing back slavery.
[02:08:50.171 --> 02:08:55.072]  That's what political correctness and socialism is.
[02:08:55.072 --> 02:09:09.756]  Where select groups have to pay higher taxes, have to do national service, even when they're poor, because of their race or their nationality, as part of the cult of political correctness, that is slavery.
[02:09:10.635 --> 02:09:21.717]  Germany to spend some 22.6 billion to accept refugees in 2015 based on the assumption that only 1.1 million have come in when it's well over 2 million.
[02:09:21.717 --> 02:09:25.338]  Now here's the story up on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:09:25.338 --> 02:09:28.619]  This story is linked at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:09:28.619 --> 02:09:32.380]  Politician calls for compulsory, you hear that word?
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:35.040]  Compulsory labor.
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.321]  Compulsory is a fancy term for force.
[02:09:39.636 --> 02:09:46.340]  Can we add to this article, maybe ask Watson, who is probably listening, the definition of compulsory and the definition of slavery?
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:49.201]  Compulsory means forced.
[02:09:49.201 --> 02:09:51.963]  Compulsory means basically free.
[02:09:51.963 --> 02:09:54.324]  Compulsory means slavery.
[02:09:54.324 --> 02:09:56.045]  Compulsory means absolute.
[02:09:56.045 --> 02:09:57.946]  You are compelled.
[02:09:57.946 --> 02:09:58.766]  You are forced.
[02:09:58.766 --> 02:10:01.048]  You are made to.
[02:10:01.048 --> 02:10:03.349]  Politician calls for compulsory labor.
[02:10:05.302 --> 02:10:14.006]  To force Germans to service migrants, university graduates would face mandatory year of social service and then that'll be expanded.
[02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:26.131]  The German Parliament, we have video of it on the article, the German Parliament member has called for introducing a compulsory labor program under which young Germans would be forced to spend a year of service to migrants.
[02:10:26.131 --> 02:10:30.353]  Focus.deutsch reports that CDU MP Eckart
[02:10:31.451 --> 02:10:43.038]  Roberg provoked heated discussion when he suggested that Germany's inability to cope with the migrant influx could be solved by making university graduates commit a year of services to social service.
[02:10:43.038 --> 02:10:46.640]  That's also indoctrination.
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:49.502]  And it goes into how they make them do it as a forced labor program.
[02:10:49.502 --> 02:10:52.524]  But can we pull up the definition?
[02:10:52.524 --> 02:10:57.207]  Just type the word definition of compulsory into the search engine and give me the Webster's definition.
[02:10:57.207 --> 02:10:58.488]  That'll come up probably the third link.
[02:10:59.739 --> 02:11:09.746]  After, it always does for some reason, almost always does after Wikipedia and a few others, but I want to show people Webster's definition of compulsory, which means forced.
[02:11:09.746 --> 02:11:10.986]  So forced labor.
[02:11:10.986 --> 02:11:17.711]  Let's change that to politician calls for forced labor to force Germans to service migrants.
[02:11:17.711 --> 02:11:19.552]  Compulsory!
[02:11:19.552 --> 02:11:20.333]  Compulsory!
[02:11:21.716 --> 02:11:22.537]  Obligatory.
[02:11:22.537 --> 02:11:23.157]  Mandatory.
[02:11:23.157 --> 02:11:23.958]  Required.
[02:11:23.958 --> 02:11:24.518]  Requisite.
[02:11:24.518 --> 02:11:25.238]  Necessary.
[02:11:25.238 --> 02:11:26.339]  Essential.
[02:11:26.339 --> 02:11:28.621]  Involved or exercising compulsion.
[02:11:28.621 --> 02:11:30.042]  Coercive.
[02:11:30.042 --> 02:11:35.065]  The abuse of compulsory powers.
[02:11:35.065 --> 02:11:36.666]  Let's click dictionary.
[02:11:36.666 --> 02:11:37.167]  The one under it.
[02:11:37.167 --> 02:11:38.307]  Let's click that.
[02:11:38.307 --> 02:11:40.529]  Get a wider definition of it.
[02:11:40.529 --> 02:11:43.991]  Compulsory means forced, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:43.991 --> 02:11:46.053]  Just click on the next one because there's always variants of them.
[02:11:47.025 --> 02:11:47.985]  There you go.
[02:11:47.985 --> 02:11:49.206]  Now click on that one.
[02:11:49.206 --> 02:11:50.707]  Dictionary.com.
[02:11:50.707 --> 02:11:51.327]  Required.
[02:11:51.327 --> 02:11:53.728]  Mandatory.
[02:11:53.728 --> 02:12:03.972]  Something as a athletic feat that must be performed or completed as part of a consent or competition.
[02:12:03.972 --> 02:12:07.374]  That means like it's compulsory that you have to compete and then win and make a certain amount.
[02:12:07.374 --> 02:12:09.034]  That's a different type in there.
[02:12:09.034 --> 02:12:10.595]  But there you go.
[02:12:10.595 --> 02:12:11.975]  So there is the origin of it.
[02:12:11.975 --> 02:12:12.816]  Mandatory.
[02:12:12.816 --> 02:12:15.017]  Required.
[02:12:15.017 --> 02:12:15.377]  Forced.
[02:12:17.873 --> 02:12:21.456]  And again, I'm not dehumanizing the, quote, migrants.
[02:12:21.456 --> 02:12:24.538]  The point is you can't go to their country and get something free.
[02:12:24.538 --> 02:12:28.080]  The point is Germany advertised all these freebies, lowered its border.
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:29.782]  It is part of a larger plan.
[02:12:29.782 --> 02:12:33.905]  And then Donald Trump comes out and says, look, we'll expand the visas, we'll bring in workers.
[02:12:34.946 --> 02:12:46.593]  We'll make a fast track deal where if you can come and you're legal and lawful in everything but the fact that you're not here legally, you can stay in a very quick process that was proven you're not a criminal and you have a job.
[02:12:46.593 --> 02:12:50.776]  But if you're just here on welfare and doing nothing or you're a criminal, you're gone.
[02:12:50.776 --> 02:12:51.556]  We're collapsing.
[02:12:51.556 --> 02:12:52.857]  We can't pay for this.
[02:12:52.857 --> 02:12:54.118]  That's completely reasonable.
[02:12:54.118 --> 02:12:55.539]  You can't go to China and do that.
[02:12:55.539 --> 02:12:56.520]  They'll deport you.
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:57.560]  You can't go to Mexico and do that.
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:58.561]  They'll deport you.
[02:12:58.561 --> 02:13:01.123]  You can't go to Nigeria and get something free.
[02:13:01.123 --> 02:13:01.703]  They'll deport you.
[02:13:03.812 --> 02:13:05.073]  And we're going bankrupt.
[02:13:05.073 --> 02:13:08.154]  Here's Donald Trump, separate from the debate.
[02:13:08.154 --> 02:13:13.577]  This is him on MSNBC talking about a deportation force.
[02:13:13.577 --> 02:13:14.518]  Here it is.
[02:13:14.518 --> 02:13:26.744]  You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely, and you're going to bring the country, and frankly, the people, because you have some excellent, wonderful people, some fantastic people that have been here for a long period of time.
[02:13:26.744 --> 02:13:31.987]  Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting on line to come into this country.
[02:13:32.327 --> 02:13:34.789]  And they're waiting to come in legally.
[02:13:34.789 --> 02:13:36.190]  And I always say, the wall.
[02:13:36.190 --> 02:13:37.492]  We're going to build the wall.
[02:13:37.492 --> 02:13:39.013]  It's going to be a real deal.
[02:13:39.013 --> 02:13:40.214]  It's going to be a real wall.
[02:13:40.214 --> 02:13:44.818]  There was a picture in one of the magazines where they had a wall this tall, and they were taking drugs over the wall.
[02:13:44.818 --> 02:13:48.021]  They built a ramp over the wall, and the truck was going up and down.
[02:13:48.021 --> 02:13:49.202]  They were using it like a highway.
[02:13:49.202 --> 02:13:50.943]  The wall was like a highway.
[02:13:50.943 --> 02:13:52.405]  And that's not going to happen.
[02:13:52.405 --> 02:13:53.366]  It's going to be a Trump wall.
[02:13:53.366 --> 02:13:54.687]  It's going to be a real wall.
[02:13:54.687 --> 02:13:57.870]  And it's going to stop people, and it's going to be good.
[02:13:59.526 --> 02:14:03.889]  Your friend Thomas Friedman called me and he said, huh, there should be a big door.
[02:14:03.889 --> 02:14:05.090]  I said, gonna be a big door.
[02:14:05.090 --> 02:14:06.410]  I love the expression.
[02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:09.472]  There's going to be a big, beautiful, nice door.
[02:14:09.472 --> 02:14:12.574]  People are gonna come in and they're gonna come in legally.
[02:14:12.574 --> 02:14:13.675]  But we have no choice.
[02:14:13.675 --> 02:14:15.156]  Otherwise, we don't have a country.
[02:14:15.156 --> 02:14:16.497]  We don't even know how many people.
[02:14:16.497 --> 02:14:18.778]  We don't know if it's 8 million or if it's 20 million.
[02:14:18.778 --> 02:14:22.901]  We have no idea how many people are in our country.
[02:14:22.901 --> 02:14:25.983]  And then you see what happened with Kate in San Francisco.
[02:14:26.203 --> 02:14:27.424]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:14:27.424 --> 02:14:28.265]  He keeps going on.
[02:14:28.265 --> 02:14:38.135]  Now let's go to the debate itself last night, where Neil Cavuto came out and basically knocked CNBC and said, quote, the reason we were popular is it wasn't about us.
[02:14:38.135 --> 02:14:43.760]  Yeah, it wasn't a bunch of, and I'm not just defending Fox, it's just true, they did a fair job asking real questions.
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:49.546]  With CNBC, it was just naked attack dogs when they've done these softball debates for the Democrats.
[02:14:49.546 --> 02:14:50.587]  And that bias is clear.
[02:14:52.233 --> 02:15:00.900]  Now let's go ahead and go to Rand Paul, who I think pretty much won the debate last night, corrects Donald Trump's comments on China being part of the TPP.
[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:03.382]  They were part, they pulled out.
[02:15:03.382 --> 02:15:04.502]  I should even be corrected on that.
[02:15:04.502 --> 02:15:05.443]  In fact, I've been corrected.
[02:15:05.443 --> 02:15:08.045]  They were in it at first, now they're not part of it.
[02:15:08.045 --> 02:15:08.986]  But let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:15:11.272 --> 02:15:12.313]  I can't be, Neil.
[02:15:12.313 --> 02:15:20.419]  And the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front, economically, militarily.
[02:15:20.419 --> 02:15:23.441]  There is nothing that we do now to win.
[02:15:23.441 --> 02:15:25.383]  We don't win anymore.
[02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:26.724]  Our taxes are too high.
[02:15:26.724 --> 02:15:31.027]  I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much.
[02:15:31.027 --> 02:15:33.268]  It's going to be a tremendous plan.
[02:15:33.268 --> 02:15:37.331]  I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic.
[02:15:37.331 --> 02:15:37.492]  But
[02:15:38.092 --> 02:15:39.553]  Taxes too high.
[02:15:39.553 --> 02:15:41.195]  Wages too high.
[02:15:41.195 --> 02:15:43.958]  We're not going to be able to compete against the world.
[02:15:43.958 --> 02:15:47.361]  I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is.
[02:15:47.361 --> 02:15:52.446]  People have to go out, they have to work really hard, and they have to get into that upper stratum.
[02:15:52.446 --> 02:15:55.428]  That's one of the clubs I was going to get to, but it's out of order.
[02:15:55.428 --> 02:15:58.151]  That's Donald Trump saying wages are too high.
[02:15:58.151 --> 02:15:59.833]  Taxes and regulations are too high.
[02:16:00.922 --> 02:16:19.674]  If you're getting paid $15 an hour, after they pay your FICA, the Social Security matching, all the little fines and fees and state regs, and I'm in a low-tax state like Texas, if I've got a crew member being paid $15 an hour, which is the very low end, I don't think anybody working there gets $15 an hour, they all get more than that.
[02:16:19.674 --> 02:16:25.618]  The point is, it's like $22 an hour, is what it comes out to.
[02:16:25.618 --> 02:16:26.819]  If you're getting paid $20 an hour, it's like $28 an hour.
[02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:31.333]  It's just, it's crazy.
[02:16:31.333 --> 02:16:35.176]  People don't, and then the dollar's devalued so it doesn't buy as much.
[02:16:35.176 --> 02:16:44.185]  I almost disagree on minimum wage because they're going to devalue the dollar so much you're going to have to have a higher minimum wage.
[02:16:44.185 --> 02:16:46.547]  But that's kind of what the free market does anyways.
[02:16:46.547 --> 02:16:48.249]  You've got to pay people what the market will bear.
[02:16:49.827 --> 02:16:55.371]  But it's easy for socialists like Bernie Sanders to go, the minimum wage should be $30!
[02:16:55.371 --> 02:16:58.453]  And all these idiots that never run a business don't know what that means.
[02:16:58.453 --> 02:17:06.720]  That'd be like $50 an hour, after all the regulations and taxes that are tagged on to a business owner.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:10.322]  Now let's go to Rand Paul, corrects Donald Trump's comments on China.
[02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:10.823]  Here's that clip.
[02:17:11.465 --> 02:17:27.049]  You say the terms of the deal were published just last week, the detailed 5,000 pages of it, and 80% of US trade with countries in the Pacific, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and the trade deal only affects the other 20%.
[02:17:27.049 --> 02:17:30.269]  Are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?
[02:17:30.269 --> 02:17:33.370]  Yes, well the currency manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster.
[02:17:33.690 --> 02:17:45.535]  If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States, China in particular, because they're so good, it's the number one abuser of this country.
[02:17:45.535 --> 02:17:49.896]  And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation.
[02:17:49.896 --> 02:17:53.077]  It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.
[02:17:54.778 --> 02:17:56.278]  It's not even discussed.
[02:17:56.278 --> 02:18:04.540]  And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have.
[02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:06.501]  They don't even discuss it in this agreement.
[02:18:06.501 --> 02:18:10.041]  So I say it's a very bad deal, should not be approved.
[02:18:10.041 --> 02:18:15.643]  If it is approved, it'll just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country.
[02:18:15.643 --> 02:18:19.063]  We are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before.
[02:18:19.063 --> 02:18:21.324]  I want to bring jobs back into this country.
[02:18:21.684 --> 02:18:26.570]  Hey Gerard, you know we might want to point out China's not part of this deal.
[02:18:26.570 --> 02:18:27.351]  True.
[02:18:27.351 --> 02:18:27.692]  It's true.
[02:18:32.116 --> 02:18:35.477]  Rand Paul then comes back with his explanation, and it's a good shot.
[02:18:35.477 --> 02:18:36.897]  It's technically true.
[02:18:36.897 --> 02:18:46.199]  China was part of it, though, and China's lackey groups and sub-states and its lobbyists are all over it, and it's one-sided for China.
[02:18:46.199 --> 02:18:53.461]  China then just got mad because they couldn't fully run it, and they're so spoiled, they even control our Hollywood movies now, ran off whining.
[02:18:53.461 --> 02:18:56.082]  But Rand Paul did a great job last time.
[02:18:56.082 --> 02:18:57.042]  I'm not taking that away from him.
[02:18:57.042 --> 02:18:59.182]  It's just China's all over this agreement.
[02:18:59.182 --> 02:19:00.323]  It is one-sided.
[02:19:00.323 --> 02:19:01.243]  Let's go to his response.
[02:19:01.243 --> 02:19:01.543]  Here it is.
[02:19:07.279 --> 02:19:21.128]  Isn't that part of the problem, if I may say, Senator, that if this deal is not ratified by the U.S., by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it's been seeking to do.
[02:19:21.128 --> 02:19:22.209]  And if the U.S.
[02:19:22.209 --> 02:19:26.032]  is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead.
[02:19:26.272 --> 02:19:31.435]  There is an argument that China doesn't like the deal because in us doing the deal we'll be trading with their competitors.
[02:19:31.435 --> 02:19:32.436]  You're exactly right.
[02:19:32.436 --> 02:19:35.618]  But I think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here.
[02:19:35.618 --> 02:19:40.721]  There is an important point though about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on.
[02:19:40.721 --> 02:19:42.903]  We should negotiate from a position of strength.
[02:19:43.523 --> 02:19:48.906]  And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us.
[02:19:48.906 --> 02:19:52.729]  I think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals.
[02:19:52.729 --> 02:19:53.930]  Good job Rand Paul.
[02:19:53.930 --> 02:19:55.130]  He goes on, it just gets better.
[02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.991]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[02:19:58.717 --> 02:20:06.823]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today, but there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented One Silver Solution.

[02:20:57.992 --> 02:21:02.218]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:02.218 --> 02:21:02.839]  It's true.
[02:21:02.839 --> 02:21:07.006]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:07.006 --> 02:21:09.389]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:09.389 --> 02:21:13.856]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:21:14.156 --> 02:21:27.054]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[02:21:48.505 --> 02:21:49.565]  For the love of clean water.
[02:21:57.682 --> 02:22:00.986]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[02:22:00.986 --> 02:22:06.492]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[02:22:06.492 --> 02:22:08.755]  But they're about to lose control.
[02:22:08.755 --> 02:22:14.081]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[02:22:14.081 --> 02:22:18.546]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:22:18.646 --> 02:22:21.049]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:22:21.049 --> 02:22:24.893]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[02:22:24.893 --> 02:22:29.418]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[02:22:29.418 --> 02:22:32.541]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:22:32.541 --> 02:22:35.144]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:22:35.144 --> 02:22:36.486]  This will affect us all.
[02:22:36.966 --> 02:22:41.691]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[02:22:41.691 --> 02:22:48.097]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[02:23:06.917 --> 02:23:12.400]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:17.302]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:17.302 --> 02:23:20.823]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:20.823 --> 02:23:23.244]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[02:23:23.244 --> 02:23:25.065]  SimpliSafe Home Security.

[02:24:12.125 --> 02:24:13.606]  Good enough for me and my Bobby
[02:24:30.368 --> 02:24:33.750]  I want to get to more of these clips from the debate.
[02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:44.478]  The next clip is Rand Paul versus Marco Rubio on wasteful government spending and talking about the fact that the RINOs spend just as much as the Democrats.
[02:24:44.478 --> 02:24:46.279]  Then there's Rand Paul on climate change.
[02:24:46.279 --> 02:24:48.781]  Let's go to Rand Paul versus Marco Rubio.
[02:24:49.796 --> 02:24:53.580]  A point that I'd like to make about the tax credits.
[02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:57.144]  We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative.
[02:24:57.144 --> 02:25:01.689]  Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion dollar expenditure?
[02:25:01.689 --> 02:25:04.713]  We're not talking about giving people back their tax money.
[02:25:04.713 --> 02:25:08.036]  He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay.
[02:25:08.036 --> 02:25:09.879]  It's a welfare transfer payment.
[02:25:10.499 --> 02:25:11.701]  So here's what we have.
[02:25:11.701 --> 02:25:20.130]  Is it conservative to have a trillion dollars in transfer payments, a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit?
[02:25:20.130 --> 02:25:28.320]  Add that to Marcos' plan for a trillion dollars in new military spending and you get something that looks to me not very conservative.
[02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:29.621]  Thank you.
[02:25:29.621 --> 02:25:30.943]  Governor Kasich.
[02:25:30.943 --> 02:25:32.645]  Let me come to Governor Kasich.
[02:25:32.645 --> 02:25:33.886]  Governor Kasich.
[02:25:33.886 --> 02:25:35.468]  Excuse me, I get to respond.
[02:25:35.468 --> 02:25:36.329]  Very quickly, Senator.
[02:25:36.329 --> 02:25:38.011]  No, I get my 60 seconds to respond.
[02:25:38.011 --> 02:25:39.333]  He's talking about my tax plan.
[02:25:39.333 --> 02:25:39.814]  Please.
[02:25:39.814 --> 02:25:40.695]  So let me begin with this.
[02:25:42.242 --> 02:25:44.846]  I actually believe, first of all, this is their money.
[02:25:44.846 --> 02:25:52.315]  They do pay, it is refundable, not just against the taxes they pay to the government, but also on their federal income tax, it's refundable against the payroll tax.
[02:25:52.315 --> 02:25:54.098]  Everyone pays payroll tax.
[02:25:54.098 --> 02:25:56.321]  This is their money, this is not our money.
[02:25:56.321 --> 02:25:59.265]  And here's what I don't understand, if you invest that money in a piece of equipment,
[02:25:59.745 --> 02:26:02.606]  If you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.
[02:26:02.606 --> 02:26:09.029]  But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America, in strengthening your family, we're not going to recognize that in our tax code.
[02:26:09.029 --> 02:26:12.090]  The family is the most important institution in society.
[02:26:12.090 --> 02:26:14.891]  And yes, I do want to rebuild the American military.
[02:26:14.891 --> 02:26:16.991]  I know that Rand is a committed isolationist.
[02:26:16.991 --> 02:26:17.492]  I'm not.
[02:26:17.492 --> 02:26:23.794]  I believe the world is a stronger and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.
[02:26:25.114 --> 02:26:34.597]  Marco, how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?
[02:26:34.597 --> 02:26:38.959]  How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?
[02:26:38.959 --> 02:26:43.900]  You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.
[02:26:47.839 --> 02:26:50.161]  We can't even have an economy if we're not safe.
[02:26:50.161 --> 02:26:55.564]  There are radical jihadists in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians.
[02:26:55.564 --> 02:26:57.945]  Our own government created them.
[02:26:57.945 --> 02:26:58.986]  That's enough of him.
[02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:13.351]  Yay, Niko!
[02:27:13.351 --> 02:27:14.872]  I was throwing a fit during the break.
[02:27:14.872 --> 02:27:15.813]  I couldn't find my car keys.
[02:27:15.813 --> 02:27:16.774]  I just keep losing everything.
[02:27:16.774 --> 02:27:18.215]  I'm so busy.
[02:27:18.215 --> 02:27:20.257]  I tell you, this news gets me upset sometimes.
[02:27:20.257 --> 02:27:21.218]  Thank you.
[02:27:21.218 --> 02:27:24.821]  And then, separately, let's go to another clip here.
[02:27:24.821 --> 02:27:27.744]  Let's go now to Rand Paul on climate change.
[02:27:27.744 --> 02:27:35.751]  You know, Putin's come out and said it's pure bull, and it's a military operation by the globalists to shut down nation states, which is what it is.
[02:27:35.751 --> 02:27:37.012]  Let's see what Rand Paul had to say.
[02:27:40.743 --> 02:27:49.736]  Senator Paul, you were one of 15 Republicans to vote for an amendment which states that human activity contributed to climate change.
[02:27:51.004 --> 02:27:55.425]  President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions.
[02:27:55.425 --> 02:28:00.447]  At the same time, energy production in America has boomed.
[02:28:00.447 --> 02:28:11.670]  Is it possible to continue this boom and move toward energy self-sufficiency while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate change program?
[02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:18.452]  The first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the president has put in place.
[02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:23.548]  Including the Clean Power Act.
[02:28:23.548 --> 02:28:29.476]  While I do think man may have a role in our climate, I think nature also has a role.
[02:28:29.476 --> 02:28:31.959]  The planet's 4.5 billion years old.
[02:28:31.959 --> 02:28:35.163]  We've been through geologic age after geologic age.
[02:28:35.163 --> 02:28:37.026]  We've had times when the temperature's been warmer.
[02:28:37.466 --> 02:28:42.629]  We've had times when the temperature's been colder, we've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere has been higher.
[02:28:42.629 --> 02:28:44.890]  So I think before, we need to look before we leap.
[02:28:44.890 --> 02:28:50.813]  The President's often fond of saying he wants a balanced solution, but really we do need to balance.
[02:28:50.813 --> 02:28:56.356]  Both keeping the environment clean, we will have some rules for that, but we've got to balance that with the economy.
[02:28:56.356 --> 02:28:58.137]  He's devastated my state.
[02:28:58.137 --> 02:29:03.980]  I say the President's not only destroying Kentucky, he's destroying the Democrat Party down there because nobody wants to associate with him.
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:09.624]  So what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms.
[02:29:09.624 --> 02:29:16.689]  And that means we will have solar and wind and hydro, but we will still have coal and we still will have natural gas.
[02:29:16.689 --> 02:29:19.512]  And we've got to have an all of the above policy.
[02:29:19.512 --> 02:29:22.834]  You know, I've got to say, Rand Paul's not as strong as he should be on this.
[02:29:22.834 --> 02:29:25.096]  Coal power plants in the United States are totally clean.
[02:29:25.096 --> 02:29:27.198]  Nothing comes out but water and carbon dioxide.
[02:29:27.198 --> 02:29:31.161]  But they list carbon dioxide as toxic and tax it to shut it down and then exempt
[02:29:31.901 --> 02:29:32.922]  Insider companies.
[02:29:32.922 --> 02:29:34.182]  And that's what he should be saying.
[02:29:34.182 --> 02:29:35.663]  He knows that.
[02:29:35.663 --> 02:29:37.624]  He should be talking like Putin.
[02:29:37.624 --> 02:29:44.347]  It is a total fraud to devastate this country and bankrupt poor people.
[02:29:44.347 --> 02:29:47.909]  It is a military attack!
[02:29:47.909 --> 02:29:49.329]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.329 --> 02:29:51.851]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.851 --> 02:29:54.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:14.010]  Marco Rubio, the new billionaire boy toy, was left speechless on the fourth GOP debate when Rand Paul called him on his absurd pandering to the military-industrial complex and his attempt to outdo Hillary Clinton with free college.
[02:30:14.010 --> 02:30:16.592]  And yes, I do want to rebuild the American military.
[02:30:16.592 --> 02:30:18.493]  Rebuild the American military?
[02:30:18.493 --> 02:30:19.534]  Seriously, Rubio?
[02:30:19.534 --> 02:30:23.577]  But you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined.
[02:30:23.757 --> 02:30:25.699]  I know that Rand is a committed isolationist.
[02:30:25.699 --> 02:30:31.106]  From Marco's perspective, if you don't have more than the seven Obama wars going, you're an isolationist.
[02:30:31.106 --> 02:30:38.435]  Perhaps it would be safer if we were involved in ten wars, or maybe even better, picked a fight with Russia, so Rubio's masters could cash in.
[02:30:38.715 --> 02:30:47.044]  Marco, how is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?
[02:30:47.044 --> 02:30:52.970]  How is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?
[02:30:52.970 --> 02:30:58.015]  You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.
[02:30:58.015 --> 02:30:59.597]  I want my money!
[02:30:59.597 --> 02:31:00.698]  I want my money again!
[02:31:00.698 --> 02:31:01.279]  Why, why, why?
[02:31:01.599 --> 02:31:11.325]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:31:11.325 --> 02:31:13.907]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:31:13.907 --> 02:31:17.589]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:31:17.589 --> 02:31:23.913]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:31:23.913 --> 02:31:28.756]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:31:29.036 --> 02:31:35.418]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:31:35.418 --> 02:31:43.159]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:31:43.159 --> 02:31:50.701]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:10.404]  Big Brother.
[02:33:10.404 --> 02:33:12.285]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:12.285 --> 02:33:13.906]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:13.906 --> 02:33:15.447]  You want answers?
[02:33:15.447 --> 02:33:17.067]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:17.067 --> 02:33:20.729]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.460 --> 02:33:28.183]  Welcome to your life, there's no turning back.
[02:33:28.183 --> 02:33:35.928]  Leon McAdoo is hosting the fourth hour with Joe Biggs, who will also be contributing here on Veterans Day.
[02:33:35.928 --> 02:33:41.813]  We've added the fourth hour to global transmission, three hours of Alex Jones and an hour of one of my other co-hosts and reporters.
[02:33:43.908 --> 02:33:47.190]  Coming up in the fourth hour, she will have debate wrap-up.
[02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:49.571]  Who are the nice big winners and losers?
[02:33:49.571 --> 02:33:53.733]  Universities are pumping out wimps who want to trade freedom for tolerance.
[02:33:53.733 --> 02:33:54.374]  It's beyond that.
[02:33:54.374 --> 02:33:59.016]  They want to dominate and control other people, and they're control freaks.
[02:33:59.016 --> 02:34:01.358]  Joe Biggs says he's found the next Jade Helm.
[02:34:02.398 --> 02:34:04.799]  So he'll be joining to break that.
[02:34:04.799 --> 02:34:07.860]  It was, of course, Joe that found Jade Helm and first reported it to me.
[02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:10.960]  It was a listener did, but then Joe, we popularized it.
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:12.121]  Let's just put it to you that way.
[02:34:12.121 --> 02:34:15.262]  The media spun what it was and lied about what we said it was.
[02:34:15.262 --> 02:34:16.462]  Well, he's got the next Jade Helm.
[02:34:16.462 --> 02:34:19.583]  He'll be breaking that down in the next hour as well.
[02:34:23.476 --> 02:34:26.579]  We just played Rand Paul talking about energy.
[02:34:26.579 --> 02:34:28.842]  I want to tie it into EPA's Clean Power Plan.
[02:34:28.842 --> 02:34:32.586]  It's going to hike electricity prices in 47 states.
[02:34:32.586 --> 02:34:33.347]  That's Fox News.
[02:34:33.347 --> 02:34:39.373]  I want to tie it into John Kerry, Secretary of State, saying climate change is a threat to national security.
[02:34:39.373 --> 02:34:40.735]  That is all coming up.
[02:34:42.296 --> 02:34:56.663]  But before I go any further today, we've got a whole bunch of different specials that we're running right now that folks really should take advantage of because they're high-quality products that have been life-changing for myself, my family, and so many other people that have spoken about it.
[02:34:58.311 --> 02:35:15.803]  About their experiences whether it's liver cleanse and the oxy powder for the liver cleanse with the liver shield or whether it is a high quality valerian root melatonin and seven other compounds together for the price of the same dose of melatonin alone.
[02:35:16.664 --> 02:35:17.565]  You heard me right.
[02:35:17.565 --> 02:35:22.531]  This has the same dose as the leading competitor of melatonin that costs $19.95 a bottle.
[02:35:22.531 --> 02:35:35.505]  This has the same dose of melatonin, organic based, with valerian root, with L-tryptophan, that's the stuff in turkey, and a whole bunch of other things that are known to naturally bring you into deep, healthful, restful, delicious, succulent sleep.
[02:35:36.445 --> 02:35:40.009]  Knockout is at Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:40.009 --> 02:35:42.853]  Super Male Vitality is back in stock.
[02:35:42.853 --> 02:35:45.576]  Folks' favorite, Super Female Vitality.
[02:35:45.576 --> 02:35:47.798]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[02:35:48.718 --> 02:35:52.440]  And we are now introducing Living Defense by Infowars Life.
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:58.603]  9 out of 10 people are infested with harmful organisms, also known as Hillary Clintons, or tapeworms.
[02:35:58.603 --> 02:36:07.687]  These toxic organisms, I'm being sarcastic, can be transmitted by people, pets, food, environment, and so people aren't really aware that 9 out of 10 folks have them.
[02:36:09.441 --> 02:36:20.405]  Living Defense is a giant bottle of big ol' capsules of organic, powerful compounds that say bye-bye to the bad guys.
[02:36:20.405 --> 02:36:22.546]  Let me be gender non-specific.
[02:36:22.546 --> 02:36:25.007]  Bad things.
[02:36:25.007 --> 02:36:25.787]  Being sarcastic.
[02:36:25.787 --> 02:36:29.949]  Wild crafted black walnut, green whole organic.
[02:36:29.949 --> 02:36:30.990]  It just goes on and on.
[02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.710]  Wild crafted
[02:36:33.081 --> 02:36:35.302]  Organic clove, organic wormwood.
[02:36:35.302 --> 02:36:38.643]  That's why it's called wormwood, because they used to take it to get rid of worms.
[02:36:38.643 --> 02:36:39.863]  Just got a whole bunch of stuff in it.
[02:36:39.863 --> 02:36:40.403]  Go read.
[02:36:40.403 --> 02:36:41.923]  It's super powerful.
[02:36:41.923 --> 02:36:45.444]  And the bottle is filled to the top, brimming.
[02:36:45.444 --> 02:36:52.626]  Again, other similar compounds are 30-40% more and may have half as much in the bottle.
[02:36:52.626 --> 02:37:01.969]  This is another super deal, and it helps fund this operation so we can send reporters around the country and the world, so we can have journalists, writers, investigative journalists,
[02:37:03.174 --> 02:37:08.697]  Video editors, camera men, because most of our camera folks are men, camera persons.
[02:37:08.697 --> 02:37:11.338]  I'm just showing the political correctness.
[02:37:11.338 --> 02:37:13.259]  That's what it's all about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:13.259 --> 02:37:15.460]  I want to thank you for your support.
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:20.162]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:20.162 --> 02:37:21.843]  And it was supposed to end
[02:37:25.259 --> 02:37:34.255]  Last Wednesday, and I noticed on Friday it was still up, and they said, oh, the manufacturer by contract said we could do it for a week, but now they're extending another week.
[02:37:34.255 --> 02:37:37.440]  So I said, okay, free shipping on Alexa Pure.
[02:37:38.584 --> 02:37:45.285]  Pro systems, the entire family of super high-quality gravity-fed filters that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosates, all of it.
[02:37:45.285 --> 02:37:46.126]  Truly amazing.
[02:37:46.126 --> 02:37:47.666]  Very fast flow rate.
[02:37:47.666 --> 02:37:50.186]  Discounts on the survival spring type system.
[02:37:50.186 --> 02:37:51.607]  It's like the LifeStraw.
[02:37:51.607 --> 02:37:53.727]  We also sell that as well.
[02:37:53.727 --> 02:37:56.248]  We have the ProPures that are excellent as well.
[02:37:56.248 --> 02:37:59.328]  It's high quality and priced fairly.
[02:37:59.328 --> 02:38:00.368]  We have it.
[02:38:00.368 --> 02:38:02.469]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:03.089]  Free shipping.
[02:38:04.258 --> 02:38:05.919]  And 10% off with promo code water.
[02:38:05.919 --> 02:38:07.880]  But the free shipping really is the big deal.
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:10.281]  That is continuing at least for a couple more days.
[02:38:10.281 --> 02:38:11.922]  I've got to check and see how long.
[02:38:11.922 --> 02:38:14.763]  I think it's Friday we're authorized to.
[02:38:14.763 --> 02:38:18.305]  So that's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:38:18.305 --> 02:38:30.791]  And I cannot tell you how important it is that you buy these products for your own health, your own wellness, but also symbiotically, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[02:38:30.791 --> 02:38:33.032]  We would put out one-tenth the info and be
[02:38:34.051 --> 02:38:35.672]  Not as effective.
[02:38:35.672 --> 02:38:42.357]  I'd be here, I'd have a webmaster that put links up to a story, and maybe I'd put a film out a year, maybe write a book a year.
[02:38:42.357 --> 02:38:42.737]  That'd be it.
[02:38:42.737 --> 02:38:44.819]  I'd have like five people.
[02:38:44.819 --> 02:38:45.599]  And that'd be it.
[02:38:45.599 --> 02:38:47.040]  Like other talk show hosts.
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:56.247]  We want to build a real media organization that actually rallies people, awakens them, and breaks important stories, and fights back against the globalist crime machine.
[02:38:57.594 --> 02:39:00.937]  And we see Hillary in trouble, we see Jeb falling apart.
[02:39:00.937 --> 02:39:03.439]  People are rejecting these globalists.
[02:39:03.439 --> 02:39:16.892]  That's why they're desperately trying to accelerate things into sexist war, regional war, race war, just every form of divide and conquer, balkanization you can imagine.
[02:39:16.892 --> 02:39:19.714]  And Kit Daniels will be reporting first, then Jakari Jackson.
[02:39:20.976 --> 02:39:38.735]  from the head campus of the four-campus system uh... there at the state college in missouri missouri state pc police now after getting the chancellor and the president to resign were both liberals themselves for no reason and now what thomas jefferson taken down as racist and sexist melissa click the
[02:39:39.756 --> 02:39:48.500]  Professor running around commanding the anti-free speech forces that was heading up large areas of the media department now ran another disinfo op claiming she's resigned.
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:53.202]  That's from her unpaid commissar position over the media area.
[02:39:53.202 --> 02:39:59.265]  Not, as a professor, blood-sucking off the state, in my opinion, as well.
[02:39:59.265 --> 02:40:05.168]  The viral video of her turns out the Mizzou hunger strike commanders tied in with George Soros,
[02:40:06.357 --> 02:40:13.903]  And of course, Berkshire Hathaway's commander who runs around running eugenics operations.
[02:40:13.903 --> 02:40:14.583]  They're all involved.
[02:40:14.583 --> 02:40:21.028]  His dad makes $8 million a year heading up one of the largest railroads in the country.
[02:40:21.969 --> 02:40:23.710]  And Warren Buffett couldn't be happier.
[02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:28.433]  So this is all just completely staged, as it always ends up turning out to be.
[02:40:28.433 --> 02:40:30.714]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[02:40:30.714 --> 02:40:32.295]  Joining us is Kit Daniels.
[02:40:32.295 --> 02:40:39.839]  He and Jakari have filed a bunch of very informative reports up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:40:39.839 --> 02:40:43.361]  So Kit, you've been there since yesterday afternoon.
[02:40:43.361 --> 02:40:44.942]  What is your view on what's happened?
[02:40:44.942 --> 02:40:46.043]  What can you report to people?
[02:40:47.059 --> 02:40:53.641]  Well right now we're in the middle of a University of Missouri campus in front of the Thomas Jefferson statue.
[02:40:53.641 --> 02:40:59.363]  Now this statue is the smoking gun of the whole situation up here in Missouri that you've all been reading the headlines past couple of days.
[02:41:01.563 --> 02:41:13.174]  On October 27th, 22nd, I wrote an article on Infowars.com about how some of the student groups, like Black Lives Matter and whatnot, were claiming that this statue was racist and sexist and needed to be removed.
[02:41:13.174 --> 02:41:19.619]  A couple of weeks later, the same student groups were the ones that ousted the president and ousted the chancellor as well.
[02:41:19.619 --> 02:41:28.207]  So, you know, it really shows you how out of proportion everything has been and how exploited the situation has been.
[02:41:28.889 --> 02:41:32.830]  I mean, I'm sure there's some racist issues that are going on on campus, no doubt about that.
[02:41:32.830 --> 02:41:34.291]  You know, there's here and there.
[02:41:34.291 --> 02:41:48.155]  But this is what I like to call phantom racism, in which you have a situation that's blown completely out of proportion in order to exploit and push a ultimate higher agenda.
[02:41:48.155 --> 02:41:55.357]  I mean, for example, it's just like the kind of feminist movements where they're claiming that, you know, you're all men are rapists and there's a rapist on every corner.
[02:41:55.357 --> 02:41:56.597]  It's just like here on campus.
[02:41:57.273 --> 02:42:02.458]  Where there's claiming that everyone's a racist, and there's the Ku Klux Klan member on every corner.
[02:42:02.458 --> 02:42:06.421]  We actually had an African-American gentleman that stopped us on campus, you know, concerned.
[02:42:06.421 --> 02:42:08.623]  He was like, is the KKK really out here on campus?
[02:42:08.623 --> 02:42:10.945]  We're like, no, it's just been misinformation.
[02:42:10.945 --> 02:42:11.826]  That's what we all suspected.
[02:42:11.826 --> 02:42:12.987]  Well, who cares who they are?
[02:42:12.987 --> 02:42:13.707]  Go laugh at them.
[02:42:13.707 --> 02:42:14.388]  Yeah.
[02:42:14.388 --> 02:42:14.728]  Yeah.
[02:42:14.728 --> 02:42:15.729]  That's what I told Jakari.
[02:42:15.729 --> 02:42:21.354]  I was like, when we were in the hotel getting ready to come here this morning, I was like, even if the Klan was here, we'd go and protest it.
[02:42:21.354 --> 02:42:23.356]  It should report half of them are federal agents anyway.
[02:42:24.130 --> 02:42:25.271]  Well, it's just ridiculous.
[02:42:25.271 --> 02:42:28.112]  Like, somebody might be wearing a Halloween costume that scares me.
[02:42:28.112 --> 02:42:30.033]  Remove it immediately at Yale.
[02:42:30.033 --> 02:42:32.995]  It's just, it's a witch trial.
[02:42:32.995 --> 02:42:35.356]  Meanwhile, we're all having our rights taken.
[02:42:35.356 --> 02:42:37.037]  We're all being targeted by the globalists.
[02:42:37.037 --> 02:42:38.258]  That's why they're doing this, Kit.
[02:42:39.212 --> 02:42:43.814]  Yeah, and it's like, I had an incident with the TSA coming up here where I was detained for a long time.
[02:42:43.814 --> 02:42:45.155]  I missed my flight.
[02:42:45.155 --> 02:42:47.596]  But, you know, funny enough... Yeah, describe that.
[02:42:47.596 --> 02:42:55.661]  You shot a video on that, but just to show you where this country is, a Jakari on the camera man went on ahead of you.
[02:42:55.661 --> 02:42:56.441]  You weren't able to.
[02:42:56.441 --> 02:42:58.182]  Describe what happened.
[02:42:58.182 --> 02:42:59.523]  Yeah, I had the TSA stop me.
[02:42:59.523 --> 02:43:01.144]  They swabbed my fingers.
[02:43:01.144 --> 02:43:04.986]  They ran me through the machine a couple times, just patted me down, had me sit for 15-20 minutes.
[02:43:06.375 --> 02:43:11.819]  And what's ironic was, I was looking outside the terminal and there's like a state of Kuwait plane.
[02:43:11.819 --> 02:43:17.162]  And I was telling Jakaria later, I was like, you know, they're not doing the same thing to them as they are to me.
[02:43:17.162 --> 02:43:26.668]  Just like how the State Department was allowing the Muslim Brotherhood into the country, giving them pork courtesy, telling the TSA, hey, don't bother these guys, just let them pass through.
[02:43:26.668 --> 02:43:30.631]  It's all security theater to exploit our fears and to
[02:43:31.599 --> 02:43:32.880]  Make us give up our rights.
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:35.522]  The same thing here in the University of Missouri about the political correctness.
[02:43:35.522 --> 02:43:39.084]  Political correctness is used to exploit our fear of being social outcasts.
[02:44:01.899 --> 02:44:03.019]  Plantation.
[02:44:03.019 --> 02:44:03.879]  You're absolutely right.
[02:44:03.879 --> 02:44:07.800]  But specifically, your video's titled, The TSA, What They're Not Telling You.
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:12.421]  What was their excuse for searching you and making you miss your flight?
[02:44:12.421 --> 02:44:16.161]  It's probably because I'm not donating money to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:44:16.161 --> 02:44:17.302]  Yeah, that would be a good thing.
[02:44:17.302 --> 02:44:18.942]  Because I'm not, yeah, exactly.
[02:44:18.942 --> 02:44:20.962]  How did they detain you?
[02:44:20.962 --> 02:44:23.303]  What did they do to you?
[02:44:23.303 --> 02:44:30.744]  Oh, they just, they just had me, uh, they just ran on the swab thing over my fingers, had me run me through the machine a couple times, patted me down,
[02:44:32.224 --> 02:44:36.625]  It was like, I told him afterwards, my fly already took off by the time I was done with it.
[02:44:36.625 --> 02:44:39.266]  So they just ran you through the ringer for fun and made you sit there.
[02:44:39.266 --> 02:44:40.866]  Yeah, I've had them do that to me.
[02:44:40.866 --> 02:44:41.986]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:41.986 --> 02:44:44.407]  And I think they did the same thing to Mike, our cameraman.
[02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:53.989]  Maybe not as severe, but... Well, they gotta be careful because ISIS, who our government created in funds and gave missiles to, is shooting down airplanes and blowing them up.
[02:44:53.989 --> 02:44:58.110]  So, you know, they've got to take our rights down to keep us safe from their bosses.
[02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:58.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:58.750 --> 02:45:01.091]  And what people don't realize is the whole government is
[02:45:01.866 --> 02:45:18.776]  I think it was the Cardinal Richelieu, I think that's how you pronounce his name, the 17th century French statesman, who proposed this idea of reasons of state, which unlike you being you, the state, the government, politicians, they don't concern themselves with ethics and morality.
[02:45:18.776 --> 02:45:23.038]  They just see themselves as if the state achieves its aims.
[02:45:23.038 --> 02:45:24.219]  That's the ultimate goal.
[02:45:24.219 --> 02:45:29.342]  If it doesn't, then... And it's Machiavelli, but if you don't have any morals, then your aims aren't going to be good either.
[02:45:30.157 --> 02:45:39.195]  Exactly, and the tyranny that results that I'm experiencing, everyone around here is experiencing, political correctness, that's all a direct result of this idea of reasons of state.
[02:45:41.154 --> 02:45:50.918]  I've heard that I've seen a video of them going after people and they had to cancel classes because of the hysteria and they were promising to go after free speech rallies.
[02:45:50.918 --> 02:45:52.579]  Have you seen anything like that?
[02:45:52.579 --> 02:45:54.840]  Let me tell you something funny about that.
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:58.062]  We went down to the Starbucks just down the road from here on campus.
[02:45:58.062 --> 02:46:04.985]  I was going to go in there and get one of them red politically correct coffee cups to report on it and tie it into the whole University of Missouri political correctness.
[02:46:05.583 --> 02:46:11.784]  They shut Starbucks down because the employees were too scared to show up to work because of all the political correctness running amok.
[02:46:11.784 --> 02:46:18.926]  So you got, I can't get my politically correct coffee from Starbucks because it got shut down by the PC police, literally.
[02:46:18.926 --> 02:46:21.827]  So basically the PC police are the end of civilization.
[02:46:21.827 --> 02:46:23.767]  It's just the shutdown of everything.
[02:46:23.767 --> 02:46:27.988]  Yeah, it's like, what we're seeing right now is like the end of the Roman Empire, the end of the Byzantine Empire.
[02:46:27.988 --> 02:46:31.569]  It's like this whole destruction of civilization where everybody
[02:46:32.412 --> 02:46:34.833]  It's too scared to speak out and be human beings.
[02:46:34.833 --> 02:46:37.494]  They just want to be a sheep mentality and just wither in fear.
[02:46:37.494 --> 02:46:38.794]  That's right.
[02:46:38.794 --> 02:46:44.336]  Let me see the evil guy that this first Declaration of Independence would have ended slavery.
[02:46:44.336 --> 02:46:50.739]  Let's see Thomas Jefferson, a huge critic of slavery, and they mindlessly point out that he was born into a slave owning family but then freed them.
[02:46:50.739 --> 02:46:56.841]  Yeah, I want to point out something else about that because the whole Black Lives Matter movement and you know they
[02:46:57.765 --> 02:47:05.147]  We're saying they're fighting against racism, but racism, like I said in a video I shot last night, racism is a collectivist concept.
[02:47:05.147 --> 02:47:09.228]  I mean, you're grouping people by race and stereotyping them.
[02:47:09.228 --> 02:47:12.729]  That's right, individualism would just do well with racism to begin with.
[02:47:12.729 --> 02:47:15.190]  And this is the guy who fought for individualism.
[02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:20.892]  This is the man who promoted individualism, probably the first person in human history that really
[02:47:22.034 --> 02:47:22.834]  We're good to go.
[02:47:44.403 --> 02:47:49.547]  Just destroy racism using some other collectivist ideology.
[02:47:49.547 --> 02:47:52.850]  I mean, the only way you're ever going to fight racism is through individualism.
[02:47:52.850 --> 02:47:57.314]  And the one way to first learn about individualism is to read this guy's writings right here.
[02:47:57.314 --> 02:47:57.574]  That's right.
[02:47:57.574 --> 02:48:00.056]  Let's see the evil individualist again.
[02:48:00.056 --> 02:48:02.078]  Ja'kar gives us a shot.
[02:48:02.078 --> 02:48:03.479]  There is Thomas Jefferson.
[02:48:03.479 --> 02:48:05.541]  And as you said, you wrote about this a month ago.
[02:48:06.201 --> 02:48:06.621]  Or more.
[02:48:06.621 --> 02:48:14.446]  They wanted this gone, so when that wouldn't happen, somebody started putting swastikas in the bathroom, or once, and then they heard somebody say something racist.
[02:48:14.446 --> 02:48:19.329]  So now coffee shops are shut down, campuses are shut down, total fear, hysteria.
[02:48:19.329 --> 02:48:20.890]  Oh my gosh, we're in so much trouble.
[02:48:20.890 --> 02:48:22.571]  Yeah, it's completely blown out of proportion.
[02:48:22.571 --> 02:48:27.354]  I mean, I went to the R. Bowron Lofton, I believe that's how you pronounce his name.
[02:48:27.354 --> 02:48:31.637]  He was the president of Texas A&M when I attended there, and I graduated a couple years ago.
[02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:34.117]  He was a chancellor here at Missouri.
[02:48:34.117 --> 02:48:35.638]  I didn't realize that until I came up here.
[02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:36.319]  He had to resign.
[02:48:36.319 --> 02:48:40.723]  That guy was, he was the nicest person that could have been president at A&M.
[02:48:40.723 --> 02:48:44.047]  You know, he wore a bow tie, went around campus, you know, you could shake his hand.
[02:48:44.047 --> 02:48:47.250]  He was, he was very humble about being in this position.
[02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:48.151]  Well, that's why they ran him out.
[02:48:48.151 --> 02:48:50.834]  These guys were what I'd call classical liberals.
[02:48:50.834 --> 02:48:51.995]  Yeah, he was not a yes man.
[02:48:53.584 --> 02:48:56.507]  You know, he wasn't pushing the towel in the party line.
[02:48:56.507 --> 02:48:57.708]  Just the same thing with the president.
[02:48:57.708 --> 02:49:00.330]  They're saying, oh, you gotta recognize your white privilege.
[02:49:00.330 --> 02:49:04.955]  That's racism in itself, because you're saying you're collectivizing him as being a white person.
[02:49:04.955 --> 02:49:08.898]  You're saying that he has all these stereotypical white things about him.
[02:49:08.898 --> 02:49:09.659]  Well, that's what they've done.
[02:49:09.659 --> 02:49:13.483]  They've taken classical racism and again, turned it back around.
[02:49:13.483 --> 02:49:14.304]  It's just insane.
[02:49:14.963 --> 02:49:16.705]  Yeah, it's just divide and conquer.
[02:49:16.705 --> 02:49:18.847]  It's just how the globalists lust for power.
[02:49:18.847 --> 02:49:22.490]  They, you know, they combat people, the population off each other.
[02:49:22.490 --> 02:49:25.493]  I mean, just as we saw with the Spanish conquistadors, they did that.
[02:49:25.493 --> 02:49:28.156]  Do you think, do you think it's starting to peak though?
[02:49:28.156 --> 02:49:31.840]  I mean, it's really getting crazy now.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:34.342]  You know, Alex, to be honest, I don't think so yet.
[02:49:34.342 --> 02:49:36.905]  I think we're going to see a lot more violence when it peaks.
[02:49:37.688 --> 02:49:43.930]  I think we really will see a so-called race war, which I hate to say that, but I think we're going to end up seeing some more L.A.
[02:49:43.930 --> 02:49:44.430]  Riot stuff.
[02:49:44.430 --> 02:49:50.911]  The way I'm just seeing it right here, this is completely ridiculous how bad the hysteria has been on this campus.
[02:49:50.911 --> 02:49:56.613]  And this is a school I would have considered going to if I could have done it when I was in my 20s.
[02:49:56.613 --> 02:49:58.373]  Yeah, it's really nice.
[02:49:58.373 --> 02:50:03.515]  Yeah, it's just so ridiculous how out of control it is.
[02:50:03.515 --> 02:50:05.215]  And one thing else I want to add.
[02:50:06.265 --> 02:50:10.708]  A lot of these Black Lives Matter kids, I think they are well-meaning, but they've been duped.
[02:50:10.708 --> 02:50:15.771]  Just like I was reading a book on my Kindle coming up on the airplane about Hernan Cortez.
[02:50:15.771 --> 02:50:23.416]  Like how he kind of duped a lot of the Native American tribes in Mexico when he allied with them to kick out the Aztecs.
[02:50:23.416 --> 02:50:24.277]  That's the same thing.
[02:50:24.277 --> 02:50:26.038]  Sure, it's classic divide and conquer.
[02:50:26.038 --> 02:50:27.919]  That's what colonialists always do.
[02:50:27.919 --> 02:50:28.439]  Stay there.
[02:50:28.439 --> 02:50:29.500]  I'm going to come back now.
[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:30.160]  Great job, Kit.
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:31.701]  Talk to Jakari Jackson for two segments.
[02:50:31.701 --> 02:50:33.843]  Then I'm going to hand the baton to Leanne McAdoo.
[02:50:34.543 --> 02:50:41.146]  And we're going to have highlights of the debates, of our response and analysis, Veterans Day coverage, and more in the fourth hour.
[02:50:41.146 --> 02:50:49.190]  But straight ahead, Jakari Jackson, his take from the headquarters of Missouri State, where there is a purge ongoing.
[02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.830]  It's right out of 1984.
[02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:55.132]  It's right out of the real Soviet Union, or what Mao did with his brigades.
[02:50:55.132 --> 02:50:56.873]  It's the beginning of the rise of the left.
[02:50:59.161 --> 02:50:59.962]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:50:59.962 --> 02:51:01.763]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?

[02:53:01.804 --> 02:53:05.707]  You're taking longer to urinate, and you're waking up at night to go.
[02:53:05.707 --> 02:53:08.950]  It's because as you age, so does your prostate.

[02:53:39.909 --> 02:53:43.211]  Peak Life Prostate is like taking two formulas in one.

[02:54:00.488 --> 02:54:08.976]  Look, there were major movements in this country and others to try to end classism.
[02:54:08.976 --> 02:54:12.759]  Same thing they have in India still, the caste.
[02:54:12.759 --> 02:54:21.467]  That's how humans have always organized themselves since agrarian society formed 6,000, 7,000 years ago.
[02:54:21.467 --> 02:54:25.351]  But now they're just taking that whole good movement mainly created by Christians
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:31.662]  And turning it on its head and creating a culture about infighting.
[02:54:31.662 --> 02:54:38.425]  And more and more of even leftists who aren't evil have come out and admitted, okay, this is out of control.
[02:54:38.425 --> 02:54:46.108]  But the question is, with young people being just absolutely fried with fake feminism and all this garbage,
[02:54:47.639 --> 02:54:52.884]  I don't know how we counter it when it's consciously being carried out by leftists who know it's a scam.
[02:54:52.884 --> 02:54:56.447]  Let me tell you, these professors know what they're doing, in my view.
[02:54:56.447 --> 02:54:58.629]  Jakari Jackson, you've been there now for today.
[02:54:58.629 --> 02:55:01.151]  We've got about four minutes of this segment, five of the next.
[02:55:01.151 --> 02:55:02.252]  I hand the baton.
[02:55:02.252 --> 02:55:04.094]  Great job with your reports.
[02:55:04.094 --> 02:55:05.996]  Overall, what have you taken away from this?
[02:55:07.773 --> 02:55:10.855]  This is Carl Jackson reporting from the University of Missouri.
[02:55:10.855 --> 02:55:12.837]  Yes, Alex, we've been out here for about a day or so.
[02:55:12.837 --> 02:55:14.738]  We came in late last night.
[02:55:14.738 --> 02:55:18.321]  Most of the protests and the other activities have subsided, as you can see out here.
[02:55:18.321 --> 02:55:20.002]  It's a pretty quiet day.
[02:55:20.002 --> 02:55:23.604]  We've had various threats, some bogus threats at that.
[02:55:23.604 --> 02:55:26.246]  The KKK coming out here, a lot of people were scared.
[02:55:26.246 --> 02:55:31.850]  As Kit mentioned, we actually encountered somebody on campus who stopped and asked, he said, hey, do you guys know anything about this?
[02:55:31.850 --> 02:55:34.012]  And as far as we know, it's just a cooked up threat.
[02:55:34.272 --> 02:55:37.035]  By the way, if you're a radio listener, you gotta see the feed, Jakari.
[02:55:37.035 --> 02:55:39.978]  It looks like The Last Man on Earth or I Am Legend.
[02:55:39.978 --> 02:55:44.142]  There's no one out there I can see in this beautiful, gorgeous campus.
[02:55:44.142 --> 02:55:47.105]  Looks cooler than the University of Texas or Harvard or something.
[02:55:47.105 --> 02:55:48.407]  Great place to just looking at.
[02:55:48.407 --> 02:55:49.668]  Looks wonderful.
[02:55:49.668 --> 02:55:52.431]  And there's no one there in fear of the stupid Klan.
[02:55:53.925 --> 02:55:58.027]  Yeah, it's just a whole lot of things going on out here.
[02:55:58.027 --> 02:56:14.516]  So as we've been reporting, Mrs. Click, as you mentioned a little bit earlier, she was out here a couple days ago stifling people's First Amendment rights, which is very interesting being that she's a communications professor or appointment is, I think, the proper term they gave her.
[02:56:14.516 --> 02:56:19.159]  And as you were mentioning, she gave up her, I guess, appointment, appointee position.
[02:56:19.159 --> 02:56:22.561]  But there are other people concerned that she may still have a place here on campus.
[02:56:23.061 --> 02:56:24.262]  Man, of course, went to our office.
[02:56:24.262 --> 02:56:25.363]  She's not there, obviously.
[02:56:25.363 --> 02:56:28.284]  This is something she wants to lay low from.
[02:56:28.284 --> 02:56:33.307]  But we were talking to a group earlier today, the Young Americans for Liberty.
[02:56:33.307 --> 02:56:40.292]  Yeah, and they were telling us that if she does retain her position, they do have plans to try to start a petition to get her to resign.
[02:56:40.292 --> 02:56:43.093]  Which is kind of interesting, you know, considering the whole thing that's going on here.
[02:56:43.093 --> 02:56:48.737]  The football team wants the, or had the president resign, I believe the chancellor resigned as well.
[02:56:48.737 --> 02:56:50.798]  Well, if the chancellor or president had come out,
[02:56:51.138 --> 02:56:54.321]  And said we banned the First Amendment, I'd call for him to step down.
[02:56:54.321 --> 02:56:54.841]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:56:54.841 --> 02:56:58.144]  I was just saying that it's a lot of resigning going on out here.
[02:56:58.144 --> 02:57:01.267]  Since, well not even since, we've been here before we got here.
[02:57:01.267 --> 02:57:02.909]  And there's some very interesting guys.
[02:57:02.909 --> 02:57:03.950]  We had a chance to talk to them.
[02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:06.012]  We have a report about that coming up a little bit later.
[02:57:06.012 --> 02:57:08.634]  Once we have a chance to sit down and do some editing.
[02:57:08.634 --> 02:57:12.157]  But by and large, that's pretty much what's going on out here.
[02:57:12.157 --> 02:57:16.401]  There's no violence, no petitions, nothing like that at this point.
[02:57:17.557 --> 02:57:19.479]  Well, that's good.
[02:57:19.479 --> 02:57:21.561]  What about that evil Thomas Jefferson, Jakar?
[02:57:21.561 --> 02:57:23.102]  You think they should melt that down?
[02:57:23.102 --> 02:57:31.790]  Well, if it fell over and it was crushed, it wouldn't hurt my feelings, but I'm not signing any petition, nor signed any petition to get it removed.
[02:57:31.790 --> 02:57:38.596]  Well, it just shows that people are having their rights, as I said, in general taken away by the globalists, but then we're obsessing over statues.
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:46.503]  Yeah, well, that's the one thing, as I believe Kit was pointing out, you know, there's a lot of things and people do have legitimate concerns.
[02:57:46.503 --> 02:57:47.844]  It's just the way they're going about them.
[02:57:47.844 --> 02:57:57.650]  You know, as he was talking about the collectivist notion, a lot of these people, as well-intentioned as they may be, a lot of these groups, not just here, but just we've seen around the country for the past several years, they get co-opted.
[02:57:57.650 --> 02:58:07.095]  They get people coming in, trying to give them these talking points, saying this and that, and then they just want everybody to subscribe to that, as opposed to people taking a step back and thinking about what can I do
[02:58:07.595 --> 02:58:10.137]  As an individual to try to stem these type of things.
[02:58:10.137 --> 02:58:10.638]  Sure.
[02:58:10.638 --> 02:58:11.839]  Stem my behavior to him.
[02:58:11.839 --> 02:58:12.680]  Stay there, Jakari.
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:15.582]  I want to ask you what you think of the leader of the movement, the hunger strike guy.
[02:58:15.582 --> 02:58:16.763]  I hope you can find him.
[02:58:16.763 --> 02:58:22.228]  Turns out his dad works for one of the biggest, is the vice president of the biggest railroads in the country.
[02:58:22.228 --> 02:58:25.691]  Partially owned by Soros and of course Warren Buffett.
[02:58:25.691 --> 02:58:30.035]  And he's out here saying he's underprivileged when his dad makes eight million dollars a year.
[02:58:30.996 --> 02:58:33.837]  I wish my dad made eight million dollars a year.
[02:58:33.837 --> 02:58:35.978]  Now that is a lot of money, folks.
[02:58:35.978 --> 02:58:37.259]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:37.259 --> 02:58:40.080]  This country's been pretty good, you know, to this guy is what I'm saying.
[02:58:40.080 --> 02:58:42.581]  Well, stay with us, folks.

[02:59:50.929 --> 02:59:53.565]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.135 --> 03:00:07.778]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.778 --> 03:00:11.439]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.439 --> 03:00:16.362]  So, Jakari, the guy that led the hunger strike, didn't seem like he lost any weight.
[03:00:16.362 --> 03:00:23.925]  Turns out that he's got some privilege coming from a dad who's worth tens of millions of dollars.
[03:00:25.157 --> 03:00:31.841]  And I don't think it's fair to criticize him because his dad's worth tens of millions of dollars and makes $8 million a year and has $20 million, I guess.
[03:00:31.841 --> 03:00:39.306]  Except that's the leftist socialist argument that if somebody's got $20 million, they must have stolen it or they're bad.
[03:00:39.306 --> 03:00:42.468]  Or that only, you know, rich white people can make $20 million.
[03:00:42.468 --> 03:00:44.329]  Well, that's just not how it works.
[03:00:44.329 --> 03:00:45.290]  What do you make of this?
[03:00:45.290 --> 03:00:47.191]  And what are other tidbits you've noticed?
[03:00:47.191 --> 03:00:49.572]  Do you think political correctness is starting to peak?
[03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:50.693]  Or is it just going to get crazier?
[03:00:51.837 --> 03:00:53.878]  Well, as far as the guy, you know, I'm with you.
[03:00:53.878 --> 03:01:02.584]  I mean, I'm not faulting him because his dad is successful, but at the same time, I'm sure there are plenty of underprivileged people here, but he definitely doesn't seem to be one of them.
[03:01:02.584 --> 03:01:07.788]  He's, like I said, his dad makes $8 million a year, so I don't think he's hurting for any cash or any type of...
[03:01:08.448 --> 03:01:10.009]  Uh, hand up in life.
[03:01:10.009 --> 03:01:14.813]  As far as the political correctness, you know, just the thing we documented earlier today, the free speech board.
[03:01:14.813 --> 03:01:21.938]  I think that's a great step in the right direction because you walk up to the board, as you guys can see the video that Kit did, and they just hand you a marker.
[03:01:21.938 --> 03:01:24.079]  They don't tell you anything to say, anything you can't say.
[03:01:24.079 --> 03:01:26.841]  You know, some people wrote, you know, very positive things.
[03:01:26.841 --> 03:01:28.102]  People wrote profanity.
[03:01:28.102 --> 03:01:29.183]  People wrote whatever they wanted to.
[03:01:29.503 --> 03:01:39.869]  It was just a free speech, and I think that's a step in the right direction of having a way to combat a negative sense of political correctness and that you just want to shut down all speech.
[03:01:39.869 --> 03:01:41.631]  It's not something that you agree with.
[03:01:41.631 --> 03:01:43.452]  And actually, I have a gentleman over here who's agreeing with it.
[03:01:43.452 --> 03:01:45.073]  Sir, did you have something that you wanted to say?
[03:01:45.073 --> 03:01:48.455]  There's a gentleman who came out here with us just a few minutes ago.
[03:01:48.455 --> 03:01:53.838]  No, not necessarily, other than I just wanted to display my shirt that I got from you guys.
[03:01:53.838 --> 03:01:58.341]  But basically, once you understand this, everything else falls into place.
[03:01:59.048 --> 03:02:13.214]  Just go to ae911truth.org and you'll see what 2,500 professional architects and engineers have to say about calling for a new petition, an independent investigation into what happened on 9-11.
[03:02:13.214 --> 03:02:18.656]  Once you figure this out, folks, the rest all falls into place.
[03:02:18.656 --> 03:02:22.718]  And let's talk about an independent investigation for Benghazi.
[03:02:22.718 --> 03:02:25.619]  What do you think about that?
[03:02:25.619 --> 03:02:25.920]  I think
[03:02:27.455 --> 03:02:31.619]  Like the guy was saying who was on with Alex yesterday, they're above the law.
[03:02:31.619 --> 03:02:32.640]  You know?
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:34.361]  I don't know a way around that.
[03:02:34.361 --> 03:02:35.982]  Other than the ants, you know?
[03:02:35.982 --> 03:02:40.026]  If enough of us ants get together, those grasshoppers up there are shaking in their boots.
[03:02:40.026 --> 03:02:41.007]  And that's why they're dividing us.
[03:02:41.007 --> 03:02:42.568]  The ants are down here rumbling.
[03:02:42.568 --> 03:02:46.591]  As soon as enough of us figure it out, when we reach that tipping point, the ants are done.
[03:02:46.591 --> 03:02:48.373]  Alright, thank you so much, sir.
[03:02:48.373 --> 03:02:51.656]  Alright, that's just one of the people we've got a chance to meet out here.
[03:02:52.455 --> 03:02:55.816]  Yeah, interviewing more for the website of the Nightly News, Jakari.
[03:02:55.816 --> 03:02:58.857]  I know you're going to be filing reports for the Nightly News as well.
[03:02:58.857 --> 03:03:02.159]  Then I guess coming on back, what, tomorrow or the next day?
[03:03:02.159 --> 03:03:03.679]  Yeah, we're coming back tonight.
[03:03:03.679 --> 03:03:03.939]  Wow.
[03:03:03.939 --> 03:03:05.280]  So we'll be on the plane late tonight.
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:07.801]  You want to get back to Texas?
[03:03:07.801 --> 03:03:10.042]  Yeah, well, we're ready to get on back.
[03:03:10.042 --> 03:03:11.582]  Hey, I'll say this, man.
[03:03:11.582 --> 03:03:13.523]  Is it just me or does that college look awesome?
[03:03:14.605 --> 03:03:16.567]  Oh, it's a very beautiful campus.
[03:03:16.567 --> 03:03:18.008]  The rose brick.
[03:03:18.008 --> 03:03:19.810]  Maybe we can do a pan out here.
[03:03:19.810 --> 03:03:21.472]  And you can see how beautiful it is.
[03:03:21.472 --> 03:03:23.574]  It's a stunning architecture.
[03:03:23.574 --> 03:03:24.395]  What do you call that?
[03:03:24.395 --> 03:03:25.496]  Classical American?
[03:03:25.496 --> 03:03:27.358]  What does that call, that architecture?
[03:03:27.358 --> 03:03:29.420]  I don't know if colonial.
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:30.261]  What did you call it, Kit?
[03:03:32.632 --> 03:03:38.817]  As far as I know, this was the first public land-grant university that was created after the Louisiana Purchase.
[03:03:38.817 --> 03:03:41.278]  That's why Thomas Jefferson's statue is here.
[03:03:41.278 --> 03:03:46.042]  And I think this quad is actually designed off of the University of Virginia.
[03:03:46.042 --> 03:03:59.511]  So, I point that out because, ironically, if you were saying that Thomas Jefferson's racist, then isn't it logical then to have to bulldoze the whole school down to... Because he did the Louisiana Purchase.
[03:03:59.511 --> 03:03:59.892]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:01.833 --> 03:04:03.355]  I mean, this is his design, pretty much.
[03:04:03.355 --> 03:04:04.235]  No, no, I agree.
[03:04:04.235 --> 03:04:16.827]  Why don't we put a press release out, shoot a serious video, you know, say Saturday, calling for the entire, say, We Agree, InfoWars Agrees, or Media Outlet headline, Remove Thomas Everson's Statue, Bulldoze College.
[03:04:16.827 --> 03:04:18.228]  I think that's it.
[03:04:18.228 --> 03:04:19.229]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:19.229 --> 03:04:21.591]  And then we could just, they could like, turn it into some...
[03:04:22.959 --> 03:04:28.945]  Occupy thing with tents and whatnot on the whole Bulldoze College and then they can push whatever dinner they want to push.
[03:04:28.945 --> 03:04:32.708]  Yeah, let's actually tear it all down and build a giant statue of Mao.
[03:04:32.708 --> 03:04:34.230]  Let me get a final comment from Jakari.
[03:04:34.230 --> 03:04:36.031]  Jakari, great job.
[03:04:36.031 --> 03:04:36.812]  You have 20 seconds.
[03:04:36.812 --> 03:04:38.534]  Final comments, then Leanne McAdoo's coming up.
[03:04:39.944 --> 03:04:41.887]  Oh, he can't hear me.
[03:04:41.887 --> 03:04:43.068]  He's got the earpiece.
[03:04:43.068 --> 03:04:44.110]  Jakari, we're out of time.
[03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:45.992]  Just say bye.
[03:04:45.992 --> 03:04:47.354]  Last ten seconds.
[03:04:47.354 --> 03:04:49.056]  Take us out.
[03:04:49.056 --> 03:04:50.078]  Oh, thank you.
[03:04:50.078 --> 03:04:52.241]  InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:04:52.241 --> 03:04:52.661]  Central.
[03:04:52.661 --> 03:04:54.884]  Jakari Jackson, Kit Daniels, signing off.
[03:04:54.884 --> 03:04:56.667]  It's teleprop from the University of Missouri.
[03:05:00.618 --> 03:05:13.890]  Marco Rubio, the new billionaire boy toy, was left speechless on the fourth GOP debate when Rand Paul called him on his absurd pandering to the military-industrial complex and his attempt to outdo Hillary Clinton with free college.
[03:05:13.890 --> 03:05:16.472]  And yes, I do want to rebuild the American military.
[03:05:16.472 --> 03:05:18.373]  Rebuild the American military?
[03:05:18.373 --> 03:05:19.414]  Seriously, Rubio?
[03:05:19.414 --> 03:05:23.458]  But you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined.
[03:05:23.638 --> 03:05:25.580]  I know that Rand is a committed isolationist.
[03:05:25.580 --> 03:05:31.006]  From Marco's perspective, if you don't have more than the seven Obama wars going, you're an isolationist.
[03:05:31.006 --> 03:05:38.335]  Perhaps it would be safer if we were involved in ten wars, or maybe even better, picked a fight with Russia, so Rubio's masters could cash in.
[03:05:39.316 --> 03:05:48.585]  Marco, how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?
[03:05:48.585 --> 03:05:52.869]  How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?
[03:05:52.869 --> 03:05:57.834]  You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.
[03:05:58.154 --> 03:06:01.657]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:01.657 --> 03:06:09.924]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:09.924 --> 03:06:15.328]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:15.328 --> 03:06:17.871]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:06:17.871 --> 03:06:19.972]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:06:29.146 --> 03:06:31.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:06:31.369 --> 03:06:36.356]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:06:36.356 --> 03:06:39.640]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:06:39.640 --> 03:06:43.145]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:06:43.145 --> 03:06:44.888]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:06:45.128 --> 03:06:45.948]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:06:45.948 --> 03:06:47.209]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:06:47.209 --> 03:06:49.210]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:06:49.210 --> 03:06:57.774]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:06:57.774 --> 03:06:59.414]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:06:59.414 --> 03:07:00.915]  You can't survive without it.
[03:07:00.915 --> 03:07:02.095]  But where do you get it?
[03:07:02.095 --> 03:07:07.838]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:07:08.098 --> 03:07:14.004]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:07:14.004 --> 03:07:30.881]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:07:31.261 --> 03:07:33.743]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:07:33.743 --> 03:07:35.224]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:07:35.224 --> 03:07:36.265]  Easy assembly.
[03:07:36.265 --> 03:07:37.165]  Low maintenance.
[03:07:37.165 --> 03:07:39.267]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:08:00.342 --> 03:08:03.105]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:03.105 --> 03:08:05.889]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.294 --> 03:08:12.516]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:12.516 --> 03:08:15.718]  You are now entering the fourth hour overdrive.
[03:08:15.718 --> 03:08:17.899]  I'm your host, Leanne McAdoo.
[03:08:17.899 --> 03:08:27.886]  Now, right before the break, you heard Alex Jones and Kit Daniels discussing a very radical idea bulldozing the entire campus there at Mizzou.
[03:08:27.886 --> 03:08:29.527]  It must be racist.
[03:08:29.527 --> 03:08:34.970]  You know, it was there built after the land grant, designed after the University of Virginia.
[03:08:34.970 --> 03:08:37.612]  Just all sorts of racist implications there.
[03:08:38.052 --> 03:08:39.393]  I think that's a phenomenal idea.
[03:08:39.393 --> 03:08:44.117]  Hopefully we can get a petition started to just do away with this racism altogether.
[03:08:44.117 --> 03:08:48.941]  Who cares, you know, about the historical accuracy of anything?
[03:08:48.941 --> 03:08:51.023]  I think, you know, this is what's happening with our country now.
[03:08:51.023 --> 03:08:56.087]  These kids are so radical, you know, in their tolerance that we're just going to do away with everything.
[03:08:56.087 --> 03:08:58.009]  So we're going to talk more about that coming up.
[03:08:58.009 --> 03:08:59.850]  Joe Biggs is going to be joining me in the studio.
[03:09:00.831 --> 03:09:09.037]  After about 2.30 today, we want to talk about Veterans Day, talk about some of the problems that veterans are facing in the professional workplace.
[03:09:09.037 --> 03:09:14.762]  Of course, the White House is now trying to say that they're going to ease veterans access to care.
[03:09:14.762 --> 03:09:21.607]  You know, we've had all these issues there with the VA and we haven't really seen a lot being done in that respect.
[03:09:21.607 --> 03:09:22.808]  So Joe Biggs will be in here.
[03:09:22.808 --> 03:09:23.829]  We also got a pretty
[03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.449]  I think so.
[03:09:45.564 --> 03:09:46.164]  Thank you.
[03:09:57.364 --> 03:10:02.087]  Everyone that's there, aside from Rand Paul, is pushing for World War III.
[03:10:02.087 --> 03:10:03.988]  So that was pretty frightening.
[03:10:03.988 --> 03:10:10.272]  Now, let's talk about what is happening on college campuses across the United States.
[03:10:10.272 --> 03:10:14.955]  They are no longer pumping out the next generation of intellectuals.
[03:10:14.955 --> 03:10:22.220]  These are people who are completely afraid of being introduced to any ideas that are contrary to their own.
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:25.263]  And they're getting a lot of momentum now.
[03:10:25.263 --> 03:10:31.249]  They actually have the president of the University of Missouri's school system resigning.
[03:10:31.249 --> 03:10:32.971]  He didn't even put up a fight.
[03:10:32.971 --> 03:10:39.397]  Now, he is the president of the University of Missouri, that particular school, but he resides over a four-school system.
[03:10:39.397 --> 03:10:43.662]  So that is a lot of power there, and he just stepped down without a fight.
[03:10:44.102 --> 03:10:50.904]  You know, he didn't come right out and say, I'm sorry for my white privilege, which was, of course, one of the demands of those students.
[03:10:50.904 --> 03:10:54.906]  But, you know, I mean, that for me was just pretty shocking.
[03:10:54.906 --> 03:11:00.888]  So, of course, now we're going to start seeing a lot of other race protests scattered around the U.S.
[03:11:00.888 --> 03:11:04.449]  They're reporting other campuses are going to do this in solidarity.
[03:11:05.229 --> 03:11:07.550]  What other presidents are going to be resigning?
[03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:16.093]  What other teachers who are caught on camera telling photojournalists to get lost or she's going to get some weight in to remove them?
[03:11:16.093 --> 03:11:24.297]  Now, of course, we've learned that Melissa Click has resigned from her courtesy appointment with the Missouri School of Journalism.
[03:11:25.277 --> 03:11:34.933]  She was of course the loud mouth there on camera that was yelling at that photojournalist and she issued an apology afterward, but that wasn't enough.
[03:11:34.933 --> 03:11:37.196]  She also had to resign her courtesy appointment.
[03:11:38.476 --> 03:11:47.440]  But then we find out that this hunger strike, the hunger striker, he was kind of the main one that started this whole thing.
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:53.643]  Now, we learned from his Facebook page that first it was due to Planned Parenthood being removed from campus.
[03:11:53.643 --> 03:11:55.723]  That is according to Missouri state law.
[03:11:55.723 --> 03:12:06.148]  The president of the University of Missouri had nothing to do with that, but he was also really upset about the removal of student health care, which of course, that's thanks to Obamacare,
[03:12:06.468 --> 03:12:10.009]  Once again, the president of the University of Missouri had nothing to do with that.
[03:12:10.009 --> 03:12:15.230]  But, you know, there wasn't even any evidence for a lot of these racial incidents that they said happened.
[03:12:15.230 --> 03:12:20.151]  This alleged swastika that was put on the wall with some poop.
[03:12:20.151 --> 03:12:21.272]  The poopstika.
[03:12:21.272 --> 03:12:22.912]  They didn't have any pictures of that.
[03:12:22.912 --> 03:12:25.273]  I guess they didn't take any DNA samples.
[03:12:25.273 --> 03:12:25.853]  I don't really know.
[03:12:26.753 --> 03:12:27.894]  What happened with that?
[03:12:27.894 --> 03:12:35.479]  But, you know, there was only one instance that was actually reported to the police and the president did issue something about that.
[03:12:35.479 --> 03:12:37.060]  So that was the one thing.
[03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:40.682]  All of these other claims of racism, there was no evidence for it.
[03:12:40.682 --> 03:12:50.569]  But now it turns out this Mizzou hunger striker who claims that he's so oppressed and it's white privilege and he, you know, asked the president to resign and all this.
[03:12:50.569 --> 03:12:54.131]  So he comes from a family worth $20 million.
[03:12:54.131 --> 03:12:55.452]  His father is a railroad VP.
[03:12:56.693 --> 03:13:00.695]  He made about $8.4 million last year.
[03:13:00.695 --> 03:13:02.296]  So, what?
[03:13:02.296 --> 03:13:05.018]  And so these are the people that have this agenda.
[03:13:05.018 --> 03:13:09.140]  Activists, I'm sorry everyone, activists have an agenda.
[03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:15.083]  They will lie to do what it takes to get their demands met, to have the president resign.
[03:13:15.083 --> 03:13:19.685]  Here this guy is, you know, comes from a family worth $20 million.
[03:13:19.685 --> 03:13:23.788]  Now, Kit Daniels and Jakari Jackson also talked about how they were getting these
[03:13:24.628 --> 03:13:28.452]  People coming up and asking them if it was true that KKK was on campus.
[03:13:28.452 --> 03:13:42.786]  Well it turns out that was a rumor that was put out by I guess the student body president and he said that he there was a confirmed sighting of a KKK member on campus and he got everyone riled up you know stay indoors it's very frightening this and that and then
[03:13:43.547 --> 03:13:45.529]  Turns out, that wasn't even true.
[03:13:45.529 --> 03:13:52.075]  But, you know, it didn't matter because by then it had already gotten legs and everyone was saying KKK was on campus.
[03:13:52.075 --> 03:13:55.278]  So this is the type of craziness that is going on.
[03:13:55.278 --> 03:14:00.263]  Forget about cognitive development on campus, higher education has now embraced
[03:14:00.703 --> 03:14:02.684]  Emotional reasoning.
[03:14:02.684 --> 03:14:06.345]  That is the, I feel it, therefore it must be true.
[03:14:06.345 --> 03:14:11.607]  And the only way that you can respect me is by validating my subjective feelings.
[03:14:11.607 --> 03:14:14.788]  I don't have to provide you with any evidence of my claims.
[03:14:14.788 --> 03:14:16.289]  I don't have to file a police report.
[03:14:16.289 --> 03:14:23.712]  I just have to tell you that I'm hurt and I'm sad and now you and your white privilege need to step down.
[03:14:23.712 --> 03:14:26.073]  So I want to play this video from Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:26.073 --> 03:14:28.173]  He pretty much sums it up.
[03:14:28.173 --> 03:14:29.194]  So let's go ahead and roll that.
[03:14:30.353 --> 03:14:40.556]  Progressives and social justice warriors have launched an ideological jihad against free speech and the very bedrock of what education is supposed to represent.
[03:14:40.556 --> 03:14:48.338]  Free thinking, logic, debate, dissent, open inquiry under their new regime of safe spaces, trigger warnings,
[03:14:48.638 --> 03:14:48.978]  Maybe two.
[03:14:48.978 --> 03:14:49.178]  Okay.
[03:15:09.821 --> 03:15:17.929]  At Yale, a professor was surrounded by a hysterical mob who used Maoist Red Guard tactics to intimidate and shout him down.
[03:15:25.097 --> 03:15:25.657]  His hate crime?
[03:15:40.626 --> 03:15:47.468]  Writing an email critical of the students' efforts to censor offensive Halloween costumes.
[03:15:47.468 --> 03:16:00.511]  At Missouri University, President Tim Wolf and others were forced to resign in part for not acknowledging their white privilege and refusing to echo the debunked narrative behind the Michael Brown shooting.
[03:16:00.511 --> 03:16:09.753]  Radicals and professors then openly called for using mob violence to silence the First Amendment right of the press to cover the story.
[03:16:10.333 --> 03:16:11.854]  Hi media, can I talk to you?
[03:16:11.854 --> 03:16:13.615]  No, you need to get out!
[03:16:13.615 --> 03:16:14.656]  You need to get out!
[03:16:14.656 --> 03:16:16.117]  No I don't.
[03:16:16.117 --> 03:16:17.638]  You need to get out!
[03:16:17.638 --> 03:16:18.199]  I actually don't.
[03:16:23.931 --> 03:16:46.296]  A university in the UK arranged a conference on censorship, then censored conservatives from taking part because it might offend someone.
[03:16:46.296 --> 03:16:47.897]  Feelings are more important than facts.
[03:16:47.897 --> 03:16:48.697]  Yeah!
[03:16:48.697 --> 03:16:49.437]  This is wrong!
[03:16:50.117 --> 03:16:51.997]  You're all crazy!
[03:16:51.997 --> 03:16:55.098]  Stop violating me with your different opinions!
[03:16:55.098 --> 03:16:56.738]  I have the right to speak my mind!
[03:16:56.738 --> 03:16:58.819]  No, we have the right not to be offended.
[03:16:58.819 --> 03:17:04.060]  For years, people have played down the threat posed by SJWs to free speech.
[03:17:04.060 --> 03:17:06.120]  Oh, they're only dumb teenagers on Tumblr.
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:06.860]  Just ignore them.
[03:17:06.860 --> 03:17:07.660]  They'll go away.
[03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:11.561]  This past week has completely demolished that naive assumption.
[03:17:11.561 --> 03:17:14.442]  These people will be teaching our children.
[03:17:14.442 --> 03:17:15.602]  They'll be in government.
[03:17:15.962 --> 03:17:18.583]  With the full force of the state behind them.
[03:17:18.583 --> 03:17:24.586]  Now even liberal professors are admitting that they're frightened of their own students' zealotry.
[03:17:24.586 --> 03:17:34.651]  Instead of producing the next generation of intellectuals, these universities are churning out crazed cult members who have declared war on free speech.
[03:17:34.651 --> 03:17:37.712]  This is not going to end well for society.
[03:17:37.712 --> 03:17:39.493]  And unless actual liberals
[03:17:39.853 --> 03:17:46.303]  Stand up for true intellectual tolerance and authentic classical liberalism.
[03:17:46.303 --> 03:17:50.329]  The future for free speech in the West is doomed.
[03:17:51.881 --> 03:17:56.265]  And that was Paul Joseph Watson, and that is it.
[03:17:56.265 --> 03:17:57.667]  I mean, this is frightening.
[03:17:57.667 --> 03:17:59.629]  This is the future of America.
[03:17:59.629 --> 03:18:08.157]  They think that it is progressive to launch a relentless attack on the values that this country was founded upon due to their feelings.
[03:18:08.157 --> 03:18:09.478]  You cannot hurt their feelings.
[03:18:09.478 --> 03:18:13.321]  And, you know, it'd be one thing if this was an isolated event, but these are
[03:18:14.082 --> 03:18:20.187]  Students coming out of prestigious colleges who are going to be the future teachers of the world and lawyers.
[03:18:20.187 --> 03:18:31.357]  I mean they actually had a law school that was working on not using the word violate as in violate the law because it could possibly trigger some students.
[03:18:31.357 --> 03:18:32.938]  So this is what's happening.
[03:18:32.938 --> 03:18:38.022]  We're going into PC craziness and you know we're basically now
[03:18:38.843 --> 03:18:41.824]  Universities are breeding ground for homogenous thought.
[03:18:41.824 --> 03:18:50.648]  So it's all about, you know, zero tolerance, creating a class of exceptionally thin-skinned humans that are going to be absolutely useless in the real world.
[03:18:50.648 --> 03:18:59.871]  Can you imagine how many lawsuits are going to be coming about in the workplace if they're upset or their feelings are heard over something?
[03:18:59.871 --> 03:19:04.953]  So, you know, these are real-world things that are going to be a huge issue once these people leave their
[03:19:05.373 --> 03:19:07.895]  Safe space of academia.
[03:19:07.895 --> 03:19:10.997]  Now when we come back, we're going to be talking a little bit about
[03:19:12.034 --> 03:19:16.575]  You know, some more about this, but we also want to do the debate wrap-up.
[03:19:16.575 --> 03:19:24.017]  You know, a lot of people, even the haters, have had to say that Rand Paul has done a really amazing job and, you know, I was pretty impressed with him last night.
[03:19:24.017 --> 03:19:26.678]  I hope that he continues to step it up.
[03:19:26.678 --> 03:19:37.260]  But also, we're going to have Joe Biggs in studio talking a lot about, you know, the issues that are facing veterans now in the professional workplace.
[03:19:37.260 --> 03:19:38.661]  So, we'll be right back with that.
[03:19:39.781 --> 03:19:45.272]  You know, hopefully we can do something about these crazy college kids because they're getting pretty frightening.
[03:19:45.272 --> 03:19:45.873]  Pretty radical.
[03:20:01.229 --> 03:20:05.853]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:20:05.853 --> 03:20:10.156]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:20:10.156 --> 03:20:11.537]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:20:11.537 --> 03:20:14.559]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:20:14.559 --> 03:20:16.781]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:16.781 --> 03:20:18.983]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:20:18.983 --> 03:20:21.264]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:21.264 --> 03:20:22.906]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:22.906 --> 03:20:25.407]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:20:25.407 --> 03:20:29.450]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:30.271 --> 03:20:31.392]  Another concern?
[03:20:31.392 --> 03:20:35.375]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:20:35.375 --> 03:20:37.957]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:37.957 --> 03:20:41.940]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:20:41.940 --> 03:20:44.742]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:44.742 --> 03:20:49.386]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:20:49.386 --> 03:20:51.387]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:20:51.387 --> 03:20:53.049]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:53.049 --> 03:20:54.390]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:20:58.251 --> 03:21:03.877]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:21:03.877 --> 03:21:18.333]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:21:18.493 --> 03:21:26.496]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:21:26.496 --> 03:21:31.918]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[03:21:31.918 --> 03:21:35.620]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:21:35.620 --> 03:21:39.701]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:21:39.701 --> 03:21:43.583]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:21:43.823 --> 03:21:44.063]  I think.
[03:21:58.297 --> 03:22:09.207]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:22:09.207 --> 03:22:13.371]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:22:13.371 --> 03:22:15.513]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:15.513 --> 03:22:20.978]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:21.138 --> 03:22:31.160]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:22:31.160 --> 03:22:37.661]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:22:37.661 --> 03:22:41.002]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:22:41.002 --> 03:22:43.062]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:22:43.062 --> 03:22:46.163]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:22:46.723 --> 03:23:00.274]  Don't take a cold or flu lying down.
[03:23:00.274 --> 03:23:03.316]  Stand up and fight back with Supernatural Silver.

[03:24:05.498 --> 03:24:07.239]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:07.239 --> 03:24:10.562]  You are now listening to the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:10.562 --> 03:24:12.263]  I am Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[03:24:12.263 --> 03:24:14.905]  And we're going to go ahead and talk about some of the debate highlights.
[03:24:14.905 --> 03:24:16.786]  Even the haters had to agree.
[03:24:16.786 --> 03:24:19.248]  Paul came out on top.
[03:24:19.248 --> 03:24:20.509]  He was looking really good.
[03:24:20.509 --> 03:24:30.977]  Looking at Drudge Report, the Drudge polls, you all decided Trump, Cruz, Paul, and Rubio took the lead after this debate.
[03:24:30.977 --> 03:24:34.480]  What I was surprised to see was Kasich was out there talking a lot.
[03:24:35.140 --> 03:24:38.561]  And of course he was talking about taking down Wall Street and all that.
[03:24:38.561 --> 03:24:43.083]  Meanwhile, this is the guy that sat on the board of Lehman Brothers during the whole crash.
[03:24:43.083 --> 03:24:44.664]  So what is he talking about?
[03:24:44.664 --> 03:24:51.906]  It's just like Hillary Clinton saying she's going to come after her biggest donors, which are from the big banks and Wall Street and all that.
[03:24:51.906 --> 03:24:54.427]  So it's it's just a total farce.
[03:24:54.427 --> 03:24:55.548]  But let's look at some of these.
[03:24:56.528 --> 03:25:05.295]  Publications that have been really attacking Rand Paul relentlessly over the weeks, the Huffington Post, Slate and Salon.
[03:25:05.295 --> 03:25:13.841]  So these were unexpected sources that were applauding Paul's performance, saying it was clear he came out ahead.
[03:25:13.841 --> 03:25:21.267]  There's plenty of reasons to oppose Rand Paul's political philosophy, but he at least has one, and it's both coherent and consistent.
[03:25:21.667 --> 03:25:22.848]  And that was evident last night.
[03:25:22.848 --> 03:25:27.833]  That's been my big praise and support of Rand Paul is that he has been consistent.
[03:25:27.833 --> 03:25:36.121]  And the votes that he's been making there have been, you know, not because, oh, I'm running for president, so I've got to vote this way or that way.
[03:25:36.121 --> 03:25:39.584]  He votes, you know, on his libertarian ideals.
[03:25:39.584 --> 03:25:40.826]  So I appreciate that.
[03:25:41.606 --> 03:25:56.851]  But one of the things that I thought was probably the most powerful, obviously, yes, he called everybody out on not being actual fiscal conservatives and how adding trillions of dollars to the debt without being able to pay for it was not conservative value.
[03:25:56.851 --> 03:26:05.114]  But I really, you know, it was powerful for me when he was calling everybody out on their hawkish war ideals of saying
[03:26:05.734 --> 03:26:19.598]  Putting this no-fly zone over Syria or Iraq, that is basically saying, Russia, if you fly, we're going to shoot down your planes, which means we're going to have to be sending our sons and daughters to World War III.
[03:26:19.598 --> 03:26:22.439]  That's what that means, and a lot of people don't realize that.
[03:26:22.439 --> 03:26:23.679]  They just say, yeah, we need to go
[03:26:24.139 --> 03:26:24.500]  I think?
[03:26:41.602 --> 03:26:44.423]  Full equality and women want to be there in the military.
[03:26:44.423 --> 03:26:46.864]  Should women be able to be drafted in as well?
[03:26:46.864 --> 03:26:49.625]  So that means your sons and daughters, there could be a draft.
[03:26:49.625 --> 03:26:56.887]  I mean, who knows where this thing could go because we're seeing all on the conservative side as well as there on the Democratic side.
[03:26:57.407 --> 03:26:57.768]  I don't know.
[03:27:15.871 --> 03:27:18.313]  I want everyone to understand what this means.
[03:27:18.313 --> 03:27:24.196]  If you're calling for a no-fly zone over Russia, you're actually saying, let's go to World War III.
[03:27:24.196 --> 03:27:25.717]  Because that's what that means.
[03:27:25.717 --> 03:27:27.318]  Now, this is Viggo Mortensen.
[03:27:27.318 --> 03:27:29.099]  We've had him on the show before.
[03:27:29.099 --> 03:27:31.521]  You know, very well-spoken, intelligent man.
[03:27:31.521 --> 03:27:37.505]  And basically calling out Bernie Sanders, saying he's just as hawkish as Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:40.366 --> 03:27:46.610]  He says, I really don't think Hillary Clinton, who voted for the invasion, is going to be bringing the subject up on her own.
[03:27:46.610 --> 03:27:51.813]  Neither would Bernie Sanders, frankly, because he has also voted for every military appropriation.
[03:27:51.813 --> 03:27:54.255]  He's just as hawkish as she is.
[03:27:54.255 --> 03:28:07.363]  Now, Bernie Sanders has voted against some military appropriation bills, but he's, you know, he's staunchly pro-Israel, his foreign policy stance, so we kind of know how that goes.
[03:28:09.557 --> 03:28:24.277]  You know, I'm just really concerned with what's actually going to be happening here in the coming years, because the president that we voted next, not only is he going to have to be dealing with a huge jobs crisis, the fact that everything is going now to automation,
[03:28:24.717 --> 03:28:32.825]  We have people calling for a higher minimum wage, which of course Trump was right in that, saying, you know what, there's no way that we can sustain that.
[03:28:32.825 --> 03:28:38.351]  We are now going to be competing, thanks to this TPP, we're going to be competing with more of the world.
[03:28:38.351 --> 03:28:45.158]  We've got, you know, massive illegal immigration happening, which is also going to be affecting the jobs that are going to be available for people.
[03:28:45.698 --> 03:28:49.041]  And, you know, there are going to be a huge crisis here.
[03:28:49.041 --> 03:28:55.205]  And now we've got the fact that they want to fix the economy by going for more war.
[03:28:55.205 --> 03:28:58.028]  That seems to always be the solution.
[03:28:58.028 --> 03:29:02.951]  Now, we're going to be playing up some of our debate highlights for you coming up in the next segment.
[03:29:02.951 --> 03:29:04.212]  Joe Biggs will be in as well.
[03:29:04.212 --> 03:29:08.155]  He had a lot of things to say during the debate coverage last night.
[03:29:09.116 --> 03:29:28.783]  You know, but I was pretty pleased with what happened there on stage, especially the fact, let's not forget, Rand Paul called out, you know, a lot of people want to say he's Obama's cheerleader when it comes to foreign policy, but he actually called out the fact that the number one thing we need to do is stop arming our enemies.
[03:29:28.783 --> 03:29:32.784]  If that's how we want to stop this, stop sending weapons to ISIS!
[03:29:32.784 --> 03:29:34.205]  Stop arming Al Qaeda!
[03:29:34.645 --> 03:29:47.848]  That's the big issue here, and he was one of the only people that actually had the gall to say it, and actually had the gall to say we need to do away with the Federal Reserve, which is the crux of the issue here.
[03:29:47.848 --> 03:29:50.849]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:50.849 --> 03:29:54.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.825 --> 03:30:14.095]  Marco Rubio, the new billionaire boy toy, was left speechless on the fourth GOP debate when Rand Paul called him on his absurd pandering to the military-industrial complex and his attempt to outdo Hillary Clinton with free college.
[03:30:14.095 --> 03:30:16.697]  And yes, I do want to rebuild the American military.
[03:30:16.697 --> 03:30:18.579]  Rebuild the American military?
[03:30:18.579 --> 03:30:19.640]  Seriously, Rubio?
[03:30:19.640 --> 03:30:23.663]  But you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined.
[03:30:23.843 --> 03:30:25.785]  I know that Rand is a committed isolationist.
[03:30:25.785 --> 03:30:31.211]  From Marco's perspective, if you don't have more than the seven Obama wars going, you're an isolationist.
[03:30:31.211 --> 03:30:38.520]  Perhaps it would be safer if we were involved in ten wars, or maybe even better, picked a fight with Russia, so Rubio's masters could cash in.
[03:30:39.520 --> 03:30:48.803]  Marco, how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?
[03:30:48.803 --> 03:30:53.064]  How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?
[03:30:53.064 --> 03:30:58.005]  You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.
[03:30:58.565 --> 03:31:02.526]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:31:02.526 --> 03:31:08.829]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:31:08.829 --> 03:31:16.131]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:31:16.131 --> 03:31:24.914]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.

[03:31:31.398 --> 03:31:36.242]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:31:36.242 --> 03:31:39.824]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:31:39.824 --> 03:31:41.726]  No needles, no injections.
[03:31:41.726 --> 03:31:43.367]  Don't take my word for it.

[03:32:31.367 --> 03:32:36.351]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:36.351 --> 03:32:39.653]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:39.653 --> 03:32:43.136]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:43.136 --> 03:32:45.118]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[03:32:59.810 --> 03:33:05.225]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.225 --> 03:33:07.511]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:18.115 --> 03:33:19.816]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.816 --> 03:33:22.318]  You are now listening to the Overdrive Hour.
[03:33:22.318 --> 03:33:23.458]  I am Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:33:23.458 --> 03:33:26.040]  Joining me in studio is Joe Biggs.
[03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:30.583]  We're gonna talk a lot about Veterans Day and some of the issues that are facing the veterans.
[03:33:30.583 --> 03:33:35.986]  Now we've got, you know, a lot of our presidential candidates talking about taking us into a new war.
[03:33:35.986 --> 03:33:38.048]  What else is new?
[03:33:38.048 --> 03:33:43.131]  But before we get into that, I wanted to let you guys know that super male vitality is back!
[03:33:43.471 --> 03:33:45.432]  You got to secure yours before it sells out.
[03:33:45.432 --> 03:33:46.873]  It always sells out.
[03:33:46.873 --> 03:33:48.193]  Then we've got to produce more.
[03:33:48.193 --> 03:33:49.774]  It's always a limited run.
[03:33:49.774 --> 03:33:54.156]  So now is the time to secure your bottle before we run out of this.
[03:33:54.156 --> 03:33:57.697]  You know, it's typically months before we get in another shipment.
[03:33:57.697 --> 03:33:59.758]  This is an ultra-strength formula.
[03:33:59.758 --> 03:34:03.760]  It contains organic herbs and acids that are the real deal.
[03:34:03.760 --> 03:34:10.423]  I was actually taking Supermail when we first started creating it and I was like, this is great, but why don't you make some
[03:34:10.663 --> 03:34:17.008]  Something for the ladies and then lo and behold we did and you know both versions are completely awesome.
[03:34:17.008 --> 03:34:20.030]  This is Screech from Smithfield, Rhode Island.
[03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:28.256]  He's a hockey player and he says, amazing energy for during my heavy lifting and on ice training for hockey.
[03:34:28.256 --> 03:34:31.879]  And then we've got one other one here by Lobo.
[03:34:31.879 --> 03:34:35.242]  He's from Maryland and he says, love it!
[03:34:35.242 --> 03:34:36.022]  So there you go.
[03:34:37.412 --> 03:34:38.492]  Joe Biggs, what do you think?
[03:34:38.492 --> 03:34:40.013]  Supermail Vitality.
[03:34:40.013 --> 03:34:41.093]  That's definitely a great product.
[03:34:41.093 --> 03:34:45.495]  Everywhere I've been, it's funny, when I fly into these different little airports, I'm always running into somebody.
[03:34:45.495 --> 03:34:49.637]  They come up to me like, hey Joe Biggs, and they show me their bottle of Supermail Vitality.
[03:34:49.637 --> 03:34:51.437]  I'm friends with a lot of big bands.
[03:34:51.437 --> 03:34:55.359]  Those guys always take it before they go out on stage and rock out for the night.
[03:34:55.359 --> 03:34:57.740]  So it's definitely a product that people love.
[03:34:57.740 --> 03:34:59.880]  They're using it, and they're going back for more.
[03:34:59.880 --> 03:35:04.242]  So definitely highly encourage people to take part of that and try it out.
[03:35:05.262 --> 03:35:06.444]  Absolutely.
[03:35:06.444 --> 03:35:08.226]  Well, now, you just got here.
[03:35:08.226 --> 03:35:11.130]  I know you have been enjoying your Veterans Day.
[03:35:11.130 --> 03:35:12.752]  Thank you so much for coming in.
[03:35:12.752 --> 03:35:16.777]  Yeah, I've been to four different restaurants thus far.
[03:35:16.777 --> 03:35:17.838]  I ended at Hooters.
[03:35:17.838 --> 03:35:20.101]  It's been a fantastic lunch thus far.
[03:35:21.102 --> 03:35:33.570]  And I really appreciated what you had to say yesterday in your video where you were saying happy birthday to the Marine Corps, but one of the things you were reminding people about with Veterans Day, it's not about just going up and saying thank you for your service.
[03:35:33.570 --> 03:35:36.753]  It's about saying, hey man, how are you?
[03:35:36.753 --> 03:35:37.493]  How are you doing?
[03:35:37.493 --> 03:35:38.834]  Is everything okay?
[03:35:38.834 --> 03:35:40.135]  That's what the veterans really need.
[03:35:40.515 --> 03:35:44.738]  Yeah, there's a lot of people out there who are anti-war and I can understand that, that's fine.
[03:35:44.738 --> 03:35:50.122]  You know, horrible wars that don't make any sense whatsoever, that's not good at all.
[03:35:50.122 --> 03:35:55.807]  But guess what, there's still men and women out there who believe like I did, hey, I'm trying to do something for my country.
[03:35:55.807 --> 03:35:58.129]  They're not out there for any bad reasons, they're not out there because...
[03:35:58.809 --> 03:36:02.592]  You know, they're trying to help further the gobelist agenda, whatever you may think it is.
[03:36:02.592 --> 03:36:08.596]  So there's people out there, men and women, who say, hey, I want to do something for America because I do think it's the greatest country.
[03:36:08.596 --> 03:36:11.918]  And, you know, simply saying thank you, that's nice and all, but it kind of makes us feel awkward.
[03:36:11.918 --> 03:36:13.559]  Really, at the end of the day, you know what we care about?
[03:36:13.559 --> 03:36:14.720]  Hey, man, how you doing?
[03:36:14.720 --> 03:36:15.420]  How do you feel, man?
[03:36:15.420 --> 03:36:16.021]  Because you know what?
[03:36:16.021 --> 03:36:19.603]  90% of those injuries you do get overseas, they're not external.
[03:36:19.603 --> 03:36:20.203]  You can't see them.
[03:36:20.203 --> 03:36:24.126]  They're not the missing limbs, legs, scars, burn marks, all that stuff.
[03:36:24.126 --> 03:36:25.187]  They're internal.
[03:36:25.187 --> 03:36:27.128]  It's that deep depression you get through every day.
[03:36:27.128 --> 03:36:28.269]  It's the suicidal thoughts.
[03:36:28.869 --> 03:36:30.651]  It's all of that, the massive drinking.
[03:36:30.651 --> 03:36:33.773]  I mean, when you see someone like that, go up and say, hey man, are you alright?
[03:36:33.773 --> 03:36:34.834]  Do you need anything?
[03:36:34.834 --> 03:36:35.935]  I'm here for you.
[03:36:35.935 --> 03:36:38.057]  You know, because a lot of times people forget about those guys.
[03:36:38.057 --> 03:36:44.602]  And it's not that they need to be thanked, they just want to be remembered a little bit and to feel like people out there care about them.
[03:36:44.602 --> 03:36:57.793]  Not because they need that extra attention, but because when you go through that experience, as they're showing combat pictures I've been through, this and that, things I've survived, you go through things to where you don't
[03:36:58.723 --> 03:37:06.548]  You don't think that you can ever assimilate, you don't ever think you're going to be able to fit into civilian life again.
[03:37:06.548 --> 03:37:16.374]  And I'm telling you, when I got back from Afghanistan that last time, and then I got sent from Fort Bragg to Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, I felt completely alone.
[03:37:16.374 --> 03:37:22.858]  And I was even around veterans then because I was still in the Army, but I was in a new place, I'm coming out of hard combat, and I was lost.
[03:37:23.678 --> 03:37:49.024]  I was suicidal, they were giving me pills, I was going to the army doctors every day, William Beaumont, I can't remember all the different hospitals, but they would just push these drugs down me and not even think twice about the adverse reactions, about what was going to happen, about what I've been through, how I'm psychologically able to understand things and deal with things, and that's what the medical professions out there, the people in the VA need to understand.
[03:37:49.444 --> 03:37:58.053]  They keep hiring these 20-year-old kids who come out of, you know, medical school or some kind of form or, you know, they're 28 and they've gone from high school to college to med school.
[03:37:58.053 --> 03:37:59.954]  They don't know anything about a veteran.
[03:37:59.954 --> 03:38:01.116]  They don't know anything about serving.
[03:38:01.116 --> 03:38:02.657]  They don't know anything about combat.
[03:38:02.657 --> 03:38:05.019]  And all of a sudden you think that you're going to be my psychiatrist?
[03:38:05.720 --> 03:38:09.903]  How in the hell am I supposed to open up to you when you've never pulled the trigger?
[03:38:09.903 --> 03:38:13.845]  When you've never had to make that decision between life and death?
[03:38:13.845 --> 03:38:18.848]  When it's a little kid holding a grenade or a whole convoy or a whole hundred of your buddies.
[03:38:18.848 --> 03:38:23.911]  You know, I got a buddy who's deaf now because some kid ran out of a bazaar and threw a hand grenade.
[03:38:23.911 --> 03:38:24.532]  That's horrible.
[03:38:24.532 --> 03:38:26.193]  That stuff haunts me all the time.
[03:38:26.193 --> 03:38:27.213]  I mean, do you shoot that kid?
[03:38:27.213 --> 03:38:28.114]  What do you do?
[03:38:28.114 --> 03:38:31.776]  You know, we joined the military because we want to serve our nation.
[03:38:31.776 --> 03:38:34.418]  At the end of the day, we're not the ones who decide where we go.
[03:38:34.958 --> 03:38:47.586]  I don't know if I'm going to go to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Serbia, you know, Iran, Syria, wherever it may be, Djibouti, Africa, you know, wherever they throw at us, that's where we have to go because that's what we signed up for.
[03:38:47.586 --> 03:38:57.993]  But what we want in return is we're willing to lay our life down for our country, but we want a little bit of respect and a little bit of something from our government.
[03:38:58.823 --> 03:39:03.167]  Now they're talking about sending troops now to, you know, back to Iraq.
[03:39:03.167 --> 03:39:03.648]  Hold on, man.
[03:39:03.648 --> 03:39:05.569]  You haven't even dealt with us here yet.
[03:39:05.569 --> 03:39:06.870]  We've had a small break.
[03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:12.015]  There's a minute amount of people overseas right now, like in Afghanistan, things like that.
[03:39:12.015 --> 03:39:14.798]  They want to send more people overseas into harm's way.
[03:39:14.798 --> 03:39:19.342]  You can't even take care of us from Vietnam and up with what's going on here.
[03:39:19.342 --> 03:39:21.004]  You've got a whole lot of people who need
[03:39:22.193 --> 03:39:29.914]  Mental evaluations, you know, we need people who, I need good psychiatrists, people we can talk to, people that have that training, people who have been there.
[03:39:29.914 --> 03:39:31.575]  And that's where the VA needs to do something.
[03:39:31.575 --> 03:39:36.035]  They need to pull people who are getting out because there's a lot of veterans right now who are homeless.
[03:39:36.035 --> 03:39:38.896]  There's a lot of veterans right now who can't get a job.
[03:39:38.896 --> 03:39:39.496]  Guess what?
[03:39:39.496 --> 03:39:50.838]  A VA is a good place for them because I'm going to open up and talk to a guy who's been to Iraq, who's been to Afghanistan, who's been to Vietnam, who survived that, who's been in the trenches and seen what I've seen, done what I've done.
[03:39:51.258 --> 03:39:53.779]  That's how I'm going to be able to cope with what's going on.
[03:39:53.779 --> 03:40:00.201]  And when I try to open up, I'm going to be able to break through some barriers if I have a chance to actually talk to somebody who's been there.
[03:40:00.201 --> 03:40:08.463]  But when it's some snot-nosed little kid and all he's got is to further the pharmaceutical agenda to push some drug down my throat, I shell up.
[03:40:08.703 --> 03:40:13.467]  Well, you're, you know, you're a strong person, so you were able to kind of fight back emphatically.
[03:40:13.467 --> 03:40:16.809]  Well, yeah, I'm strong that I got rid of the medications, but I still have issues.
[03:40:16.809 --> 03:40:17.149]  Right.
[03:40:17.149 --> 03:40:20.912]  But I learned, someone gave me a poem a long time ago.
[03:40:20.912 --> 03:40:23.875]  It's called, I Wear My Mask, and basically that's what I do.
[03:40:23.875 --> 03:40:26.757]  I'm a great actor when it comes to hiding my emotions.
[03:40:26.757 --> 03:40:28.598]  There's a lot of times I don't want to be around.
[03:40:28.598 --> 03:40:31.901]  There's a lot of times I just feel down and out, and I hate my life.
[03:40:32.421 --> 03:40:39.707]  But I put on that mask and I go through the day and I act happy as hell and I try to joke and do what I can to suppress that stuff.
[03:40:39.707 --> 03:40:43.530]  Because at the end of the day, how am I going to open up to people around me when they've never been there?
[03:40:43.530 --> 03:40:43.750]  Right.
[03:40:44.417 --> 03:40:47.559]  Well, you know, and that was one of the really powerful things that I learned.
[03:40:47.559 --> 03:40:52.003]  I interviewed some people on the show that are making a Project 22.
[03:40:52.003 --> 03:40:57.667]  And Project 22 was a movie, a documentary, that was created by two combat wounded veterans.
[03:40:57.667 --> 03:41:02.150]  And they were really upset about the fact that 22 veterans are committing suicide every day.
[03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:06.353]  So they head out on this Project 22 to go and reach those veterans.
[03:41:06.693 --> 03:41:14.838]  Before, it's not about raising awareness of the suicide, but actually reaching them before they do commit suicide, before they get there.
[03:41:14.838 --> 03:41:25.866]  And throughout this documentary, you learn just why, you know, these veterans are going through this and why they come back and how they could be going through this PTSD.
[03:41:25.866 --> 03:41:30.389]  And like you said, they're getting these drugs, which by the way, are black labeled.
[03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:35.332]  So this black label basically says, hey, you know, we're not going to give this to the regular population of people.
[03:41:35.472 --> 03:41:37.013]  They're not FDA approved whatsoever.
[03:41:37.013 --> 03:41:39.556]  They use us as guinea pigs on everything.
[03:41:39.556 --> 03:41:43.720]  And they don't ever make the connection that that's the reason people are blowing their brains out.
[03:41:43.720 --> 03:41:55.351]  Well it says right there on the thing, by the way, this in men, particularly between the ages of 20-26 years old, it is more likely that they are going to commit suicide.
[03:41:55.851 --> 03:42:07.073]  I mean it says that right on the pill bottle and one of the men that was interviewed in this movie said that he was taking like 30 pills several times a day and that was what was prescribed to him by the VA.
[03:42:07.073 --> 03:42:08.234]  Oh take this pill for that.
[03:42:08.234 --> 03:42:10.334]  Oh now you need to take this for that and this for that.
[03:42:10.334 --> 03:42:16.136]  No wonder these people are going completely crazy and you know so here this really powerful movie Project 22 it's also
[03:42:18.616 --> 03:42:30.565]  You know, it's good for the veterans to let them know, you know, you're not alone and here are some alternative therapies that you can take that are going to help you reconnect back with society, help you, you know, to take those tools that you have in your tool bag.
[03:42:30.565 --> 03:42:41.553]  I mean, let's face it, the veterans are probably the most equipped members of society, yet we just tell them to throw their tool bag, you know, into the basement when they return to civilization.
[03:42:42.994 --> 03:42:48.098]  And so then you're here, and you don't know how to transfer those talents and that skill.
[03:42:48.098 --> 03:42:55.123]  But, you know, also this movie is really good for those of us who have never been to war and who don't know what people are going through.
[03:42:55.123 --> 03:42:56.324]  That's another big thing.
[03:42:56.324 --> 03:42:57.084]  That's another big thing.
[03:42:57.084 --> 03:43:00.287]  Like, you know, in relationships that's always been my problem.
[03:43:00.287 --> 03:43:03.049]  I can't ever find, you know, it's hard to find a woman who actually
[03:43:03.689 --> 03:43:03.749]  And
[03:43:27.034 --> 03:43:32.526]  I'd stopped at a couple bars and had like a drink here and there, and I just felt alone.
[03:43:32.526 --> 03:43:36.535]  All of a sudden I felt like I was in this bubble by myself, but I was surrounded by women, people everywhere.
[03:43:37.461 --> 03:43:42.584]  Anybody would have had a great time, but for some reason, I just felt like I was all alone and had nothing to do.
[03:43:42.584 --> 03:43:45.325]  And I jumped in my car and I started screaming and crying.
[03:43:45.325 --> 03:43:48.907]  And I started punching my steering wheel and my horns going off in the parking lot.
[03:43:48.907 --> 03:43:50.388]  And I'm just hitting everything I can.
[03:43:50.388 --> 03:43:54.130]  I've still got fist marks on my car where I was just screaming.
[03:43:54.130 --> 03:43:55.711]  And I didn't know what to do.
[03:43:55.711 --> 03:43:56.992]  I didn't know why this was happening.
[03:43:56.992 --> 03:44:00.954]  And then I started getting so frustrated and angry that I was, why was I this angry?
[03:44:00.954 --> 03:44:02.254]  What is going on?
[03:44:02.254 --> 03:44:06.437]  And I ran home and I took every freaking Ambien that I had because I just, I'd had enough.
[03:44:06.997 --> 03:44:16.943]  And I took a whole bottle of Ambien, chucked a whole bottle of tequila, and walked out into the desert because the lining of houses at that point in time, everything in our backyard was a desert.
[03:44:16.943 --> 03:44:18.404]  There was nothing out there.
[03:44:18.404 --> 03:44:20.705]  It hadn't been developed yet.
[03:44:20.705 --> 03:44:23.427]  So I went out there and I was like, you know, I'm just ready to go.
[03:44:23.427 --> 03:44:24.567]  I can't take this anymore.
[03:44:24.567 --> 03:44:28.190]  I'm just sick and tired of going through this stuff all the time.
[03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:34.493]  And this girl that I know, Becky, from South Carolina, up and calls my phone out of nowhere and says, hey, I had this bad feeling.
[03:44:34.493 --> 03:44:35.094]  Are you okay?
[03:44:35.794 --> 03:44:37.115]  And I just broke down again.
[03:44:37.115 --> 03:44:39.477]  And next thing you know, she called the fire department.
[03:44:39.477 --> 03:44:41.979]  They came and got me, took me to the hospital.
[03:44:41.979 --> 03:44:45.082]  And you know, everyone's from my unit like, hey, are you okay?
[03:44:45.082 --> 03:44:46.423]  And I'm like, oh, I'm fine.
[03:44:46.423 --> 03:44:47.544]  It's just a misunderstanding.
[03:44:47.544 --> 03:44:48.164]  I played it off.
[03:44:48.164 --> 03:44:49.045]  I put my mask on.
[03:44:49.045 --> 03:44:50.166]  I said, oh, yeah, I didn't do anything.
[03:44:50.166 --> 03:44:51.387]  What are you guys talking about?
[03:44:51.387 --> 03:44:51.687]  I'm fine.
[03:44:51.687 --> 03:44:53.269]  I don't have PTSD.
[03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:58.153]  And I went home and I lied to everybody and said I was A-OK because I didn't know how to open up to anybody.
[03:44:58.153 --> 03:45:01.856]  Because when you do, automatically in the military, they say there's an open door policy, but there's not.
[03:45:02.356 --> 03:45:04.698]  They say that you're crazy and that you can't handle anymore.
[03:45:04.698 --> 03:45:09.422]  Then they'll put you in some crappy unit where you're never going to go and do what you love to do again.
[03:45:09.422 --> 03:45:11.664]  And then you're going to hate your life even more.
[03:45:11.664 --> 03:45:14.867]  I went home, I threw every single pill down the toilet.
[03:45:14.867 --> 03:45:18.370]  I said screw this stuff, screw all this crap, I'm never doing it again.
[03:45:18.370 --> 03:45:21.353]  Because I understood that I wasn't angry.
[03:45:21.353 --> 03:45:24.615]  I wasn't depressed, I didn't hate my life, it was these freaking pills.
[03:45:25.779 --> 03:45:32.283]  That we're doing this to me was the fact that the doctors didn't give one care about me whatsoever.
[03:45:32.283 --> 03:45:34.104]  And then I was like, you know what, I'm done.
[03:45:34.104 --> 03:45:37.866]  And that's why there are 22 people taking themselves a day.
[03:45:37.866 --> 03:45:42.289]  I've had two this year, two buddies, one guy who wore a mask just as well as I did.
[03:45:42.289 --> 03:45:43.689]  So I couldn't tell that he was depressed.
[03:45:43.689 --> 03:45:46.931]  I couldn't tell that he wanted to kill himself at all.
[03:45:46.931 --> 03:45:49.333]  And I go in one day to go hang out with him and he's not there.
[03:45:50.029 --> 03:45:50.329]  Yeah.
[03:45:50.329 --> 03:45:51.430]  You know, that's horrible.
[03:45:51.430 --> 03:45:58.554]  And that's really powerful because that's exactly what it is, taking that time to just make that phone call and just reach out and say, hey, how are you doing today?
[03:45:58.554 --> 03:45:59.634]  Are you OK?
[03:45:59.634 --> 03:46:06.558]  And knowing that you are going to put on that mask because that's how you've been trained to deal with, you know, you don't cry, you don't get to cry on the battlefield.
[03:46:06.558 --> 03:46:10.781]  So when you come back here, you don't know how to filter all of those emotions.
[03:46:10.781 --> 03:46:11.541]  I mean, it's very hard.
[03:46:11.561 --> 03:46:12.902]  It's not a video game.
[03:46:12.902 --> 03:46:14.582]  You know, war is not a video game.
[03:46:14.582 --> 03:46:26.488]  And that's why, for me, watching the debate last night and just seeing this craziness of all these people foaming at the mouth to send even more people to a battle that we, the U.S.
[03:46:26.488 --> 03:46:31.890]  government, is sending weapons to our enemies in order to create this chaos.
[03:46:31.890 --> 03:46:35.672]  They love the soldiers when it's time to send them to combat, but they don't love you when you get back.
[03:46:35.672 --> 03:46:37.112]  They don't love to take care of you.
[03:46:37.112 --> 03:46:37.933]  They don't care about you.
[03:46:38.615 --> 03:46:41.596]  And I'm not saying that it's a bad profession to go into.
[03:46:41.596 --> 03:46:43.977]  I think we have to make change from the inside.
[03:46:43.977 --> 03:46:45.998]  But, you know, come on, people out there.
[03:46:45.998 --> 03:46:47.198]  Washington, do something.
[03:46:47.198 --> 03:46:50.259]  There's people out there literally on the edge.
[03:46:50.259 --> 03:46:55.461]  Yeah, Trump is really one of the only ones who's actually talking about, you know, the veterans and this is what we need to do.
[03:46:55.461 --> 03:46:58.002]  So, of course, now the White House today is stepping up.
[03:46:58.002 --> 03:47:02.484]  Now, before we go to break, I want to play this one video and then we'll get your take on it when we come back.
[03:47:03.044 --> 03:47:04.967]  So guys, can we go ahead and roll this?
[03:47:04.967 --> 03:47:06.930]  It's a breaking video.
[03:47:06.930 --> 03:47:09.735]  It is on UWEX-16.
[03:47:09.735 --> 03:47:14.141]  It's an unconventional warfare exercise, 2016, taking place here in Texas.
[03:47:21.701 --> 03:47:24.563]  So what did we learn from Jade Helm 15?
[03:47:24.563 --> 03:47:27.565]  More importantly, what did the government learn?
[03:47:27.565 --> 03:47:30.446]  Apparently not enough, because in March of 2016, U.S.
[03:47:30.446 --> 03:47:39.912]  Special Forces are redeploying to Texas under a new codename, UX-16, short for Unconventional Warfare Exercise 2016.
[03:47:42.384 --> 03:47:58.418]  Unlike Jade Helm 15, where military contractors and officers presented their plans for public scrutiny, UX 16 was approved by commissioners in secret, without public input, effectively handing over Bastrop County, Texas to the U.S.
[03:47:58.418 --> 03:48:00.840]  military without public consent.
[03:48:02.017 --> 03:48:12.380]  When the people are removed from the public debate over military operations within their own county limits, effectively, martial law has been declared.
[03:48:12.380 --> 03:48:17.302]  In the case of Jade Helm UX-16, the citizens of Bastrop County don't even know.
[03:48:22.299 --> 03:48:34.548]  Now, according to reports, UX-16 will be even more covert than Jade Helm 15, operating on privately owned properties in the county and at Camp Swift.
[03:48:34.548 --> 03:48:46.698]  County Judge Paul Pape told the press he is in full support of the next phase of military operations in Bastrop, as he indicated there were, quote, no incidents during Jade Helm.
[03:48:47.634 --> 03:49:05.473]  Despite one local eyewitness, Ryan Hohenstein, who stated, Unfortunately for Hohenstein, his response indicates Jade Helm 15 was a successful conditioning exercise.
[03:49:05.473 --> 03:49:07.135]  No wonder the military is returning.
[03:49:08.385 --> 03:49:19.777]  Judge Pape's only concern was the public outcry and paranoia surrounding Jane Helden 15, and he hopes that the military planners have a better containment policy than last time.
[03:49:19.777 --> 03:49:29.227]  He was clear to issue a directive to special forces to subdue the new name for the operation and refrain from labeling Texas as hostile territory.
[03:49:30.370 --> 03:49:39.659]  Little is known about UX16 at this time other than it kicks off in March of 2016 and will be even more covert than Jade Helm.
[03:49:39.659 --> 03:49:44.564]  Unfortunately for Judge Pape and the Bath Shop Commissioners, the cat is out of the bag.
[03:49:44.564 --> 03:49:48.008]  Fortunately for the free people of Texas, we're getting the word out.
[03:49:48.926 --> 03:49:52.147]  All right, so that was sent over to us from the Next News Network.
[03:49:52.147 --> 03:49:54.008]  Of course, they are talking about UWEX-16.
[03:49:54.008 --> 03:49:55.569]  It's short for Unconventional Warfare Exercise 2016.
[03:49:55.569 --> 03:49:58.750]  This one is obviously happening in a more covert way.
[03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:59.491]  We do have some
[03:50:16.418 --> 03:50:16.638]  Yeah.
[03:50:34.546 --> 03:50:41.689]  Based on their own materials there, what they were talking about with mastering the human domain and what that meant.
[03:50:41.689 --> 03:50:46.992]  So obviously this time around, we just want to make sure people aren't going to be putting words in our mouth.
[03:50:46.992 --> 03:50:51.474]  But, you know, Joe Biggs, I want to get your take on this when we get back.
[03:50:59.269 --> 03:51:07.991]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:07.991 --> 03:51:09.471]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.471 --> 03:51:17.393]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:17.393 --> 03:51:25.815]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:26.375 --> 03:51:31.537]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:31.537 --> 03:51:35.198]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:35.198 --> 03:51:37.079]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:37.079 --> 03:51:38.079]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:38.079 --> 03:51:41.120]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:58.194 --> 03:52:03.859]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:52:03.859 --> 03:52:18.290]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:52:18.450 --> 03:52:26.455]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:52:26.455 --> 03:52:32.038]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:52:32.038 --> 03:52:35.600]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:52:35.600 --> 03:52:39.683]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:52:39.683 --> 03:52:43.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:52:43.905 --> 03:52:48.031]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[03:53:00.373 --> 03:53:05.014]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:53:05.014 --> 03:53:09.295]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:53:09.295 --> 03:53:10.676]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:53:10.676 --> 03:53:13.717]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:53:13.717 --> 03:53:15.917]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:53:15.917 --> 03:53:18.118]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:53:18.118 --> 03:53:20.419]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:53:20.419 --> 03:53:22.059]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:53:22.059 --> 03:53:24.540]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:53:24.540 --> 03:53:28.601]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:53:29.426 --> 03:53:30.547]  Another concern?
[03:53:30.547 --> 03:53:34.529]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:53:34.529 --> 03:53:37.110]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:53:37.110 --> 03:53:41.093]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:53:41.093 --> 03:53:43.894]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:43.894 --> 03:53:48.537]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:53:48.537 --> 03:53:50.538]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:53:50.538 --> 03:53:52.179]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:52.179 --> 03:53:53.540]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:54:08.699 --> 03:54:10.460]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:10.460 --> 03:54:14.540]  We are wrapping up the fourth hour overdrive here, myself and Joe Biggs.
[03:54:14.540 --> 03:54:22.882]  Now, we just watched a video that was sent over to us from the Next News Network, talking about UW-EX-16.
[03:54:22.882 --> 03:54:25.083]  Is this, you know, the next Jade Helm?
[03:54:25.083 --> 03:54:28.804]  It is a Jade Helm return, or, you know, Joe Biggs, what do you think?
[03:54:28.804 --> 03:54:32.885]  Well, I don't get the fact that, obviously, you know, why would they pick Bastrop?
[03:54:32.885 --> 03:54:36.966]  That was one of the biggest blowbacks from the majority of the population.
[03:54:36.966 --> 03:54:37.686]  They don't want that.
[03:54:38.277 --> 03:54:41.640]  Right, well now it's going to be on private property in Camp Swift.
[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:44.383]  Oh, so they're going to actually stay on Camp Swift?
[03:54:44.383 --> 03:54:46.685]  I mean, let's talk about unconventional warfare.
[03:54:46.685 --> 03:54:48.887]  I mean, and this is what they're saying they're training for.
[03:54:48.887 --> 03:54:51.950]  This is coming directly from my, you know, my Army site.
[03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:59.878]  Special forces have long employed the use of unconventional warfare in enemy territory, unlike direct action missions, which are generally designed to be quick strikes.
[03:54:59.878 --> 03:55:02.421]  Unconventional warfare operations can last months, even years.
[03:55:03.001 --> 03:55:04.722]  Unconventional warfare missions allow U.S.
[03:55:04.722 --> 03:55:09.684]  Army soldiers to enter a country covertly and build relationships with local militia.
[03:55:09.684 --> 03:55:15.806]  Meanwhile our government hates militia and we keep using people's property to do these training missions.
[03:55:15.806 --> 03:55:16.847]  Guess what?
[03:55:16.847 --> 03:55:18.868]  The majority of Americans are all for the military.
[03:55:19.708 --> 03:55:22.290]  They support the veterans, the troops, and all that.
[03:55:22.290 --> 03:55:23.271]  But here's my thing.
[03:55:23.271 --> 03:55:25.773]  The government's going around and buying up all this land.
[03:55:25.773 --> 03:55:27.214]  There's all these land grabs.
[03:55:27.214 --> 03:55:32.097]  I think the government has quite enough property to do their own training missions on.
[03:55:32.097 --> 03:55:38.682]  Why in the hell do they keep coming into places like this, where obviously there's an outcry, where especially in Bastrop, they see what's going on.
[03:55:38.682 --> 03:55:40.023]  They see the implications, like you said.
[03:55:41.906 --> 03:55:49.053]  There's these underlined meanings about what's going on and the words they use in their pamphlets, their handouts, their online slides.
[03:55:49.053 --> 03:55:51.316]  They really kind of have some disturbing meanings to it.
[03:55:51.316 --> 03:55:58.784]  Not saying there's going to be martial law, but you know, when they're talking about, you know, what is it, taking over the human domain, doing all this stuff.
[03:55:59.144 --> 03:56:02.347]  That's got some pretty sinister implications going on there.
[03:56:02.347 --> 03:56:10.373]  When they've already told you, hey, we don't want you here, and now the military operations are coming over, taking place in your town anyway, covertly.
[03:56:10.373 --> 03:56:14.797]  Yeah, I mean, you've got some judge and you've got all these people there saying, oh, well, I want it, so let's go in and have it.
[03:56:14.797 --> 03:56:15.077]  Right.
[03:56:15.077 --> 03:56:19.501]  What happened to people who were elected and put into position listening to the people who vote?
[03:56:20.001 --> 03:56:22.742]  You know, obviously those voters out there don't want that going on.
[03:56:22.742 --> 03:56:26.222]  You know, so I think that this is my take on it.
[03:56:26.222 --> 03:56:30.423]  Yeah, I think the government or the military should train for missions overseas, obviously.
[03:56:30.423 --> 03:56:31.063]  We need that.
[03:56:31.063 --> 03:56:34.064]  They used to do this Jade Helm mission overseas.
[03:56:34.064 --> 03:56:37.805]  But I think with a lot of the tension going on, that's why they felt they could come back here.
[03:56:37.805 --> 03:56:39.485]  But obviously people don't want that.
[03:56:39.485 --> 03:56:40.565]  But here's the thing.
[03:56:40.565 --> 03:56:42.726]  Our government has tons of land to use.
[03:56:42.726 --> 03:56:43.146]  Right.
[03:56:43.146 --> 03:56:44.866]  We're seeing BLM grabs every day.
[03:56:44.866 --> 03:56:47.067]  We see, I mean, you have to pay to go on land.
[03:56:47.947 --> 03:56:48.588]  Right.
[03:56:48.588 --> 03:56:50.429]  Nature costs money.
[03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:53.772]  Maybe they're thinking, oh see, nothing happened there with Jade Helm.
[03:56:53.772 --> 03:56:56.554]  And like we pointed out, that's not what it was about.
[03:56:56.554 --> 03:57:00.117]  It was mastering the human domain was much deeper than that.
[03:57:00.117 --> 03:57:02.158]  I implore you to go back and look at our report.
[03:57:02.158 --> 03:57:06.622]  If these guys want to train for Afghanistan or wherever, go to Fort Huachuca in Arizona.
[03:57:06.622 --> 03:57:09.524]  There's all kinds of private property you can't go on, and that's very mountainous.
[03:57:09.764 --> 03:57:10.664]  That's in Arizona.
[03:57:10.664 --> 03:57:11.805]  Go out there and train there.
[03:57:11.805 --> 03:57:12.605]  Go to El Paso.
[03:57:12.605 --> 03:57:14.386]  Move out to White Sands and do all that stuff.
[03:57:14.386 --> 03:57:15.607]  But don't be in people's backyards.
[03:57:15.607 --> 03:57:16.067]  Don't go in there.
[03:57:16.067 --> 03:57:17.508]  That scares the hell out of people.
[03:57:17.508 --> 03:57:21.129]  Especially in a town, or in a place like Texas, where guess what?
[03:57:21.129 --> 03:57:22.210]  I got a whole bunch of guns.
[03:57:22.210 --> 03:57:23.370]  We all got guns.
[03:57:23.370 --> 03:57:24.991]  What happens with a gun?
[03:57:24.991 --> 03:57:26.232]  You use a gun for self-defense.
[03:57:26.232 --> 03:57:28.453]  It's not to go out and run a gun and shoot stuff up.
[03:57:28.453 --> 03:57:32.815]  It's if you feel threatened and you're on your property and someone's sneaking through it, it's to defend yourself.
[03:57:32.815 --> 03:57:35.536]  You got a baby in there, you're going to go into that safety mode.
[03:57:35.896 --> 03:57:41.057]  So if you've got a whole bunch of special ops guys jumping out of planes and helicopters rolling through, people are going to get scared.
[03:57:41.057 --> 03:57:42.597]  And they're not going to know what's going on.
[03:57:42.597 --> 03:57:45.018]  Especially in a lot of these backwoods towns where they don't get the news.
[03:57:45.018 --> 03:57:53.640]  Well, look what happened when they fired the test, the nuclear test missile right there in LA at like high time for everyone to see it.
[03:57:53.640 --> 03:57:56.260]  They didn't tell anyone about it and they were completely freaked out.
[03:57:56.260 --> 03:57:59.301]  Our government's pushing down World War III down our throats.
[03:57:59.301 --> 03:58:01.641]  Complete and total, you know, we're about to get killed by ISIS.
[03:58:01.641 --> 03:58:02.242]  People are scared.
[03:58:02.242 --> 03:58:03.082]  People are worried.
[03:58:03.082 --> 03:58:04.122]  So that's what people have to look at.
[03:58:04.693 --> 03:58:05.193]  Right.
[03:58:05.193 --> 03:58:06.193]  No, that's absolutely true.
[03:58:06.193 --> 03:58:20.297]  And they're definitely kind of gearing up for something and getting people used to these unconventional warfare exercises taking place in these tiny towns, launching nuclear test missiles off the coast of LA and Florida.
[03:58:20.297 --> 03:58:29.179]  So, I mean, they're definitely gearing us up, getting us ready for World War III, whatever our... Hey, happy Veterans Day and happy birthday to the Marine Corps and everybody else out there.
[03:58:29.179 --> 03:58:29.799]  You guys are awesome.
[03:58:30.595 --> 03:58:34.587]  We'll see you on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight at 7 p.m.
[03:58:34.587 --> 03:58:35.751]  Central with David Knight.
