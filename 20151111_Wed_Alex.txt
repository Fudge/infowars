[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:33.760]  if you look at photos of Hillary Clinton she is clearly ill and is deteriorating
[00:33.760 --> 00:40.360]  very very quickly and does not look like someone who should even be working much
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.960]  less at close to 70 years of age attempting to be the leader of a
[00:44.960 --> 00:50.120]  supposed free world but if you go to drudgerport.com you can see the latest
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.320]  images of her on the campaign trail and then comparisons of her just a few
[00:55.320 --> 01:02.000]  years ago looking completely insane looking completely whacked out of her
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.800]  brain all those high-tech drugs they've got we know the Clintons are huge drug
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.720]  heads they're party animals and they're also into desecrating America they love
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.600]  putting Mao and Stalin and linen Christmas ornaments on the tree that's
[01:16.600 --> 01:19.560]  been confirmed people say what's the point of that that's just kind of silly
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.840]  and stupid it's about desecrating I tuned into local radio this morning two
[01:24.840 --> 01:29.960]  different shock jock stations I just happened to be tuned to the dial and I
[01:29.960 --> 01:34.680]  both channels were bad-mouthing Christians and saying they were insane
[01:34.680 --> 01:41.720]  that there was no war on Christmas and that Starbucks wasn't removing the just
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.560]  Christmas symbols not even Christian ones but winter festival symbols like
[01:45.560 --> 01:51.160]  snowflakes and Christmas trees tan and bombs from their cups because of
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.760]  political correctness the company admitted they did it to be quote more
[01:54.760 --> 02:07.320]  inclusive I mean Starbucks admittedly has these programs where they ask you you
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.880]  know why you're a racist is your white or how many black people have you talked
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.640]  to today to inject racial division but I was tuning in not just the MSNBC which
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.080]  we know puts up a talking point but I was listening to local radio and both
[02:20.080 --> 02:25.360]  shows within about five minutes only listened for about 10 or 15 both of
[02:25.360 --> 02:31.600]  them cited MSNBC and we're playing clips of it that's how unified these people
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.640]  are in their propaganda even local radio laughing going there's no war on
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.480]  Christians no the UN just admits that they're murdering Christians by the
[02:41.480 --> 02:45.680]  hundreds of thousands a year worldwide and that there's more persecution of
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.640]  Christians than all other groups combined and they're taking crosses down
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.400]  everywhere and they're harassing churches and they are harassing Christians
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.520]  in school saying they have no free speech and that you can't thank God
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.000]  during your valor Victorian speech even though that's your free speech
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.440]  separation of church and state is the school doesn't have an official
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.600]  religion if it's public but you can say whatever you want during open discussion
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.080]  time and now that extends to the Missouri school system college system
[03:17.080 --> 03:22.200]  where you've got professors running around screaming saying no press no
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.840]  photos in the middle of the commons out on a green grass park in the middle of
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.040]  the college we control the area get me muscle run these people down and then
[03:32.040 --> 03:39.360]  you see reporters being run down by a mob of cultists and that's who these
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.200]  people are oh but there's no war on free speech at the colleges they're just
[03:43.200 --> 03:48.480]  shredding constitutions it colleges all over the country if they find them if
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.200]  they find you handing them out and you're even a student there you're
[03:52.200 --> 03:57.040]  arrested you can hand out anything else you want but the founding document that
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.440]  those police officers have sworn enough to that's how whacked out and upside
[04:01.440 --> 04:07.520]  down this is now the supposed professor that you called in the muscle and was
[04:07.520 --> 04:13.960]  directing the folks running people over she ran a stunt no thing in the public
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.000]  stupid yesterday and resigned as media coordinator in the journalism department
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.960]  that's an unpaid position to nanny state and control speech is only reason she
[04:23.960 --> 04:28.040]  was part of it we're investigating her right now she's exactly what she we
[04:28.040 --> 04:33.080]  thought she'd be she stills a fully paid professor there and did not resign from
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.080]  sucking money off of the partially state-funded University so the parasite
[04:38.080 --> 04:43.480]  is fully burrowed in enjoying a blood meal of taxpayer money while trying to
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.600]  annihilate free speech and create a commissariat within the school that's
[04:48.600 --> 04:53.080]  what she's doing but that's my view on this creature all right it's all coming

[08:15.560 --> 08:29.080]  gcn radio network well when it comes to news I am overloaded I am like a
[08:29.080 --> 08:34.080]  hungry junkyard dog that hadn't eaten in a week that has been thrown in the
[08:34.080 --> 08:41.240]  middle of a butcher shop there are just every conceivable cutlet of meat hanging
[08:41.240 --> 08:47.000]  and on tables piled up to the ceiling I don't even know what to chomp into first
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.320]  this is incredible we have major general Albert stubble bind former head of
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.800]  special forces former head of army intelligence and dr. rima labo joining
[08:56.800 --> 09:01.760]  us the general has been signaling the alarm along with his medical doctor
[09:01.760 --> 09:07.360]  wife that the mass culling and the cutoff of resources worldwide that will
[09:07.360 --> 09:12.320]  cause a systemic collapse of civilization and billions to starve to death in
[09:12.320 --> 09:19.120]  the next decade has begun and I concur with their analysis so that is coming
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.320]  up Anthony Uchiarty will be hosting the fourth hour we've added of overdrive
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.880]  because there's so much breaking news and things unfolding so again thank you
[09:27.880 --> 09:40.280]  so much for joining us on this Wednesday the 11th day of November 2015 that said
[09:40.280 --> 09:44.840]  when I talk about information overload amazing debates last night I've got to
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.840]  say Rand Paul really shined last night and not because I'm a Paul supporter and
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.960]  friends with him and know he's for real I've been a critic of him not being more
[09:53.960 --> 10:02.160]  hardcore more aggressive his father of course was on last week but what I'm
[10:02.160 --> 10:05.600]  getting at is I don't get up here and say he did a great job in debates just to
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.040]  say it the last few debates he did okay he did really good last night and I have
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.160]  to say was probably one of the winners a couple people did well but I watched our
[10:15.160 --> 10:20.200]  live coverage and analysis with our crew last night breaking it down and I think
[10:20.200 --> 10:24.680]  their points were spot-on and much better analysis than what we saw from
[10:24.680 --> 10:29.840]  mainstream media in the aftermath last night in fact that they were all up here
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.280]  till about midnight but I'm encouraging them as soon as they can to add it down
[10:33.280 --> 10:37.680]  some of the highlights of their commentary on the debate and they are
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.040]  able to do it today or today of not tomorrow or probably on the nightly
[10:41.040 --> 10:48.800]  news tonight 7 o'clock central so we got that to deal with the situation in the
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.160]  Missouri state system has just intensified and we knew there'd be no
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.560]  end it turns out the main agitator with the hunger strike that obviously is fake
[10:58.560 --> 11:02.960]  in my view watching it because over several weeks he didn't lose any weight
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.840]  I've gone back and looked at the videos it turns out his father alone makes 8
[11:07.840 --> 11:13.240]  million dollars a year the family's worth more than 20 million dollars a year
[11:13.240 --> 11:17.880]  he himself is very wealthy and they are jacked into the inside and of course
[11:17.880 --> 11:22.640]  they are you know who's big in the railroads that's right I looked it up this
[11:22.640 --> 11:25.400]  morning I meant to go give it to Kit Daniels when I walked in there I forgot
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.160]  I'd send him to Missouri with Jacarie Jackson they'll be on it 130 today to
[11:29.160 --> 11:36.000]  report as well I'm still double checking it but it appears the railroad is part
[11:36.000 --> 11:43.640]  Soros owned so it looks like we may have another Soros operative it of course it
[11:43.640 --> 11:47.560]  is I mean every time we turn around that's what it is once you figure this
[11:47.560 --> 11:53.680]  stuff out you've got to just be sure not to rely on the fact that they're so
[11:53.680 --> 12:03.040]  Pavlovian they're so OCD they're so predictable they're so methodical in how
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.920]  they operate that nine times out of ten it's the exact same players the exact
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.160]  same playbook and it's totally predictable every once in a while they
[12:11.160 --> 12:14.760]  zig when they zag and you don't want to get sucker punched when they do a
[12:14.760 --> 12:18.880]  football handoff or a fake handoff and the quarterback runs it up the middle
[12:18.880 --> 12:26.200]  that said usual suspects it just never ends when you're screwing over all the
[12:26.200 --> 12:29.880]  students and their degrees are going to be pretty much worthless on average about
[12:29.880 --> 12:34.680]  80 percent are worthless that is you're not going to get more money out of the
[12:34.680 --> 12:38.880]  degree than what you spent on it but it feels good I was talking to the Texas
[12:38.880 --> 12:44.800]  monthly editor one time and they said yeah what we get is we get editor ships
[12:44.800 --> 12:50.800]  associate editor ships but we don't get money when they cut our pay we we get
[12:50.800 --> 12:58.240]  titles and it's the same thing when they're fleecing you with an extra
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.080]  worthless degrees because the country's been totally shut down by design when
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.200]  black unemployment doubles in just six and a half years what are you going to
[13:06.200 --> 13:13.000]  give folks well racial identity chips on the shoulder and divert the young white
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.600]  students black students doesn't matter divert them all into in fighting with
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.920]  each other and I know that's 101 but that's what's going on listen to these
[13:24.920 --> 13:29.840]  headlines and then I'm going to go into them info wars comm kit Daniels from
[13:29.840 --> 13:36.560]  Missouri State headquarters PC police label Thomas Jefferson statue racist
[13:36.560 --> 13:43.800]  and sexist feminist hashtag black lives matter protesters want Jefferson statue
[13:43.800 --> 13:47.480]  removed or you guessed it the football team is not going to play and all the
[13:47.480 --> 13:53.160]  rest of it and then that won't stop because that's their identity they're
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.400]  getting a degree in pity parties they're getting a degree in being ignorant
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.800]  they're getting a degree in not knowing Thomas Jefferson fought to ban slavery
[14:01.800 --> 14:07.600]  in the Declaration of Independence they go buddy had slaves yeah and when he
[14:07.600 --> 14:14.920]  freed them they wouldn't leave because slavery went from basically family to
[14:14.920 --> 14:19.040]  people being beaten and polls and totally you know murdered but there was a
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.280]  whole spectrum of it and Jefferson represented the reform of it that was
[14:23.280 --> 14:26.360]  the time they lived in you don't hear the black activists bitching and
[14:26.360 --> 14:33.760]  complaining about slavery going on in at least five African countries today or
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.840]  they'll say oh well that's African culture in those areas yeah I know do you
[14:39.840 --> 14:44.560]  blame Africans in other countries for it do you blame black people for it
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.600]  they're not the ones doing it you can't blame me for white slavery for whites
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.040]  having slaves anymore you can blame me for true white slavery which is sex
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.360]  slavery the politically correct people are so ignorant every time I talk about
[14:58.360 --> 15:02.760]  nine core Halliburton or the UN caught in white slavery they send me emails or I
[15:02.760 --> 15:07.440]  see comments going why aren't you worried about black slavery racist white
[15:07.440 --> 15:13.440]  slavery is a thousand-year-old European term for soft slavery meaning sex
[15:13.440 --> 15:21.720]  slavery of women that's the European English translation of it it had other
[15:21.720 --> 15:32.800]  terms in the Arab world but basically was known as soft slavery women in what
[15:32.800 --> 15:38.120]  was the term they used in the Middle East and in Arab cultures harems harems
[15:38.120 --> 15:46.080]  and Saudi Arabia still has harems of slave women American women of every
[15:46.080 --> 15:50.360]  race color and creed will be dumb enough to go over there and then get in a one
[15:50.360 --> 15:53.680]  of these palaces with one of these princes there's thousands of them and
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.680]  they never get out again and the State Department doesn't do anything to try to
[15:57.680 --> 16:01.280]  help you but see you're not gonna hear Gloria Steinem talk about American
[16:01.280 --> 16:08.480]  women who are kept for life and raped and they have children and everything
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.240]  else you're not gonna hear one stinking word out of Sumner Redstone and MTV and
[16:13.240 --> 16:17.000]  Viacom you're not gonna hear one stinking word out of the New York Times not
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.120]  one stinking word out of MSNBC not one stinking word out of CNN and Anderson
[16:23.120 --> 16:26.800]  Cooper of the Central Intelligence Agency
[16:26.800 --> 16:31.120]  you're not gonna hear anything
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.240]  because it's all about bashing the Magna Carta and the Constitution the Bill
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.800]  of Rights the Declaration of Independence the Enlightenment the Renaissance the
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.640]  the freedom of the world the West we could at least recognize we were
[16:46.640 --> 16:51.560]  barbarians we could recognize slavery was wrong we could recognize that
[16:51.560 --> 16:54.280]  corruption in the church was wrong saying the earth was the center of the
[16:54.280 --> 17:03.360]  universe the West was the best and now it's committing suicide by design from
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.920]  Spain to Germany from the United Kingdom it's killing itself look at these
[17:08.920 --> 17:16.960]  headlines Germany to spend 22.6 billion to accept refugees in 2015 now get
[17:16.960 --> 17:21.080]  ready a few weeks ago they ordered all over in different governorships the
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.240]  public school kids elementary and up to go make beds run things pamper and
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.040]  clean the facilities for the illegals I said that'll be part of national service
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.280]  ladies and gentlemen their speaker Bill than others are now endorsing a
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.320]  government plan our story is linked up on drudgereport.com
[17:38.320 --> 17:44.080]  politician calls for compulsory labor to force Germans to service migrants

[26:29.160 --> 26:34.080]  brings up the fact that his father's tied into Soros and tied into Buffett the
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.520]  usual suspects through their foundations funding the Black Lives Matter go after
[26:38.520 --> 26:45.640]  the cops crap sick of these people George Soros is running around on record

[27:03.240 --> 27:06.960]  them and the fluoride targeting them black people are targeted and it's by
[27:06.960 --> 27:13.200]  fake liberals like Margaret Sanger and George Soros and don't forget Warren
[27:13.200 --> 27:19.000]  Buffett who heads up the eugenics program worldwide with Bill Gates but Bill
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.760]  Gates is very liberal and loves you and has all those inoculations for Africans
[27:23.760 --> 27:30.280]  and he's helping fund and support groups as well and that's why CNN ABC news NBC

[30:04.360 --> 30:08.960]  the country on a migrant boat last month German media reports according to
[30:08.960 --> 30:13.880]  NTV the arrest of the Tunisian born suspect who was sentenced to seven years
[30:13.880 --> 30:18.280]  in 2007 for plotting multiple terror attacks was initially hidden by
[30:18.280 --> 30:23.520]  authorities over fears that it would stop panic the suspect who was arrested
[30:23.520 --> 30:28.080]  at sea while traveling with more than 200 migrants told police he was seeking
[30:28.080 --> 30:33.080]  asylum in Europe in order to escape persecution after providing a false name
[30:33.080 --> 30:38.360]  following several days of interrogation by police the suspect was deported back
[30:38.360 --> 30:42.920]  to Tunisia and handed over to local authorities as noted by the independent
[30:42.920 --> 30:47.280]  the alleged attempt to cover up the arrest was likely rooted in the Italian
[30:47.280 --> 30:51.640]  interior ministers claim that there was no evidence that Islamic terrorists were

[35:53.440 --> 35:57.760]  also wrote the John Carter novels the movie was okay the novels are good where
[35:57.760 --> 36:00.840]  there's this advanced alien humanoid species that actually wants to destroy
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.080]  planets and suck them dry and it puts governments in charge that'll actually
[36:05.080 --> 36:10.160]  put policies in place to lose their atmospheres but to do it slow enough
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.840]  where they never wake up to it it's almost like it's almost like it's true
[36:14.840 --> 36:24.080]  or something NASA does say we are losing our atmosphere from the Sun and from the
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.600]  winds of space and their answer is in the carbon cycle that is replenishing our
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.440]  atmosphere not as fast as we lose it in fact the word is the Earth being studied
[36:36.440 --> 36:41.120]  by a lot most mainline scientists and the cruise is googling what I say as I
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.320]  say it when they're finding you know mainstream news admitting it that the
[36:45.320 --> 36:48.920]  earth is basically dying right now I mean it won't happen in our lifetimes
[36:48.920 --> 36:51.320]  won't happen in the next probably a hundred thousand years maybe million
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.640]  years maybe half billion years who knows we just know the atmospheres the
[36:55.640 --> 37:06.960]  thinnest ever recorded and as soon as the VOC patents ran out in the 70s they
[37:06.960 --> 37:11.640]  had global conventions in the next decade by the mid 80s to phase out those
[37:11.640 --> 37:17.840]  and adopt all the new refrigerants and coolants that were patented oh and those
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.280]  patents are gonna go up in a few years and I'm afraid they're gonna be banned
[37:21.280 --> 37:28.240]  too but don't worry you can buy whole new refrigeration systems and air
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.080]  conditioning systems again that don't work as well they told you they those
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.440]  chemicals were eating up the ozone layer which most scientists agree during
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.640]  certain months of the year always becomes thin at the poles but they weren't
[37:44.640 --> 37:48.440]  ever worried about detonating hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere that did
[37:48.440 --> 37:56.400]  blow holes in the atmosphere and did off gas our atmosphere into space in
[37:56.400 --> 38:02.280]  attempts in the 50s 60s and 70s before the International Treaty to blow a hole
[38:02.280 --> 38:07.800]  in the Van Allen radiation belt so spacecraft could escape the radiation
[38:07.800 --> 38:15.960]  field then people conjecture well how do we go to the Van Allen radiation belt to
[38:15.960 --> 38:22.040]  begin with well the answer is they had them turn around the craft facing it
[38:22.040 --> 38:30.040]  and get behind the water tanks and they did get radiated because I've
[38:30.040 --> 38:33.040]  interviewed the people I've had dinner with some of the people that were on
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.760]  those crafts they went there but they start laughing and say you're dead on
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.160]  they're not allowed to tell folks what they had then or that people had gone
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.040]  before them you don't just think NASA sent people out there for those
[38:45.040 --> 38:49.080]  televised events before they sent military astronauts up there right you
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.960]  know there's a lot of dead astronauts out there thousands have died in the
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.040]  space program but most of those on the ground that is on the earth testing
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.440]  things thousands and I was told that by high-level astronauts and I've told other
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.720]  astronauts that and they are amazed I know it and then start spilling their
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.880]  guts like Buzz Aldrin did on the show about things that he'd never said before
[39:10.880 --> 39:16.320]  or never said since I'm not bragging it's just when I mention these things it's
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.680]  so wild I can't even believe it Buzz Aldrin told me they discovered water in
[39:20.680 --> 39:23.800]  the next six months that India was going to crash a probe that the NASA had told
[39:23.800 --> 39:26.440]  them were to crash it and they had discovered the water there when they
[39:26.440 --> 39:31.920]  were on the moon but it was classified and then six months later as he said it
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.560]  was declassified and he was laughing about it of course they didn't say that
[39:35.560 --> 39:42.680]  the US had found it they said India did I mean that is just crazy let me get
[39:42.680 --> 39:48.440]  back to the news though so the Missouri State hunger strike striker who started
[39:48.440 --> 39:55.320]  all this claims he's oppressed rips white privilege comes from wealthy family
[39:55.320 --> 40:02.400]  worth 20 million dad made 8 million last year and works for you guessed it he
[40:02.400 --> 40:09.080]  works for George Soros and he works for Warren Buffett that's who he's
[40:09.080 --> 40:14.600]  connected to now it's not direct where you get 34 million 33 million dollars
[40:14.600 --> 40:18.440]  just in Ferguson alone to stir stuff up and again the cops were shooting our
[40:18.440 --> 40:22.600]  reporters were over bullets they were acting like jerks there's a lot of
[40:22.600 --> 40:26.560]  arrogance by police and government there's problems we agree we try to
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.480]  reform it but when the government itself and foreign interests like George
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.960]  Soros start trying to make it the number one issue it's to stir up social
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.400]  calamity and social classes in this country which will then be used to bully
[40:39.400 --> 40:43.800]  local jurisdictions into becoming federalized and that's what the feds
[40:43.800 --> 40:46.600]  are coming in now in the White House praising the students saying you're
[40:46.600 --> 40:50.320]  right the chancellor and the president resigning who are big liberals isn't
[40:50.320 --> 40:53.040]  enough we're gonna take down Thomas Jefferson we're gonna help you file
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.040]  lawsuits we're just gonna come in and take over and anytime you don't do what
[40:59.040 --> 41:02.360]  the globalists say they'll just activate their political operatives their
[41:02.360 --> 41:11.040]  community organizers and boom you know somebody will draw a swastika in the
[41:11.040 --> 41:14.720]  bathroom and it's over everybody's got a resign because it's your fault you're a
[41:14.720 --> 41:21.080]  white chancellor you're a white president somebody drew on the bathroom wall how
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.560]  much you want to bet how much you want to bet like the other 99% of the time
[41:26.560 --> 41:33.320]  this was staged that you just search engine woman put swastika on her own
[41:33.320 --> 41:40.000]  dorm room door or member of Jewish fraternity caught putting swastika on I
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.520]  mean I've seen that headline let's not exaggerate in 21 years on air probably
[41:44.520 --> 41:51.560]  a couple hundred times black student caught burning cross in parents'
[41:51.560 --> 41:58.320]  front yard black student caught setting fire to black church Jewish man arrested
[41:58.320 --> 42:05.440]  after posting swastika on doors one in telegraph on and on and on and on and on
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.160]  and on and on and on and on and it's not just minorities that do it every time
[42:11.160 --> 42:16.560]  some white woman goes five black guys rape me in the street and cars you know
[42:16.560 --> 42:22.200]  cracker on my back the police go check it or their background to find out they're
[42:22.200 --> 42:26.400]  completely mentally ill that make false reports constantly and almost every time
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.160]  that's made up to it's just this is what goes on people black Florida man burns
[42:31.160 --> 42:39.440]  crossing own driveway yep there's another headline on and on and on but you get to
[42:39.440 --> 42:42.920]  be a big star get to be on the news get to hunger strike seems like you gain
[42:42.920 --> 42:46.920]  weight under the hunger strike it's like the UT professor that said he was
[42:46.920 --> 42:51.280]  resigning because they were gonna allow guns on campus they were already allowed
[42:51.280 --> 42:57.800]  it's just open carry now because he'll carry you name it it's passing all over
[42:57.800 --> 43:01.960]  the country he quote resigned and then I was talking to a high-level UT
[43:01.960 --> 43:04.920]  professor he said look it up look up this tenure page it's still up and I
[43:04.920 --> 43:07.920]  wouldn't look to do an article we never did I went looked it up that night I
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.960]  was at a pool party barbecue party this guy's a big sports lawyer I'll leave it
[43:12.960 --> 43:19.400]  at that negotiate some of the major major sports deals you know of both NFL
[43:19.400 --> 43:27.000]  level ends college level but I just NFL and I went and looked it up and sure
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.440]  enough that guy has sat on there months before that this was his last semester
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.280]  coming up this Christmas this this holiday season see how they get us to use
[43:37.280 --> 43:41.320]  their words and then pretty soon we can't even have speech see I mean actually
[43:41.320 --> 43:49.240]  one to say holiday to be inclusive it's Christmas it's what it is and it was all
[43:49.240 --> 43:52.480]  staged it's just it's what these people do it's like this UT professor said he
[43:52.480 --> 43:54.960]  was gonna live in a dumpster to teach us how to not have anything and live under
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.080]  austerity so the elite can have more and it turns out he doesn't live in the
[43:58.080 --> 44:01.480]  dumpster we sent reporters out there three times he was never there and then he
[44:01.480 --> 44:08.040]  admitted later oh I just come into photo ops at the dumpster it's all fake and
[44:08.040 --> 44:13.080]  these people are fascist I've met them I know them I've been at dinner with them
[44:13.080 --> 44:18.000]  and they'll go off record and almost every time they'll say you just don't
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.840]  you want to just kill all the minorities they're total scum and I'll say and it
[44:21.840 --> 44:24.760]  could be black people saying this and I've had black leaders on who go yeah
[44:24.760 --> 44:29.520]  I've been given that speech many times and and maybe and I'll say listen you're
[44:29.520 --> 44:33.480]  trying to get me to say I'm racist I'm not I'm not for killing black people I'm
[44:33.480 --> 44:38.880]  for empowering everybody oh whatever blacks just can't make it need to be
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.520]  dealt with and controlled and then these are the people running their
[44:42.520 --> 44:45.160]  communities that keep them in the position they're in you're looking at
[44:45.160 --> 44:53.320]  actual slave masters I mean look at this guy's dad makes 8 million a year this
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.440]  guy you know I've seen that the pro-abortionist devil worshipers who
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.560]  say their devil worshipers they pull up and brand new $80,000 Jaguars and and
[45:03.560 --> 45:10.320]  brand new ZF1 or whatever they are Corvettes and you're just like and
[45:10.320 --> 45:15.240]  they're wearing Rolexes and they're screaming about class privilege with
[45:15.240 --> 45:21.960]  Mao on their arms but what you've got to understand we've tracked these people
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.840]  we've been doing an investigative report on them for a while that's why I can say
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.000]  it now this word pretty much done we went to their meetings and managed city
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.440]  council its major corporations they are setting up all the review boards they're
[45:33.440 --> 45:38.160]  putting people like that on boards that will run the town and that's what these
[45:38.160 --> 45:41.920]  community organizers are they're going to put these people on the police
[45:41.920 --> 45:46.800]  advisory board they have people from the police advisory board at the
[45:46.800 --> 45:51.520]  communist meetings where they got communist gabbling at public meetings
[45:51.520 --> 45:56.040]  at UT with professors leading communist quorums and they're all being promised
[45:56.040 --> 46:00.640]  command bases takeover of government it's all about money they don't want to
[46:00.640 --> 46:04.360]  make money building a better widget or designing something or working hard in
[46:04.360 --> 46:10.880]  the company they're gonna rule us they go to college to rule they don't actually
[46:10.880 --> 46:14.440]  get freaked out by Halloween costumes they don't actually get freaked out by
[46:14.440 --> 46:20.040]  Thomas Jefferson that is the controllers don't the commas are students and they
[46:20.040 --> 46:24.240]  go out to these mindless TV head white kids mainly who you see in these videos
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.200]  who actually look freaked out and go you're racist unless you do everything I
[46:28.200 --> 46:34.920]  say and these white kids salute and go yes sir and you see the white female
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.760]  professors behind them commanding and laughing in their body language I mean
[46:38.760 --> 46:45.960]  they're like witches they're they're wicked they know what they're doing how
[46:45.960 --> 46:49.680]  do you cover up killing half the black people how do you cover up sterilizing
[46:49.680 --> 46:53.160]  women how do you cover up all the fluoride in the water you act like you're
[46:53.160 --> 46:56.760]  liberal and run around saying you want to quality and care about everybody and
[46:56.760 --> 47:02.280]  everybody fighting with each other and stirred up you know Marco Rubio is a good
[47:02.280 --> 47:07.480]  person mobile oh well that's that's racist or you know MSNBC or Paul Ryan's
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.840]  a really hard worker now excuse me no one can be a hard worker but black slaves
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.800]  in America that is a slight at black slaves and the Hispanic guys like excuse
[47:16.800 --> 47:20.360]  me what he says yes it is the whole table agrees with her they go that's
[47:20.360 --> 47:25.320]  right it's racist to say anyone ever was a hard worker if a white guy wins a
[47:25.320 --> 47:29.280]  pole vaulting deal and they say man he's got a lot of stamina it's just it's
[47:29.280 --> 47:34.600]  putting down black people it's learning to equate everything with how you've
[47:34.600 --> 47:42.000]  been racially slided so you are a mental patient basket case drooling neurotic
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.960]  panic attack driven mess and again they've instituted a cultural revolution
[47:48.960 --> 47:55.360]  twice at my cousin's party because part of it was out in public at a restaurant
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.440]  bar I had people come over about my captain's hat and say are you a Nazi I
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.240]  be left with no really don't like that I'd say well you can get out of my face
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.440]  with your political correct mind control garbage and then they all groveling get
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.040]  upset oh yeah there's not 15 people now to bully me and there was I wasn't
[48:14.040 --> 48:18.200]  saying this obviously you know I'd love to hammer the heads in a 15 people
[48:18.200 --> 48:21.560]  trying to back me off I'm not bragging that that's just when I wake up is when
[48:21.560 --> 48:27.920]  the whole mob of scum wants to take me on it's clobbering time at that point I'm
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.120]  just sick of these bullies I'm sick of their garbage and now Germany to spend
[48:32.120 --> 48:36.600]  22 billion to accept refugees this year alone and they're gonna have compulsory
[48:36.600 --> 48:46.440]  service to quote serve the migrants all run by Goldman Sachs all run by the
[48:46.440 --> 48:53.800]  mega banks all breaking our will increasing your power prices so this is
[48:53.800 --> 48:57.720]  all coming up I'm gonna go to break and come back we're gonna get into some
[48:57.720 --> 49:01.080]  hardcore mass culling next hour I've got a bunch of clips that we're gonna be
[49:01.080 --> 49:07.240]  going over from the debate last night the RNC debate the Fox business channel
[49:07.240 --> 49:13.560]  debate that is coming up as well but we have a new product and it's living
[49:13.560 --> 49:18.520]  defense and it's a whole bunch of organic compounds like wildcrafted black
[49:18.520 --> 49:27.040]  walnut organic clove I'm not gonna read all the things that's in this but this
[49:27.040 --> 49:33.880]  is the known harmful organism remover and there's so many parasites out there
[49:33.880 --> 49:37.480]  I'm not claiming every parasite the point is both people don't know that
[49:37.480 --> 49:42.800]  nine out of ten people have parasites and this is what I personally am doing
[49:42.800 --> 49:46.480]  right now to flush my system just to be safe and I'm also given to my children
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.640]  and this stuff is so incredibly good for you if you read what the ingredients
[49:50.640 --> 49:56.720]  are and best of all you're taking care of yourself and your own body but you're
[49:56.720 --> 50:04.520]  also funding the vicious aggressive spear of truth being plunged mercilessly
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.200]  into the giant goblin belly of the New World Order and I'm willing to get up
[50:09.200 --> 50:13.720]  close and actually smell this beast but you're you're right beside us and right
[50:13.720 --> 50:16.760]  behind us and at the core of what we're doing funding our operation but I do have
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.240]  to get close to the goblin creatures it is not enjoyable to look upon them and
[50:21.240 --> 50:27.560]  to study them but it must be done and so you're helping fund and forge weapons
[50:27.560 --> 50:30.920]  in the info war reporters investigative journalists you name it to go out in
[50:30.920 --> 50:38.200]  chronicle it was I alone is chronicler that will tell their story so it's key
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.400]  ladies and gentlemen that you go to info wars life calm and get living
[50:43.400 --> 50:47.000]  defense today at current sales it'll sell out about five six days is our
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.120]  introduction of it we always do a limited run test a bunch of other
[50:50.120 --> 50:55.720]  specials running right now as well at info wars life calm be sure and check
[50:55.720 --> 50:58.400]  those out
[51:00.680 --> 51:06.440]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us
[51:06.440 --> 51:10.440]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[51:10.440 --> 51:13.600]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[51:13.600 --> 51:17.880]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[51:17.880 --> 51:22.120]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[51:22.120 --> 51:26.160]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[51:26.160 --> 51:30.640]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[51:30.640 --> 51:34.520]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[51:34.520 --> 51:38.600]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[51:38.600 --> 51:43.560]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to fortress
[51:43.560 --> 51:47.960]  clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot com has the answers to your heat
[51:47.960 --> 51:53.360]  storage dilemma don't get stuck in the cold fortress clothing dot com you'll

[55:00.680 --> 55:08.080]  have the light in the dark of the night but what do you make of the incredible
[55:08.080 --> 55:22.040]  announcement that Germany is to spend some 22.6 billion to accept refugees in
[55:22.040 --> 55:29.720]  2015 based on the assumption that 1.1 million will be free and will flee into
[55:29.720 --> 55:33.920]  Germany on top of those that are already there
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.560]  continuing politicians call for compulsory labor to force Germans to
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.200]  service migrants university graduates will face mandatory year of service
[55:43.200 --> 55:46.760]  remember when he was the White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel wanted that
[55:46.760 --> 55:52.000]  he said that on C-SPAN and on Good Morning America you name it so so this is
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.360]  this is classic communism a German parliament member has called for the
[55:56.360 --> 56:00.040]  introduction of compulsory labor program that's quote under which young
[56:00.040 --> 56:04.800]  Germans would be forced to spend a year in service to migrants focus.d
[56:04.800 --> 56:11.080]  reports CDU MP Eckhart Reiberg provoked heated discussion when he
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.240]  suggested that Germany's inability to cope with the migrant influx could be
[56:15.240 --> 56:19.000]  solved by making university graduates commit a year of service yeah that means
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.960]  being brainwashed to accept it as well so there you go and now they want to take
[56:24.960 --> 56:30.920]  down Thomas Jefferson at the Missouri University and we're gonna have our
[56:30.920 --> 56:39.240]  reporters coming up in the last 30 minutes the third hour reporting from the

[56:43.920 --> 56:50.080]  have been cancelled isn't that archetypally proper that it's about
[56:50.080 --> 56:54.160]  canceling education it's about canceling the open free discussion of ideas isn't
[56:54.160 --> 56:57.080]  that what political correctness goes to begin with is the end of the university
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.440]  system as we know it the end of the industrialized age the end of the
[57:01.440 --> 57:05.520]  Renaissance isn't it fitting I think they should have a holiday every year
[57:05.520 --> 57:12.240]  where they shut it down for a week and celebrate ignorance celebrate mindlessness
[57:12.240 --> 57:20.360]  celebrate idiocy celebrate having chips on your shoulder meanwhile Jeb Bush and

[57:31.240 --> 57:34.800]  of the Rings star and listener of the show he's been on as a guest Vigo
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.400]  Mortensen comes out and said that Bernie Sanders is just as bad as Hillary or the
[57:39.400 --> 57:48.440]  rest of them and just as hawks hawkish he supported major funding efforts for
[57:48.440 --> 57:51.800]  the Iraq and Afghanistan wars that's why I like Vigo Mortensen is he's
[57:51.800 --> 57:55.760]  actually informed and educated and understands the controlled left is
[57:55.760 --> 58:01.360]  just that control we'll try to get him back on the show I was really flattered
[58:01.360 --> 58:06.760]  learn he's a almost daily listener it's crazy that's just one of the big
[58:06.760 --> 58:11.160]  Hollywood stars that'll actually come on the most of them are totally afraid but
[58:11.160 --> 58:14.360]  Vigo Mortensen is a true artist I mean his movies are so good I tell you the
[58:14.360 --> 58:17.920]  road I've only watched it once and I just can't make myself watch it again it
[58:17.920 --> 58:21.560]  was so horrifying that's the scariest movie I've ever seen because it's so real
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.320]  it's so close to what could happen under a whole bunch of different scenarios

[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.000]  coming up in the next segment Major General Albert Stubblebine and his
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.160]  medical doctor wife Rena Lebo will be joining us to break down why they
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.360]  believe the great culling of the human population has begun and I mentioned this
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:58.120]  Sunday this London Guardian article from Saturday November 7th a few days ago
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.520]  artificial intelligence homo sapiens will be split into a handful of gods and
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:10.440]  then the rest of us and that's covered in my film in-game blueprint for global
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:16.560]  enslavement made eight years ago I don't believe this is what's actually going
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.800]  to happen but this is what the elite actually believes this is what world
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:26.880]  government is really all about so they may not become gods or what compared to
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.240]  us you could call a god for all intents and purposes eternal creatures self
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:40.040]  replicating but they're certainly trying to take over the planet and dominate
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.160]  science and technology and control our development or stop our development so
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.400]  that's coming up and then meanwhile Justice Department to take fight over
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.800]  Obama immigration order to Supreme Court reviews sought of ruling that block
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.360]  plans to defer deportations of more than four million people multiple federal
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.800]  judges have said no and state judges as well you just can't have illegals and
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.320]  then just give them everything free and just keep them here outside of law
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.920]  nobody can do that we have one of the most lax immigration policies in the
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.200]  world it's very hard though we try to do it legally you just come in and they're
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.880]  illegal you tend to get left alone a lot of times I'm for opening up the legal
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.520]  that's fine we need workers we killed all our kids whether you were a Hispanic
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.840]  American black American white American you know we killed most our kids just
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.800]  like the pro-abortion people said when I talked to them they said look you know I
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:38.760]  kill my kids I don't adopt I love it want to kill them it's fine so I'm not
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.080]  against immigrants I'm against them being brought in and then weaponized and
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.760]  then given free tuition free health care and then turned against the Republic and
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.120]  not assimilating that's the big issue and we'll be looking at that Obama
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.760]  administration wants the Supreme Court to approve its immigration plans John
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.080]  Bowne has a report on that we're going to be airing a little bit later in the
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.880]  transmission briefly in what's left of this segment because I didn't really

[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.640]  the country which three years ago that was a big goal to talk about now it's
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.160]  mainstream news that's because more and more of this tyranny is getting ready to
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.640]  go operational or already has the fact that they've gone from denying world
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.240]  government denying mass culling denying planned austerity to admitting it and
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.600]  saying it's good tells me they're getting ready to roll more of this out
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.080]  cashless society retina scanning to buy and sell it's all being announced now
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.440]  brain ships in the troops here's a London Guardian article that ties into all
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.560]  this artificial intelligence homo sapiens will be split into a handful of
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:16.440]  gods and the rest of us and then it goes into all these big government reports
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.760]  UN statements machines replace humans then the elite will control the
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.440]  population because we won't have jobs and robot factories and robot farms will
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:31.280]  supply us human individualism and self-sufficiency will be illegal that's
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:37.400]  why the you lemonade stands from Germany to the United States are illegal swap
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.760]  meets they're shutting them down farmers markets the Amish new raids this week of
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:50.560]  Amish producing their own crops the harassment because this is a takeover
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.320]  this is a military takeover and if you've occupied a city or a country you
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.200]  don't let those people produce their own food in their own staples you control
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.560]  them with it and I know General Stubblebine can speak to that and then it
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.320]  ties into something there really the tip of the spear on and that is getting
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.000]  people to understand under international law now that lawyers on they concur
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.480]  with it that is a violation of the Nuremberg code it is a violation of
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:22.080]  informed consent it's a violation of the US code to forcibly inoculate people
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:28.600]  which is beginning so we're going to go over all of that as well in the second
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:34.400]  part of the interview but first I wanted to pick General Stubblebine but also his
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:42.200]  wife Dr. Labo's brain specifically about what's currently happening because I
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.040]  was talking to one of the lawyers that we work with as well that they work with
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.760]  about forced inoculation and and he was saying well General Stubblebine and Dr.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.000]  Labo believe the culling has begun and you know it's funny they say that I've
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.200]  said that as well I agree with them the beginning of the cutoff of the food
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.920]  worldwide the beginning of the cutoff of good medicine has begun the beginning of
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.560]  the cutoff of good health care here has begun it's being replaced with the death
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.480]  care and they admit this is the new austerity where you can't have air
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.720]  conditioning can't have a car unless you're the elite and they're also
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.040]  fomenting racial and ethnic and religious trife not just here but all over
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.720]  the world they'll take whatever differences there are animus Christians
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.800]  they're all black haven't killed each other muslims Christians they're all
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.080]  black haven't killed each other they can take any group Latin America
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.040]  Catholic versus Protestant kill each other communists versus non-communist
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.440]  kill each other this is the great divide and conquer so I want to get their
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.160]  expert breakdown on where this is going I guess we'll probably go to General
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.040]  Stubblebine for five minutes first and his wife can pop in any time than to her
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.880]  for five minutes but Major General Albert and Stubblebine the third General
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:52.400]  Burt is a graduate U.S. Military Academy class of 52 he enjoyed the
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.640]  distinguished 32 career with the U.S. Army he retired as the commanding
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.560]  general United States Army intelligence and security command prior to his
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.880]  assignment he commanded the U.S. Army electronics research and development
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.440]  command that's hooked into DARPA during his active duty career he commanded
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.960]  soldiers at every level at his retirement he served as VP for the
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.320]  intelligence systems with BDM and major defense contractor he has brought these
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.080]  expertises to the leading-edge medical research and development in
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.960]  collaboration with his wife Dr. Rima E. Labo MD who's treated some royalty and
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.200]  some of the most famous people in the world which is part of what will occur
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.520]  up because what they were saying Dr. Rima truth reports dot com and they also
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.040]  have a whole section on informed consent these cards you can print off you can
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.520]  also just I would say come up with your own as well whatever works to to put
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.880]  people on notice when they're trying to forcibly inoculate you or your
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.280]  children because they lie and say there's no side effects or it's it's the
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.520]  law you got to take it it's not true even as they pass laws saying it they're
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:01.280]  trumped they're like a one-of-hearts with their fake regulation or state law
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.960]  versus the Bill of Rights the Constitution the Nuremberg Code the
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.240]  Geneva Convention that's the ace of spades you can't trust these governments
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:15.200]  to forcibly put something in you come on so joining us is Major General retired
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.200]  Albert instoubled by General it's been a long time I tell you great to have you
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.440]  on with us well Alex is great to be here where do you guys want to begin
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.520]  there's so much I mean you've said it I agree with you the great calling has
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:40.400]  begun unfortunately Alex you are correct it is already started and my sense is
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:47.800]  it's only going to get worse general Burke just wrote a piece on white men
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:55.960]  dying in America let's talk about that well when you take a look at the
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:03.840]  statistics statistics is it statistics or statistics I'm not quite sure which
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:10.880]  word to use but when you look at the facts what you find is that instead of
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:24.600]  getting older there's a block in terms of aging that is sort of the 40 to 50 age
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:36.520]  range and suddenly instead of getting older like I am they are dying they are
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:46.000]  dying too soon way too soon and the real question is not that they're dying but
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:55.160]  why are they dying that young the the mortality rate has been accelerating 1
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:03.240]  percent a year for the last 15 years for men between the ages of 40 and 55 they
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.680]  were the most privileged sector in really in the world in terms of their
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:15.000]  longevity they were well cared for they were well fed they were capable of
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.600]  sustaining themselves longer than most other groups and now they're their
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.760]  ability to do that their longevity is declining at the rate of 1 percent a
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.640]  year 15 years and by the way I've seen those numbers in the news that the
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.880]  United States actually its life expectancy is going down if you remove
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.720]  infant mortality infant mortality is back up but but still a lot lower than
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:43.680]  100 years ago but if you take out the numbers of dead children and babies
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.200]  we're not living as long as we did just 50 60 70 years ago even though they have
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.360]  advanced technologies and sciences they can't even keep us alive now and
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.520]  there's this myth that we're living longer but neurological disorders talk
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.040]  about some of those numbers as an MD doctor I mean they're just off the chart
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.400]  diabetes you name it infertility it is just crazy and then specifically what's
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.440]  happening to white men what's happening to white men started statistically in
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:17.880]  the year 2000 which was the year after the suicide inducing liver failure
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:25.240]  inducing drugs psychiatric drugs started to be prescribed very widely and so
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.720]  people started dying well the causes that have been identified for this decline
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.480]  in mortality or I'm sorry increase in mortality and decline in longevity in
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:43.080]  this privileged group in the past anyway the causes are liver failure suicide
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:51.440]  alcohol and what we know is that when you combine statin drugs and
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.640]  psychiatric drugs and blood sugar regulating drugs for the rampant
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:03.200]  diabetes and you put them all together with vaccines you have damage to the
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.160]  liver and you have suicide because the lower the cholesterol is the more
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.880]  suicide people have the more psychiatric drugs they use the more
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.120]  suicide they have and the liver simply falls apart under the onslaught of the
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.160]  drugs and vaccines so what we're seeing is iatrogenic that is doctor induced
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:34.680]  increase in death and the next age cohort below them is now leveling off in
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.760]  their longevity and they'll start to decline and the most frightening thing
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:47.200]  of all Alex is that you can just taste the fact that in order to protect us the
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.240]  great ones will want to medicate our water and our food sure to keep us from
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.000]  committing suicide to keep our livers from falling apart and in fact what
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.560]  they'll be doing is accelerating all of those that don't know it's now Fox News
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.320]  CNN as you point out doctor the Japanese government they're all saying let's put
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:09.440]  all sorts of chemicals including statins in the water let's put lithium in the
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.440]  water but my dad's a chemist also retired old surgeon I remember him in the
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.960]  80s freaking out about statins saying your brain's made up out of cholesterol
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.880]  showing me studies that it would eat your brain but now as you know they've
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.520]  admitted a lot of that but I can't tell you how many people I know whose fathers
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.400]  particularly retired 65 they're totally normal they go on statins and with when
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.560]  one year they can't even read and write I mean I in fact I it's very it's very
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.280]  close to home I'm not allowed to talk about it as a family issue I have some
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.960]  family that won't listen it won't go off of them and it's literally eating their
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.840]  brain that's exactly right this whole erectile dysfunction thing by the way
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:51.280]  guys if you really would like to have an erection and you're taking satin drugs
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.960]  you're canceling out your ability to make testosterone because cholesterol is
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:03.360]  the molecule for which testosterone is made and your brain is 50% cholesterol
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:08.280]  as well so you can't think and you can't have an erection but then you get
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.560]  medication for both Alzheimer's disease and you get medication for erectile
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.480]  dysfunction and when your heart and liver collapse you get more medication for
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:24.120]  that this is crazy then add vaccines and we're talking about sure I was on a
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.160]  plane back from Toronto speaking a few months ago with George Norrie and
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.800]  actually looked up with a guy was turned he was a famous chemist and we were up
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.560]  in first class that's how they flew us up there to speak and he was telling me
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:42.520]  that listen Tylenol couldn't get approved today but he goes new things can but he
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.680]  goes if you take Tylenol he listed all this other over-the-counter stuff he
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.920]  said it will literally eat your liver in a matter of weeks worse than drinking
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.800]  gallons of Jack Daniels a day that was his words he started listening all these
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.840]  drugs and he was telling me it's crazy I want to develop good drugs but he said
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:06.200]  it it's over the top because these doctors will prescribe things that they
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.440]  been told will eat your liver and he was saying I don't know why they keep
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.760]  doing it why are they doing it as a medical doctor and then I want General
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.000]  Stubblebine he's been on obviously talked about you know as a guy that's
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.480]  trained in intelligence and seeing what's happening is making the dots what's
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:26.520]  actually going on well when you take a look at the statistics no statistics
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:34.080]  about the liver and the other organs what you find is that the thing is that
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:43.560]  the curve is greater than 45 degrees it's almost a 60 degree curve going up up
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:54.200]  up up up over the last 15 years and your liver folks is your detoxification
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:21:00.240]  capability if you can't detox your body you're in deep trouble and here's this
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:10.720]  this graph that shows how steep the curve is that's killing your liver you're
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.560]  absolutely right it's the glyphosate to the water the fluoride yeah how big a
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:21.360]  victory is it general and also doctors labo that we forced you and others now
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.740]  European governments to call for the removal of hydrofluorosalic acid or
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:31.200]  fluoride and how big a deal it is to have the EPA say and FDA reduce it from
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:37.800]  1.3 parts per million down to 0.7 cutting it roughly in half how big a deal is
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.480]  that that we're finally forcing breakthroughs but then where's the
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:49.200]  debate about why they did it to begin with general doctor well I I'd like to
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.600]  I'd like to leap in on that because I can't resist it's a huge victory and it's
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:02.520]  a tiny drop in the contaminated bucket the the issue of fluoride should never
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.120]  be underestimated people say why why are people acting like sheeple and you
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:15.880]  should never underestimate the impact of fluoride fluoride cuts your ability to
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:22.280]  reach out using a moral compass fluoride calcifies pineal gland fluoride makes
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.800]  you dumber it makes you infertile it gives you diabetes and you would think
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:32.840]  well good when they and makes you passive passive very very passive when you
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:40.920]  cannot do any kind of action when you're that past so it kills motivation it
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.520]  kills motivation but the point is yes they're they're eliminating
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:50.680]  hydrofluorosalic acid in Europe but at the same time they spray food even
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:56.720]  organic food in storage and transit with higher much higher levels of fluoride
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:04.400]  33,000 parts per million so toothpaste is a delivery system food is a delivery
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.960]  system what has to happen is that fluoride is banned as an additive in any
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:14.560]  way I agree people need to start suing companies that put it in food I remember
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.520]  being a camp as a child I was no rocket scientist but when they gave us powdered
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.640]  eggs I would go throw them up and I loved food at a very strong stomach and then
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:29.680]  years later I learned that very brand had 300 other brands have 600 300 parts
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.320]  per million as you know doctor 1.3 parts per million reduces IQ by 10 points
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:40.640]  after several years of use imagine 300 parts per million that is a devastating
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.480]  dose devastating dose let me point out that the United States government
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:53.000]  pressed very hard to add very high levels of fluoride to baby formula through
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.160]  Codex Alimentarius we were able to keep them from adding fluoride to normal
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:03.720]  babies formula but then at the very end of the meeting they ran through the
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.920]  ability to add high levels to the formulas for sick infants this is a
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:14.920]  program to control us and to dumb us and to make us absolutely rid of us and
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:20.240]  fluoride is in many vaccines and why would fluoride be in a vaccine because
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.040]  it's synergistically toxic with the aluminum and the mercury in those
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.480]  vaccines this is a death program sure I can walk out my door there's a grocery
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.240]  store three minutes away I could be back in 10 minutes half the water section is
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.160]  nursery water with added fluoride for babies at a very high level I mean we're
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:46.480]  talking 10 parts per million or higher I mean this is so sick to give developing
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:52.680]  babies their high fructose corn syrup formula mixed with this and I tell
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:59.720]  women I know that I see giving them the high fructose corn syrup formula I say
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.000]  listen it's a death sentence for your child's brain and they go there's no
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.440]  way the government would allow that and they can't admit they've already been
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.560]  hurting their kid so they won't reverse it they're committed to having a moron
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.000]  child yes well so are a lot of other people and then we get to common core
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.720]  education but it's very important to understand that if you're drinking
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.360]  fluoridated water or eating fluoridated food and you take vaccines you're adding
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:33.600]  aluminum and fluoride together and they are synergistically 10,000 times more
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.640]  toxic wow well listen I've been asking some of the questions here but you guys
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.720]  rightfully say but you're bigger expert someone than I am on eugenics and things
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.040]  with your backgrounds from a military background from a medical doctor
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.040]  background why do you say they're now launching they've gone from testing to
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:58.760]  actually launching the mass culling? Well one of the things that we see is
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:04.720]  that the death rates are increasing we see that the United States because of
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.520]  its vaccines has the highest infant mortality rate in the developed world
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:16.000]  even Zimbabwe has a lower infant mortality rate it has the highest first
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.440]  day infant mortality it has the highest one-year infant mortality and it has the
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.520]  highest five-year infant mortality I would call that a great culling I would
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:33.040]  call the fact that privileged white males are now dying at a an accelerating
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.120]  rate part of the great culling I would call the induced infertility part of
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  the great culling I would call the introduction of nagalase the enzyme that
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.600]  blocks the immune system part of the great culling how is it introduced well
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.840]  it appears to be introduced in vaccines I think one of the most important things
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:01.680]  that we can do to stop the great culling is never ever again take a vaccine or
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.080]  allow anyone to take a vaccine but given the mandates that are being forced
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:14.000]  upon us globally like the no-jab no-pay in Australia like SB 277 in
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.360]  California every child must be vaccinated and every child care worker
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:29.280]  unless we assert our right to informed consent with this where's my camera with
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:36.080]  this kind of active assertion then in fact we are going to be vaccinated
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.720]  forcibly you're right we've got to get organized we've got to get aggressive
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.040]  but everything you're saying just makes a light bulb go off we've got British US
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.040]  Canadian you name it studies just type into Google flu vaccine doubles your
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.880]  chances of getting flu mainstream news admits it doesn't work and gives you the
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.160]  flu and destroys your immune system and people admit autoimmune disorders are
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.080]  off the charts they have videos on the news in Mexico and Latin America they
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.400]  give little girls the Gardasil and a bunch of them start having convulsions
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.120]  this is really testing how much we'll put up with I think we're beyond testing
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.000]  how much we'll put up with they have determined how much we'll put up with and
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.040]  it's anything they want to give us until we say no now you said earlier Alex
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.440]  that people look at their own vaccine exemption card and you're kind of right
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:31.400]  and kind of wrong because there is a very specific legal format necessary for
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:36.280]  exerting your informed consent right and if you don't do it right you're going to
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:43.000]  get vaccinated that's why we've created the advanced vaccine directive and why
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.120]  we are working so hard to make it available to everyone in fact we just
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:55.160]  slash the prices so that everyone can afford it now I want to say everyone
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:03.320]  needs one in your diaper pack in your backpack in your pop wallet in your purse
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:11.520]  each person has to assert that right and if they don't they will be forcibly
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.560]  vaccinated doc the point I'm getting at is I appreciate the service you're
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.520]  providing and I agree with your analysis of it I want to come back and talk about
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.040]  Nuremberg code and form consent and all that I'm just telling people if they
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.960]  don't go get one from you people can go look at the wording you've put on
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.520]  whatever they do learn this info teach it to others and explain to people that
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.880]  under the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence common law
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:40.080]  Nuremberg code Geneva Convention they cannot force you to take this stuff plus
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:46.080]  they got hundreds of vaccines coming down the line 20 years ago was like 15
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.600]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:03.040]  network a proposed EU law puts the simple act of linking to content under
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.840]  copyright protection Julia Retta a German activist puts it this way the
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.720]  European Commission is preparing a frontal attack on the hyperlink the
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:16.760]  basic building block of the internet as we know it this is based on an absurd
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:22.280]  idea that just won't die making search engines and news portals pay media
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.960]  companies for promoting their freely accessible articles reticites a drought
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.920]  communication on copyright reform leaked last week the ideas expressed by the
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:35.960]  document challenge the existing interpretation and spirit of the law as
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:40.640]  well as common sense each web link would become a legal landmine and would
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:45.320]  allow press publishers to hold every single actor on the internet liable she
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.880]  went on to explain Retta believes the EU will try to slide this through under the
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:54.680]  guise of clearing up unanswered questions you can find more reports on

[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.800]  desperate now which makes them even more dangerous and and how do you see the
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.960]  battle space right now general in this fight to enlighten people because I see
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.400]  us as winning the fight to wake people up that will think the problem is though
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.840]  we're still occupied by this global force where does it all go I mean I see
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:24.320]  the military awake I see people in government awake but they're not calling
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:33.280]  the shots they're taking orders how far can this go well let me let me look at
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.320]  that in a couple of different ways first of all go back to our previous
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:47.240]  conversation Finland for instance has I believe 11 vaccines you know we have
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:56.720]  right now 36 36 vaccines and guess what there are more in the making there are
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.120]  more in the pipeline so we're not going to be and it's going to be mandatory so
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:06.600]  you're not going to get just a few vaccines you're going to get a whole
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:14.280]  lot of vaccine every one of those is going to be have poisons in it that you
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:21.560]  do not want in your body and that's number one number two you as the
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:33.480]  population need to object you need to refuse you all now are on active duty you
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:41.600]  all now are part of the army you're part of the military why because you have to
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:49.920]  say no not oh well here's my arm you can stick anything in it you want and put
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:56.000]  anything in your my body that you want to put in there uh-huh no no no no no you
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:04.760]  as the population must say no you now are the military you are the army you
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:11.360]  are the objectors you will say no that's right we are under attack this is a
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.720]  global military operation people need to realize they're under attack whether
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.320]  they decide to fight back or not you're right we are all seen as an enemy army
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.440]  we're we're humans were alive the globalists want to mop us up they want
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:26.920]  to reduce world population this is a one-child policy after birth we've got
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.840]  to admit it's happening let me let me take one of the things you said Alex and
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:39.360]  resonate with it for our listeners you asked about battle space the fundamental
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:44.320]  battle space is your DNA right now you are being genetically modified you're
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:50.520]  being genetically modified by the GMO garbage and poison in your food you're
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:57.080]  being genetically modified by the the chemicals that are used in quote food
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:02.160]  which ought to be spelled pH UDE because it doesn't support life or create
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.760]  health you're being genetically modified by the vaccines you're being
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:12.600]  genetically modified by a whole group of technologies the general Bert has
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:18.960]  called genomicidal technologies and those in fact recently a scientist from
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:25.440]  New York said that we should have fertilization in vitro only so that
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.480]  people's genes that make them smaller shorter should be enhanced and the ones
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:38.880]  that make them taller should be canceled out to to fight global warming logic is
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.920]  not part of the deal here your genes are under attack and one of the things that
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:49.840]  you need to do is say no to the things that are attacking and changing your
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:58.240]  genes for two purposes one is to kill you and the other is to dumb and dwarf you
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:05.080]  on every parameter that's the battle space I totally agree and listen this
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.760]  isn't rhetoric folks to get you to wake up we have the eco science written by
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.480]  the current White House science are we have hundreds of books you've you've
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.120]  made films you've written about it doctors so general stubble bind this is
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:21.760]  so naked and that's part of it it's a hidden in-plane view attack so brazen so
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.280]  dirty with the death panels and the trips being put on no treat list they're
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:33.320]  really I agree going from the testing phase to operational why do you think
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:38.280]  they're accelerating their program general why because it's getting I think
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:45.000]  they're behind their program schedule and I think they're worried that people
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:52.920]  like you and ourselves dr. Revan myself are beginning to talk about it and do
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:44:03.320]  say okay here is a way of not doing what you want me to do because I do not want
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:11.360]  to put all of that poison in my body I do not want to succumb to you and I'm
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:17.920]  following the principles of war one of which is mass and we need all of you all
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:24.400]  of you to say no not just one or two but everybody and educate others I mean to
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:28.120]  send this video and audio from this interview today when we put it out no
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.200]  vaccines are designed to kill you emergency alert you know you can say
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.240]  no to vaccines get them out let's speak about dr. Rema truth reports dot com
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.680]  where people can go at cost and get these cards that have the science the
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:47.880]  history the facts of the Nuremberg code and us law in them when they lie to you
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:53.360]  and say it's the law because the line in the sand for me is forced in
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.880]  oscillations we know they're deadly we know they're not protecting us almost
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.080]  everyone in my family has almost been killed by one from my mother to my
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:04.800]  uncle I mean everybody you know listeners people that have been sick from
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.120]  vaccines the inserts say they can kill you it's just hiding in plain view now
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.360]  is the time to say no now is the time to get in their face when they're giving
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.840]  out the free flu shots on the side of the highway or they lie and say it's the
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.000]  law every year to take the shots now is the time to call their bluff let's get
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.920]  into the Nuremberg code and and and what's on these cards well when
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:35.000]  everybody needs to understand basic principle when country signs a treaty the
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.400]  law of that treaty wipes out whatever the law of the country was and replaces it
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:49.240]  trumps or supersedes national law so when the United States and 125 other
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.680]  countries around the world ratified the Geneva Conventions and there have been
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:00.360]  three separate Geneva Conventions US has ratified them all that means that the
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:06.560]  law of informed consent so-called humanitarian law is now the law of the
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.480]  United States no matter what California passes or Montana or Idaho or even the
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.800]  United States itself at the federal level the law of informed consent prevails
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:25.120]  now that law says that you have the right to say no to any medical
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.720]  intervention including vaccination without pressure without prejudice and
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:35.920]  without punishment that means you cannot be forced to give up a right for
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:41.280]  instance the right to a public education for your children if I'm sorry to give up
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:48.760]  a benefit in order to have someone be pleased with you you cannot be forced to
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:54.960]  give up a right in order to get a benefit like the Australian $16,000 a year
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:00.440]  per child payments you are entitled to that and if somebody comes at you with a
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:07.480]  vaccine and you have not asserted your right your informed consent is deemed
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:13.480]  waived but if you have inserted asserted that right according to the United
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:19.080]  States Supreme Court as well as the law of the land once you've asserted your
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:25.480]  right to informed consent anybody who violates that is committing malpractice
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.920]  is committing assault is committing battery and a variety of other crimes by
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:35.440]  the way my dad as a physician years ago said that that's what he would do when
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.480]  people try to force vaccines on whoever or for him to practice medicine they
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.120]  would try he would come and say you to the board he got called for a board one
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:46.200]  time he said all of you sign this informed consent for liability if I get
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.240]  hurt tell me it's safe and that you'll pay for it they said fine you don't have
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.040]  to have the hepatitis shots but I mean that's what it comes down to and the
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.920]  reason we created this card at the Natural Solutions Foundation the advanced
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:07.840]  vaccine directive is that the law of advanced health directives is well
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.640]  established once you properly assert your advanced health wish I don't want to
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.080]  be vaccinated I don't want to be resuscitated living will penicillin
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:24.560]  then if they do violate that it's established that they're already
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:32.160]  committing a crime so you are protected now will everyone be it will it be
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:37.160]  respected for everyone who asserts it no some people will be violated and then
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.920]  they are big-time heavy-duty right these public schools from California to
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:46.720]  Alabama that have been caught giving kids shots in mass even when parents said
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:53.400]  no our super liable parents just don't know how to take action but understand
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:59.520]  that just saying no is not enough you actually have to give them the form you
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:05.800]  have to do it in the correct legal way or it won't count you can't just write
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.800]  it on a piece of paper and say no let me ask this question general what about the
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.720]  misnomer that the military has to take any shot they want correct me if I'm
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.840]  wrong but from law that's the prescribed authorized non-experimental shots
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.480]  because you have some of your rights joining the military but still implied
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:28.560]  consent is there if it's deemed experimental correct correct no no sorry
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:33.600]  no well I know you're a medical doctor correct us then doctor I love you both
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.760]  this is so important I have to correct you Alex and I have to correct I mean we
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:45.680]  want to get your perspective go ahead okay every vaccine and every drug is
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.320]  experiment I know they are I'm talking about the law though that's the point
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:59.280]  because the the Nuremberg code and the Geneva conventions don't say that this
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.840]  applies only to experimental drugs but in fact every drug and every but I'm
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.720]  saying don't you wave that right when you join the military well the courts
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:14.440]  have said you know okay but the the issue in law is not what the truth is
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.640]  it's what the answer to the specific question you know I know you're a
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.400]  medical doctor is an expert in general stubble bind commanded you know hundreds
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.000]  of thousands of troops that's why I'm asking what we got 30 seconds general
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:31.920]  but where does it stand for servicemen and women right now most people don't
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:36.920]  even understand the issue and so they all say no you got to have this you got
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:41.520]  to have this you got to have this but the answer real answer is no you don't
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:48.400]  not if you say I do not consent you do not have to do it so it's your belief
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:52.520]  that informed consent extends also serving members the military that's
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.800]  powerful info they don't know it yet but the answer is still yet okay good
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.880]  that's good we'll be right back are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor

[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:18.080]  correct people with their malice style activities they had to just cancel
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.560]  classes and get everybody out of there because they were just frothing running
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.760]  around attacking reporters and just screaming with professors screaming our
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.480]  time has come our takeovers here while they're all being soft killed it's just
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.640]  total insanity that's up on info wars dot com we'll be breaking some of that
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:39.720]  down course as usual George Soros and others are tied into the guy that started
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:47.560]  the whole operation it's it's it's truly truly sick also there's a new video
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:52.760]  how you can stop and expose political correctness that's all coming up the
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.280]  next hour we also have a reporters from Missouri State where they're trying to
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:02.080]  pull down the statue of Thomas Jefferson now joining us kid Daniels and
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:08.840]  Jakari Jackson that is all coming up in the next hour well General Stubblebine
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.680]  and dr. Lebo I want to thank you both for coming on is the best place for
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.400]  people because your site so jam-packed dr. Reema truth reports dot com can they
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:22.160]  go there and find these consent forms so that people can get the card and the
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.280]  facts and learn how to say no because medical people obviously as you're
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:29.480]  saying know the law they know this trumps what they're doing and so the
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.840]  fact they're trying to intimidate you into something can certainly backfire on
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:39.600]  them absolutely that is precisely where they can go and there's a button there
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:47.360]  and they can follow it but I think that understanding that we have the right to
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.960]  control what happens to our body no matter what the liars tell us is
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.760]  fundamental to everything that you're trying to do for us Alex and that we're
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:03.600]  trying to do for everyone as well and we really would appreciate it if you use
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:11.000]  our card because that will allow us to support you further in the future sure
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.880]  absolutely I think what you're doing is great and of course I'm not involved
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:16.680]  monetarily in this but you're saying if they put in what some kind of promo code
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:22.920]  with my name they got a discount on the card if they use an AJ code there's a
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:28.120]  slot for the code then we will support your work from the proceeds of that I
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.240]  didn't even know that okay we were telling my producer that listen that's
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:35.640]  fine you guys can just donate that money back to get another people maybe you
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.880]  know more cards or something because it is really important and you're right
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:43.280]  because what you're telling me to do what you're saying to do is exactly what
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.040]  my dad who's been on medical boards at the state level and a lot more
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:51.120]  testified before the legislature he's pretty smart guy at this he said the
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:55.640]  exact same thing that it violates the Geneva Convention and consent federal
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.240]  state law it's just crazy that they're doing this but I think it's a sign of
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.040]  desperation because I know the awakening about vaccines is happening
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:11.240]  absolutely they're desperate in many ways this is just one way to protect
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:15.720]  ourselves but there are so many areas that we need to be active in I'm so
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:20.400]  pleased to be back on the show it's been a long time and we're happy to support
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.000]  what you're doing and to share our information with everybody well I want
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.480]  to get you a general suburbine back sometime just talk about what's
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:30.400]  happening militarily around the world and in one minute we have left in a
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.880]  suburbine what do you make of it coming out that the West is funding ISIS and
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.480]  that we're starting this thing in Ukraine what's your view of what the
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:43.680]  globalists are doing with our military right now I think that there I think a
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:48.520]  good part of it is all about oil and I think they're worried that we're gonna
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:57.240]  lose the oil and so everybody or what we need then is our own army to keep the
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:02.520]  oil for us I think it's crazy I want to say on Veterans Day despite our
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:06.280]  military being deployed in bad ways some of my favorite folks are veterans like
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:10.640]  yourself so we appreciate your service in what you believe was our Republic
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:18.280]  general stubblebine let me tell you one thing war is or should be the last choice
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:24.120]  the last choice not the first absolutely you're absolutely right well

[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:23.440]  Texas Alex Jones all I can say to Patriots worldwide fighting the
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.680]  loveliest is stay on target I'm Alex Jones your host coming up the bottom of
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.600]  the hour jacari Jackson and Kit Daniels both China's from the headquarters of
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.400]  Missouri State University we're now moving on to try to pull down
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:38.640]  statues of Thomas Jefferson and more and vowing to attack anyone engaged in free
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.920]  speech so much so the college had to campus had to cancel events but first
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:47.360]  let's go to this report about protecting our liver since Dr. Lebo was just
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.840]  talking about that that won't come back after break with Key Intel and when you
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:58.320]  eat all these toxins if you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:03.440]  plasticizers in them your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do so
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:07.840]  the liver basically excretes that into the gallbladder and it holds it
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.840]  just google gallbladder stones and it's disgusting
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.480]  but you need to look at it and when you finally get filled up with these it
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.560]  burst or gets infected they've got to remove it
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:24.320]  and we'll scroll through these there's even grosser ones like let's scroll down
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.240]  on average they're green or black if they're black they're really old and
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.760]  toxic they're generally green and this stuff's
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:38.400]  meant to be passed out of you but we eat such artificial food
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:42.240]  that it doesn't these are way beyond kidney stones you name it you also have
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:45.040]  liver stones
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:49.840]  and medical doctors won't tell you on average hey flush your liver
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.520]  they'll just say hey your liver's sick it's going to get progressively worse
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:57.280]  we're going to get you on a list for a liver transplant
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:02.000]  it is unbelievable we're showing these disgusting images so
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.040]  about a year and a half ago Anthony Gucciardi just said man I just have a
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:09.600]  doctor grips liver cleanse the one he recommends and he's developing this
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:12.480]  proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.360]  you really got to do it the results are dramatic after six days
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.520]  and I'm like no way no way I'm doing it I don't believe that there's giant black
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:25.280]  or green balls in my gallbladder and this is how ignorant I am
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.680]  how does the apple cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and with the liver
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:34.480]  trucks over to six day cleanse how does it then when you take the olive oil at
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.800]  the end lay on your side for an hour as you go to
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.480]  sleep why does it then have the the gallbladder release
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:46.080]  what you should do and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.320]  starting in the early 90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:53.680]  liver was to develop an herbal formula that
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:57.440]  contains herbs that will help soften or break down
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:00.720]  these globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.680]  and that's really what the first five days is for
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.360]  that's where you mix the bottle of liver shield you pour the whole bottle in a
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.480]  gallon of distilled water and then you drink four eight
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:14.320]  ounce glasses a day of that four or five days
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.160]  at the same time though you're also using the apple cider vinegar and that's
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:20.960]  going to be the the liver flush kit that we put
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:26.320]  together exclusively for info wars you know viewers and the people
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:29.920]  that want to support the you know the info war
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:33.440]  so basically that you want you do that for five days and of course you want to
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.400]  eat fairly healthy you don't want to be putting a bunch of chemicals and toxins
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.760]  into your body but then on day five is when you
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.360]  actually do the olive oil and when you you do epsom salts and the epsom salts
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.400]  that you drink will actually help relax the the bile duct
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:54.880]  and make it a lot more elastic so any of the stones
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.960]  can pass through there or the globules the toxic globules
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.080]  and then when you lay on your you drink the olive oil
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:05.760]  you lay on your right side because your liver is on the right side
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:10.240]  and those or that heavy oil ends up absorbing down through your intestinal
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.960]  lining and going into the liver and it kind of works like
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:17.520]  oil pulling which is a big thing now that it was on Dr. Ross with the coconut
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:20.960]  oil where you swish it in your mouth and oil has an
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.720]  affinity for toxic substances and absorbs some of those
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:28.240]  and when you do the liver cleanse you will actually form
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:33.840]  also little oil globules as well so the reason why you take during the ox
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.000]  the flush the liver flush the reason why you take oxy powder
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.440]  at the same time is because you want to be able to flush that out of the system
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.320]  because when the liver dumps all those toxic balls
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:47.920]  and rocks and all that toxic buildup that's been in there for years and
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.280]  years and years you want to have something to flush it out of the
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:54.080]  intestines
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:06.080]  in florida they call me jeb because i earned it poor jeb i got a lot of really
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:08.320]  cool things that i could do other than sit around
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:12.560]  being miserable jeb just got some more bad news while both trump and carcyn would
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:16.720]  beat hillary in florida former florida governor jeb would lose to hillary
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:23.360]  in the republican leaning state and with that news jeb's exclamation mark
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:27.200]  went completely flaccid and his comments got even stranger
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:30.880]  i love my dad i'd kill for him i'd go to prison for him because i love him so
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:33.200]  much well i'm sure that comes up around the bush

[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:38.400]  articles that are all very interesting to cover and i got a bunch of clips to
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:42.320]  get to but i'm going back to something i covered earlier because
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:47.680]  when i was reading this it just hit me this is slavery
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:51.840]  germany is bringing back slavery that's what political correctness and
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:54.880]  socialism is
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:57.760]  where select groups have to pay higher taxes
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.880]  have to do national service even when they're poor
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:04.880]  because of their race of their nationality
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:08.720]  as part of the cult of political correctness
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:14.560]  that is slavery germany to spend some 22.6 billion to accept refugees in
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.920]  2015 based on the assumption that only 1.1
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:21.520]  million have come in when it's well over 2 million
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.360]  now here's the story up on info wars.com i apologize if watson the
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:28.560]  story is linked to drudgereport.com
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:35.600]  politician calls for compulsory you hear that word compulsory labor compulsory
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.520]  is a fancy term for forks in fact
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:42.640]  can we add to this article maybe ask watson to he's probably listening the
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.800]  definition of compulsory and the definition of slavery compulsory
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:51.840]  means forced compulsory means basically free
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:57.840]  compulsory means slavery compulsory means absolute you are compelled
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:05.200]  you are forced you are made to politician calls for compulsory labor
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:10.160]  to force germans to service migrants university graduates would face
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:13.840]  mandatory year of social service and then that'll be expanded
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:16.880]  the german parliament we have video of it on the article
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.880]  a german parliament member has called for introducing a compulsory labor
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:24.880]  program under which young germans would be forced to spend a year of service
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:29.840]  to migrants. Focus.deutsch reports that c-d-u-m-p
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:34.240]  Eckhart Robberg provoked heated discussion
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:36.960]  when he suggested that germany's inability to cope with the migrant
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:40.880]  influx could be solved by making university graduates commit a year of
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:46.400]  services to social service that's also indoctrination
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:49.680]  and it goes into how they'd make them do it as a forced labor program but can we
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:54.400]  pull up the definition just have to work definition of compulsory
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.520]  into the search engine and give me the webster's definition that'll come up
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:02.240]  probably the third link after it always does for some reason
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.280]  almost always does after wikipedia and a few others but i want to show people
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.600]  websters definition of compulsory which means forced
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:14.160]  so forced labor let's change that to politician calls for forced labor
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:19.440]  to force germans to service migrants compulsory
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:26.240]  compulsory obligatory mandatory required requisite necessary essential
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:34.080]  involved or exercising compulsion coercive the abuse of compulsory powers
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:39.200]  let's click dictionary the one under it let's click that get a wider definition
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.120]  of it compulsory means forced ladies and gentlemen
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:46.880]  that you just just click on the next one because there's always variants of them
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.640]  there you go and click on that one dictionary.com
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:57.840]  required mandatory something as a
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.720]  athletic feat that must be performed or completed as part of a consent or
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.680]  competition that means like it's compulsory that you have to
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.880]  compete and then win and make a certain well that's a different type in there
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:12.720]  but there you go so there is the origin of it mandatory
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:20.880]  required forced and again i'm not dehumanizing the quote
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.400]  migrants the point is you can't go to their country and get something free
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.320]  the point is germany advertised all these freebies lowered its border it is
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:31.600]  part of a larger plan and then donald trump comes out and says look we'll
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:36.560]  expand the visas we'll bring in workers we'll make a fast-track deal
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:39.520]  where if you can come and you're legal and lawful
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:43.360]  in everything but the fact that you're not here legally you can stay in a very
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:45.280]  quick process it was proven you're not a criminal
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:48.720]  and you have a job but if you're just here on welfare and doing nothing or
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.640]  you're a criminal you're gone we're collapsing we can't pay for this
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.000]  that's completely reasonable you can't go to china and do that they'll deport
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.400]  you you can't go to mexico and do that they'll deport you
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.600]  you can't go to nigeria and get something free they'll deport you
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:07.280]  and we're going bankrupt here's donald trump
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:11.840]  separate from the debate this is him on msnbc talking about
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:16.720]  a deportation force here it is you're going to have a deportation force and
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.000]  you're going to do it you mainly and you're going to bring the country and
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.600]  frankly the people because you have some excellent wonderful people some
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.640]  fantastic people that have been here for a long period of time
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.120]  don't forget me that you have millions of people that are waiting online to come
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.560]  into this country and they're waiting to come in legally
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:38.560]  and i always say the wall we're going to build the wall it's going to be a real
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:40.720]  deal it's going to be a real wall there was a picture
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:43.920]  one of the magazines where they had a wall this tall and they were taking
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.400]  drugs over the wall they built a ramp over the wall
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.440]  and the truck was going up and down they were using it like a highway the wall
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.160]  was like a highway and this is not going to happen
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:55.040]  it's going to be a trump wall this is going to be a real wall and it's going to
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:59.280]  stop people and it's going to be good but
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:02.080]  your friend thomas freedman called me and he said
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.440]  huh there should be a big door i said going to be a big door i love the
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:08.880]  expression there's going to be a big beautiful nice
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.400]  store people are going to come in and they're going to come in legally
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:15.840]  but we have no choice otherwise we don't have a country we don't even know how
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:18.560]  many people we don't know if it's eight million or if it's 20
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:22.640]  we have no idea how many people are in our country
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:26.160]  and then you see what happened with kate and san francisco
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:29.280]  all right let's stop right there he keeps going on now let's go to the debate
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.320]  itself last night uh where neil cavuto came out and
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:36.720]  basically knocked cnbc and said quote the reason we were popular is it wasn't
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.280]  about us yeah it wasn't a bunch of i'm not just
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:43.680]  defending fox it's just true they did a fair job asking real questions
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:48.480]  with cnbc it was just naked attack dogs when they've done these softball debates
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.080]  for the democrats and that bias is clear
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.680]  now let's go ahead and go to rand paul who i think pretty much won the debate
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.280]  last night uh corrects donald trump's comments on china
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:03.200]  being part of the tpp they were part they pulled out
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:06.400]  i should even be corrected on that i've been corrected they were in it first
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:11.120]  now they're not part of it uh but let's go and go to that clip
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:16.320]  i can't be neil and the reason i can't be is that we are a country that is being
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:22.160]  beaten on every front economically militarily there is nothing that we do
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.520]  now to win we don't win anymore our taxes are too high i've come up with a
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.240]  tax plan that many many people like very much it's going to be a
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:37.200]  tremendous plan i think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:42.960]  but taxes too high wages too high we're not going to be able to compete against
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.400]  the world i hate to say it but we have to leave it the
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.200]  way it is people have to go out they have to work
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.640]  really hard and they have to get into that upper okay
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:55.120]  but we cannot that's one of the clubs i was going to get to but it's out of
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.360]  order that's donald trump saying wages are too high taxes and regulations are
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:03.360]  too high if you're getting paid $15 an hour
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.040]  after they pay your fica the the social security matching
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:10.960]  all the little fines and fees and state regs and i'm in a low tax state like
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:14.880]  texas if i've got a crew member being paid $15 an hour
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:18.880]  which is the very low end but i don't think anybody working there is $15 an hour
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.160]  they'll get more than that the point is it's like $22 an hour
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:29.360]  is what it comes out to if you're getting paid $20 an hour it's like $28 an hour
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:33.760]  it's just it's crazy people don't and then the dollars devalued
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.200]  so it doesn't buy as much i almost disagree on minimum wage because
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:40.800]  they're going to devalue the dollars so much you're going to have to
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:43.840]  have a higher minimum wage
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.440]  but that's kind of what the free market does anyways you got to pay people what
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:51.040]  the market will bear but it's easy for socialists like
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.200]  bernie sanders to go the minimum wage should be $30
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:58.320]  and all these idiots that never run a business don't know what that means
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:02.960]  that'd be like 50 bucks an hour after all the regulations and taxes that are
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:06.080]  tagged on to a business owner
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.160]  now let's go to rand paul corrects donald trump's comments on china here
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:14.320]  here's that clip to say the terms of the deal were published
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:19.600]  were published just last week the detail 5 000 page of it and 80 percent of us
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:23.040]  trade with countries in the pacific now of these countries these 11 countries
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:27.040]  is actually tariff free and these the trade deal only affects the other 20
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:30.400]  percent which are there particular parts of the yes well the currency
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:33.600]  manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement which is a disaster
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:37.280]  if you look at the way china and india and
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.040]  almost everybody takes advantage of the united states
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:44.480]  china in particular because they're so good it's the number one abuser of this
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:46.960]  country and if you look at the way they take
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:49.760]  advantage it's through currency manipulation
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:53.840]  it's not even discussed in the almost 6 000 page
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:57.520]  agreement it's not even discussed it was a separate and as you understand i mean
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:00.000]  you understand very well from the wall street journal
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.760]  currency manipulation is the single great weapon
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.680]  people have they don't even discuss it in this agreement so i say it's a very
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:11.920]  bad deal should not be approved if it is approved it'll just be more
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:15.520]  bad trade deals more loss of jobs for our country
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.880]  we are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:22.960]  i want to bring jobs back into this country hey juror do you know we might
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.440]  want to point out china is not part of this deal
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:30.160]  yeah true it's true yeah that's right
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.240]  i can pause right there rand paul that comes back with his explanation and
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:39.520]  it's a good shot it's technically true china was part of it though and china's
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:44.480]  lackey groups and sub states and its lobbyists are all over it and it's one
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:47.360]  sided for china china then just got mad because they
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:51.280]  couldn't fully run it and they're so spoiled they even control our hollywood
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:55.440]  movies now ran off whining but rand paul i you know did a great
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:57.920]  job bless i'm not taking that away from him it's just
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:01.120]  china's all over this agreement it is one sided uh let's go to his response
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:05.040]  here it is
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.480]  before we get a little bit off we'll filter isn't that isn't that part of the
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:12.080]  problem if i say senator that if that if this deal is not
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:15.920]  ratified by by the us by the senate then it would actually
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:19.920]  give china an opportunity to grow its economic leadership which has been
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:23.680]  seeking to do and if the us is unable to take part in this trade
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:26.560]  deal with these countries in asia china will take the lead there is an
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:29.920]  argument that china doesn't like the deal because in us doing the deal we'll
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:32.560]  be trading with their competitors you're exactly right
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:35.440]  but i think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.040]  there is an important point though about how we discuss these trade treaties
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:42.480]  but i do agree with mr trump on we should negotiate from a position of
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:46.160]  strength and we also should negotiate using the full force
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:49.920]  and the constitutional power that was given to us i think it's a mistake that
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:53.840]  we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals good job rand paul
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.640]  he goes on it just gets better we'll be back stay with us

[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:40.800]  the next clip uh is rampol versus marco rubio on wasteful government spending
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:43.360]  uh and talking about the fact that the rhino spend just as much as the
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.520]  democrats then there's rampol on climate change let's go to rampol
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:53.440]  versus marco rubio you know a point that i'd like to make about the tax credits
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:57.360]  we have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative is it
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:01.520]  fiscally conservative to have a trillion dollar expenditure
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:04.560]  we're not talking about giving people back their tax money
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:07.840]  he's talking about giving people money they didn't pay
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:11.520]  it's a welfare transfer payment so here's what we have
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:16.320]  is it conservative to have a trillion dollars in transfer payments a new
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:21.040]  welfare program that's a refundable tax credit add that
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:25.200]  to marco's plan for a trillion dollars in new military spending
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:28.640]  and you get something that looks to me not very conservative
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:32.720]  thank you governor don't know i'm sorry let me come to governor case
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:35.760]  i was excuse me any one i get to respond very very quickly
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:39.200]  senator no i get my 60 seconds to respond he's talking about my tax plan
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:43.200]  please so let me begin with this i actually believe
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:46.560]  first of all this is their money they do pay it is refundable not just against
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:49.920]  the taxes they pay to the government but also the on their federal income tax
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.920]  it's refundable against the payroll tax everyone pays payroll tax
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.440]  this is their money this is not our money and here's what i don't understand if
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:00.800]  you invest that money in a piece of equipment if you invest that money in a
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:03.600]  business you get to write it off your taxes but if you invest it in your
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.120]  children in the future of america and strengthening your family
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:09.920]  we're not going to recognize that in our tax code the family is the most
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:13.760]  important institution ever less it's not very i do want to rebuild the american
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:16.880]  military i know that rand is a committed isolationist
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.720]  i'm not i believe the world is a stronger and a better place
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:23.680]  when the united states is the strongest military power in the world
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:29.120]  marco marco how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.600]  dollar expenditure for the federal government
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:36.000]  there's nothing for how is it conservative how is it conservative
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.800]  to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:42.800]  you cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:45.280]  you're not going to pay for i may respond more quick very quick
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:50.000]  we can't even have an economy if we're not safe
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.800]  there are radical jihadists in the middle east beheading people and
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:57.680]  crucifying christians a radical shea claire our own government created them
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:01.440]  the chinese i set up with him oh the chinese are taking over after
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:04.720]  we sent all our jobs there and set up deals where we couldn't operate
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:09.680]  i mean just absolute pure bull absolute total garbage nico you can come on
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.240]  through studio bro yay nico i was throwing a
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:16.640]  fit during the break i couldn't find my car keys i just keep losing everything
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.160]  i'm so busy uh i'd say this news gets me upset sometimes
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:23.360]  thank you and then separately let's let's go to another
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.960]  clip here uh let's go now to rand poll on climate
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:29.600]  change you know putans come out and said it's pure
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:32.800]  bull and it's a military operation by the globalist
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.600]  to shut down nation states which is what it is
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:39.280]  let's see what rand paul had to say
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:45.520]  senator paul you are one of 15 republicans to vote for an amendment
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:50.880]  which states that human activity contributed to climate change
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.280]  president obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:58.480]  at the same time energy production in america
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:03.120]  has boomed is it possible to continue this boom
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:07.680]  and move toward energy self-sufficiency while at the same time
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.520]  pursuing a meaningful climate change program
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:15.840]  the first thing i would do as president is repeal the regulations that are
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:21.280]  hampering our energy that the president has put in place
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:25.040]  including the clean power act well i do think man
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:29.600]  may have a role in our our climate i think nature also has a role the
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:33.840]  planet's 4.5 billion years old we've been through geologic age after
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:36.320]  geologic age we've had times when the temperature
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:39.520]  has been warmer we've had times when the temperature has been colder we've had
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:42.480]  times when the carbon in the atmosphere has been higher
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:45.280]  so i think before we need to look before we leap
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:49.200]  presidents all often fond of saying he wants a balanced solution
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:52.800]  but really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean we will
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.160]  have some rules for that we got to balance that with the economy
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:59.600]  he's devastated my state i say the president's not only destroying
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:03.040]  kentucky he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.240]  associate with him so what we really need is somebody
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:09.440]  that understands that we do need energy of all forms
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:13.200]  and that means we will have solar and wind and hydro
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:16.560]  but we will still have coal and we still have natural gas
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:20.720]  and we've got to have an all of the above policy yeah i gotta say ramp all is
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:24.240]  not as strong as you should be on this coal power plants in the united states
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:27.040]  are totally clean nothing comes out but water and carbon dioxide
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:30.320]  but they list carbon dioxide as toxic and tax it to shut it down
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:34.560]  and then exempt insider companies and that's what he should be saying he knows
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:38.800]  that he should be talking like putin it is a total
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:44.160]  fraud to devastate this country and bankrupt poor people
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:51.680]  it is a military attack we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:30:00.400]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:04.960]  marco rubio the new billionaire boy toy was left speechless on the fourth
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:08.000]  gp debate when ran paul called him on his absurd
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.920]  pandering to the military industrial complex in his attempt to outdo
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:15.920]  hillary clinton with free college and yes i do want to rebuild the american
[02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:18.400]  military rebuild the american military
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:22.640]  seriously rubio but you know we spend more on our military than the next 10
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:24.880]  countries combined i know that rand is a committed
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:27.360]  isolationist from marco's perspective if you don't have
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:30.960]  more than the seven obama wars going you're an isolationist
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:34.720]  perhaps it'd be safer if we were involved in 10 wars or maybe even better
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:38.640]  picked a fight with russia so rubio's masters could cash in
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:43.840]  marco how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:46.960]  expenditure for the federal government that should not pay for
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:51.360]  how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollars
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:54.640]  in military expenditures you cannot be a conservative
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:57.520]  if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay
[02:30:57.520 --> 02:31:03.920]  for and it's that type of behavior that spurred
[02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:06.400]  me to do the research to develop a true
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:10.480]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:13.360]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind
[02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:16.400]  control television music fast food gmo's
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:20.320]  sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:23.760]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:27.760]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:31.360]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:34.320]  formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:37.120]  like and take we worked with the leading manufacturer
[02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:40.320]  and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most

[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:18.000]  balkanization you can imagine and kit daniels will be

[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:26.400]  system uh there at the state college in
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:30.480]  missouri missouri state pc police now after getting the chancellor and the
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:32.800]  president to resign who were both liberals themselves
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:37.440]  for no reason now what thomas jeverson taken down as racist and sexist
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:42.160]  melissa click the professor running around commanding the anti-free speech
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:45.840]  forces that was heading up large areas of the media department
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:49.920]  now around another disinfo out claiming she's resigned that's from her unpaid
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:54.400]  commissar position over the media area not as a professor
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:59.120]  bloodsucking off the state in my opinion as well
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:03.680]  the viral video of her turns out the mizu hunger strike commanders tied in
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:08.720]  with george soros and of course berkshire hathaway's
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:13.760]  commander who who runs around running eugenics operations

[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.840]  and warren buffett couldn't be happier so this is all just completely staged
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:30.000]  as it always ends up turning out to be so that's just some of the news on
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.480]  that front joining us is kit daniels he and jacari have followed a bunch of
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:39.680]  very informative reports up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:44.240]  so kit you've been there since yesterday afternoon uh what is your view on
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:46.960]  what's happened what can you report to people
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:50.880]  well right now uh we're in the middle of a university of missouri campus
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.680]  in front of the thomas jefferson statue now this statue is the spoken gun of
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.560]  the whole situation up here missouri that you've all been reading the headlines
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:03.120]  past couple of days the uh on october 27th uh
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.880]  22nd i wrote an article on info wars dot com about how some of the student
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.000]  groups like black lives matter or whatnot were claiming that this
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.040]  statue was racist and sexist that needs to be the rude
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:16.080]  a couple of weeks later the same student groups were the ones that ousted the
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:19.520]  president and ousted the chancellor as well
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:23.040]  so you know it's kind of it really shows you
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:26.560]  how out of proportion everything has been how
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:30.080]  exploited the situation has been i mean i'm sure there's some
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:33.200]  racist issues that are going on on campus no doubt about that you know they're
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:37.120]  here and there but this is what i like to call fandom racism
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:41.360]  in which you have a situation that's blown completely out of proportion
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:48.000]  in order to exploit and push a ultimate higher agenda
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.440]  i mean for example uh it's just like the kind of feminist movements where they
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:54.160]  are they're claiming that you know you're a all men of rapists and there's a
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:57.120]  rapist on every corner it's just like here on campus
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:01.280]  where there's claiming that uh everyone's a racist and there's the klu Klux Klan
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:04.000]  member and on every corner we actually had an african-american gentleman that
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.360]  stopped us on campus you know concern he was like is the kkk
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:09.600]  really out here on campus like no it's just been
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.240]  misinformation that's what we also who cares if they are go laugh at it yeah
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:17.440]  yeah that's what i told jacari i was like when we were in the hotel getting
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:20.640]  away to come here uh this morning i was like even if the clan was here we'd go
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:24.000]  and protest that should report half of them are federal agents anyway
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.040]  well it's just ridiculous like somebody might be wearing a halloween
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:31.360]  cousin that scares me remove it immediately at yale it's just it's a it's
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:35.280]  a witch trial meanwhile we're all having our rights taken
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:38.000]  we're all being targeted by the globalists that's why they're doing this
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.760]  kit yeah and it's like i had an incident with the tsa
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:45.040]  coming up here where i was detained for a long time i missed my flight
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:49.200]  but you know funny enough to describe that you shot a video on that but just to
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  show you where this country is the jacari and the camera
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:58.000]  man went on ahead of you uh you were able to describe what happened
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.920]  yeah i had the tsa it stopped me they swabbed my fingers they ran me through
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.080]  the machine a couple times just patted me down had me sit for 15 20 minutes
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.560]  and what's ironic was i was looking outside the terminal there's like a state
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:13.840]  of Kuwait plane i was telling jacari later i was like
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:17.040]  you know you know they're not doing the same thing to them as they are to me
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:20.400]  just like how the state department was allowing the muslim brotherhood
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:24.000]  into the country giving them pork courtesy telling tsa hey don't
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.920]  don't bother these guys just let them pass through it's all security theater
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:33.440]  to exploit our fears and to uh make us give up our rights the same thing here
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:36.320]  in the university of Missouri about the political correctness local correctness
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:39.360]  is used to exploit our fear of being social outcast
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:43.040]  by like saying that oh we're gonna keep us in junior high i mean when i was 11
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:46.560]  i thought people didn't like me i was a little bit depressed most kids are
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.920]  i was going through social stuff kids saying mean things would hurt my feelings
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:54.080]  but by about 13 i could care less most people still care in college what
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:57.680]  somebody says about them they're trying to arrest development
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:01.760]  they're trying to keep us little scared kids on their
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:05.680]  plantation you're absolutely right but specifically your videos titled
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.520]  the tsa what they're not telling you what was their excuse for searching you
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:14.480]  and making you miss your flight uh it's probably because i'm not donating money
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:17.200]  to the clinton foundation yeah that would be a good thing
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:21.360]  because i'm not yeah exactly i mean they how did they tell you what did they do
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:24.880]  to you oh they just they just had me uh
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:28.400]  they just read they ran on the swab thing over my fingers had me run me through
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:33.440]  the machine a couple times padded me down and it was like i told them
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:36.800]  afterwards i fly my fly already took off by the time i was done with it so they
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:39.200]  just made they just ran you for the ringer for fun and made you sit there
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:43.360]  yeah i've had him do that to me yeah yeah and i think they did the same thing to
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:48.000]  micro cameramen maybe not as severe but well they got to be
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.280]  careful because isis who our government created in funds and gave
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:54.320]  missile to is shooting down airplanes and blowing them up so
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:58.000]  you know they've got to take our rights now to keep us safe from their bosses
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.680]  yeah yeah and what people don't realize is the whole government is
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:05.600]  i think it was the cardinal richelieu thinks how you pronounce the name the
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:10.400]  17th century french statesman who had he proposed this idea of reasons the
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:14.640]  state which unlike you being you the state the government politicians they
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:17.280]  don't uh concern themselves with ethics and
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:21.200]  morality you know they just they just see themselves as
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:24.880]  get the state achieved its aims that's the ultimate goal if it doesn't then
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:27.440]  it's macchio valley but if you don't have any morals
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:31.280]  then your aims aren't going to be good either exactly in the tyranny that
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:34.480]  results that i'm experiencing everyone around here is experiencing political
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:38.640]  correctness that's all a direct result of this idea of reasons
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:42.640]  the state well i've heard i've heard that
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.560]  i've seen a video of them going after people and they had to cancel classes
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:50.160]  because of the hysteria and they were promising to go after free speech
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.520]  rallies have you seen anything like that or if you let me tell you something
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:57.040]  funny about that i was we went down to the starbucks just down the road from
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:00.400]  here on campus i was going to go in there and get one of them uh read
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:03.520]  politically correct coffee cups to report on it and tied into the whole
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:06.880]  university of missouri political correctness they shut starbucks down
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:09.920]  because the employees were too scared to show up to work because of all the
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:15.360]  local correctness run amok so you got i can't get my politically correct coffee
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:19.440]  from starbucks because it got shot down by the pc police literally so basically
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:23.680]  the pc police are the end of civilization it's just the shut down of everything
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:26.960]  yeah it's like what we're seeing right now is like the end of roman empire the
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:30.720]  end of the mid-satine empire it's like this whole destruction of civilization
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:34.720]  where everybody is too scared to speak out and be human beings
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:37.920]  they just want to be a cheap mentality and just wither in fear and
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:41.200]  that's right let me see the evil guy that this first declaration of
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:44.240]  independence with slavery i'm standing up here
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:46.960]  let's see thomas jefferson a huge critic of slavery
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:49.920]  then they mindlessly point out that he was born into a slave owning family but
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:53.040]  then freed them yeah i don't i want to point out something else about that
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:57.600]  because the whole black lives matter movement and you know they uh
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:00.880]  we're saying they're fighting against racism but racism is like i said in a
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:04.960]  video i shot last night racism is a collectivist concept
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:09.040]  i mean you're grouping people by race and stereotyping them
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:12.720]  the only way to individualism would just do with racism to begin with
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:16.640]  this is a guy who fought for individualism this is the man who
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:20.480]  promoted individualism probably the first person in human history that
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:24.320]  really brought individualism to the forefront
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.840]  and to the minds and hearts of men and women and he tried to enslavery
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:32.560]  a hundred years before it was ended so he's the terrorist
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:36.240]  yeah and it's it's just so ridiculous you're not gonna just like i said last
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:40.080]  night you're not gonna fight and combat successfully
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:44.320]  conic crony capitalism with communism just like you're not gonna
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.840]  just destroy racism using some other collectivist
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:51.760]  you know ideology i mean the only way you're ever going to fight racism is
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:55.040]  through individualism and the one way to learn first learn about
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:58.080]  individualism is to read this guy's writings right right let's see the
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:02.320]  evil individualist again jacar gives us a shot there is
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:06.080]  thomas jefferson and as you said they first you wrote about this a month ago
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:09.840]  or more they wanted this gone so when that wouldn't happen somebody started
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:13.280]  putting swastikas in the bathroom or once and then they heard somebody say
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.360]  something racist so now coffee shops are shut down campuses are shut down
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:21.920]  total fear hysteria oh my gosh we're in so much it's completely blown out
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.320]  proportion i mean i went to the arbar and lofton i believe that's how you
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:29.680]  pronounce his name he was the he was the president of texas a and m when i
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:32.240]  attended there and i graduated a couple years ago
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:35.440]  he was a chancellor here at missouri i didn't realize that until i came up here
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:38.960]  and he had to resign and that guy was he was the nicest person that you
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:42.320]  that could have been president a and m you know he wore a bow tie went around
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:44.960]  campus you know you could shake his hand he was
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:48.480]  he was very humble about being well that's why they ran him out these guys
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:53.360]  were i'd call classical liberals yeah he was not a yes man
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:56.800]  you know he wasn't he wasn't pushing the towel in the party line just the same
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:48:59.440]  thing with the president they're saying oh you got to recognize your white
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:02.320]  privilege that's racism in itself because you're saying you're
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:04.800]  collectivizing him as being a white person
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:08.000]  you're saying that he has all these uh stereotypical white
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:11.360]  things about him well that's what they've done they've taken classical racism
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:14.800]  and again turned it back around it's just insane
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:19.040]  yeah just divide and conquer it's just how the globalist lust for power they
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:22.720]  you know they combat people the population off each other
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.320]  when just as we saw with the spanish conquistadors who did that do you think
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:31.680]  do you think it's starting to peak though i mean it's really getting crazy now
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:35.280]  you know i alex to be honest i don't think so yet i think we're going to see a
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:39.920]  lot more violence when it peaks i think we really will see a so-called race war
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:43.040]  which i hate to say that but i think we're going to end up seeing
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.000]  like some more le right stuff the way i'm just seeing it right here this is
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.720]  completely ridiculous how bad this the hysteria has been on this campus
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:54.160]  and this is i mean this is a kid school i would have considered going to if i
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:58.320]  could have done it like nulls in my 20s so yeah it's really nice
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:04.640]  yeah it's just it's so ridiculous how out of control it is and one thing i also
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:08.160]  want to add is a lot of these black lives matter kids
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:11.840]  i think they are well-meaning but they've been duped just like i was reading a
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:15.600]  book of my kindle coming up on the airplane about work for non-cortez
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:20.240]  like how he kind of duped a lot of the native american tribes in Mexico when
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:24.560]  he allied with them to pick up plastics that's the same thing that's exactly
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:27.760]  sure it's classic divide in congress that's what colonialists always do
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:30.960]  stay there i'm going to come back now great job kitten talk to jacari jackson

[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:06.800]  there were major movements in this country
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:11.200]  and others to try to end classism say they may have in india still
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.960]  a caste that's how humans have always organized themselves
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:19.200]  since agrarian society formed six thousand
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:23.920]  seven thousand years ago but now they're just taking that whole good movement
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:28.560]  mainly created by christians and turning it on its head
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.600]  and creating a culture about infighting and more and more of even
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:36.880]  leftist who who aren't evil have come out and admitted okay this is out of
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:40.960]  control but the question is with young people being
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:47.440]  just absolutely fried with fake feminism and all this garbage
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:50.880]  i don't know how we counter it when it's consciously being carried out by
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:53.760]  leftist who know it's a scam let me tell you these
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:57.440]  professors know what they're doing in my view uh jacari jackson you've been

[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:20.880]  out here it's a pretty quiet day we've had
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:25.120]  various threats of some bogus threats at that the kkk coming out here a lot of
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:28.560]  people were scared as kit mentioned we actually encountered somebody on
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:31.600]  campus who stopped and asked us he said hey do you guys know anything about this
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.360]  and as far as we know it's just a cooked up thread by the way if you're a radio
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:39.200]  listener you got to see the feed jacari it looks like the last man on earth or i
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:43.600]  am legend there's no one out there i can see in this beautiful gorgeous
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.960]  campus looks cooler than the university of texas or harvard or something
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:49.440]  great place to just looking at looks wonderful
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:53.840]  and and there's no one there in fear of the stupid clan
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:57.920]  yeah it's just a whole lot of a whole lot of things going on out here
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:03.360]  so as we've been reporting now mrs click as you mentioned a little bit earlier
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:06.800]  she was out here a couple days ago stifling people's first amendment
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:10.000]  rights which is very interesting being that she's a communications
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:14.320]  a professor or appointment is i think the proper term they gave her
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:18.240]  and as you're mentioning she gave up her i guess was a appointment appointee
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:21.520]  position but there are other people concerned that she may still have a
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:24.800]  place here on campus man of course went to our office she's not there
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:28.160]  obviously just for something she wants to lay low from
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:31.600]  but uh we were talking to a group earlier today was
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:35.200]  the young americans for liberty yeah and they were telling us that if she does
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:39.120]  retain her position they do have plans to try to start a petition to get her
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:42.320]  to resign which is kind of interesting you know considering the whole thing
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:45.760]  that's going on here the football team wants the uh or had the president
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:48.560]  resign uh i believe the chancellor resigned as well
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:51.600]  well if it's a lot of moving things they can go ahead and come out and said we
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:54.080]  banned the first amendment i'd call for him to step down
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:58.000]  oh yeah yeah i'm just saying that it's a lot of resigning going on out here
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:01.040]  since well not even since we've been here before we got here
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:03.920]  and uh there's some very interesting guys we had a chance to talk to them we
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:06.800]  have a report about that coming up a little bit later once we have a chance
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:11.280]  to down and do some editing but uh by and large that's uh pretty much what's
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:15.520]  going on out here if it's no uh no violence no uh petitions nothing
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:19.040]  like that at this point well that's good
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:22.800]  um what about that evil thomas jefferson jacar you think they should melt that
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.000]  down well if it fell over and it was
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:29.120]  crusty wouldn't hurt my feelings but i'm not signing any petition nor
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:33.680]  it's not any petition to get it removed well it just shows that people are
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:36.720]  having their rights as i said in general taken away by the globalist
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:40.400]  but then we're obsessing over statues
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:43.440]  yeah well that's the one thing as i believe kit was pointing out you know
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:46.720]  there's a lot of things and people do have legitimate concerns it's just the
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:49.280]  way they're going about them you know as he was talking about the collectivist
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:52.640]  notion a lot of these people as well-intentioned as they may be
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:55.760]  a lot of these groups not just here but just we've seen around the country for
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:58.880]  the past several years they get co-opted they get people coming in to
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:01.840]  trying to give them these talking points saying this and that and then they
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:05.680]  just want everybody to subscribe to that as opposed to people taking a
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:07.440]  step back and thinking about what can i do
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:10.480]  as the individual to try to stem these type of things sure
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:13.360]  send my behavior to them stay there jacarii i want to ask you what you
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:16.080]  think of the leader of the movement the hunger strike guy i hope you can find

[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:28.880]  and he's he's out here saying he's underprivileged when his dad makes eight
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:34.160]  million dollars a year i wish my dad made eight million dollars a year

[03:00:01.040 --> 03:00:05.120]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:08.880]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[03:00:08.880 --> 03:00:13.280]  and the gcn radio network so jacari the guy that led the
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:16.240]  hunger strike didn't seem like he lost any weight
[03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:20.720]  turns out that he's got some some I mean some privilege
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:25.040]  coming from a dad who's worth tens of millions of dollars
[03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:28.000]  and I don't think it's fair to criticize him because his dad's worth tens of
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.400]  millions of dollars and makes eight million dollars a year and has 20
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:33.440]  million dollars I guess except that's the leftist socialist
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:36.320]  argument that if somebody's got 20 million dollars
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:41.120]  they must have stolen it or they're bad or that only you know rich white people
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:44.160]  can make 20 million dollars well that's just not how it works
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:47.280]  what do you make of this and what are other tidbits you've noticed do you
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:49.360]  think political correctness is starting to peak
[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:53.760]  or is it just going to get crazier well as far as the guy you know I'm with you
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:57.120]  I'm not following him because his dad is successful but at the same time
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:00:59.760]  I'm sure there are plenty of underprivileged people here but he
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:02.400]  doesn't he definitely doesn't seem to be one of them
[03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:05.440]  he's like said his dad makes eight million dollars a year so I don't think
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:08.640]  he's starting for any cash or any type of
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:12.560]  hand up in life as far as the political correctness you know just the thing we
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:15.440]  documented earlier today the free speech board I think that's
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:19.200]  a great step in the right direction because you walk up to the board as you
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:22.000]  guys can see the video that Kit did and they just hand you a marker they don't
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.640]  tell you anything to say anything you can't say you know some
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:27.920]  people that's wrote you know very positive things people wrote profanity
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:30.640]  people wrote whatever they wanted to it was just a free speech and I think
[03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:35.840]  that's a step in the right direction of how in a way to combat a negative
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:39.360]  sense of political correctness in that that you just want to shut down all
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:42.560]  speech it's not something that you agree with and obviously I have a gentleman
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:44.880]  over here it's agreement sir did you have something that you want to say
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:48.240]  there's a gentleman who came out here with us just a few minutes ago
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:52.160]  no not necessarily other than I just wanted to display my shirt that I got
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:55.520]  from you guys that was very nice shirt but basically you know once you
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:58.880]  understand this everything else falls into place
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:02.560]  just go to ae911truth.org and you'll see what 2,500
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:07.200]  great professional architects and engineers have to say about calling
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:12.960]  for a new petition an independent investigation into what happened on
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:18.800]  9-11. Once you figure this out folks rest all falls into place and let's
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:22.800]  talk about independent investigation for Benghazi what do you
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:28.400]  think about that? I think like the guy was saying who
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:32.880]  was on with Alex yesterday they're above the law you know I don't know
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:37.040]  way around that other than the ants you know if enough of us ants get
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:40.320]  together those grasshoppers up there are shaking their boots and that's why
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:42.800]  they're dividing us. The ants are down here rumbling as soon as
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:47.120]  enough of us figure it out when we reach that tipping point the ants are done
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:50.560]  all right thank you so much sir all right that's just one of the people we've
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:54.080]  got a chance to meet out here. Yeah interviewing more for the
[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:57.200]  website or for the nightly news jacari I know you're going to be filing reports
[03:02:57.200 --> 03:03:00.800]  for nightly news as well then I guess coming on back what tomorrow the next
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:03.520]  day yeah we're coming back tonight
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:07.680]  wow so we'll be on the plane late tonight you want to get back to Texas
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:11.360]  yeah well we're ready to get on back hey I'll say this man
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:15.440]  is it just me or does that college look awesome oh it's a very beautiful
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:20.160]  campus uh the rose brick uh maybe we can do a pan out here
[03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:23.440]  and you can see how beautiful it is it's a stunning architecture
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:27.200]  what do you call that classical american what does that call that architecture
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:32.480]  is it I don't know if colonial what would you call it
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:37.360]  as far as I know this was the first public land grant university that was
[03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:41.040]  created after losing in a purchase that's why Thomas Jefferson statue's here
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:44.400]  and I think this quad is actually designed off of the University of
[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:50.160]  Virginia so I point that out because ironically if
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:55.200]  you are saying that Thomas Jefferson's racist and isn't it logical then to
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:59.360]  have to bulldoze the whole school down to because he did the Louisiana purchase
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:03.200]  yeah yeah and because he uh I mean this is his design pretty much
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:06.960]  no no I agree why don't we put a press release out shoot a serious video
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:10.640]  you know say Saturday calling for the entire say we agree
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:14.640]  info wars agrees or or media outlet headline remove Thomas ever since
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.080]  tattoo bulldoze college I think that's it
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.800]  yeah yeah and then we could just vote they could like turn into some uh
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:27.040]  occupy thing with tents and whatnot on the whole bulldoze college and then
[03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:30.480]  they can push whatever gender they want to put yeah let's let's let's actually
[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:33.600]  tear it all down able to giant statue a mouth let me get a final comment from
[03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:36.960]  jacari jacari uh great job you got 20 seconds final

[03:04:54.960 --> 03:05:00.480]  teleprompter from the University of Missouri all right
[03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:04.800]  marco rubio the new billionaire boy toy was left speechless on the fourth
[03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:07.920]  GOP debate when ran paul called him on his absurd
[03:05:07.920 --> 03:05:11.760]  pandering to the military industrial complex in his attempt to outdo
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:15.760]  hillary clinton with free college and yes I do want to rebuild the American
[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:19.280]  military rebuild the american military seriously rubio
[03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:22.880]  but you know we spend more on our military than the next 10 countries
[03:05:22.880 --> 03:05:26.080]  combined I know that rand is a committed isolationist for marco's
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:29.360]  perspective if you don't have more than the seven obama wars going
[03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:33.600]  you're an isolationist perhaps it'd be safer if we were involved in 10 wars or
[03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:38.560]  maybe even better picked a fight with russia so rubio's masters could cash in
[03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:43.760]  marco how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar
[03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:46.800]  expenditure for the federal government that's not paying for
[03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:51.280]  how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollars
[03:05:51.280 --> 03:05:54.560]  in military expenditures you cannot be a conservative
[03:05:54.560 --> 03:05:58.000]  if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for
[03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:01.520]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in

[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:27.360]  discussing a very radical idea bulldozing the entire campus there at
[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:30.240]  missou it must be racist you know it was there
[03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:34.880]  built after the land grant designed after uh the university of virginia
[03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:39.360]  just all sorts of racist implications there i think that's a phenomenal idea
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:43.440]  hopefully we can get a petition started uh to just do away with this racism
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:46.400]  altogether who cares you know about the historical
[03:08:46.400 --> 03:08:50.480]  accuracy of anything um i think you know this is what's happening with our
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:54.800]  country now these kids are so radical um you know in their tolerance that we're
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:57.120]  just going to do away with everything so we're going to talk more about that
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:00.640]  coming up joe bigs is going to be joining me in the studio
[03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:03.680]  after about 230 today we want to talk about veterans day
[03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:07.040]  talk about some of the problems that veterans are facing
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:10.720]  in the professional workplace of course the white house is now
[03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:14.640]  trying to say that they're going to ease veterans access to care
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:17.920]  you know we've had all these issues there with the va and we haven't really
[03:09:17.920 --> 03:09:22.320]  seen uh a lot being done in that respect so joe bigs will be
[03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:26.240]  in here we also got a pretty uh groundbreaking video that we want to
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:29.360]  see you know what does joe big think think about this there's another
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:33.440]  unconventional warfare exercise taking place in texas and
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:36.560]  um be notes to everyone we just kind of want to know why are they doing these
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:42.240]  unconventional warfare tests once again kind of in quiet in secret um and then
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:45.760]  of course we're going to talk a little bit about the debate um
[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:49.840]  give you our synopsis some of our highlights covering the debate and
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:52.160]  you know who did you think were the night's big winners
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:57.200]  and losers and it was pretty clear to me from what I saw that
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:02.160]  everyone that's there is aside from ran paul is pushing for world war three so
[03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:05.760]  that was pretty frightening now let's talk about what is
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:10.160]  happening on college campuses across the united states
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:13.760]  they are no longer pumping out the the next generation of
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:19.280]  intellectuals these are people who are completely afraid of being
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:22.560]  introduced to any ideas that are contrary to their own
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:26.320]  and they're getting a lot of momentum now they actually have
[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:30.400]  uh the president of the university of missouri's school system
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:33.600]  resigning he didn't even put up a fight now
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:36.560]  he is the president of the university of missouri that particular school but he
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:41.360]  resides over a four school system so that is a lot of power there
[03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:45.280]  and he just stepped down without a fight you know he didn't come right out and
[03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:49.600]  say i'm sorry for my white privilege which was of course one of the demands
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:54.720]  of those students but you know i mean that for me was just pretty shocking
[03:10:54.720 --> 03:10:59.040]  so of course now we're going to start seeing a lot of other race protests
[03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:02.560]  scattered around the us they're reporting other campuses
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:06.800]  are going to do this in solidarity but what what other presidents are going to
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:10.720]  be resigning what other teachers who are caught on camera
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:14.640]  telling photojournalists to get lost or she's going to you know get some weight
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:17.760]  in to remove them now of course we've learned that
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:23.280]  melissa clique has resigned from her courtesy appointment with the missouri
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:27.200]  school of journalism she was of course the uh loud
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:30.960]  mouth there on camera that was yelling at that photojournalist and she
[03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:36.000]  issued an apology afterward but that wasn't enough she also had to resign
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:40.400]  her courtesy appointment but then we find out
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:45.600]  that this hunger strike the hunger striker he was kind of the main one
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:50.080]  that started this whole thing now we learned from his facebook page that
[03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:53.920]  first it was due to planned parenthood being removed from campus that is
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:57.600]  according to missouri state law the president of the the university of
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:01.120]  missouri had nothing to do with that but he was also really upset about the
[03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:04.080]  removal of of student health care which of course
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:08.080]  that's thanks to obama care once again the president of the university of
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:11.200]  missouri had nothing to do with that but you know
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:14.080]  there wasn't even any evidence for a lot of these racial incidents that they
[03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:18.080]  said happened this alleged swastika that was put on the
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:21.440]  wall with some poop the poop sticker there they
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:25.120]  didn't have any pictures of that but i guess they didn't take any dna samples
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:28.800]  i don't really know what happened with that but you know
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:32.400]  there was only one instance that was actually reported to the police
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:36.880]  and the president did issue something about that so that was the one thing
[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:40.560]  all of these other claims of racism there was no evidence for it
[03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:43.520]  but now it turns out this mizu hunger striker
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:47.440]  who claims that he's so oppressed and it's white privilege
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:50.960]  and he you know asked the president to resign and all this he said
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:56.560]  he comes from a family worth 20 million dollars his father is a railroad vp
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:03.840]  he made about 8.4 million last year so what and so these are the people that
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:07.680]  have this agenda activists i'm sorry everyone activists
[03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:11.680]  have an agenda they will lie to do what it takes to
[03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:14.960]  to get their demands met to have the president resign
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:18.720]  here this guy is you know comes from a family worth 20 million
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:22.880]  um now kit daniels and jacari jackson also talked about how they were
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:27.440]  uh getting these people coming up and asking them if it was true that kkk was
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:31.040]  on campus well it turns out that was a rumor that was put
[03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:33.920]  out by uh i guess the student body president
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:37.120]  and he said that he there was a confirmed sighting of a kkk member on
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:40.480]  campus and he got everyone riled up you know stay indoors
[03:13:40.480 --> 03:13:43.440]  it's very frightening this and that and then
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:47.840]  turns out that wasn't even true but you know but it didn't matter because by
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:51.360]  then it had already gotten legs and everyone was saying kkk was on
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:54.560]  campus so this is the type of craziness that is
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:58.320]  going on forget about cognitive development on campus
[03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:02.560]  higher education has now embraced emotional reasoning
[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:06.160]  that is the i feel it therefore it must be true
[03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:10.640]  and the only way that you can respect me is by validating my subjective
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:13.760]  feelings i don't have to provide you with any evidence
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:17.440]  of my claims i don't have to file a police report i just have to tell you
[03:14:17.440 --> 03:14:21.280]  that i'm hurt and i'm sad and now you
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:24.960]  and your white privilege need to step down so i want to play this video from
[03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:28.000]  Paul Joseph Watson he pretty much sums it up
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:32.400]  so let's go ahead and roll that progressives and social justice warriors
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:36.320]  have launched an ideological jihad against free speech
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:40.480]  and the very bedrock of what education is supposed to represent
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:43.920]  free thinking logic debate dissent
[03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:47.440]  open inquiry under their new regime of safe spaces
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:50.880]  trigger warnings and the right not to be offended
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:54.880]  the intolerant regressive left has targeted all these things
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:59.840]  for abolition at universities across america administrators agreed to
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:04.480]  literally rip up copies of the constitution because it triggered
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:09.600]  investigators who are posing as students
[03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:12.960]  at Yale a professor was surrounded by a hysterical mob
[03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:18.080]  who used Maoist red god tactics to intimidate and shout him down
[03:15:18.080 --> 03:15:25.120]  the exception is because other people have rights to not just
[03:15:25.120 --> 03:15:31.120]  i don't agree with that
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:34.720]  i have a different step down if that is what you think about being a
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:38.640]  president step down it is not about pretty intellectual
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:43.120]  things his hate crime writing an email critical of the students
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:48.800]  efforts to censor offensive halloween costumes at missouri university
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:52.240]  president tim wolf and others were forced to resign
[03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:55.840]  in part for not acknowledging their white privilege
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:59.920]  and refusing to echo the debunked narrative behind the michael brown
[03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:04.480]  shooting radicals and professors then openly called for using mob
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:08.400]  violence to silence the first amendment right of the press
[03:16:08.400 --> 03:16:13.520]  to cover the story i made it can i talk to you no you need to get out
[03:16:13.520 --> 03:16:17.440]  you need to get out no i don't you need to get out
[03:16:17.440 --> 03:16:21.120]  i actually don't all right
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:25.840]  we're out of here i need to bust them over here
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:41.120]  the university in the uk arranged a conference on censorship
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:45.600]  then censored conservatives from taking part because it might offend
[03:16:45.600 --> 03:16:47.840]  someone feelings are more important than facts
[03:16:47.840 --> 03:16:51.920]  yeah this is wrong you're all crazy
[03:16:51.920 --> 03:16:56.240]  stop violating me with your different opinions i have the right to speak my
[03:16:56.240 --> 03:17:00.240]  mind no we have the right not to be offended for years people have played
[03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:03.840]  down the threat posed by sjw's to free speech
[03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:07.600]  oh they're only dumb teenagers on tumblr just ignore them they'll go away
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:11.760]  this past week has completely demolished that naive assumption these
[03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:15.040]  people will be teaching our children they'll be in
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:19.760]  government with the full force of the state behind them now even liberal
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:23.680]  professors are admitting that they're frightened of their own students
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:26.880]  zealotry instead of producing the next generation of
[03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:31.600]  intellectuals these universities are churning out crazed cult members
[03:17:31.600 --> 03:17:36.640]  who have declared war on free speech this is not going to end well for
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:41.120]  society and unless actual liberals stand up for true
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:45.120]  intellectual tolerance and authentic classical
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:49.600]  liberalism the future for free speech in the west
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:56.960]  is doomed and that was paul joseph watson and that is it i mean this is
[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:01.360]  frightening this is the future of america they think that it is progressive
[03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:06.800]  to launch a relentless attack on the values of this country was founded upon
[03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:09.840]  due to their feelings you cannot hurt their feelings and
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:12.400]  you know be one thing if this was an isolated event
[03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:16.400]  but these are students coming out of prestigious
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:20.320]  colleges who are going to be the future teachers of the world and lawyers
[03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:23.680]  i mean they actually had a law school that was
[03:18:23.680 --> 03:18:28.480]  working on not using the word violate as in violate the law
[03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:32.800]  because it could possibly trigger some students so this is what's happening
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:38.640]  we're going into pc craziness um and you know we're basically now
[03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:41.680]  universities are breeding ground for homogenous thought
[03:18:41.680 --> 03:18:45.120]  so it's all about you know zero tolerance at creating a class of
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:48.560]  exceptionally thin skinned humans that are going to be
[03:18:48.560 --> 03:18:51.600]  absolutely useless in the real world can you imagine
[03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:56.080]  how many lawsuits are going to be coming about uh in the workplace
[03:18:56.080 --> 03:18:59.760]  if they're upset or their feelings are heard over something
[03:18:59.760 --> 03:19:03.920]  so you know these are real world things that are going to be a huge issue once
[03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:07.760]  these people leave their safe space of academia
[03:19:07.760 --> 03:19:11.920]  now when we come back we're going to be talking a little bit about
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:16.080]  you know some more about this but we we also want to do the debate wrap up

[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:13.600]  overdrive i am leon macadoo and we're gonna go ahead and talk about some of
[03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:16.720]  the debate highlights even the haters had to agree
[03:24:16.720 --> 03:24:20.400]  paul came out on top uh he was looking really good
[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:25.040]  looking at drudge report the drudge polls uh you all decided
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:28.480]  trump cruise paul and rubio took the lead
[03:24:28.480 --> 03:24:32.240]  after this debate um what i was surprised to see was
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:36.720]  kasek was out there talking a lot and of course he was talking about
[03:24:36.720 --> 03:24:40.160]  taking down wall street and all of that meanwhile this is the guy that sat on
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:44.480]  the board layman brothers during the whole crash so what is he talking about
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:48.000]  it's just like hillary clinton saying she's going to come after her
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:51.920]  biggest donors which are from the big banks and wall street and all that so
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:56.400]  it's it's just a total farce but let's look at some of these
[03:24:56.400 --> 03:25:01.440]  publications that have been really attacking ran paul relentlessly
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:05.200]  over the weeks the huff huffington post slate and salon
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:08.800]  so these were unexpected sources that were
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:13.680]  applauding paul's performance um saying he it was clear he came out ahead
[03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:17.440]  there's plenty of reasons to oppose ran paul's political philosophy but he at
[03:25:17.440 --> 03:25:20.480]  least has won and it's both coherent and
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:23.840]  consistent and that was evident last night that's been my big
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:26.800]  praise in support of ran paul is that he has been
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:31.360]  consistent and the votes that he's been making uh there
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:34.640]  have been you know not because oh i'm running for president so i've got to
[03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:38.880]  vote this way or that way he votes um you know on his libertarian
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:43.280]  ideals so i i appreciate that um but one of the things that i thought was
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:47.200]  probably the most powerful obviously yes he called everybody out on
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:50.640]  not being actual fiscal conservatives and how adding
[03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:54.240]  trillions of dollars to the debt without being able to pay for it
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:57.680]  was not conservative value um but i really
[03:25:57.680 --> 03:26:02.080]  you know it was powerful for me when he was calling everybody out on their
[03:26:02.080 --> 03:26:07.760]  hawkish war ideals of saying putting this no fly zone over syria or
[03:26:07.760 --> 03:26:11.760]  iraq that is basically saying russia if you fly we're
[03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:15.280]  going to shoot down your planes which means
[03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:17.840]  we're going to have to be sending our sons and daughters
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:22.160]  to world war three that's what that means and a lot of people don't realize
[03:26:22.160 --> 03:26:25.840]  that they just say yeah we need to go police the world and set up an old
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:28.880]  fly zone and show those russians whose boss and
[03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:33.120]  you know that's not what that means it means your children are going
[03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:36.560]  to war and you know now they're already talking about
[03:26:36.560 --> 03:26:41.760]  um should women have to be included in the draft if they want this full
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:44.320]  equality and women want to be there in the military
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:48.080]  should women be able to be drafted in as well so that means your sons and
[03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:51.600]  daughters there could be a draft i mean who knows where this thing could go
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:54.400]  because we're seeing all on the conservative side
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:58.720]  as well as they're on the democratic side um now that here's another article
[03:26:58.720 --> 03:27:02.160]  we've got up at info wars dot com lord of the rings star
[03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:06.560]  slams bernie sanders says he's just as hawkish as hillary clinton
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:10.400]  so it really doesn't matter who we vote for and that's why we got to be
[03:27:10.400 --> 03:27:15.680]  uh very conscious and call them out on that like rand paul did and say
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:19.600]  i want everyone to understand what this means if you're calling for a no fly
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:24.080]  zone over russia you're actually saying let's go to world war three
[03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:27.920]  because that's what that means now this is uh vigo mortensen we've had him on
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:32.240]  the show before you know very well spoken intelligent man
[03:27:32.240 --> 03:27:36.080]  and uh basically calling out bernie sanders saying he's just as hawk
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:39.920]  hawkish as hillary clinton um and
[03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:44.400]  he he says i really don't think hillary clinton who voted for the invasion
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:47.760]  is going to be bringing the subject up on her own neither would bernie sanders
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:51.680]  frankly because he has also voted for every military appropriation
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:55.680]  he's just as hawkish as she is now bernie sanders
[03:27:55.680 --> 03:27:58.960]  has voted against some military appropriation bills
[03:27:58.960 --> 03:28:05.680]  um but he's you know he's staunchly pro-israel his foreign policy stance so
[03:28:05.680 --> 03:28:10.880]  we kind of know how that goes and you know
[03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:14.400]  i'm just really concerned with with what's actually going to be happening
[03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:17.760]  here in the the coming years because the president that we vote in next not
[03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:20.640]  only is it they're going to have to be dealing with a huge job
[03:28:20.640 --> 03:28:23.600]  jobs crisis uh the fact that everything is going now to
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:28.000]  automation we have people calling for higher minimum wage which of course
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:32.160]  trump was right in that saying you know what there's no way that we can sustain
[03:28:32.160 --> 03:28:36.720]  that we are now going to be competing thanks to this tpp we're going to be
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:40.880]  competing with more of the world we've got you know massive um illegal
[03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:43.840]  immigration happening which is also going to be affecting the jobs that are
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:48.080]  going to be available for people and you know there are going to be a huge
[03:28:48.080 --> 03:28:51.680]  crisis here and now we've got the fact that they want to
[03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:57.920]  fix the economy by going for more war that seems to always be the solution
[03:28:57.920 --> 03:29:01.600]  now we're going to be playing up some of our debate highlights for you coming
[03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:05.120]  up in the next segment um joe biggs will be in as well he had a lot of things to
[03:29:05.120 --> 03:29:10.960]  say during the debate coverage last night you know but i was uh pretty
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:14.640]  pretty pleased with what happened there on stage especially the fact
[03:29:14.640 --> 03:29:18.560]  let's not let's not forget ran paul called out you know a lot of people
[03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:22.720]  want to say he's obama's cheerleader when it comes to foreign policy but he
[03:29:22.720 --> 03:29:27.040]  actually called out the fact that the number one thing we need to do is stop
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:30.240]  arming our enemies if that's how we want to stop this
[03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:34.480]  stop sending weapons to isis stop arming al qaeda
[03:29:34.480 --> 03:29:37.920]  that's the big issue here and he was one of the only people
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:41.600]  that actually had the gall to say it and actually had the gall to say we need
[03:29:41.600 --> 03:29:47.680]  to do away with the federal reserve which is the crux of the issue here
[03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:51.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:51.520 --> 03:30:00.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.720 --> 03:30:05.440]  marco rubio the new billionaire boy toy was left speechless on the fourth gp
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:08.160]  debate when ran paul called him on his absurd
[03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:12.000]  pandering to the military industrial complex in his attempt to outdo
[03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:16.000]  hillary clinton with free college and yes i do want to rebuild the american
[03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:20.560]  military rebuild the american military seriously rubio but you know we spend
[03:30:20.560 --> 03:30:24.560]  more on our military than the next 10 countries combined i know that rand is a
[03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:27.840]  committed isolationist for marco's perspective if you don't have more than
[03:30:27.840 --> 03:30:32.240]  the seven obama wars going you're an isolationist perhaps would be safer if
[03:30:32.240 --> 03:30:34.800]  we were involved in 10 wars or maybe even better
[03:30:34.800 --> 03:30:38.800]  picked a fight with russia so rubio's masters could cash in
[03:30:38.800 --> 03:30:44.000]  marco how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar
[03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:47.600]  expenditure for the federal government that's not paying for how is it
[03:30:47.600 --> 03:30:52.080]  conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military
[03:30:52.080 --> 03:30:55.200]  expenditures you cannot be a conservative if you're going to
[03:30:55.200 --> 03:30:58.480]  keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for

[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:14.720]  your veterans day thank you so much for coming in and yeah i've been to uh
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:18.640]  four different restaurants thus far i ended at hooters it's been a
[03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:22.640]  fantastic lunch thus far and i really appreciated what you had to say
[03:35:22.640 --> 03:35:26.080]  yesterday in your video uh where you were saying happy birthday to the marine
[03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:29.200]  corps but one of the things you were reminding people about with
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:33.360]  veterans day it's not about just going up and saying thank you for your service
[03:35:33.360 --> 03:35:37.360]  it's about saying hey man what how are you how are you doing
[03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:40.400]  is everything okay that's what the veterans really need
[03:35:40.400 --> 03:35:43.760]  yeah there's a lot of people out there who who are anti-war and i can understand
[03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:47.120]  that that's fine you know horrible wars that don't make a sense
[03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:50.480]  you know make any sense whatsoever that that's not good at all but guess what
[03:35:50.480 --> 03:35:52.800]  there's still men and women out there who
[03:35:52.800 --> 03:35:56.000]  believe like i did hey i'm trying to do something for my country they're not
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:58.640]  out there for any bad reasons they're out there because
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:02.000]  you know they're trying to help further the gobless agenda whatever you may
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:05.520]  think it is no there's people out there men and women who say hey i want to do
[03:36:05.520 --> 03:36:08.400]  something for america because i do think it's the greatest country
[03:36:08.400 --> 03:36:11.120]  and you know simply saying thank you that's nice and all but it kind of makes
[03:36:11.120 --> 03:36:13.360]  us feel awkward really at the end of the day you know what we care about
[03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:16.720]  hey man how you doing how do you feel man because you know what 90% of those
[03:36:16.720 --> 03:36:20.240]  injuries you do get overseas they're not external you can't see them they're
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:23.760]  not the missing limbs legs scars burn marks all that
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:26.960]  stuff they're internal it's that deep depression you get through every day
[03:36:26.960 --> 03:36:30.080]  it's the suicidal thoughts it's all of that the massive
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:33.280]  drinking i mean when you see someone like that go up and say hey man are you
[03:36:33.280 --> 03:36:35.760]  all right you need anything i'm here for you
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:38.400]  you know because a lot of times people forget about those guys and it's not that
[03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:41.440]  they need to be thanked they just want to be remembered a little bit
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:44.480]  and to feel like people out there care about them
[03:36:44.480 --> 03:36:47.840]  not because they need that extra attention but because when you go through
[03:36:47.840 --> 03:36:51.680]  that experience like as they're showing combat pictures i've been through
[03:36:51.680 --> 03:36:58.560]  this and that things i've survived um you go through things to where you don't
[03:36:58.560 --> 03:37:02.400]  you don't think that you can ever assimilate you don't ever think you're
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:06.960]  going to be able to fit into civilian life again right
[03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:10.080]  and i'm telling you when i got back from afghanistan that last time and then i
[03:37:10.080 --> 03:37:13.920]  got sent from fort bragg to big's army airfield no pass of
[03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:17.440]  texas i felt completely alone right and i was even around veterans in
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:20.560]  because i was still in the army but i was in a new place i'm coming out of
[03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:25.360]  hard combat and i was lost i was suicidal they were
[03:37:25.360 --> 03:37:29.360]  giving me pills i was going to the the army doctors every day william bowmont
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:32.160]  i can't remember all the different hospitals but
[03:37:32.160 --> 03:37:36.640]  they would just push these drugs down me and not even think twice
[03:37:36.640 --> 03:37:39.760]  about the adverse reactions about what was going to happen
[03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:43.120]  about what i've been through how i'm psychologically able to
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:46.080]  understand things and deal with things and that's what the medical
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:49.680]  professions out there the people in the va need to understand right they keep
[03:37:49.680 --> 03:37:52.960]  hiring these 20 year old kids who come out of you know medical school or
[03:37:52.960 --> 03:37:56.160]  some kind of form or you know they're 28 and they've they've gone from high
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:37:59.840]  school to college to med school they don't know anything about a veteran
[03:37:59.840 --> 03:38:02.480]  they don't know anything about serving they don't know anything about combat
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:05.600]  and all of a sudden you think that you're going to be my psychiatrist
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:09.360]  how in the hell am i supposed to open up to you right when you've never pulled
[03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:12.960]  the trigger when you've never had that mate to make that decision between life
[03:38:12.960 --> 03:38:17.360]  and death when it's a little kid holding a grenade or a whole convoy or a whole
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:20.400]  home of your buddies you know i got a buddy who's death now
[03:38:20.400 --> 03:38:23.760]  because some kid ran out of a bizarre and through a hand grenade
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:27.120]  that's horrible that stuff haunts me all the time i mean do you shoot that kid
[03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:31.360]  what do you do you know we join the military because we want to serve our
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:34.720]  nation at the end of the day we're not the ones who decide where we go
[03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:38.400]  i don't know if i'm going to go to iraq afghanistan bosnia
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:43.760]  syria syria syria syria syria you know
[03:38:43.760 --> 03:38:46.320]  wherever they throw at us that's where we have to go because that's what we
[03:38:46.320 --> 03:38:50.320]  signed up for but what we want in return is
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:54.240]  we're willing to lay our life down for our country but we want a little bit
[03:38:54.240 --> 03:38:58.720]  of respect and a little bit of something from our government
[03:38:58.720 --> 03:39:03.040]  now they're talking about sending troops now to you know back to irek
[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:07.040]  hold on man you haven't even dealt with us here yet we've had a small break
[03:39:07.040 --> 03:39:11.840]  There's a minute amount of people overseas right now, like in Afghanistan, things like that.
[03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:16.400]  They want to send more people overseas in the harm's way. You can't even take care of us
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:20.880]  from Vietnam and up with what's going on here. You've got a whole lot of people who need
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:27.280]  mental evaluations. We need people who, I need good psychiatrists, people we can talk to,
[03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:31.200]  people that have that training, people who have been there. And that's where the VA needs to do
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:34.720]  something. They need to pull people who are getting out because there's a lot of veterans
[03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:39.040]  right now who are homeless. There's a lot of veterans right now who can't get a job. Guess
[03:39:39.040 --> 03:39:43.360]  what? A VA is a good place for them because I'm going to open up and talk to a guy who's been to
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:47.920]  Iraq, who's been to Afghanistan, who's been to Vietnam, who survived that, who's been in
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:52.720]  the trenches and seen what I've seen, done what I've done. That's how I'm going to be able to cope
[03:39:52.720 --> 03:39:57.040]  with what's going on. And when I try to open up, I'm going to be able to break through some barriers
[03:39:57.040 --> 03:40:00.880]  if I have a chance to actually talk to somebody who's been there. But when there's some snot in
[03:40:00.880 --> 03:40:06.080]  those little kid and all he's got is to further the, you know, the pharmaceutical agenda to push
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:11.360]  some drug down my throat, I shell up. Well, you're, you know, you're a strong person. So you were
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:16.000]  able to kind of- No, I'm great. Well, yeah, I'm strong. I got rid of the medications, but I still
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:21.200]  have issues. Right. But I learned that if someone gave me a poem a long time ago, it's called I
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:25.920]  Wear My Mask. And basically that's what I do. I'm a great actor when it comes to hiding my
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:30.080]  emotions. There's a lot of times I don't want to be around. There's a lot of times I just fill
[03:40:30.080 --> 03:40:35.920]  down and out and I hate my life. But I put on that mask and I go through the day and I act happy
[03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:40.240]  as hell and I try to joke and do what I can to suppress that stuff. Because at the end of the
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:44.720]  day, how am I going to open up to people around me when they've never been there? Right. Well,
[03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:48.880]  you know, and that was one of the really powerful things that I learned. I interviewed some people
[03:40:48.880 --> 03:40:56.080]  on the show that making a Project 22. And Project 22 was a movie, a documentary that was created by
[03:40:56.080 --> 03:41:00.640]  two combat wounded veterans. And they were really upset about the fact that 22 veterans are committing
[03:41:00.640 --> 03:41:07.280]  suicide every day. So they head out on this project 22 to go and reach those veterans before
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:11.440]  they, it's not about raising awareness of the suicide, but actually reaching them
[03:41:11.440 --> 03:41:17.200]  before they do commit suicide before they get there. And throughout this documentary, you learn
[03:41:17.760 --> 03:41:24.080]  just why, you know, these veterans are going through this and why they come back and how
[03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:27.360]  they could be going through this PTSD. And like you said, they're getting these drugs,
[03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:32.720]  which by the way, are black labeled. So this black label basically says, Hey, you know,
[03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:36.240]  we're not going to give this to the regular population of people. They're not FDA approved
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:41.600]  whatsoever. They use us as guinea pigs on everything. And they don't ever make the connection
[03:41:41.600 --> 03:41:46.080]  that that's the reason people are blowing their brains. Well, it says right there on the thing,
[03:41:46.080 --> 03:41:52.160]  by the way, this in men, particularly between the ages of, you know, 20, 26 years old,
[03:41:52.160 --> 03:41:57.440]  it is more likely that they are going to commit suicide. I mean, it says that right on the pill
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:42:02.800]  bottle. And one of the men that was interviewed in this movie said that he was taking like 30 pills
[03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:07.680]  several times a day. And that was what was prescribed to him by the VA. Oh, take this pill
[03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:11.120]  for that. Oh, now you need to take this for that and this for that. No wonder these people are
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:17.760]  going completely crazy. And you know, so here, this really powerful movie project 22, it's also,
[03:42:18.400 --> 03:42:21.600]  you know, it's good for the veterans to let them know, you know, you're not alone and here are
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:27.120]  some alternative therapies that you can take that are going to help you reconnect back with society,
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:31.200]  help you, you know, to take those tools that you have in your tool bag. I mean, let's face it,
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:37.600]  the veterans are probably the most equipped members of society. Yet we just tell them to
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:42.960]  throw their tool bag, you know, into the basement when they return to civil is civilization. And
[03:42:42.960 --> 03:42:47.280]  so then you're here and and you don't know how to transfer those talents and that skill.
[03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:52.880]  But, you know, also this movie is really good for those of us who have never been to war and who
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:56.320]  don't know what people are going through. That's another big thing. That's another big thing.
[03:42:56.320 --> 03:43:00.880]  Like, you know, in relationships, that's always been my problem. I can't ever find, you know,
[03:43:00.880 --> 03:43:04.800]  it's hard to find a woman who actually can understand what it is I'm going through with
[03:43:04.800 --> 03:43:09.120]  my mood swings. Hey, guess what? It's going to happen. There's some days I feel fine. There's
[03:43:09.120 --> 03:43:13.840]  a day that I wake up and I just don't want to exist. I don't know why that happened, but that is a
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:17.920]  reaction of what I've been through. You know, I'll never forget this one certain day. I was in
[03:43:17.920 --> 03:43:23.520]  El Paso, Texas. I was driving eastbound on Zaragoza towards my new house that I just moved in with
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:31.120]  my buddy. And I'd stopped at a couple bars and had like a drink here and there. And I just felt
[03:43:31.120 --> 03:43:34.880]  alone. All of a sudden, I felt like I was in this bubble by myself, but I was surrounded by women,
[03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:39.840]  people everywhere. Anybody would have had a great time. But for some reason, I just felt like I
[03:43:39.840 --> 03:43:44.320]  just felt like I was all alone and had nothing to do. And I jumped in my car and I started screaming
[03:43:44.320 --> 03:43:48.720]  and crying. And I started punching my steering wheel and my horns going off in the parking lot.
[03:43:48.720 --> 03:43:53.280]  And I'm just hitting everything I can. I've still got fist marks in my car where I was just screaming.
[03:43:53.920 --> 03:43:57.600]  And I didn't know what to do. I didn't know why this was happening. And then I started getting
[03:43:57.600 --> 03:44:03.120]  so frustrated and angry that I was, why was I this angry? What is going on? And I ran home and I
[03:44:03.120 --> 03:44:07.840]  took every freaking ambient that I had because I just, I'd had enough. And I took a whole bottle
[03:44:07.840 --> 03:44:12.560]  of Ambien truck, the whole bottle of tequila and walked out into the desert because my,
[03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:16.960]  the, the lining of houses at that point in time, everything in our backyard was a desert. There
[03:44:16.960 --> 03:44:22.400]  was nothing out there. It hadn't been developed yet. So I went out there and I was like, you know,
[03:44:22.400 --> 03:44:27.120]  I'm just ready to go. I can't take this anymore. I'm just sick and tired of going through this stuff
[03:44:27.120 --> 03:44:32.400]  all the time. And this girl that I know, Becky from South Carolina up and calls my phone out of
[03:44:32.400 --> 03:44:37.200]  nowhere and says, Hey, I had this bad feeling. Are you okay? And I just broke down again and
[03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:42.000]  next thing you know, she called the fire department. They came and got me, took me to the hospital and
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:46.560]  you know, everyone's from my unit like, Hey, are you okay? And I'm like, Oh, I'm fine. It's just
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:50.240]  a misunderstanding. And I played it off. I put my mask on and said, Oh yeah, I didn't do anything.
[03:44:50.240 --> 03:44:54.800]  What are you guys talking about? I'm fine. I don't have PTSD. And I went home and I lied to
[03:44:54.800 --> 03:44:58.640]  everybody and said I was a okay because I didn't know how to open up to anybody. Because when
[03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:02.080]  you do automatically in the military, they say there's an open door policy, but there's not.
[03:45:02.080 --> 03:45:06.080]  They say that you're crazy and that you can't handle anymore. Then they'll put you in some,
[03:45:06.080 --> 03:45:09.600]  some crappy unit where you're never going to go and do what you love to do again.
[03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:13.920]  And then you're going to hate your life even more. I went home. I threw every single pill down the
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:19.200]  toilet. I said, screw this stuff, screw all this crap. I'm never doing it again. Because I understood
[03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:24.560]  that I wasn't angry. I didn't, I wasn't depressed. I didn't hate my life. It was these freaking pills
[03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:31.280]  that were doing this to me was the fact that the doctors didn't give one care about me whatsoever.
[03:45:31.280 --> 03:45:36.640]  And then I was like, you know what? I'm done. And that's why there are 22 people taking themselves
[03:45:36.640 --> 03:45:41.840]  a day. I've had two this year, two buddies, one guy who wore a mask just as well as I did. So I
[03:45:41.840 --> 03:45:46.560]  couldn't tell that he was depressed. I couldn't tell that he wanted to kill himself at all. And I
[03:45:46.560 --> 03:45:51.200]  go in one day to go hang out with him and he's not there. You know, that's horrible. And that's
[03:45:51.200 --> 03:45:55.440]  really powerful because that's exactly what it is, is taking that time to just make that phone
[03:45:55.440 --> 03:45:59.920]  call and just reach out and say, Hey, how are you doing today? Are you okay? And knowing that you
[03:45:59.920 --> 03:46:03.680]  are going to put on that mask, because that's how you've been trained to deal with, you know,
[03:46:03.680 --> 03:46:07.280]  you don't cry, you don't get to cry on the battlefield. So when you come back here,
[03:46:07.280 --> 03:46:13.040]  you don't know how to filter all those emotions. I mean, it's not a video game, you know, war is
[03:46:13.040 --> 03:46:18.640]  not a video game. And that's why for me, watching the debate last night and just seeing this craziness
[03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:25.840]  of all these people foaming at the mouth to send even more people to a battle that we the US
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:32.560]  government is sending weapons to our enemies in order to create this chaos. They love the soldiers
[03:46:32.560 --> 03:46:36.000]  when it's time to send them to combat, but they don't love you when you get back. They don't love
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:41.120]  to take care of you. They don't care about you. And I'm not saying that it's a bad profession to go
[03:46:41.120 --> 03:46:45.760]  into. I think we have to make change from the inside. But you know, come on people out there,
[03:46:45.760 --> 03:46:50.960]  Washington do something. Yeah, there's people out there literally on the edge. Yeah, Trump is really
[03:46:50.960 --> 03:46:54.880]  one of the only ones who's actually talking about, you know, the veterans and this is what we need
[03:46:54.880 --> 03:46:59.120]  to do. So of course, now the White House today is stepping up. Now before we go to break, I want
[03:46:59.120 --> 03:47:03.680]  to play this one video and then we'll get your take on it when we come back. So guys, can we go
[03:47:03.680 --> 03:47:10.880]  ahead and roll this? It's a breaking video. It is on UW ex 16. It's an unconventional warfare
[03:47:10.880 --> 03:47:25.520]  exercise 2016 taking place here in Texas. So what did we learn from Jade Helm 15? More importantly,
[03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:30.720]  what did the government learn? Apparently not enough because in March of 2016, U.S. special
[03:47:30.720 --> 03:47:39.120]  forces are redeploying to Texas under a new codename UX 16 short for unconventional warfare
[03:47:39.120 --> 03:47:46.160]  exercise 2016. Unlike Jade Helm 15, where military contractors and officers
[03:47:46.160 --> 03:47:52.880]  presented their plans for public scrutiny, UX 16 was approved by commissioners in secret
[03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:59.680]  without public input effectively handing over Bastrop County, Texas to the U.S. military without
[03:47:59.680 --> 03:48:06.560]  public consent. People are removed from the public debate over military operations within
[03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:14.320]  their own county limits. Effectively, martial law has been declared. In the case of Jade Helm UX 16,
[03:48:14.320 --> 03:48:25.680]  the citizens of Bastrop County don't even know. Now, according to reports, UX 16 will be even
[03:48:25.680 --> 03:48:31.840]  more covert than Jade Helm 15 operating on privately owned properties in the county and
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:39.920]  at Camp Swift. County Judge Paul Pate pulled the press. He is in full support of the next
[03:48:39.920 --> 03:48:46.080]  phase of military operations in Bastrop as he indicated there were, quote, no incidents during
[03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:54.400]  Jade Helm. Despite one local eyewitness, Brian Hoenstein, who stated, we saw a few more uniforms
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:49:01.120]  in restaurants and in the Walmart. Unfortunately for Hoenstein, his response indicates Jade Helm
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:09.040]  15 was a successful conditioning exercise. No wonder the military is returning. Judge Pate's
[03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:15.440]  only concern was the public outcry and paranoia surrounding Jade Helm 15. And he hopes that the
[03:49:15.440 --> 03:49:21.520]  military planners have a better containment policy than last time. He was clear to issue a directive
[03:49:21.520 --> 03:49:27.920]  to special forces to subdue the new name for the operation and refrain from labeling Texas
[03:49:27.920 --> 03:49:34.320]  as hostile territory. Little is known about UX 16 at this time other than it kicks off in March
[03:49:34.320 --> 03:49:41.680]  of 2016 and will be even more covert than Jade Helm. Unfortunately for Judge Pate and the Bastrop
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:47.040]  commissioners, the cat is out of the bag. Fortunately for the free people of Texas,
[03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:52.080]  we get the word out. We'll monitor a military chatter to bring you the latest on this developing
[03:49:52.080 --> 03:49:56.720]  story. Please distribute this news alert to your social networks and subscribe to our YouTube channel
[03:49:56.720 --> 03:50:02.880]  for the updates. This has been a Next News Network special report. All right, so that was sent over
[03:50:02.880 --> 03:50:08.320]  to us from the Next News Network. Of course, they are talking about UWE X 16 at short for
[03:50:08.320 --> 03:50:14.720]  unconventional warfare exercise 2016. This one is obviously happening in a more covert way. We do
[03:50:14.720 --> 03:50:20.960]  have some news outlets reporting on it as well. But you know, I want to get your commentary when
[03:50:20.960 --> 03:50:27.440]  we come back. What do you think about this? Should people be concerned? We put out a lot of information
[03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:32.080]  on Jade Helm, not about the martial law and all that stuff that people tried to portray it as,
[03:50:32.080 --> 03:50:38.080]  but actually showing you based on their own materials there, what they were talking about
[03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:43.840]  with mastering the human domain and what that meant. So obviously this time around, we just want
[03:50:43.840 --> 03:50:48.160]  to make sure people aren't going to be putting words in our mouth. But you know, Joe Biggs,
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:51.440]  I want to get your take on this when we get back.
[03:50:59.120 --> 03:51:04.960]  My name is Don Whisken, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told
[03:51:04.960 --> 03:51:12.000]  I'd be on disability for the rest of my life. What did I do? I created Extendivite, a garlic
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:18.880]  and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life. For over 17 years

[03:52:57.280 --> 03:53:06.160]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages or war. Each of us have had that moment
[03:53:06.160 --> 03:53:10.720]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared. We typically do the same thing. We
[03:53:10.720 --> 03:53:15.760]  start with food storage, then we address the need for water. But have you considered heat storage?
[03:53:15.760 --> 03:53:20.240]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold. Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:53:20.240 --> 03:53:23.600]  How will I keep my family warm? The standard answers are firewood,
[03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:28.400]  coal or propane. But the problem with that if you need to be on the move is, you can't take it with
[03:53:28.400 --> 03:53:33.040]  you. Another concern? There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke,
[03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:37.760]  like in times of war. There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel. The answers
[03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:43.680]  may be simpler and less costly than you think. For these answers, go to fortressclothing.com.
[03:53:43.680 --> 03:53:47.760]  Again, fortressclothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:53:47.760 --> 03:53:53.760]  Don't get stuck in the cold. Fortressclothing.com, you'll never be cold again.
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:26.080]  News Network, talking about UW-EX-16. Is this the next Jade Helm? Is it Jade Helm's return?
[03:54:28.640 --> 03:54:33.600]  Well, I don't get those. Obviously, why would they pick Bastrop? That was one of the biggest
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:37.680]  blowbacks from the majority of the population. They don't want that.
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:46.480]  So they're going to actually stay on Camp Swift? Let's talk about unconventional warfare.
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:50.160]  I mean, this is what they're saying they're training for. This is coming directly from my,
[03:54:50.160 --> 03:54:54.720]  you know, my Army site. Special Forces have long employed the use of unconventional warfare in
[03:54:54.720 --> 03:54:59.680]  enemy territory, unlike direct action missions, which are generally designed to be quick strikes.
[03:54:59.680 --> 03:55:03.680]  Unconventional warfare operations can last months, even years. Unconventional warfare
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:08.800]  missions allow US Army soldiers to enter country covertly and build relationships with local
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:14.560]  militia. Meanwhile, our government hates militia, and we keep using people's property to do these
[03:55:14.560 --> 03:55:20.480]  training missions. Guess what? Majority of Americans are all for the military. They support the
[03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:24.640]  veterans, the troops and all that. But here's my thing. The government's going around and buying
[03:55:24.640 --> 03:55:30.080]  up all this land. There's all these land grabs. I think the government has quite enough property
[03:55:30.080 --> 03:55:34.400]  to do their own training missions on. Why in the hell do they keep coming into places like this?
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:38.000]  We're obviously, there's an outcry where, especially in Bastrop, they don't, they see
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:43.200]  what's going on. They see the implications. Like you said, there's these underlying meanings
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:48.160]  about what's going on in the wordage they use and the pamphlets, their handouts, their online
[03:55:48.160 --> 03:55:52.080]  slides. They really kind of have some disturbing meanings to it. Not saying there's going to be
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:58.960]  martial law, but when they're talking about taking over the human domain, doing all this stuff,
[03:55:58.960 --> 03:56:01.520]  that's got some pretty sinister implications going on in there.
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:05.200]  And when they've already told you, hey, we don't want you here, and now the military
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:10.240]  operations are coming over, taking place in your town anyway, covertly.
[03:56:10.240 --> 03:56:13.520]  Yeah, I mean, you got some judge and you got all these people there saying, oh, well, I want it,
[03:56:13.520 --> 03:56:17.680]  so let's go ahead and have it. What happened to people who are elected and put in a position
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:22.240]  listening to the people who vote? Obviously, those voters out there don't want that going on.
[03:56:22.960 --> 03:56:27.600]  So I think that this is my take on it. Yeah, I think the government or the
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:31.840]  military should train for missions overseas. Obviously, we need that. They used to do this
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:36.160]  J-Tel mission overseas, but I think with a lot of the tension going on, that's why they felt
[03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:40.400]  they could come back here. But obviously, people don't want that. But here's the thing,
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:45.360]  our government has tons of land to use. We're seeing BLM grabs every day. We see,
[03:56:45.360 --> 03:56:51.280]  I mean, you have to pay to go on land. Nature is cost money. Maybe they're thinking, oh,
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:56.400]  see nothing happened there with Jade Helm. And like we pointed out, that's not what it was about.
[03:56:56.400 --> 03:57:01.760]  It was mastering the human domain was much deeper than that. I implore you to go back and look at
[03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:07.040]  these guys on a train for Afghanistan or wherever. Go to Forwa Chook in Arizona. There's all kinds
[03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:10.640]  of private property you can't go on. And that's very mountainous. Right. That's in Arizona. Go
[03:57:10.640 --> 03:57:14.320]  out there and train there. Go to El Paso, move out to White Sands and do all that stuff. But
[03:57:14.320 --> 03:57:17.760]  don't be in people's backyards. Don't go and then that scares the hell out of people, especially
[03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:22.320]  in a town like or in a place like Texas, where guess what? I got a whole bunch of guns. We all
[03:57:22.320 --> 03:57:27.520]  got guns. What happens with a gun? You use a gun for self-defense. It's not to go out and run a gun
[03:57:27.520 --> 03:57:31.200]  and shoot stuff up. It's if you feel threatened and you're on your property and someone's sneaking
[03:57:31.200 --> 03:57:34.880]  through it, this is a thin yourself. Right. You got a baby in there. You're going to go into that
[03:57:34.880 --> 03:57:38.400]  safety mode. So if you've got a whole bunch of special op guys jumping out of planes and
[03:57:38.400 --> 03:57:41.760]  helicopters rolling through, people are going to get scared and they're not going to know what's
[03:57:41.760 --> 03:57:45.520]  going on. Right. Especially in a lot of these backwoods towns where they don't get the news.
[03:57:45.520 --> 03:57:52.080]  When they fired the test, the nuclear test missile right there in LA at like high time for
[03:57:52.080 --> 03:57:56.080]  everyone to see it, they didn't tell anyone about it and they were completely freaked out.
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:58:00.160]  Our government's pushing down World War III down our throats, complete in total. You know,
[03:58:00.160 --> 03:58:03.520]  we're about to get killed by ISIS. People are scared. People are worried. So that's what people
[03:58:03.520 --> 03:58:07.760]  have to look at. Right. No, that's absolutely true. And they're definitely kind of gearing up for
[03:58:07.760 --> 03:58:12.720]  something and getting people used to these unconventional warfare exercises taking place
[03:58:12.720 --> 03:58:20.480]  in these tiny towns, launching nuclear test missiles off the coast of LA and Florida. So,
[03:58:20.480 --> 03:58:24.880]  I mean, they're definitely gearing us up, getting us ready for World War III, whatever.
[03:58:24.880 --> 03:58:29.040]  Hey, happy Veterans Day and happy birthday to the Marine Corps and everybody else out there.
[03:58:29.040 --> 03:58:35.120]  You guys are awesome. We'll see you on the Info Wars nightly news tonight at 7 p.m. Central with
[03:58:35.120 --> 03:59:02.240]  David Knight.
