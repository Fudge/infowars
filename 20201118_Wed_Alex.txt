[00:00.000 --> 00:23.720]  It's Wednesday, November 18th of the year is 2020 and we are living in a paradox.
[00:23.720 --> 00:26.400]  It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.
[00:26.400 --> 00:33.880]  We are seeing a planetary awakening to a UN corporate directed great reset that is designed
[00:33.880 --> 00:40.480]  to usher in an end of all Western freedom and it's exported around the planet.
[00:40.480 --> 00:47.520]  The end of the process, the end of the right of assembly, the end of every basic freedom,
[00:47.520 --> 00:51.280]  that is the goal of the Communist Chinese who are unified with the United Nations in
[00:51.280 --> 00:52.280]  stating.
[00:52.280 --> 00:56.480]  They even have articles in the LA Times saying GG Ping's mission is to crush American system
[00:56.480 --> 01:01.000]  and democracy and our republic and that's really the attitude of these corporations.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.400]  They are conquering everyone very, very cold bloodedly and now you see the footage of your
[01:05.400 --> 01:12.280]  TV viewer, RadioListressIt'sOnInFullWars.com of the police in Germany savagely beating
[01:12.280 --> 01:19.320]  and attacking men, women and children with batons, men in armor running at full speed
[01:19.320 --> 01:24.040]  into crowds of civilians who simply want a right to have their business, a right to
[01:24.040 --> 01:29.400]  go outside, a right to not be tracked, a right to not live in something worse than the Stasi
[01:29.400 --> 01:30.400]  East German system.
[01:30.400 --> 01:36.400]  This is classic tyranny of the highest grade upgraded with a high tech overload and this
[01:36.400 --> 01:41.600]  system is the post industrial world and you see the footage coming out of Australia of
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.440]  people that have been locked for weeks and in some cases months in hotels, tourists that
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.240]  can't get out and aren't even allowed to leave their rooms.
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.400]  In Australia people have to have their dogs take a crap inside the house and they throw
[01:54.400 --> 01:55.960]  it out the windows.
[01:55.960 --> 01:59.320]  This is a lockdown, this is training us to be prisoners and I know as an audience you're
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.400]  amazing people and you get this and you understand it.
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.920]  I'm on the ground here in Georgia, we're going to be demonstrating at the Capitol in just
[02:05.920 --> 02:06.920]  a few hours.
[02:06.920 --> 02:07.920]  I was sure it was about to take over.
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.840]  We're going to have live feeds from the ground and so much more but it is heartening to see
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.280]  all these different German states saying no to Merkel, you're basically a dictator that's
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.760]  rigged the elections, manipulate the parliamentary system, you're nothing but an EU globalist
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.360]  and you're just trying to bankrupt us and make us dependent on you and it's insane.
[02:28.360 --> 02:33.200]  And all the big corporations they're seen as vital, they're seen as essential so they
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.080]  stay open, all their stocks gone up, their profits have gone up in many cases 100% in
[02:38.080 --> 02:44.520]  just the last year and it was the big tech companies that implemented the first lockdowns
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.920]  that then leftist governments followed suit with.
[02:46.920 --> 02:53.440]  So this is a global economic siege, a war by the left, by the big corporations, by the
[02:53.440 --> 02:59.920]  Communist Chinese, all lockstep to consolidate power, take our freedoms and bankrupt us and
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.400]  the very local governments that are going to see their systems bankrupted by the shutdowns
[03:04.400 --> 03:10.480]  are the ones with the police quote just following orders but that violates the Nuremberg precept
[03:10.480 --> 03:13.920]  of just following orders does not protect you, it violates the Geneva Convention and
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.480]  remember behind all of this you can't just submit and get your welfare check now and
[03:17.480 --> 03:18.480]  live in your house.
[03:18.480 --> 03:20.520]  This is beyond clout and pivot.
[03:20.520 --> 03:21.760]  They want medical tyranny.
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.640]  This is about forced inoculations, apps on your phones, tracking everywhere you go and
[03:25.640 --> 03:30.880]  what you do and now in California and places in London and places in Germany they're all
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.560]  announcing the QR codes to be able to go into businesses that read your phone to prove you've
[03:35.560 --> 03:36.560]  quote been vaccinated.
[03:36.560 --> 03:39.800]  That's why all the restaurants now have the QR codes and so that they don't have menus
[03:39.800 --> 03:42.760]  so they're getting you ready to even be able to go and sit down at a restaurant that you've
[03:42.760 --> 03:45.600]  got government pass, you've got government authorization.
[03:45.600 --> 03:48.160]  This is the mark of the beast out of revelation.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.920]  It's not coming, it's here and so many of the big Baptist churches and Catholic churches
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.480]  are putting in the QR codes and doing all the same thing because they're not churches,
[03:56.480 --> 03:57.840]  they've been taken over by the system.
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.840]  So it's going to all get rapidly worse very, very quickly until you say no.
[04:02.840 --> 04:05.680]  The level of tyranny we'll live under is the level of tyranny you put up with.
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.040]  So I'm asking everyone, take the live feeds from Band-Aid video.
[04:09.040 --> 04:13.320]  Take the live feeds from infowords.com, share them by hand, share them on email, share them
[04:13.320 --> 04:16.960]  on text, tell people on the street, put them on the back of business cards.
[04:16.960 --> 04:18.440]  That's how we're going to override this.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.720]  People are really listening right now, traffic to info wars is up like five fold, that's great.
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.400]  The awakening is here and the system is really revealing itself and remember the globalists
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.680]  aren't God.
[04:28.680 --> 04:32.680]  God is in charge and this is a great test but we're going to come through this together.
[04:32.680 --> 04:35.240]  But the answer is stand up and say no.
[04:35.240 --> 04:38.560]  Owen Schreuer is coming up live feeds on the ground from here in Georgia.
[04:38.560 --> 04:39.560]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:39.560 --> 04:59.120]  Please spread the word.
[04:59.120 --> 05:03.560]  Two info wars best selling products are now back in stock for big sold out for months.
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.760]  Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells
[05:08.760 --> 05:14.840]  in the body, that's every human activity and on top of it bodies ultimate tumor formula
[05:14.840 --> 05:19.920]  with 95% or 60% humanoid, leading competitors have 3% to 5%.
[05:19.920 --> 05:23.600]  The things the tumor does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the
[05:23.600 --> 05:25.120]  strongest you're going to find.
[05:25.120 --> 05:30.080]  So both of these are amazing products and they fund the info war, which is a 360 win.
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.800]  On top of it, despite the factor in demand, they've been sold out for months, they're
[05:33.800 --> 05:40.920]  both 50% off triple patriot points and free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[05:40.920 --> 05:46.800]  That's Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed, it's amazing and on top of it, we also have
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.880]  bodies ultimate tumor formula at infowarstore.com.
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.480]  The cell will not last long, I want to thank you all for your support and really to try
[05:54.480 --> 05:55.480]  these products.
[05:55.480 --> 06:20.760]  I absolutely love them because they really, really work, infowarstore.com.
[06:20.760 --> 06:30.760]  Asking through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.760 --> 06:34.520]  Ali, this is just one example of dozens that have already come out in the last day, this
[06:34.520 --> 06:36.800]  is just now breaking in Georgia where we are.
[06:36.800 --> 06:41.640]  Just this morning, it is breaking news, David Schaefer, the Georgia Republican Party Chair
[06:41.640 --> 06:49.160]  tweets this, one of our monitors discovered 9,626 vote air in DeKalb County hand count,
[06:49.160 --> 06:50.640]  that is in Atlanta.
[06:50.640 --> 06:57.800]  One batch was labeled 10,707 votes for Biden and just 13 for Trump, an improbable margin
[06:57.800 --> 06:59.440]  even for DeKalb standards.
[06:59.440 --> 07:07.400]  The actual count for the batch was 1,081 for Biden and 13 for Trump.
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.080]  Had this counting error not been discovered, Biden would have gained enough votes from
[07:11.080 --> 07:16.760]  this one batch alone to cancel out Trump's gains from Fayette County Floyd and Walton.
[07:16.760 --> 07:21.920]  We have to audit the vote and we have to check the signatures in Georgia, that's why Alex
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.200]  Jones and I are here at Ground Zero Georgia.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.200]  Incredible.
[07:26.200 --> 07:31.800]  Ali, what you're saying is in that building, they have now found more scams from the counting
[07:31.800 --> 07:35.280]  of the ballots in that building behind me that just so happens to have CNN on it.
[07:35.280 --> 07:36.280]  I don't believe it.
[07:36.280 --> 07:39.560]  There's no way CNN ever does anything incredible and there's no way there's a blip right there
[07:39.560 --> 07:40.560]  either.
[07:40.560 --> 07:46.640]  Well, CNN owns this town and at the CNN Center is where they counted the Fulton County ballots
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.760]  and folks, election night, we didn't know how many ballots there were, they just kept
[07:50.760 --> 07:55.520]  coming and coming and coming, just like we see at a Broward County, Florida where we
[07:55.520 --> 08:01.200]  did stop to steal 2018, we warned the Republican Party, this was the method, it's not just
[08:01.200 --> 08:05.560]  the Dominion machines, it's the mail-in ballots, it's the absentee ballots, it's these provisional
[08:05.560 --> 08:09.040]  ballots that show up, we have to stop the steal.
[08:09.040 --> 08:13.880]  Come on, let's CNN count the votes.
[08:13.880 --> 08:19.520]  Here in Atlanta, Georgia, at Olympic Park, the site of the false flag attack was blamed
[08:19.520 --> 08:24.960]  on Richard Jewel during the Olympics and there's the CNN Center and building right
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.920]  behind me and we have the Goodyear blip flying around, this is quite a conflagration happening
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.240]  and guess what else happened, they counted a lot of the mysterious votes that had problems
[08:35.240 --> 08:39.280]  inside the CNN building, that was a ballot counting center.
[08:39.280 --> 08:44.800]  So as Stalin said, I don't care who cast the vote, I care who counts them, well, Ollie Alexander,
[08:44.800 --> 08:49.040]  the National Founder, Coordinator of Stop the Steal Movement is here, we've been all
[08:49.040 --> 08:53.720]  over the country together, fighting, we've reached a critical juncture here in Georgia,
[08:53.720 --> 08:58.840]  but first big breaking news, Ollie, on the situation that is just explosive, like out
[08:58.840 --> 09:02.360]  of a Hollywood gangster movie in Michigan, tell us about that.
[09:02.360 --> 09:08.120]  So in Wayne County, Michigan, that's Detroit, the Republicans, two Republicans and two Democrats
[09:08.120 --> 09:13.760]  sit on the canvassing board, the Republicans decided not to certify the election, but under
[09:13.760 --> 09:19.960]  duress and threat from hundreds of thousands of tweets, the leftist, antifa, BLM, they
[09:19.960 --> 09:25.080]  reluctantly agreed under the condition that the Secretary of State would do an audit.
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.800]  We are in legal and constitutional limbo as we don't even understand what that means,
[09:29.800 --> 09:31.280]  what are their rights.
[09:31.280 --> 09:37.560]  So what we have is bullying from the left against people who just want to certify clean elections,
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.840]  want bad elections, and we're just in constitutional limbo, folks, you're going to have to watch
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.800]  InfoWords, you're going to have to watch the Stop the Steal Movement as we navigate this
[09:45.800 --> 09:49.240]  through patriots in the streets and through the courts.
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.880]  And let's talk about why they were saying we're not certifying this and calling for
[09:53.880 --> 09:57.360]  an audit, which they're still calling for an audit, but they did go ahead and say they're
[09:57.360 --> 10:01.840]  going to certify it because things were quote, out of balance at a record level.
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.600]  So they're out of balance at a record level, I think it was double from 2016 to now, and
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.440]  the Republicans were like, there's a human error here, let's figure that out before we
[10:10.440 --> 10:12.680]  send it to the Secretary of State's office.
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.360]  And then the Secretary of State would certify, and then depending on state law, the governor
[10:16.360 --> 10:22.200]  or some other automatic statutory entity would do the final certification to send the electors
[10:22.200 --> 10:23.200]  to the Electoral College.
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.680]  They talk about out of balance, it's a lot of different things that are happening, but
[10:26.680 --> 10:30.960]  you've got 80 plus 90 plus percent turning out, some precincts, 100 percent of the voters
[10:30.960 --> 10:31.960]  turning out.
[10:31.960 --> 10:35.920]  120, 130, 150, more votes than there are voters in those cases.
[10:35.920 --> 10:39.160]  You've got dead people by the thousands voting in Detroit.
[10:39.160 --> 10:40.240]  This is going on.
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.240]  So the brainwashing of, oh, there's no proof, there's no proof, mainstream media won't show
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.920]  the proof, but at infowars.com and Gateway Pundit and all these places, it's a firehose
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.760]  of proof and eyewitnesses and whistleblowers and undercover video of them in Detroit going,
[10:54.760 --> 10:58.200]  listen, we're not letting poll watches in here, we're going to violate the law.
[10:58.200 --> 11:03.080]  And then you have the Democrats that run the state, one of them is a former high-level
[11:03.080 --> 11:07.880]  Southern primary law center, she comes out and starts threatening people that are reporting
[11:07.880 --> 11:10.040]  on it saying, I'll arrest you for reporting on this.
[11:10.040 --> 11:13.480]  I mean, we have the intimidation, we have the fraud, we have the cover-up, we have it
[11:13.480 --> 11:16.320]  all, the people need to stand up peacefully and say no to this.
[11:16.320 --> 11:20.600]  Yes, Michigan is very dangerous, George Soros owns the attorney general there.
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.200]  If we go there, they're going to arrest us and we might just have to make them.
[11:24.200 --> 11:27.960]  Pennsylvania Supreme Court made a decision last night just to piggyback off what you
[11:27.960 --> 11:29.520]  said about poll watchers.
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.760]  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a 5-2 decision said, it doesn't matter that there were no
[11:33.760 --> 11:37.720]  Republicans in some of these polling locations, it's fine.
[11:37.720 --> 11:38.720]  That settled, folks.
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.840]  I'm sure we can take it to the Supreme Court, but I warned everyone weeks ago, Chief Justice
[11:43.840 --> 11:50.040]  Roberts set us up with the Wisconsin decision when he said, oh, it's fine if the state court
[11:50.040 --> 11:53.040]  decides something I don't agree with, my federalism.
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.120]  So don't look for relief out of the Supreme Court out of this bad Pennsylvania decision
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.240]  where they say you don't need Republican poll watchers, that's not damages.
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.600]  We need relief from the legislators in the federal and state constitutions.
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.480]  It's time for them, when there's fraud, to call emergency sessions, which is why we're
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.000]  in Georgia, tell folks about what we're doing the next four days on a row at High Noon.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.800]  So at High Noon, at the Georgia State Capitol, Alex Jones, myself and other patriots are
[12:19.800 --> 12:25.080]  here and we are marching and we are telling the Secretary of State, stop, don't certify.
[12:25.080 --> 12:30.280]  The chances of that happening are zero, but we might stop the deadline that happens 24
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.240]  hours after that, and that's when Governor Brian Kemp, who's been wobbly in this whole
[12:34.240 --> 12:37.920]  issue, then has to certify the election from his office.
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.480]  When he signs a piece of paper certifying the election, it puts a Democrat slate of
[12:42.480 --> 12:44.600]  electors to the Electoral College.
[12:44.600 --> 12:46.600]  We cannot have this happen.
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.480]  If this happens, our remedies in court then become next to nil.
[12:50.480 --> 12:55.400]  What he has to do, what Governor Kemp has to do today, is call the state legislator
[12:55.400 --> 13:00.280]  into an emergency session, keep them through January 9th, and give them broad oversight
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.280]  so they can reclaim their constitutional powers, and it's their duty, it's their obligation
[13:05.280 --> 13:06.600]  to select electors.
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.680]  They need to reclaim that constitutional power.
[13:08.680 --> 13:09.680]  That's right.
[13:09.680 --> 13:13.480]  It was Nancy Pelosi's daughter that tried to get the electors after Trump had been elected
[13:13.480 --> 13:14.480]  to say no.
[13:14.480 --> 13:16.120]  She said she had a right to do that.
[13:16.120 --> 13:17.200]  That's really questionable.
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.800]  But this is the legislature during the election process before it's been conceded.
[13:21.800 --> 13:23.960]  And look, if I thought Trump had really lost, I wouldn't be here.
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.920]  He got more votes in all these battle-around states than he got last time by a huge martins.
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.320]  He got almost 11 million more votes nationally than he got last time.
[13:31.320 --> 13:33.080]  He has all these giant rallies.
[13:33.080 --> 13:37.880]  They froze it that night, and then all the votes came in at every state straight up,
[13:37.880 --> 13:41.080]  and we have all the evidence that Georgia had an incredible fraud coming out.
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.280]  I mean, the Project Veritas won all of it, undercover videos, people inside saying that
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.360]  they would take ballots for Trump and say that they were ballots for Biden.
[13:48.360 --> 13:53.400]  This is systematic Democrats who believe they can break the law because Trump quotes Hitler.
[13:53.400 --> 13:56.600]  It's absolutely dangerous, and what's really happening is, communist China is bragging
[13:56.600 --> 13:58.560]  they're taking this nation over.
[13:58.560 --> 14:01.520]  We've got more live reports on the ground coming up today.
[14:01.520 --> 14:03.280]  Obviously, you're watching right now.
[14:03.280 --> 14:04.280]  Owen Schreuer is hosting.
[14:04.280 --> 14:08.120]  I'll be back on the broadcast from the street coming up, but we taped this right before the
[14:08.120 --> 14:09.120]  live show today.
[14:09.120 --> 14:12.600]  You'll also be posted at infowars.com, so please get this out.
[14:12.600 --> 14:13.600]  That's why we're here.
[14:13.600 --> 14:14.600]  That's why your numbers are needed.
[14:14.600 --> 14:19.040]  We expect there to be hundreds today, thousands tomorrow, tens of thousands or hundreds of
[14:19.040 --> 14:21.000]  thousands coming up on Saturday.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.640]  Be here and stop the steal.
[14:22.640 --> 14:23.640]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[14:23.640 --> 14:27.200]  Again, I'll tell folks where they visit your website to find out the real stop the steal
[14:27.200 --> 14:29.920]  movement, not Neocons hijacking into D-Railin.
[14:29.920 --> 14:32.400]  Stop the steal.us.
[14:32.400 --> 14:34.120]  Stop the steal.us.
[14:34.120 --> 14:36.320]  Go there and find out how you can participate.
[14:36.320 --> 14:37.880]  We're in all 50 states.
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.560]  We're all pissed off about this, and we highlight the contested states of where we need you.
[14:42.560 --> 14:46.440]  If you can get in your RV, if you can get in your truck, if you can get in your bike,
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.560]  if we the people will put pressure on these judges and these politicians, they'll be forced
[14:51.560 --> 14:53.160]  to react to our moves.
[14:53.160 --> 15:13.760]  All right, more live coverage with Owen Schroger right now.
[15:13.760 --> 15:31.360]  All right, more live coverage with Owen Schroger right now.
[15:31.360 --> 15:43.560]  All right, more live coverage with Owen Schroger right now.
[15:43.560 --> 16:13.320]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[16:13.320 --> 16:18.680]  Go to band.video with your Safari browser, then you click the share button at the bottom
[16:18.680 --> 16:19.680]  of the screen.
[16:19.680 --> 16:23.440]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[16:23.440 --> 16:25.520]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[16:25.520 --> 16:27.800]  I suggest band.video.
[16:27.800 --> 16:32.400]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[16:32.400 --> 16:33.400]  to stop it.
[16:33.400 --> 16:37.520]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.720]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.760]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.560]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[16:49.560 --> 17:19.040]  Be sure and share band.video.
[17:19.040 --> 17:37.680]  Just, do it.
[17:37.680 --> 17:45.880]  Follow them.
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.720]  So we're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent.
[17:49.720 --> 17:50.720]  He's a globalist.
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  He wants carbon taxes.
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.120]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.880]  This is war.
[18:00.880 --> 18:30.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:30.720 --> 18:52.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show on Infowars and Alex Jones is right
[18:52.440 --> 18:59.480]  there on the screen, bullhorning the state capital building in Atlanta, Georgia.
[18:59.480 --> 19:05.400]  I think that's Nick Fuentes to his left Rob Dew there on screen as well filming.
[19:05.400 --> 19:12.160]  And you can see the crowd gathered behind him where we were last week.
[19:12.160 --> 19:17.920]  I believe even was that on last week of this day or yesterday point is we are rallying
[19:17.920 --> 19:19.520]  the troops.
[19:19.520 --> 19:22.040]  We are on a forward march.
[19:22.040 --> 19:25.040]  We are louder than ever and we are going to stop this deal.
[19:25.040 --> 19:32.920]  But even if the Democrats get away with this, they've been so caught.
[19:32.920 --> 19:45.000]  Whatever comes at the end of this is going to be a full reveal of just how corrupt our
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.120]  system has been.
[19:49.120 --> 19:54.120]  Now I've got more news stories and reports of the total election fraud.
[19:54.120 --> 20:01.240]  We've got the smoke signals being sent by the fake Biden president elect transition
[20:01.240 --> 20:05.920]  team of what that administration would ever be about.
[20:05.920 --> 20:08.120]  It's scary, folks.
[20:08.120 --> 20:11.840]  And then just more evidence is was pouring in with videos now of what's going on in
[20:11.840 --> 20:12.840]  Georgia.
[20:12.840 --> 20:17.080]  But let's go live to Alex Jones there in front of the state capital building in Atlanta
[20:17.080 --> 20:27.080]  with a large crowd behind him, America first, America first, America first, America first.
[20:27.080 --> 20:34.080]  The globalists have been caught, lead, handed, engaged in massive fraud and the people know
[20:34.080 --> 20:41.080]  and the people will not accept this fraudulent election and just like in other countries,
[20:41.080 --> 20:48.080]  we need a new election call in the disputed state.
[20:48.080 --> 20:51.080]  Stop the steal.
[20:51.080 --> 20:53.080]  Stop the steal.
[20:53.080 --> 20:55.080]  Stop the steal.
[20:55.080 --> 20:57.080]  Stop the steal.
[20:57.080 --> 20:59.080]  Stop the steal.
[20:59.080 --> 21:01.080]  Stop the steal.
[21:01.080 --> 21:03.080]  Stop the steal.
[21:03.080 --> 21:14.080]  I intend the Republican governor is letting this happen and the Republican secretary of state is a criminal and he is letting them steal this election.
[21:14.080 --> 21:25.080]  Because the governor's chief of staff is on the payroll of the menu and the other state officials met with the Clinton's lawyers and made an illegal deal outside of the legislature.
[21:25.080 --> 21:26.080]  Is this great or not?
[21:26.080 --> 21:32.080]  You are in your living room, you're in your kitchen, you're in your car and you've got Alex Jones
[21:32.080 --> 21:38.080]  live bullhorning in Atlanta. I love it. This is what it's all about.
[21:38.080 --> 21:44.080]  It's illegal! It's illegal! It's illegal! It's illegal!
[21:44.080 --> 21:48.080]  This is just a one-on-one salute and committer by the Shutup Air today.
[21:48.080 --> 21:53.080]  It's going to get bigger and bigger as papers are on the country. See this?
[21:53.080 --> 21:59.080]  And I know I'm shutting down nearly 10,000 people, but I know that all the millions watching,
[21:59.080 --> 22:06.080]  we love you, and we appreciate you, and we'll never give up on America for this new old owner takeover.
[22:06.080 --> 22:13.080]  Yeah, we need you every day. Let's let the governor know how awesome you are coming out.
[22:13.080 --> 22:25.080]  Every day! Every day! Every day! Every day! Every day! Every day! Every day! Every day! Every day!
[22:25.080 --> 22:32.080]  The Republicans are a bunch of pussies! We're going to act like the left.
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.080]  We are going to occupy the streets. We're going to get angry.
[22:35.080 --> 22:42.080]  We're going to show up without permit. We're going to show up at their homes peacefully, but at their homes.
[22:42.080 --> 22:51.080]  Who's with us? What you'll need to know is today they found 10,000 votes that were tabulated
[22:51.080 --> 22:58.080]  for Biden erroneously. Magic, huh?
[22:58.080 --> 23:03.080]  They don't want us to take the time to slow this election down because they know what we'll catch.
[23:03.080 --> 23:09.080]  They're terrified. On Thursday, the Secretary of State is supposed to certify the election.
[23:09.080 --> 23:15.080]  And guess what? Bad Brad will. But Governor Kipp is due on Friday at 5 p.m.
[23:15.080 --> 23:22.080]  If he doesn't certify the election, we can go into constitutional limbo, which is what we want,
[23:22.080 --> 23:29.080]  so the state legislator can take back its constitutional duty, take back its constitutional obligation,
[23:29.080 --> 23:33.080]  take back its constitutional right, and choose the electors for this state.
[23:33.080 --> 23:37.080]  Yeah!
[23:37.080 --> 23:44.080]  The Republican Party has failed us. We know there was a fraud. We saw it on election day.
[23:44.080 --> 23:51.080]  There is no question about it. And since election day, we have heard from our Republican representatives
[23:51.080 --> 23:54.080]  absolutely nothing.
[23:54.080 --> 24:00.080]  Nikki Haley has said nothing. Dan Kledshaw has said nothing.
[24:00.080 --> 24:06.080]  Marco Rubio, in fact, supports Biden stealing this election.
[24:06.080 --> 24:14.080]  I'm talking about Lindsey Graham giving Kamala Harris the pistol bomb on the floor.
[24:14.080 --> 24:21.080]  So you guys know we are live here taking a feed from the Info Wars crew on the ground in Atlanta, Georgia, at the state capitol.
[24:21.080 --> 24:26.080]  You heard from Alex Jones on the bullhorn. Ali Alexander and Nick Point is currently leading the charge,
[24:26.080 --> 24:31.080]  as they are trying to steal this election in Georgia.
[24:31.080 --> 24:36.080]  But what Nick Point has just said is a million percent true.
[24:36.080 --> 24:41.080]  The Republican Party never liked Trump. They don't like populists. They don't like us.
[24:41.080 --> 24:44.080]  They're globalists that share power with the Democrats.
[24:44.080 --> 24:51.080]  But since we've awakened the globalism and now it's a household understanding that America is fighting outside corrupt forces,
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.080]  this is just the beginning of the end of them. They're having to steal this out in the open.
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.080]  They have to put a walking corpse up there and claim he's the president of the left.
[25:01.080 --> 25:08.080]  That's because the new older is in deep trouble and I want to salute all of you that came out here today.
[25:08.080 --> 25:14.080]  You are just the beginning of the Second America War.
[25:14.080 --> 25:23.080]  You all are pioneers in the next wave of the republic.
[25:23.080 --> 25:30.080]  Alex Jones has been right about everything.
[25:30.080 --> 25:41.080]  What we're seeing, Alex.
[25:41.080 --> 25:47.080]  This is not about the fake Republican Party or the fake Democratic Party.
[25:47.080 --> 25:57.080]  This is about the global special interests versus we, the American people.
[25:57.080 --> 26:02.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, powerful sights and sounds from the state capitol building in Atlanta, Georgia.
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.080]  Alex Jones, Nick Point has Ali Alexander leading the charge there.
[26:06.080 --> 26:09.080]  This is incredible. A Democrat stronghold.
[26:09.080 --> 26:17.080]  And for the second week in a row, we have rallied massive numbers of patriots out there and I do believe it's going to get bigger.
[26:17.080 --> 26:24.080]  Folks, before we take this break and come back and we'll continue our live coverage of this and I also have news I'm going to get into.
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.080]  A lot of it breaking, developing right now as far as the theft is concerned of our election.
[26:29.080 --> 26:40.080]  Everything we do here, folks, being on air, having the crew, flying out to all these things, having to stop the steel caravan, it's all possible with your support at infowarstore.com.
[26:40.080 --> 26:52.080]  So in this short four minute break, go to infowarstore.com, buy a t-shirt, buy one of the great supplements, buy an air filter, buy a water filter, get yourself some emergency food supplies, infowarstore.com.
[26:52.080 --> 26:55.080]  Fuel this ship of information.
[26:55.080 --> 27:04.080]  Remember Hillary Clinton, remember Pelosi, remember Bill Clinton, remember Obama, all of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[27:04.080 --> 27:08.080]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in the landslide because they have the internal polls.
[27:08.080 --> 27:13.080]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[27:13.080 --> 27:22.080]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze these seven states on election night and then they brought in all of the reserved ballots they had.
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.080]  This is completely transparent. So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[27:26.080 --> 27:29.080]  Trump is not conceded. None of the states have certified the vote.
[27:29.080 --> 27:31.080]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[27:31.080 --> 27:37.080]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[27:37.080 --> 27:41.080]  And in Georgia, officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[27:41.080 --> 27:43.080]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.080]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[27:47.080 --> 27:52.080]  But now this is the mother of all hoaxes. And if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[27:52.080 --> 27:53.080]  As we know it, we will be Venezuela.
[27:53.080 --> 28:18.080]  Infowars.com.
[28:24.080 --> 28:36.080]  These are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and your body have to have to live.
[28:36.080 --> 28:40.080]  But regardless, buying these products from us funds the InfoWars.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.080]  So it's a 360 win.
[28:41.080 --> 28:42.080]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[28:42.080 --> 28:44.080]  I want to ask you to redouble your average to spread the word.
[28:44.080 --> 28:46.080]  I want to ask you to buy the products.
[28:46.080 --> 28:53.080]  Infowars.com today is without you won't be on the air. Again, I salute you and thank you all.
[28:53.080 --> 28:55.080]  Please take action today in our emergency cell.
[28:55.080 --> 29:02.080]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sacks.
[29:02.080 --> 29:09.080]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death. Incredible.
[29:09.080 --> 29:16.080]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation.
[29:16.080 --> 29:18.080]  Not the COVID virus.
[29:18.080 --> 29:19.080]  That is a fact.
[29:19.080 --> 29:26.080]  And all the hero sheep that wear the mask and go along with this are signing on to mass murder bigger than what Hitler did.
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.080]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[29:30.080 --> 29:39.080]  This is a medical, world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IDs and coming with forced inoculations.
[29:39.080 --> 29:44.080]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[29:44.080 --> 29:46.080]  That story's on infowars.com.
[29:46.080 --> 29:55.080]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary Great Reset.
[29:55.080 --> 30:01.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:15.080 --> 30:18.080]  You are back live on the Alex Jones show.
[30:18.080 --> 30:21.080]  Did you go to infowarsstore.com during that short break?
[30:21.080 --> 30:23.080]  I hope you did.
[30:23.080 --> 30:28.080]  The fund of this mothership of information.
[30:28.080 --> 30:33.080]  The Paul Revere of modern day media.
[30:33.080 --> 30:36.080]  Alex Jones is leading the charge in Atlanta, Georgia right now.
[30:36.080 --> 30:43.080]  Nick Fuentes, Ali Alexander also on the scene with what appears to be at least a couple hundred patriots there in Atlanta.
[30:43.080 --> 30:51.080]  Second week in a row, we've been able to activate and organize a large crowd of people in Atlanta at the state capitol.
[30:51.080 --> 30:53.080]  Let's go back live now.
[30:53.080 --> 30:56.080]  Nick Fuentes currently on the bullhorn in front of the capitol building.
[30:56.080 --> 30:59.080]  Okay, whatever you say.
[30:59.080 --> 31:04.080]  And I don't know about you, but I'm laying it all on the line for this fight.
[31:04.080 --> 31:09.080]  That's why we're touring the state capitals.
[31:09.080 --> 31:14.080]  I was in Lansing and we were in the million MAGA March in D.C.
[31:14.080 --> 31:18.080]  Just this Saturday and we're in Georgia now.
[31:18.080 --> 31:25.080]  And if we don't secure the 16 electoral college vote from Georgia, it very well may be over all together.
[31:25.080 --> 31:38.080]  And that's why we have to turn out tomorrow and the next day and the day after that and the day after that and every single day until they allocate those votes for our rightful president, Donald Trump.
[31:38.080 --> 31:53.080]  We want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump, we want Trump.
[31:53.080 --> 32:02.080]  And if we don't get him, the trucker strike that is coming up this month is only the beginning.
[32:02.080 --> 32:09.080]  Because we are the American people. We make the trades run on time. We deliver the goods.
[32:09.080 --> 32:16.080]  And we will shut this country down.
[32:16.080 --> 32:20.080]  And folks, statewide Vernon Jones has a lot of courage.
[32:20.080 --> 32:22.080]  He's a great patriot.
[32:22.080 --> 32:24.080]  He's about to speak here in a moment.
[32:24.080 --> 32:26.080]  Well, they've got a lot to come around with.
[32:26.080 --> 32:29.080]  Vernon Jones out there with them now. This is incredible.
[32:29.080 --> 32:34.080]  So it's all beyond our super best behavior, like Patrion Tsar, we're all like ants in front of those commenters.
[32:34.080 --> 32:37.080]  So again, all the Alexandria, this is great.
[32:37.080 --> 32:39.080]  George and Patrion.
[32:39.080 --> 32:41.080]  Thank you.
[32:41.080 --> 32:50.080]  Vernon, Vernon, Vernon, Vernon, Vernon, Vernon, Vernon Jones works with us in DC.
[32:50.080 --> 32:53.080]  How many people saw over 500,000 of us in DC?
[32:53.080 --> 32:56.080]  Vernon Jones once crowdsourced the Trump rally.
[32:56.080 --> 33:00.080]  He's taking this election. He's very serious and stoic right now.
[33:00.080 --> 33:05.080]  He doesn't care what race, color, party you're with. He'll speak to any American.
[33:05.080 --> 33:08.080]  And I welcome here with us today.
[33:08.080 --> 33:11.080]  Jeffrey, you're here.
[33:11.080 --> 33:19.080]  After Vernon's speech, we're going to march peacefully, orderly into the state capitol through Mitchell Street.
[33:19.080 --> 33:23.080]  We're going to leave our signs and our flags at the cops ask us to.
[33:23.080 --> 33:29.080]  We're going to take us a little while to get in, but we're going to ring the gold dome with special session chance.
[33:29.080 --> 33:32.080]  And we will tell the governor that we've got his back if he's got ours.
[33:32.080 --> 33:35.080]  But first, state rep, Vernon Jones.
[33:35.080 --> 33:39.080]  Thank you all.
[33:39.080 --> 33:41.080]  Hey, America.
[33:41.080 --> 33:43.080]  Hello.
[33:43.080 --> 33:45.080]  Hello, Georgians.
[33:45.080 --> 33:47.080]  Are you here to stand up for your rights?
[33:47.080 --> 33:49.080]  Yes.
[33:49.080 --> 33:53.080]  Do you believe in fair and transparent elections?
[33:53.080 --> 33:55.080]  Yes.
[33:55.080 --> 33:57.080]  Do you believe in law and order?
[33:57.080 --> 33:59.080]  Yes.
[33:59.080 --> 34:01.080]  Well, I stand with you.
[34:01.080 --> 34:03.080]  Yes.
[34:03.080 --> 34:05.080]  Yes.
[34:05.080 --> 34:08.080]  Again, this is Democrat state representative, Vernon Jones.
[34:08.080 --> 34:11.080]  I want to welcome you to the people's house.
[34:11.080 --> 34:13.080]  The Georgia State Capitol.
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.080]  It belongs to the people.
[34:15.080 --> 34:20.080]  We have a weird optical issue here, folks, but we're going to stick with this live stream here.
[34:20.080 --> 34:23.080]  My comments, I do want to say this.
[34:23.080 --> 34:25.080]  We respect.
[34:25.080 --> 34:32.080]  We respect those public safety personnel that are here now, the Georgia Public Safety Department, Georgia State Patrol.
[34:32.080 --> 34:35.080]  Let's make sure we give them a big hand because they're here to protect us.
[34:35.080 --> 34:37.080]  That's right.
[34:37.080 --> 34:40.080]  Let's make sure we make their jobs easy.
[34:40.080 --> 34:43.080]  They're our friends, they're not our fault.
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.080]  I cannot stand anybody who bears this against law enforcement.
[34:46.080 --> 34:58.080]  So as we do make our way into this Capitol, if this is allowed and we do it right and properly, if we respect them, they will respect us.
[34:58.080 --> 35:00.080]  Don't act like Democrats.
[35:00.080 --> 35:04.080]  Don't act like Antifa and don't act like bright lives matter.
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.080]  Because we are great American patriots and we care about this country.
[35:08.080 --> 35:15.080]  We just hear because we have the right to protest for our right.
[35:15.080 --> 35:23.080]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! I think it's important.
[35:23.080 --> 35:34.080]  I think it's very important that the members of the Georgia General Assembly, the Lieutenant Governor, the Governor of the elected constitutional officers, including the Secretary of State,
[35:34.080 --> 35:41.080]  know that we fear that this was not a fair and a transparent election.
[35:41.080 --> 35:49.080]  We want them to know how the hell weeks later can now shoot out of nowhere on the last 48 hours.
[35:49.080 --> 35:57.080]  We want them to know that we do not like that the media system something is going on with the hardware and the software.
[35:57.080 --> 36:02.080]  We want them to know we want every legal vote counted.
[36:02.080 --> 36:08.080]  And we will not lay down until we feel that that has happened we are going continue to fight for our life.
[36:08.080 --> 36:13.080]  And this is not a democratic, it's just not a Republican issue, it's an American issue.
[36:13.080 --> 36:20.080]  We are not in fair way, that's what we have in the United States of America.
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.080]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.960]  So Vernon Jones has now joined Ali Alexander, Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones in front of the
[36:31.960 --> 36:34.880]  state capitol in Atlanta, Georgia.
[36:34.880 --> 36:37.160]  And he is speaking right now on the bullhorn.
[36:37.160 --> 36:38.160]  Let's go back live to the scene.
[36:38.160 --> 36:39.160]  USA!
[36:39.160 --> 36:40.160]  USA!
[36:40.160 --> 36:41.160]  USA!
[36:41.160 --> 36:42.160]  USA!
[36:42.160 --> 36:43.160]  USA!
[36:43.160 --> 36:44.160]  USA!
[36:44.160 --> 36:45.160]  USA!
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.160]  USA!
[36:46.160 --> 36:47.160]  USA!
[36:47.160 --> 36:48.160]  USA!
[36:48.160 --> 36:49.160]  USA!
[36:49.160 --> 36:50.160]  USA!
[36:50.160 --> 36:51.160]  USA!
[36:51.160 --> 36:52.160]  USA!
[36:52.160 --> 36:53.160]  USA!
[36:53.160 --> 36:54.160]  USA!
[36:54.160 --> 36:55.160]  USA!
[36:55.160 --> 36:56.160]  USA!
[36:56.160 --> 36:57.160]  USA!
[36:57.160 --> 36:58.160]  USA!
[36:58.160 --> 36:59.160]  USA!
[36:59.160 --> 37:00.160]  USA!
[37:00.160 --> 37:01.160]  USA!
[37:01.160 --> 37:02.160]  USA!
[37:02.160 --> 37:03.160]  USA!
[37:03.160 --> 37:04.160]  USA!
[37:04.160 --> 37:05.160]  USA!
[37:05.160 --> 37:06.160]  USA!
[37:06.160 --> 37:07.160]  USA!
[37:07.160 --> 37:08.160]  USA!
[37:08.160 --> 37:09.160]  USA!
[37:09.160 --> 37:10.160]  USA!
[37:10.160 --> 37:11.160]  USA!
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.160]  USA!
[37:12.160 --> 37:13.160]  USA!
[37:13.160 --> 37:14.160]  USA!
[37:14.160 --> 37:15.160]  USA!
[37:15.160 --> 37:16.160]  USA!
[37:16.160 --> 37:17.160]  USA!
[37:17.160 --> 37:18.160]  USA!
[37:18.160 --> 37:19.160]  USA!
[37:19.160 --> 37:20.160]  USA!
[37:20.160 --> 37:21.160]  USA!
[37:21.160 --> 37:22.160]  USA!
[37:22.160 --> 37:23.160]  USA!
[37:23.160 --> 37:24.160]  USA!
[37:24.160 --> 37:25.160]  USA!
[37:25.160 --> 37:28.160]  Even senior citizens, that's wrong.
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.160]  What has Joe Biden condemned him by name?
[37:33.160 --> 37:36.160]  What has the Democrats done it by name?
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.160]  What has a lot of Republicans done it by name?
[37:39.160 --> 37:42.160]  Let's call them out for what they are.
[37:42.160 --> 37:47.160]  But we were taught that if they slap you on your right cheek, turn your left cheek,
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.160]  and we will continue to turn the cheek, but we're not.
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.160]  Even if our heads are blurry but unbound, we are not going to bow down
[37:53.160 --> 38:00.160]  to socialism and marching in this country.
[38:00.160 --> 38:01.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:01.160 --> 38:03.160]  We will stop the steel.
[38:03.160 --> 38:04.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:04.160 --> 38:05.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:05.160 --> 38:06.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:06.160 --> 38:07.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:07.160 --> 38:08.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:08.160 --> 38:09.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:09.160 --> 38:10.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:10.160 --> 38:11.160]  Stop the steel.
[38:11.160 --> 38:13.160]  This is not over.
[38:13.160 --> 38:19.160]  Even after the votes are counted and the electoral process give those
[38:19.160 --> 38:24.160]  electoral votes to whomever, we're just not going to let the media tell us
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.160]  who is the president elected this time.
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.160]  We're not going to let the media tell us that Donald Trump has not won yet.
[38:30.160 --> 38:32.160]  Let the process go through.
[38:32.160 --> 38:33.160]  We have our rights.
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.160]  We have litigation going on.
[38:35.160 --> 38:37.160]  There's vote counting still going on.
[38:37.160 --> 38:39.160]  And we want to go to the very end.
[38:39.160 --> 38:40.160]  What is wrong with that?
[38:40.160 --> 38:43.160]  They didn't say anything when Stacey Abrams did it.
[38:43.160 --> 38:45.160]  For three years she didn't concede.
[38:45.160 --> 38:46.160]  For three years she didn't concede.
[38:46.160 --> 38:48.160]  Now why you want to give us a hard time?
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.160]  Because we want to accept your narrative.
[38:51.160 --> 38:53.160]  That's what the media does.
[38:53.160 --> 38:58.160]  The media has done more to interfere with our voting rights than Russia and China
[38:58.160 --> 38:59.160]  combined.
[38:59.160 --> 39:00.160]  I'm telling you.
[39:00.160 --> 39:08.160]  So with that being said, we want to follow the instructions of Ali.
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.160]  Ali is a great American.
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.160]  I want you all to know he's a peaceful man, but he stands up for his left and his right.
[39:14.160 --> 39:18.160]  We all do.
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.160]  So we want to respect the Capitol Police because they respect us.
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.160]  And I love those men and women who wear that blue because they love us.
[39:26.160 --> 39:31.160]  And especially the time when the liberals and the left were wanting to defund the police department.
[39:31.160 --> 39:33.160]  Want to defund Georgia State Patrol.
[39:33.160 --> 39:35.160]  Georgia's Public State.
[39:35.160 --> 39:43.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we will continue this live coverage of the Stop the Steel demonstration
[39:43.160 --> 39:45.160]  in Atlanta, Georgia at the State Capitol Building.
[39:45.160 --> 39:47.160]  This is incredible.
[39:47.160 --> 39:49.160]  America is rising.
[39:49.160 --> 39:51.160]  Patriots are coming together.
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.160]  We're not going to let them steal our lunch.
[39:54.160 --> 40:00.160]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.160]  Alpha Power.
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.160]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[40:09.160 --> 40:13.160]  and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.

[40:17.160 --> 40:22.160]  or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.160]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male pack.

[40:32.160 --> 40:35.160]  support healthy cholesterol and more.
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.160]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.

[40:45.160 --> 40:48.160]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[40:54.160 --> 40:56.160]  It's all on record.
[40:56.160 --> 41:02.160]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago
[41:02.160 --> 41:08.160]  and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.160]  and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[41:11.160 --> 41:14.160]  They talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[41:14.160 --> 41:16.160]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.160]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.160]  They told it psychologically prepared and once they get it locked down for 15 days,
[41:23.160 --> 41:25.160]  you notice now they say it's permanent.
[41:25.160 --> 41:26.160]  That's how it works.
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.160]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.160]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[41:32.160 --> 41:33.160]  No.
[41:33.160 --> 41:37.160]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[41:37.160 --> 41:42.160]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[41:42.160 --> 41:43.160]  That's the allegory.
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.160]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[41:45.160 --> 41:46.160]  We got to say no now.
[41:46.160 --> 41:48.160]  We got to make a run for it now, but we still can't.
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.160]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse folks.
[41:52.160 --> 41:54.160]  So stop submitting.
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.160]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped
[41:59.160 --> 42:02.160]  for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[42:02.160 --> 42:05.160]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[42:05.160 --> 42:07.160]  It's antioxidant effect.
[42:07.160 --> 42:10.160]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[42:10.160 --> 42:12.160]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[42:12.160 --> 42:16.160]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[42:16.160 --> 42:19.160]  They're three to five percent curcuminoid,
[42:19.160 --> 42:26.160]  but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95 percent curcuminoid level.
[42:26.160 --> 42:31.160]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerated and bring it into the cells of the body.
[42:31.160 --> 42:33.160]  It's been sold out for months.
[42:33.160 --> 42:34.160]  It's back in stock.
[42:34.160 --> 42:40.160]  And despite that, body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50 percent off
[42:40.160 --> 42:44.160]  with free shipping and triple-patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[42:44.160 --> 42:47.160]  It's body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.160]  If you haven't tried it, learn why it's got thousands of five-star reviews
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  at infowarstore.com.
[42:53.160 --> 42:54.160]  And you can't lose.
[42:54.160 --> 42:56.160]  It funds the infowar.
[42:56.160 --> 42:57.160]  It really is simple.
[42:57.160 --> 42:59.160]  The left are into being deviant.
[42:59.160 --> 43:01.160]  And I don't mean sexually deviant.
[43:01.160 --> 43:03.160]  That goes to the territory.
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.160]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against their own species,
[43:07.160 --> 43:10.160]  deviant against the order of nature.
[43:10.160 --> 43:12.160]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous,
[43:12.160 --> 43:15.160]  they still do it because they want to play God.
[43:15.160 --> 43:17.160]  Everything they touch, they destroy.
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.160]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.160]  Their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them.
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.160]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty
[43:30.160 --> 43:35.160]  and poor, ballooning populations and then watching all that new fruit down the vine
[43:35.160 --> 43:40.160]  to continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[43:40.160 --> 43:42.160]  They truly are the children of Satan.
[43:42.160 --> 43:43.160]  They are the children of the devil.
[43:43.160 --> 43:46.160]  If you look at the slaves that serve the Biden and Kamala Harris,
[43:46.160 --> 43:49.160]  it really is manifested that being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[43:49.160 --> 43:51.160]  Sin is not profitable.
[43:51.160 --> 44:17.160]  I'm Alex Jones and this is The Info War.
[44:21.160 --> 44:29.160]  That is Alex Jones.
[44:29.160 --> 44:31.160]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.160]  You are tuned in live.
[44:33.160 --> 44:39.160]  And Alex Jones is now leading the march alongside Nick Fuentes,
[44:39.160 --> 44:47.160]  Vernon Jones, Ali Alexander and hundreds of patriots who have gathered at the State Capitol in Atlanta, Georgia.
[44:47.160 --> 44:52.160]  You know, this is incredible to see they're now going into the building.
[44:52.160 --> 44:54.160]  We're going to continue this live feed, folks.
[44:54.160 --> 45:00.160]  I'm now seeing as I'm looking at the crowd here as they begin to march into the building,
[45:00.160 --> 45:06.160]  people who were on the caravan with me last week who are still part of this.
[45:06.160 --> 45:08.160]  So Americans are ready to go.
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.160]  They are not going to let this election be stolen from them.
[45:12.160 --> 45:14.160]  And so let's go back live now to the feed.
[45:14.160 --> 45:20.160]  Let's hear what they're saying as they're now entering, I believe, the Capitol building with State Representative Vernon Jones.
[45:20.160 --> 45:21.160]  It's a hard time.
[45:21.160 --> 45:22.160]  So just understand it.
[45:22.160 --> 45:28.160]  I know you all do, but you know how the other crowd will make it official.
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.160]  So they're about to take a crowd of two to three hundred people into the State Capitol.
[45:32.160 --> 45:33.160]  Thank you, too.
[45:33.160 --> 45:35.160]  We want to do our things.
[45:35.160 --> 45:38.160]  They've got all their Trump, paraphernalia and everything.
[45:38.160 --> 45:40.160]  You're going to have to support your security.
[45:40.160 --> 45:42.160]  It's hilarious.
[45:42.160 --> 45:44.160]  It looks like our feed may be getting cut off.
[45:44.160 --> 45:49.160]  They're probably in a basement there in the Capitol building.
[45:49.160 --> 45:54.160]  We're going to try to keep up with this, guys.
[45:54.160 --> 45:57.160]  Guys, give me this audio.
[45:57.160 --> 46:09.160]  Yeah, give me the audio there.
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.160]  So again, there's hundreds of people here that they're going to have to shuffle into the Capitol.
[46:13.160 --> 46:17.160]  They have basically one at a time there with the metal detector and everything.
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.160]  Of course, this is ridiculous.
[46:19.160 --> 46:24.160]  But you know, this is the security state we live in so fine.
[46:24.160 --> 46:27.160]  The nanny state.
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.160]  All after 9-Eleven.
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.160]  And we're in the new 9-Eleven now.
[46:31.160 --> 46:33.160]  The election theft is the new 9-Eleven.
[46:33.160 --> 46:35.160]  The fake pandemic is the new 9-Eleven.
[46:35.160 --> 46:37.160]  Changing your way of life.
[46:37.160 --> 46:39.160]  Changing the way you travel.
[46:39.160 --> 46:41.160]  Changing the way you engage in commerce.
[46:41.160 --> 46:45.160]  Changing the way just everything happens.
[46:45.160 --> 46:51.160]  We cannot allow this one.
[46:51.160 --> 46:57.160]  Again, think about the history.
[46:57.160 --> 47:04.160]  Think about the history in Atlanta, Georgia, a Democrat-run city in a red state
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.160]  where they're trying to steal a massive election victory from President Trump.
[47:07.160 --> 47:11.160]  And not only do you have some of the great supporters of President Trump in the media
[47:11.160 --> 47:15.160]  and activists and influencers like Nick Lynch, Alex Jones, Ali Alexander,
[47:15.160 --> 47:19.160]  but you have the Democrat state rep, Vernon Jones,
[47:19.160 --> 47:25.160]  leading the charge into the state Capitol building to stop the steal.
[47:25.160 --> 47:33.160]  He knows the Democrats stole this election.
[47:33.160 --> 47:39.160]  All right, we'll continue to monitor this.
[47:39.160 --> 47:41.160]  Just keep that feed in front of you guys.
[47:41.160 --> 47:43.160]  We'll continue to monitor that.
[47:43.160 --> 47:49.160]  In the meantime, I should play this video of something that happened in Georgia this morning.
[47:49.160 --> 47:54.160]  In fact, I don't even...
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.160]  Let's see if it's on here.
[47:57.160 --> 48:01.160]  You guys have that video out of Georgia this morning
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.160]  that President Trump retweeted that we had to go find?
[48:06.160 --> 48:12.160]  So President Trump retweeted this video where election officials in Georgia
[48:12.160 --> 48:15.160]  are basically saying, yeah, the electronic voting machines,
[48:15.160 --> 48:17.160]  we can't really get the record.
[48:17.160 --> 48:18.160]  We don't know what's happening.
[48:18.160 --> 48:20.160]  The tech team is here trying to figure it out.
[48:20.160 --> 48:21.160]  They don't know either.
[48:21.160 --> 48:23.160]  Pretty shocking, stunning footage.
[48:23.160 --> 48:26.160]  Here it is.
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.160]  Just for this building, just for this building, because this is where the problem was.
[48:31.160 --> 48:33.160]  How many are in this building?
[48:33.160 --> 48:36.160]  2141 give or take.
[48:36.160 --> 48:38.160]  That was just early voting, wasn't it?
[48:38.160 --> 48:39.160]  No, sorry, not one.
[48:39.160 --> 48:40.160]  Sorry to give you that.
[48:40.160 --> 48:41.160]  8,000 in 2014.
[48:41.160 --> 48:42.160]  Now just early voting.
[48:42.160 --> 48:44.160]  Yes, early voting in this building.
[48:44.160 --> 48:45.160]  So we're recounting this.
[48:45.160 --> 48:47.160]  About over 8,000 from just this building.
[48:47.160 --> 48:50.160]  Separate them to 50s first, then to be scanned.
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.160]  Then re-scan, get their votes, and let's go from there.
[48:54.160 --> 49:03.160]  If I'm off, this is how they do the absentee ballots.
[49:03.160 --> 49:04.160]  So in-person voting.
[49:04.160 --> 49:06.160]  This is really strange.
[49:06.160 --> 49:08.160]  This isn't the video, and I'm not blaming the crew,
[49:08.160 --> 49:10.160]  because the video got actually deleted.
[49:10.160 --> 49:12.160]  I thought that was the video.
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.160]  There's another video that that lady tweeted out,
[49:16.160 --> 49:18.160]  that got re-tweeted by the president,
[49:18.160 --> 49:21.160]  that just got magically disappeared off Twitter.
[49:21.160 --> 49:24.160]  And I'm wondering if there isn't some chicanery going on there,
[49:24.160 --> 49:26.160]  or why that video is gone.
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.160]  Because it's the same series of videos from that same gal.
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.160]  And the guys literally like,
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.160]  well, they're trying to fix this.
[49:35.160 --> 49:38.160]  The Dominion IT guys are like,
[49:38.160 --> 49:39.160]  we're trying to fix this.
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.160]  And she asked something like, well,
[49:42.160 --> 49:44.160]  can you go audit those votes or something?
[49:44.160 --> 49:46.160]  He's like, no, we can't get the record.
[49:46.160 --> 49:47.160]  We can't get the access.
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.160]  Because it's all done on that electronic machine.
[49:49.160 --> 49:52.160]  And if somebody goes in and fixes up the algorithms,
[49:52.160 --> 49:54.160]  or messes up with the data,
[49:54.160 --> 49:55.160]  there's nothing they can do to recover it.
[49:55.160 --> 49:56.160]  There's no record.
[49:56.160 --> 49:58.160]  It can all be done off location.
[49:58.160 --> 49:59.160]  It can all be done remotely.
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.160]  It's all been proven.
[50:01.160 --> 50:03.160]  That's why they run with these systems.
[50:03.160 --> 50:06.160]  That's why they tested it with Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
[50:06.160 --> 50:09.160]  And then when it worked to steal elections for the communists
[50:09.160 --> 50:11.160]  in Venezuela, it went nationwide.
[50:11.160 --> 50:19.160]  You know, it's so historic.
[50:19.160 --> 50:24.160]  You think about everything we've endured in the last four years,
[50:24.160 --> 50:30.160]  and now we're sitting here on the precipice
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.160]  of exposing rigged elections worldwide.
[50:34.160 --> 50:38.160]  And we have the names.
[50:38.160 --> 50:45.160]  We know systems, we know who's involved.
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.160]  I mean, this is so groundbreaking and it's like, this should be the number one news story in the world.
[50:50.160 --> 51:03.160]  And because most mainstream media, most network news is totally fake, totally corrupt, totally bought and paid for, you don't even hear about it.
[51:03.160 --> 51:13.160]  This is cataclysmic, this is, I mean, they sit here and obsess over fake Russian collusion, fake Russian interference for three years,
[51:13.160 --> 51:24.160]  run impeachment scams, run special counsel scams, special investigations, all these scams, you know, because they really care about the integrity of our elections.
[51:24.160 --> 51:39.160]  Bull crap, because they're ignoring the biggest theft and the biggest proof and expose we've ever seen in modern history of how elections are rigged with electronic voting technology.
[51:39.160 --> 51:46.160]  And of course, of course, this is common sense.
[51:46.160 --> 52:00.160]  What's the easiest way to rig an election? Make it electronic, use the technology to guarantee you get the results that you want.
[52:00.160 --> 52:09.160]  It's not confusing. It doesn't take a rocket science to get this, folks. It's very simple and they did it and they've been caught, not just in America worldwide.
[52:09.160 --> 52:17.160]  It was Democrats years ago complaining about this during Senate testimony. Elizabeth Warren complained, Klobacher complained, Nadler complained.
[52:17.160 --> 52:28.160]  They all complained. Hell, there's speeches from Obama in 2007 and 2008 where he says, yeah, our elections are rigged, so they all know it's going on.
[52:28.160 --> 52:35.160]  You know, the disingenuousness of the modern day liberal, the modern day Democrat, the modern day left is so disgusting.
[52:35.160 --> 52:51.160]  It's just so filthy. And it's perhaps not exemplified any better than Barack Hussein Obama, where he says that the Internet is the single biggest threat to our democracy during an interview.
[52:51.160 --> 52:56.160]  Excuse me, Barack, you traitor.
[52:56.160 --> 52:58.160]  Excuse me, Barack, you traitor.
[52:58.160 --> 53:06.160]  I have about a 15 and a half inch neck. I know that from my dress shirts. I wonder what size neck Obama has for his dress shirts.
[53:06.160 --> 53:09.160]  That's what you give traders, his new dress shirts.
[53:09.160 --> 53:14.160]  But no, I mean, I've got all of this. I've got Lynn Wood, an attorney for Donald Trump, fighting hard.
[53:14.160 --> 53:31.160]  Last night I filed an emergency motion for injunctive relief in my lawsuit against Georgia Secretary of State. Relief sought includes in order prohibiting certification, which includes defective absentee ballots, requiring that a hand count be performed, but they can't do it because it's all in the system.
[53:31.160 --> 53:35.160]  It's all already been rigged.
[53:35.160 --> 53:44.160]  I have Lynn Wood again. I have irrefutable evidence that the Georgia local election officials were instructed by state to report original vote totals and not report recount totals, which are different.
[53:44.160 --> 53:51.160]  These people are corrupt to the point of criminality. They are intentionally engaged in fraud in a federal election.
[53:51.160 --> 53:57.160]  You have Facebook and YouTube and Twitter and the rest censoring President Trump when he talks about what's happening.
[53:57.160 --> 54:04.160]  You have a six part report in the Gateway Pundit breaking down the theft in Georgia, Pennsylvania.
[54:04.160 --> 54:13.160]  You have the 16 of 17 bellwether counties is what they call them that always determine the results of the election. It's almost 100% every year.
[54:13.160 --> 54:17.160]  They all went for Trump this year magically somehow Biden won.
[54:17.160 --> 54:30.160]  Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton nationwide except in four cities. What cities Milwaukee where they stole Wisconsin, Detroit where they stole Michigan, Atlanta where they stole Georgia and Philadelphia where they stole Pennsylvania.
[54:30.160 --> 54:44.160]  It's all out there but then Obama says the Internet is the greatest threat to democracy which has nothing to do with democracy except for the fact that the Internet is where our votes are tabulated when they go through Germany and Spain and they rig the vote.
[54:44.160 --> 54:52.160]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[54:52.160 --> 55:01.160]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[55:01.160 --> 55:18.160]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[55:18.160 --> 55:29.160]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[55:29.160 --> 55:38.160]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[55:38.160 --> 55:45.160]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[56:08.160 --> 56:20.160]  It has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly a new lockdown.
[56:20.160 --> 56:27.160]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[56:27.160 --> 56:37.160]  Then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and that's when all the masks arrest start sometime towards the end of next year.
[56:37.160 --> 56:48.160]  This is a permanent martial law plan. Trump must be impudiated, exposed to how to engage and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[56:48.160 --> 56:59.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:59.160 --> 57:07.160]  Alright folks, everybody is sending me the videos that President Trump retweeted of Heather Mullen, I think is her name. I'm telling you, the video is gone.
[57:07.160 --> 57:10.160]  So I don't know what's up with that, but it's gone.
[57:10.160 --> 57:18.160]  All of her other videos are still up, but this one where she specifically talked to the IT guys and they're like, oh yeah, the IT guys are trying to figure out and they're like, oh yeah, we can't go into the system.
[57:18.160 --> 57:19.160]  We don't know what's happening.
[57:19.160 --> 57:30.160]  You know, hey, you just had your vote here and this could determine the outcome of the election of the most powerful country in the world, leader of the free world, but you know, we don't know what's going on here with the machines.
[57:30.160 --> 57:34.160]  They're broken down. Our IT guys are here, but I don't know. I don't know. And then the video is just gone.
[57:34.160 --> 57:43.160]  More breaking news is coming right now. FBI is investigating Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton saying he, well, we'll have to see this.
[57:43.160 --> 57:49.160]  This sounds like FBI targeting of Ken Paxton because he stopped the steal in Texas.
[57:49.160 --> 57:57.160]  And of course, we've got Alex Jones live with Nick Fuentes, Ali Alexander, Vernon Jones.
[57:57.160 --> 58:04.160]  Let's go back live to the feed that we have right here. They're now inside the Capitol building as Patriots are pouring in.
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.160]  I can't be managed.
[58:08.160 --> 58:10.160]  That's right. We're on the same team.
[58:10.160 --> 58:15.160]  But listen, give us your number. This is the guy that first went to all the hospitals.
[58:15.160 --> 58:21.160]  I know your camera guy. I went to the bathroom in your hotel room in D.C. where you brought us a show last Saturday.
[58:21.160 --> 58:23.160]  Yeah, great job, man. Great.
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.160]  Not even on purpose. Alex, I met him in the lobby. I got him in the bathroom. All the bathrooms are locked. He's like, here's our room.
[58:28.160 --> 58:37.160]  So we've got just people kind of cutting it up there with Alex as I think he's waiting for, he is waiting for the rest of the people to get in there.
[58:37.160 --> 58:41.160]  And they'll probably do an address from inside the building. I'm sure Vernon Jones and others will too.
[58:41.160 --> 58:45.160]  Again, there was just one metal detector they all had to go through, so it's probably going to take some time.
[58:45.160 --> 58:50.160]  Many of them had a bunch of flags and stuff, so probably they're going to have to put those back in their car.
[58:50.160 --> 58:52.160]  So we'll continue to monitor this.
[58:52.160 --> 59:05.160]  But again, Alex Jones is going to be at the state Capitol building in Atlanta, Georgia every day at noon up to and including Saturday.
[59:05.160 --> 59:09.160]  And, you know, the crew was kind of asking me, you know, are you, do you have the itch to be back out there?
[59:09.160 --> 59:11.160]  You're kind of missing this.
[59:11.160 --> 59:17.160]  Yeah, you always are. But, you know, at the same time, it's good.
[59:17.160 --> 59:24.160]  It's relieving to see that there's other patriots gathering because when I went on this journey last week, it was just me.
[59:24.160 --> 59:29.160]  Now you've got Fuentes organizing with them. Now you've got Ali Alexander organizing with them.
[59:29.160 --> 59:32.160]  Now you've got Vernon Jones organizing with them with, of course, Alex Jones.
[59:32.160 --> 59:38.160]  So yeah, I'm always going to have that call it, I guess, a competitive itch just to be out there doing your thing.
[59:38.160 --> 59:45.160]  But it's very comforting knowing that other patriots are rising up and organizing and activating as well.
[59:45.160 --> 59:58.160]  And I have a feeling if this continues like this, and I was saying this to Alex, like, if we continue to do this coverage and to lead these events like we are,
[59:58.160 --> 1:00:02.160]  well, it's going to be a long journey ahead, folks.
[1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:14.160]  So, but I'm seeing people that are still with the, I mean, it's like stop the steel caravan never stopped because I'm seeing people on these feeds that were out there with me in Atlanta,
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:19.160]  out there with me in Tallahassee, out there with me in Columbia, Raleigh, Richmond, and then DC.
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:26.160]  So they're still traveling. I mean, people are literally like dropping everything to just go wherever they need to be to stop this deal from President Trump.
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:29.160]  That's incredible.
[1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:39.160]  And for us, none of this would be possible without your supported info or store.com.
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:50.160]  And, you know, we did a money bomb about a month or so ago and basically could set up the financial infrastructure to to exist as we are for about another year.
[1:00:50.160 --> 1:01:00.160]  And Alex basically decided, you know what, we're going to shift this into high gear and then sent us on the road, sent the caravan on the road and is now on the road himself,
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:07.160]  basically saying, OK, we're going to pull the funds to put us up for the year. We're going to invest it into the stop the steel movement and we're going to be out on the scene.
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:11.160]  We're going to be bringing crews and we're going to be bringing the live streams as well as our normal live coverage.

[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:35.160]  We are now in our two of the Alex Jones show. We're going to pick up the live stream from the capital again in about a half an hour.
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:41.160]  I've got other news I'm going to get to as well as video reports in the meantime.
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:52.160]  Boy, I mean, it's just so do I go down the fake pandemic and everything they're doing with the torture, psychological torture, medical tyranny.
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:04:01.160]  It's coming with that new lockdowns happening nationwide. Biden vows to have massive lockdowns, mask mandates, basically kill everything, all human freedom.
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:04.160]  And he's now assembling the cabinet to do it.
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:18.160]  We've got all that information. But I feel that, oh my gosh, you've got Democrats, you know, I'm going to try not to yell and scream and get frustrated today.
[1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:27.160]  It's just Democrats are the most disingenuous scum I've ever seen in my life.
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:35.160]  And it's just so sick. It's so sick because, you know, you look at a Joe Biden and you get it.
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:42.160]  Here's a corrupt politician who has enriched himself beyond anybody's wildest dreams. You understand that.
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:48.160]  He's a money grubbing corrupt political whore has been for decades. Okay, like you get that's kind of simple. Okay.
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:57.160]  You know, he's he's into underage people. He's probably got his access there. He's, you know, he's into stealing and looting money left and right from all these four nations.
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:05:04.160]  And we know about all that. He's got a son as his mule. His brother is his rat hole. You get that.
[1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:10.160]  Say, okay, this is a guy who's just selfish criminal likes to get his rocks off likes to enrich himself. It's basic criminality.
[1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:18.160]  You can make sense of it. But when you see these low level Democrats on city councils now.
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:28.160]  They're the most disingenuous scum you've ever seen in your life now making threats to Republican poll watchers.
[1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:35.160]  You just why? Why are you such scum? What is in it for you? You don't you're not enriching yourself.
[1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:41.160]  You're not having hookers and drugs delivered to you at your whim. So why? It's just because they're disingenuous scum.
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:46.160]  They just love it. They love being vile filth.
[1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.160]  And it makes me sick that this is what we're up against.
[1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:58.160]  So let me play this clip. And there's two of these clips. I don't even want to play the other one.
[1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:09.160]  This is clip one here, guys. Let's start it from the point where I have it scrub to listen to a Democrat.
[1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:16.160]  Threatening GOP canvassers who just want to make sure that the election in Georgia is fair and counted accurately.
[1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:25.160]  Listen to what they are accused of in a zoom meeting when discussing whether or not to certify the Wayne County results.
[1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:33.160]  Monica Palmer and William Hartman will forever be known in Southeastern Michigan as two racists who did something so unprecedented
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:41.160]  that they disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of black voters in the city of Detroit because they were ordered to.
[1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:46.160]  Probably I know Monica, you think Q told you to do it or some other crazy stuff like that.
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:52.160]  But just know when you try to sleep tonight that millions of people around the world now on Twitter know the name Monica Palmer
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:07:02.160]  and William Hartman as two people completely racist and without an understanding of what integrity means or a shred of human decency.
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:08.160]  You the law isn't on your side, history won't be on your side, your conscience will not be on your side,
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:14.160]  and more knows when you go to meet your maker, your soul is going to be very, very warm.
[1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:23.160]  You are a sick, sad little man, Ned Stabler.
[1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:35.160]  And then you had another one, a Democrat state representative elect Abraham Ayash who did the same thing to Monica
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:45.160]  and then said, now all the world will know your kids names and where they go to school and then said that on a live public transmission.
[1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:47.160]  So now her kids are going to have their lives ruined too.
[1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:49.160]  Do you know how sick these Democrats are folks?
[1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:50.160]  They are sick.
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:52.160]  They are mentally deranged.
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:55.160]  They are an immediate threat and danger to everyone around.
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:10.160]  You know, it's kind of like you got the insane person that's like, literally off their rocker at a mental institution,
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:15.160]  likes to stab people with knives and you see them with a knife and basically everyone gets on high alert.
[1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:21.160]  It's like, whoa, okay, mentally deranged psychopath who likes to stab with a knife has a knife.
[1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:23.160]  We all need to be, that's who these people are.
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:29.160]  That's the average low life Democrat voter these days.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:36.160]  And they've got a knife and they're deranged and they're about to go on a stabbing spree.
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:43.160]  When you're going on public transmissions and accusing people of being racists simply because they want to make sure the election is fair.
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:44.160]  That's their job.
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:52.160]  And then you double down and you name their kids and where they go to school and you tell the world that because you want them to be terrorized.
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:58.160]  You belong in a mental institution, if not locked up for criminal behavior.
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:19.160]  And you know, I'm just trying to control myself here because folks, these people want to run your life and they want to torture you and your family and your lineage for the rest of time because these are sick, demonic freaks.
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:45.160]  They are sick, demonic freaks who choose not to live in reality but instead make up their own fantasy land realities built around their own mentally deranged ideologies and then virtue signal as if they have the moral high ground when everybody knows they have none.
[1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:47.160]  Hey, you have the choice to kill your kid.
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:48.160]  Do I have a choice to wear a mask?
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.160]  Nope.
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:53.160]  That's all you need to know about Democrat Party politics right there.
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:54.160]  Choice to kill your kid?
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:55.160]  Yes.
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:56.160]  Choice to wear a face mask?
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:58.160]  No.
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:09:59.160]  These are tyrants.
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:02.160]  These are sick, mentally ill people, folks.
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:04.160]  Okay.
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:05.160]  They're sick.
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:08.160]  They are an immediate danger to society.
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:19.160]  And you're seeing the pitfalls of their ideologies, you're seeing the pitfalls of their media, you're seeing the pitfalls of their politics.
[1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:22.160]  You had a million Trump people in DC over the weekend.
[1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:24.160]  How many buildings were looted?
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:25.160]  None.
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:27.160]  How many buildings were set on fire?
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:28.160]  None.
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:29.160]  How many police were attacked?
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:30.160]  None.
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:33.160]  How many innocent liberals that were out there were attacked?
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:34.160]  None.
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:35.160]  How many cars were flipped?
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:36.160]  None.
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:41.160]  How much crime was done by millions of Trump supporters in DC this weekend?
[1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:42.160]  None.
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:46.160]  How much crime was done by the thousands of people that joined me on the Stop the Steel Caravan?
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:47.160]  None.
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:52.160]  How much damage has been done today in Georgia, in Atlanta at the State Capitol, by the people rallying?
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:54.160]  None.
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:05.160]  And then the scum of the liberal left is going to sit here on the moral high ground and call us names and say we're the violent ones and we have to sit here and take it?
[1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:06.160]  None.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:16.160]  Eventually, that finger that you keep poking us with is going to get bit off, but it's going to be the whole hand.
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:21.160]  It's just sick, man.
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:23.160]  These people are so sick.
[1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:29.160]  I mean, how many different levels do you measure their disingenuousness with?
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:31.160]  The racism?
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:40.160]  I've got this whole thing over here in my stack of news, a story, a headline.
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:45.160]  Should white boys still be allowed to talk?
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:46.160]  No.
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:47.160]  They say no.
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:49.160]  I shouldn't be allowed to talk.
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:53.160]  And that's why I get censored.
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:55.160]  And these are black college students.
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:01.160]  One of them is a goodwill ambassador of the university.
[1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:13.160]  Says white boys shouldn't be allowed to talk.
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:18.160]  They complain about Russian interference, foreign interference and election integrity for four years.
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:23.160]  And then when we have no proof, by the way, with all their investigations, no proof, nothing.
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:33.160]  And then they have been caught red handed in the most blatant, flagrant election theft in modern day history and in American history.
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:38.160]  And they thumb their nose and they scoff.
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:42.160]  The liberal left is so evil.
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:49.160]  The Democrat voter is so disingenuous and evil, folks.
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  And then they think we're going to suffer in hell when this is all said and done.
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:59.160]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sacks.
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:05.160]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.160]  Incredible.
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:13.160]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction, that's causing the mass starvation.
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.160]  Not the COVID virus.
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:23.160]  That is a fact and all the hero's sheep that wear the mask to go along with this are signing on to mass murder bigger than what Hitler did.
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.160]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:35.160]  This is a medical, world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IDs and coming with forced inoculations.
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:40.160]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:51.160]  That's the reason in FullWars.com. That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary great reset.
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:13.160]  They can't tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law.
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:22.160]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying, Joe Biden is president-elect, repeating it over and over again like a brainwashing mantra.
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:28.160]  When it's up again to the state government to certify those votes, and those votes for being challenged, there's massive evidence of fraud.
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:31.160]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:38.160]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.160]  And there's massive fraud being discovered.
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:44.160]  So we're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent.
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:15:11.160]  He's a globalist. He wants carbon taxes. He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us. This is war.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:24.160]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:32.160]  Who do you think's up in that blimp?
[1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:36.160]  I'll tell you, it's been sitting over us for like 30 minutes.
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:41.160]  Brian Stelter, Humpty Dumpty, is up there surveilling us in that blimp.
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.160]  And listen, I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:47.160]  I'm just saying I wouldn't let him keep my kids, and he looks like a child molester.
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:54.160]  If I was, again, going to be a casting director for a major movie, and I was going to have not just a regular child molester,
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:16:00.160]  but like an evil clown goblin, like clowns from outer space, that eats children, it would be Brian Stelter.
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:06.160]  And then he opens up a big mouth, like at the clown, big sharp teeth, and he just slithers in at night and grabs your kids and runs off with them.
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:11.160]  But you know, what we do know is he's murdering our future, and our children's future, and he's murdering the First Amendment.
[1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:14.160]  This is the guy that pushed for me to be the platform.
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.160]  Now he wants Tucker Carlson taken off the air, he wants OAN taken off the air.
[1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:25.160]  He says it's dangerous that such things exist, that created a parallel universe.
[1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:29.160]  No, it's used, created a parallel universe at your little CNN Center.
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:34.160]  I know you're perched up there in New York, and you're perched in DC, Humpty Dumpty with no viewers.
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:36.160]  You're really the mouth of Jeff Zucker.
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:44.160]  But what we do know is that's the place, right here in Atlanta, where they counted the ballots that it turned out were flipped from Trump to Biden.
[1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:46.160]  Yes, think of the image of that.
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:50.160]  In the CNN Center, there they were, election night, counting the ballots.
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:57.160]  It is so surreal to be here in Olympic Park, where they tried to set up Richard Joule for the bombing of the Olympics.
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:06.160]  They tried to get a Patsy false flag operation, and then right here under the loving gaze of the Communist News Network, founded by who?
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:13.160]  Ted Turner, who wrote books and gave speeches saying he wants to depopulate the earth by 80%.
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:17.160]  And right outside Atlanta is the Georgia Guidestones, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:17:17.160 --> 1:17:22.160]  So we're here covering all this, trying to stop the steal, educating people about what's really happening.
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:27.160]  And the only way I can bring the security team with anti-fun, Black Lives Matter threat here, and they're strong here,
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:32.160]  the only way we can be here to cover all this and to seriously focus on what's happening is your financial support.
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:39.160]  So I want to thank you all for going to infowarstore.com, getting great t-shirts, books, films, water filtration, and then all the great supplements.
[1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:41.160]  These are the highest quality, highest in supplements.
[1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:43.160]  When I forget to take them, I really feel it.
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:45.160]  I'm somebody that burns a candle at both ends.
[1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:51.160]  And without DNA Force Plus, without the CoQ10 and the PQQ that said it, I would not be alive, I think.
[1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:55.160]  Without X2, I mean, I started taking X2, pure iodine seven years ago.
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:58.160]  My libido, my stamina, everything just peaked.
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:00.160]  Most people are iodine deficient.
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:08.160]  You have two billion people, the UN admits, that have mental disabilities because of iodine deficiency when they were growing up.
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:09.160]  This is such a globalist conspiracy.
[1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:13.160]  The iodine conspiracy learned about how it's a good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:16.160]  Again, at infowarstore.com, get your X2.
[1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:20.160]  We've got this huge sale that's got it in by this weekend because we're selling out a lot of these products.
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:22.160]  A lot of new things have come back in.
[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:27.160]  Alpha Power, that boosts your body's natural testosterone so much more.
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:29.160]  It's now back in stock.
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:31.160]  We've got some other great products that have come back in as well.
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:33.160]  But a lot of things are selling out.
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:37.160]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:40.160]  That's how you fund a grassroots operation.
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:44.160]  We're not funded like CNN is by the big military industrial complex and big pharma.
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.160]  We don't get any military industrial complex money.
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:48.160]  We don't get any big pharma money.
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:50.160]  We get money directly from you.
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:52.160]  And these are great products at the same time.
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:58.160]  So I want to thank you for visiting infowarstore.com and shopping with us and just remembering us and bookmarking that site.
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:01.160]  Because they took all our sponsors years ago by harassing them.
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:03.160]  That's how the left operates, death threats, you name it.
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:06.160]  But by you coming and buying products from us, you keep us on air.
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.160]  And that is a revolutionary idea.
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:12.160]  So again, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:18.160]  That keeps all these great shows and our reporters and our crew in the field fighting hard for all of our freedoms,
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.160]  not just for America, but the entire world and a pro human future.
[1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:24.160]  And again, there's a few other products that have also come back in.
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:25.160]  I almost forgot Vaso Beats.
[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:27.160]  It's a really great beat concentrate.
[1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:29.160]  It's great for your cardiovascular system and your heart.
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.160]  It creates a nitrous oxide.
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:32.160]  The blood is so good.
[1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:34.160]  Look up what concentrated beats do.
[1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:36.160]  Ours is a very strong formula, very high quality.
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:37.160]  It's back in stock.
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:39.160]  Everything is 50 to 60% off.
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:43.160]  Triple patriot points and free shipping, but it's got to end coming up this weekend.
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:46.160]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:47.160]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:50.160]  Look, I joke about how creepy Brian Stelzer is.
[1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:55.160]  But what's really creepy is his attempt to molest and rape and murder the First Amendment while claiming to defend it.
[1:19:55.160 --> 1:20:01.160]  This man is a walking contradiction, a walking fraud and a menace to any free society or free individual.
[1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:08.160]  And that is the modern day left in a nutshell.
[1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:15.160]  A threat to truth, a threat to free speech, a threat to any independent sovereign citizen.
[1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:17.160]  They are total tyrants, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:19.160]  They want control over your life.
[1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:21.160]  They want control over your body.
[1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:23.160]  They want control over your children.
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:25.160]  These are sick puppies that we're dealing with.
[1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:46.160]  You know, every once in a while, I just get these intellectual roadblocks on an issue because I can't get the satisfaction of properly unearthing this or getting an understanding.
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:48.160]  The crew says, no, no, no, we get it.
[1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:49.160]  We get it.
[1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:53.160]  I don't feel I'm really properly addressing this.
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:58.160]  Maybe I already have and I just can't get over it because these people are so sick and such an immediate threat to our future.
[1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:06.160]  But again, the disingenuous for these people to cry racism, racism, racism, racism, when they're the biggest racists you've ever seen in your life.
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:15.160]  The disingenuousness of these people like Obama to say the internet is the single biggest threat to our democracy when they're the ones stealing elections.
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:19.160]  I mean, there can't be a bigger threat to democracy other than having fake elections.
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:24.160]  I mean, that's how is free speech a threat to democracy, Barack?
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:25.160]  It's not.
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:29.160]  It's a threat to their power structure.
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:33.160]  But you know, what is Trump doing right now?
[1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:35.160]  And I'm not saying this to attack Trump.
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:41.160]  I'm just, I mean, really, I mean, what is President Trump doing to disappearing Trump act since election night, really?
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:44.160]  You barely seen or heard from him.
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:51.160]  Usually in front of the cameras every day, press conferences, meetings, rallies, whatever.
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:22:00.160]  And the left is just getting more hopped up, more hopped up, more hopped up.
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:09.160]  And so I understand wanting to lay low and then making your reemergence at the most pivotal powerful moment.
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:18.160]  But every day goes by the left gets more entrenched into their belief that Biden won the election.
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:32.160]  And so when you uproot that reality from them, the outrage and hysteria that's going to lead to violent riots in the streets, you know, here's another level of their disingenuousness.
[1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:36.160]  There are stories all across the nation, including where I found this story today.
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:43.160]  I was doing a deep dive into this where the headline is from a black lady, goodwill ambassador who hates white people with the headline,
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:46.160]  should white boys still be allowed to talk?
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:52.160]  That's in the Dixon Dixonian at Dixon College in Pennsylvania.
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:55.160]  You're allowed to be racist against white people.
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:58.160]  And then I'm going on to their website to see, wow, is this really their student paper?
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:22:59.160]  Were they published this?
[1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:03.160]  I mean, I can't imagine when I was the chief editor at my student newspaper.
[1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:15.160]  If I publish something racist like that, but they have how the college is boarded up and they're expecting riots post election.
[1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:17.160]  And I went and I looked other colleges did the same thing.
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:19.160]  You saw it in Washington, D.C.
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:29.160]  And I'm thinking, so think about how disingenuous the liberal left is and the Democrat Party is where they have to board up all of their buildings and board up all of their universities
[1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:33.160]  because they're afraid of violent rioting after the election.
[1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:35.160]  Of course, that's not for Trump supporters.
[1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:37.160]  Everybody knows that it's for the Democrats.
[1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:39.160]  It's for the radical left.
[1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:43.160]  But then they pretend that they're doing it because of Trump supporters.
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:46.160]  I mean, it's the most dishonest, disingenuous thing ever.
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:50.160]  I mean, what do you do with a sack of crap like the Democrat Party?
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:51.160]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:52.160]  Remember Pelosi?
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:53.160]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:54.160]  Remember Obama?
[1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:59.160]  Obama, all of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:03.160]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in the landslide because they have the internal polls.
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:08.160]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:14.160]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze these seven states on election night.
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:17.160]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:18.160]  This is completely transparent.
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:21.160]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:24.160]  Trump has not conceded, none of the states have certified the vote.
[1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:26.160]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:32.160]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:36.160]  And in Georgia, officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:38.160]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:42.160]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:44.160]  But now this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:46.160]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:48.160]  As we know it, we will be Venezuela.
[1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:51.160]  InfoWars.com.
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:21.160]  And so many other amazing products.
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:25.160]  These are game-changing things that the globalists don't need to have.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:30.160]  These are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and your body have to have to live.
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.160]  But regardless, buying these products from us funds the InfoWars.
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:35.160]  It was a 360 win.
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:36.160]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:38.160]  I want to ask you to redouble your efforts to spread the word.
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:40.160]  I want to ask you to buy the products.
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:43.160]  InfoWars.com today because without you, you won't be on the air.
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:44.160]  Again, I salute you and thank you all.
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.160]  The toll-free number is888-253-3139.
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:26:17.160]  Please take action today in our emergency zone.
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:20.160]  I suggest Band.Video.
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:23.160]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen,
[1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:25.160]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:27.160]  The globalists think you're lazy.
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:31.160]  But by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app,
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:34.160]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:36.160]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:38.160]  and click the share buttons below.

[1:26:53.160 --> 1:27:02.160]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:13.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.160]  The disingenuous of a Democrat is stuck in my crawl today.
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:21.160]  For example, Gavin Newsom, who tells you to wear a mask, social distance,
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:23.160]  stay locked down, collapse your business.
[1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:25.160]  It's all for your own safety.
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:27.160]  That punk.
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:30.160]  Well, then he has parties and gets caught having parties.
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:33.160]  So he comes out and makes a statement apologizing, saying,
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:35.160]  I'm sorry I had parties. You're right. I apologize.
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:37.160]  I'll practice what I preach now.
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:39.160]  And he doesn't wear a mask either.
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:41.160]  Well, last night he got caught having dinner.
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:45.160]  No mask, no social distance, a table of at least 10 people.
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:48.160]  No mask between bites.
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:54.160]  Again, another example of the disingenuous, the total fraud of a Democrat.
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:57.160]  These people make me sick.
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:59.160]  You scum. You liars.
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:02.160]  You deceivers. You demons.
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:07.160]  You frauds. You cowards. You traitors.
[1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:14.160]  There's not enough words in the dictionary to describe your phonyism.
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.160]  And now they tell you you can't have Thanksgiving dinner.
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:20.160]  You can't have Christmas gatherings.
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:22.160]  What kind of tyranny is this?
[1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:26.160]  And then they say, Trump is the dictator.
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:27.160]  Trump is the fascist.
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:31.160]  You tell us to stay inside, close down our business, not go to school.
[1:28:31.160 --> 1:28:34.160]  Wear a mask.
[1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.160]  You tell us to collapse the economy.
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:39.160]  You tell us we can't have family over for Thanksgiving.
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:43.160]  And then you dare accuse us of being the fascists
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:48.160]  and accuse us of being the authoritarians.
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.160]  These people want to bring hell on earth, man.
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:51.160]  See, that's what it is.
[1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:54.160]  They know they're all destined to burn in hell forever.
[1:28:54.160 --> 1:29:01.160]  So they're trying to bring hell here.
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:02.160]  It's disgusting.
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:05.160]  By the way, we have found that video I've been looking for.
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:06.160]  We will bring that in.
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:20.160]  We will air it right now.
[1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:22.160]  So there's no like concrete just to get on the record.
[1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:26.160]  There's no concrete explanation as to how those 26, 2700 votes
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:32.160]  were not counted by the machine in the first place.
[1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:33.160]  We don't know.
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:37.160]  I mean, we can't, they're not in there anywhere.
[1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:40.160]  So we don't know why they did get scanned in there.
[1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:42.160]  So have the Dominion tech guys that have been
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.160]  troubleshooting here all day been able to figure out
[1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:48.160]  why they weren't in there?
[1:29:48.160 --> 1:30:01.160]  They're not allowed to comment.
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:04.160]  But as of right now, you can also not confirm that it was
[1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:07.160]  a memory card or anything of that nature as well, right?
[1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:09.160]  Because that hasn't been confirmed to my knowledge
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:10.160]  by anyone here.
[1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:15.160]  I don't think it was a memory card.
[1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:20.160]  So we can rule out memory card that wasn't scanned.
[1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:22.160]  It seems like it's human error.
[1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.160]  It seems like it, but what's the evidence that would
[1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:27.160]  indicate it would be a human error issue?
[1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:31.160]  The ballots didn't transfer over like they should have
[1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:34.160]  and that could have been dealing with whatever program
[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:36.160]  or program, but at this point we really don't know.
[1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:39.160]  So that's why you could also potentially be a software issue.
[1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:41.160]  We're not going to speculate at this point.
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:43.160]  But you just said it could potentially be a human error.
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:44.160]  That was speculation.
[1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:45.160]  Correct.
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:47.160]  So that's why you're asking all these types of different
[1:30:47.160 --> 1:30:48.160]  questions.
[1:30:48.160 --> 1:30:49.160]  I'm just trying to get to you.
[1:30:49.160 --> 1:30:50.160]  I know what you're trying to do.
[1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:53.160]  We really don't have it embedded right now.
[1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:57.160]  We want to be able to give you the exact answer on what
[1:30:57.160 --> 1:30:58.160]  happened.
[1:30:58.160 --> 1:30:59.160]  Absolutely.
[1:30:59.160 --> 1:31:01.160]  I'm not able to do that right now.
[1:31:01.160 --> 1:31:04.160]  So this video has been completely pretty much banned
[1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:06.160]  everywhere on the internet or it's just been memory hold
[1:31:06.160 --> 1:31:07.160]  somehow.
[1:31:07.160 --> 1:31:09.160]  I've not received any explanation as to why.
[1:31:09.160 --> 1:31:12.160]  That was a guy who was smart enough to take a screen
[1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:15.160]  capture of the video because now it's completely gone.
[1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:17.160]  So that's a screen capture of the original video that's now
[1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:18.160]  completely gone.
[1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:22.160]  And you can see why Big Tech would want that gone.
[1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:27.160]  What the hell is going on in Georgia?
[1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:30.160]  I mean, folks, this is...
[1:31:30.160 --> 1:31:36.160]  I mean, they don't know.
[1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:37.160]  They literally...
[1:31:37.160 --> 1:31:38.160]  The guy says, oh, I don't know.
[1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:39.160]  He shrugs his shoulder.
[1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:41.160]  Hey, well, how do these votes disappear?
[1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:43.160]  Is it a software issue?
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:45.160]  Is it human error?
[1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:48.160]  We can't speculate.
[1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:51.160]  But you can't film in here, though.
[1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:53.160]  And then they want to certify the results.
[1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:56.160]  And let's go to this clip.
[1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:00.160]  Now to clip number two here to just kind of put it all together
[1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:02.160]  how folks, they're...
[1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.160]  I mean, they cheated in Georgia.
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:06.160]  So here's what happened.
[1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:08.160]  They cheated in Georgia.
[1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:10.160]  They use the algorithm on the voting machine to flip votes
[1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:12.160]  from Trump to Biden.
[1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:13.160]  They still didn't have enough.
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:15.160]  So they then went into the voting machine
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:19.160]  and just removed votes for Trump remotely
[1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:23.160]  and added votes to Biden, erased the record of that.
[1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:24.160]  So they don't have any record.
[1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:26.160]  And so now the Dominion tech guys are going in there saying,
[1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:27.160]  well, we don't know what happened.
[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:30.160]  Yeah, because someone remotely hacked the voting machine,
[1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:31.160]  stole the votes from Trump,
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:34.160]  and then erased that they were ever there.
[1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:36.160]  And then they add, oh, well, we don't have any record.
[1:32:36.160 --> 1:32:37.160]  We don't know what happened.
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:39.160]  Yeah, you know exactly what happened.
[1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:42.160]  So someone hacked the machine remotely, changed the votes,
[1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:45.160]  rigged the election, erased the proof,
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:47.160]  and now you're covering it up.
[1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.160]  And then they call and they say,
[1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:50.160]  what's going on with the recount?
[1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:52.160]  And they say, well, we're doing a recount,
[1:32:52.160 --> 1:32:54.160]  but it doesn't matter because we're just going to certify
[1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:56.160]  the original numbers either already.
[1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:00.160]  Here's the phone call with the Georgia election official.
[1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:03.160]  This is Jenny Bath-Martin.
[1:33:03.160 --> 1:33:05.160]  I have a couple of questions,
[1:33:05.160 --> 1:33:08.160]  and I'm hoping you might be able to help me.
[1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:10.160]  Which numbers are you going to be giving
[1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:12.160]  to the Secretary of State?
[1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:14.160]  Is it the numbers from the recount,
[1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:16.160]  or is it the numbers from election,
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:19.160]  from the original scan?
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:23.160]  And could I have your name again, please?
[1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:25.160]  Sure, it's Jenny Bath-Martin.
[1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:28.160]  Hold on, please.
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:30.160]  Elections, I can help you.
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:32.160]  Hi, this is Jenny Bath-Martin.
[1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:35.160]  I'm wondering which numbers you guys are sending
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:37.160]  to the Secretary of State.
[1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:39.160]  The numbers from the recount,
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:41.160]  or is it the numbers from the original
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:44.160]  count from Election Day?
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:48.160]  All of us counties have to turn in the same thing.
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:50.160]  What does that mean?
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:53.160]  Because I'm hearing different things from different counties.
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:55.160]  No.
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:59.160]  We all have to turn in what we did election night,
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:02.160]  and then we all have to turn in what we do with this recount.
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:05.160]  The recount's not over, though.
[1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:07.160]  Okay, and is it not over in your county,
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:09.160]  or not over state?
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:11.160]  Okay, so we're going to pull away from this
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.160]  because Alex Jones is live, but folks,
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:15.160]  they can't do the recount because they literally
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:17.160]  don't have the data. It's been erased.
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:19.160]  Alex Jones is live in this state capital building
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:21.160]  in Atlanta with a massive crowd. Let's go live.
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:24.160]  And all the fraud is against Trump!
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:27.160]  I'm sorry, we have people working here,
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:31.160]  so if you can do this, if you can do this.
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:38.160]  All right, we understand.
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:42.160]  At the end, we end with a chance.
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:44.160]  You have to end with a stamp. Listen,
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:47.160]  what we want is for every vote to be counted,
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:49.160]  and the fraud's been proven.
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:51.160]  It's the same formula all over the country.
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:56.160]  The Clinton lawyers came here and met on record.
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:00.160]  Met on record with the state officials
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:03.160]  that allowed them to illegally count votes
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:05.160]  and have mail-in ballots. The legislation
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:07.160]  never passed that law, so it's their duty
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.160]  as our representatives to call a special session
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:12.160]  and to go in and investigate,
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:14.160]  and we know the Democrats don't want that
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:16.160]  because it'll prove the fraud just like everywhere else.
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:18.160]  This is a major moment, and you guys
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:20.160]  the literal vanguard, and Georgia
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:22.160]  is a key battleground state in all of this,
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:24.160]  so I just want to salute you all,
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:26.160]  and thank you for being there because you're the salt
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:28.160]  of the earth, and we love you.
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:30.160] ENCE
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:32.160]  CHEERING
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:34.160]  Y'all don't get me thrown out of here!
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.160]  We want to be able to keep doing this everyday,
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:40.160]  so at the end, we will disrupt.
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:42.160]  Okay, you're very serious,
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:44.160]  we'll disrupt.
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.160]  Let me just give
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:49.160]  one statement to the Democrats,
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:51.160]  the new world order and the globalists here.
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:54.160]  We're peaceful now, we're civil now.
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:56.160]  If you steal this election from us,
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.320]  Patients may run so thin it may run out.
[1:36:03.820 --> 1:36:05.520]  It was when all these battleground states
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:07.400]  bought higher numbers on election night
[1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:09.280]  till they closed the polls and then secretly
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:11.280]  stopped the battle, the ballot boxes.
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:13.000]  And so that's why they're scared of recounts.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.320]  It's why they're scared of legislators stepping in
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:16.720]  and is their constitutional duty.
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:19.440]  So what you're doing is as patriotic as the people
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:21.000]  that sound the Declaration of Independence,
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.640]  it's so important, no matter what they do with this fraud,
[1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:27.680]  as a great state rep, Mr. Jones was saying is,
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:30.200]  they may even win this war.
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:31.360]  They may even win this battle,
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:32.680]  but we're gonna win the war.
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  1770, 1770.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:34.520]  1770.
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:35.360]  1770.
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:36.200]  1770.
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:37.800]  Now, can we leave?
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:38.640]  We're about to leave now.
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:40.040]  What an incredible crowd of people.
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:42.040]  We'll continue to follow this live stream.
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:43.920]  And folks, I'm telling you, I'm seeing a lot of faces
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:45.860]  that were on the Stop the Steel Caravan with me
[1:36:45.860 --> 1:36:46.920]  over a week ago.
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:48.760]  I mean, Americans are ready to fight.
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:49.600]  You're not stealing this election.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:52.360]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:55.000]  with one of our most powerful products ever made,

[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:43.560]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:47.560]  The problem with social Darwinism is
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:50.560]  the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart,
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:54.560]  inventive people, believe that chivalry
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:55.560]  doesn't exist anymore.
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:57.560]  They don't believe in being aristocrats,
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:00.560]  trying to hold up civilization and power the people.
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:03.560]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea,
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:05.560]  civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:08.560]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:10.560]  and not treat your own families.
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:14.560]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:17.560]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil or spurs
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:20.560]  that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes,
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:22.560]  try to get away from a humanity.
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:24.560]  But really, they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:27.560]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:29.560]  and not feel it themselves.
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:31.560]  But the repercussions of what they commit
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:33.560]  always comes back on them and their families
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:35.560]  and the very structure itself.
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:38.560]  Wealth is created by the fact that
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:41.560]  wealth is created by loving God.
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.560]  Wealth is created by having connection to God.
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:46.560]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:48.560]  If we deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:52.560]  The great moment of truth this year.
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:55.560]  America discovered the last five, six years
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:38:57.560]  that we were under globalist control
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  and the traitors of both parties have sold us out
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.560]  to communist China and multinational corporations
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:05.560]  and were established in a authoritarian anti-American system.
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:07.560]  Well, now they've launched their counter assault
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:10.560]  and through fraud are trying to steal the election right now
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:12.560]  and complete the police state takeover
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:15.560]  by bankrupting the people of the United States
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:18.560]  but also the entire world to bring us to our knees
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  under their great reset.
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:23.560]  Info wars has never been more valuable or more important
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:25.560]  and I'm honored with the position that you've put me in
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:27.560]  and for God's blessing.
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:29.560]  But I'm asking all listeners to understand
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.560]  that info wars is spending more money
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.560]  than we've ever spent in the fight
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:35.560]  to expose the stolen election
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:38.560]  to 21, the great reset, and the globalist takeover.
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.560]  So please visit infowarstore.com today.

[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:44.560]  that I've extended through the weekend but then it will end.

[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:50.560]  infowarstore.com.
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:52.560]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now
[1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:54.560]  by the United Nations, the Davos Group,
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:56.560]  Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Holman Sachs.
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:58.560]  They're saying that the COVID virus
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:00.560]  is going to cause a global depression
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:02.560]  and hundreds of millions to start the death.
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:04.560]  Incredible.
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:06.560]  There are the very organizations that
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:08.560]  ordered the global lockdowns
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:10.560]  that are causing the chain reaction
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:12.560]  that's causing the mass starvation,
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:14.560]  not the COVID virus.
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:16.560]  That is a fact and all the hero sheep
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  where the masks can go along with this
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:20.560]  are signing on to mass murder
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:22.560]  bigger than what Hitler did.
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.560]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.560]  and the Nuremberg Code.
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:28.560]  This is a medical, world government,
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:30.560]  tyrannical takeover, causing starvation,
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:32.560]  setting up world IDs,
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:34.560]  with forced inoculations.
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:36.560]  And now Bank of America says global unrest
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:38.560]  is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:40.560]  That's stories on infowarstore.com.
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:42.560]  That's why it's vital for all of you
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:44.560]  to be public and to say you're not stand
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:46.560]  for this or the mass global genocide
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:48.560]  being caused by the planetary
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:41:04.560]  crisis.
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:14.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:24.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:34.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:42.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:52.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:42:02.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:22.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:46.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:48.560]  Now folks, think about it.
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:50.560]  The video we played in the last segment
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:52.560]  shows clearly there is some sort of
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:54.560]  issue with the Dominion voting systems
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:56.560]  in the software.
[1:42:56.560 --> 1:42:58.560]  You think that is a singular issue?
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:00.560]  You think that's an isolated incident?
[1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:02.560]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:04.560]  That is nationwide fraud.
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:06.560]  And they're hiding it.
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:26.560]  We got a massive crowd here
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:28.560]  following Alex Jones at the state
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:32.560]  capitol building in Atlanta, Georgia.
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:36.560]  A huge crowd has turned up.
[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:40.560]  Americans are rallying nationwide.
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:42.560]  And I think this is just the beginning.
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:44.560]  I'm not really sure where it goes
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:46.560]  from here, but I do believe this is
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:48.560]  just the beginning.
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:52.560]  Because I'm seeing more people
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:54.560]  ready to mobilize and activate
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:56.560]  than I've ever seen.
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:58.560]  And we're able to basically hold these
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:00.560]  events with less than 24 hours
[1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:02.560]  to get them out.
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:04.560]  Let's go back live.
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:32.560]  Special session.
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:34.560]  Fine over prison.
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:36.560]  Fine over prison.
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:38.560]  Joe Biden is literally wanted
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:40.560]  in a criminal investigation
[1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:42.560]  in Ukraine.
[1:44:42.560 --> 1:44:44.560]  He is a worldwide criminal.
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:46.560]  Everybody knows it.
[1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:48.560]  God bless you all.
[1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:50.560]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:52.560]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:54.560]  That is Alex Jones today.
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:56.560]  He is hopping into the armored truck
[1:44:56.560 --> 1:44:58.560]  and taking off from the capitol
[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:00.560]  of Georgia in Atlanta today.
[1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:02.560]  I imagine he'll probably be joining us
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:04.560]  here before long as well.
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:10.560]  You know,
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:12.560]  my estimate is that
[1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:14.560]  the Democrats have realized
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:18.560]  it's not just about getting enough votes
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:20.560]  of enough electoral votes
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:22.560]  to put Biden over the top.
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:24.560]  They know they have to steal as many states
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:26.560]  as possible to guarantee victory here.
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:28.560]  They're not going to make the statement
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:30.560]  in 2016.
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:32.560]  So, yes, they're trying to steal
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:34.560]  Nevada, Arizona,
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:36.560]  Georgia,
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:38.560]  Pennsylvania, Michigan
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:40.560]  and Wisconsin still as we speak.
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:42.560]  But look at this massive
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:44.560]  crowd here, guys. Let's go back live to this feed.
[1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:52.560]  Nick Quintan!
[1:45:54.560 --> 1:45:56.560]  State Representative
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:45:58.560]  Donald Trump!
[1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:02.560]  And in Rick A. and those crazy boys,
[1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.560]  there's four boys.
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:08.560]  We're going to be here every day at noon,
[1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:10.560]  Christmas and Saturday.
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:12.560]  Stop, stop, steal!
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:14.560]  Stop, stop, steal!
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:16.560]  Stop, stop, steal!
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:18.560]  Stop, stop, steal!
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:20.560]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:22.560]  So they're trying to steal
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:24.560]  all these states. Trump won them all.
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:26.560]  And
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:32.560]  what you're seeing right now is
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:34.560]  who is
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:36.560]  ready, willing and able
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:38.560]  to fight for America, fight for the future,
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:40.560]  generations of Americans, fight for
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:42.560]  truth, fight for justice.
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:44.560]  And we're going to see real quick
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:48.560]  who's willing to take that mantle and who's going to take the knee.
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.560]  And when it gets in front of judges,
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:54.560]  I think that's when we're going to really know
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:56.560]  our shot at having a legal victory here.
[1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:17.560]  Let's go back live now, Alex Jones on the PA.
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:28.560]  We're all in grave danger.
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:30.560]  Fight for America.
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:32.560]  China Joe is not
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:34.560]  eligible to be president.
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:36.560]  He is an agent
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:38.560]  of the Communist Chinese.
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:42.560]  Our Republic is in
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:44.560]  grave danger.
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:46.560]  We must have an emergency
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:48.560]  session in Georgia.
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:50.560]  They violated the law of proving the mail imbalance
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:52.560]  outside of law.
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:54.560]  You must do your duty
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:56.560]  as special person
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:58.560]  now.
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:00.560]  Special person now.
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:02.560]  Special person now.
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:08.560]  So it's going to be like this in Atlanta, Georgia
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:10.560]  tomorrow,
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:12.560]  Friday, and then the big one is
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:14.560]  going to be
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:16.560]  Saturday.
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:18.560]  And I'm not
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.560]  planned to go on this trip.
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:22.560]  As I was saying
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:24.560]  earlier, if this continues basically
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:26.560]  I think it's going to have to be like a tag team operation
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:28.560]  just to preserve energy
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:30.560]  and not destroy ourselves
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:32.560]  and our voices here.
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  But I did look at
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  flights into Atlanta this Saturday.
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:38.560]  Folks, there's nothing available.
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:40.560]  So there's about to be
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:42.560]  perhaps even tens of thousands
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:44.560]  of people in Atlanta on Saturday.
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:46.560]  I'm predicting now. And I haven't had a vision or anything
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:48.560]  yet, but I did have a vision
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:50.560]  of Saturday.
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:52.560]  I was on air on the war room
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:54.560]  and the Alex Jones show and others
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:56.560]  while I was on the caravan last week.
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:48:58.560]  I said I had a vision. I did and my vision came true.
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:00.560]  So I haven't really manifested
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:02.560]  a vision yet of what's coming
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:04.560]  in Atlanta Saturday. I made tonight.
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:06.560]  But
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:08.560]  based on just the evidence
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.560]  of me doing
[1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:12.560]  my own journalistic work and traveling
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  to events, I can tell you right now
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:16.560]  there is going to be thousands of people in Atlanta this weekend
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  guaranteed.
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  If you look at flights to get into a city
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:22.560]  and there isn't a single one available,
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:24.560]  yes, I know they have less people
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:26.560]  on these flights because of COVID, but still,
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:28.560]  that's not an anomaly to be ignored.
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:30.560]  That's
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.560]  that means something's going down
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:34.560]  in that destination and that destination
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:36.560]  is Atlanta, Georgia.
[1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:38.560]  And that time is this weekend.
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:40.560]  So
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:42.560]  that's just incredible.
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:46.560]  And
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:48.560]  a relief factor.
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:50.560]  It's such
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:52.560]  a relief factor.
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:54.560]  Seeing so
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:56.560]  many Americans rise up.
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  Seeing so many people in the media
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:00.560]  that maybe they don't like us and we've disagreed
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:02.560]  on things, but the fact that we're all on this
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:04.560]  together now, we all realize the challenge
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  ahead and we all know how important it is to
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:08.560]  protect our elections.
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:10.560]  Everybody needs to come together
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:12.560]  to do this.
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:14.560]  And the evil and
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:16.560]  the tyranny we face if we're not victorious
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:18.560]  in this battle,
[1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:20.560]  we may never be able to escape
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  from.
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:24.560]  And we realize this.
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  And that's why we're fighting so damn hard
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.560]  right now.
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:32.560]  So,
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:34.560]  it's everything we thought
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:36.560]  here at Info Wars, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:38.560]  It's everything we've been telling you about.
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:40.560]  It's everything we've been warning about.
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:42.560]  The exact reason why we bought that armored truck
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  and do it safely because we know that the
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:46.560]  radical terroristic left would be out
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:48.560]  hunting us
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:50.560]  like they do.
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:52.560]  Those sick deranged
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:54.560]  freaks.
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:56.560]  Just incredible.
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:58.560]  What a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:00.560]  And the whole world is watching.
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:02.560]  The whole world is watching.
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:04.560]  All right, when we come back, I'm going to play
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:06.560]  that video again.
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.560]  The headline is
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:10.560]  Georgia elections officials have no answer
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.560]  as to what caused 2700
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:14.560]  votes to go uncounted.
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:16.560]  Dominion IT say they cannot
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.560]  comment.
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:20.560]  We'll play that video in its entirety
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:22.560]  as we come up
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.560]  in the next
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:26.560]  segment. I've got other news to cover as well.
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:28.560]  We'll stay monitoring the situation in Atlanta.
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:30.560]  And it's John Rappaport
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:32.560]  in the fourth hour today, am I correct?
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  Always informative.
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.560]  And then I'll be hosting the war room
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  today as well.
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  Alex Jones here with an important
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:42.560]  message to all of our listeners and viewers.
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.560]  I want to thank you for your support over the years.
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:46.560]  I want to thank you for having skin in the game.
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:48.560]  And no one has had more skin in the game
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:50.560]  than our president. And he needs our prayers.
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:52.560]  He needs our support. He is the president.
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:54.560]  Secretary of State Pompeo understands
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:56.560]  that's why he said yesterday
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:51:58.560]  there will be a smooth transition
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:00.560]  from this Trump administration
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:02.560]  into the next Trump administration.
[1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  Because in all the major states
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:06.560]  where they're still counting,
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:08.560]  that is, President Trump, Republican
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  party, the American people, the populace,
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:12.560]  the patriots, the enemy,
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:14.560]  the Democrats, backed by the shy comms,
[1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:16.560]  backed by the European Union, backed by Hollywood,
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:18.560]  backed by the left, the blue cities, the blue states.
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:20.560]  They are in a rage
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:22.560]  trying to gaslight us, keep calling
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.560]  Biden president-elect. He's not.
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:26.560]  President has to concede and or
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:28.560]  all of the states have to certify
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  the vote, which hasn't happened yet. And then you have to
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:32.560]  have the electors seek
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:34.560]  who is going to be the president. And this
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:36.560]  may be a dispute that goes back to the states.
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:53:05.560]  That's why it's in the Constitution. And the Constitution's kicking in.
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:08.560]  Why shouldn't they? They never get in trouble
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:10.560]  for the big illegal wars. They never get in trouble
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:12.560]  for the Chinese slave camps. They never
[1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:14.560]  get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:16.560]  in Africa. They never get in trouble
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:18.560]  for shipping fentanyl and other
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  deadly drugs into our country. And so
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:22.560]  why shouldn't they go for
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:24.560]  broke? Because so many people are domesticated
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:26.560]  and they're soft and they have
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:28.560]  Stockholm syndrome. They love their abusers.
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.560]  They can't believe they're being lied to.
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:32.560]  They can't believe they're being conned.
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  And so they're going into bondage.
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:36.560]  You see, there's always a minority
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:38.560]  that says no and enforces that minority.
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:44.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:53:44.560 --> 1:54:10.560]  show.
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:14.560]  the latest and activated.
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  And we have
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:18.560]  alerted and
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:20.560]  alarmed and informed
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:22.560]  the people of Georgia today
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:24.560]  about the steal that is coming.
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:26.560]  And there is so much evidence of voter fraud
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:28.560]  and so much evidence of the Democrats
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:30.560]  trying to cover it up. It's overwhelming.
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  I imagine we'll be hearing from Alex Jones
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:34.560]  shortly. In the meantime, I want to air
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:36.560]  this video again in its entirety
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  because it's shocking. It's disturbing.
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:40.560]  It's been totally memory-hold from the Internet.
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:42.560]  One guy was able to screenshot it
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.560]  before it got disappeared.
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:46.560]  The Dominion tech team can't answer
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  questions, refuses to answer questions,
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:50.560]  and then basically has to admit
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:52.560]  that a software glitch happened
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:54.560]  and they cannot answer why
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:56.560]  this could be happening and is
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:54:58.560]  happening across the nation
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:00.560]  with this electronic voting machine.
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:02.560]  It's very dangerous. We have rigged elections.
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:04.560]  It's all coming out. Just listen
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  for yourself. A pool watcher
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:08.560]  asking the Dominion tech guys
[1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:10.560]  what
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:12.560]  happened, why did votes go
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  uncounted?
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:22.560]  So there's no concrete
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:24.560]  just to get on the record. There's no concrete
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  explanation as to how those 26-2700
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:28.560]  votes were not counted by the machine
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  in the first place?
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:32.560]  They shrugged their shoulders.
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:34.560]  We don't know. I mean, we can't...
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:36.560]  They're not in there
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:38.560]  so we don't know why
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:40.560]  they didn't get scanned in there.
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:42.560]  So have the Dominion tech guys
[1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:44.560]  that have been troubleshooting here all day
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:46.560]  been able to figure out why they weren't in there?
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:52.560]  They're not allowed to comment.
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:54.560]  They're not allowed to comment.
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  They're not allowed to comment
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  even though it's our elections.
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.560]  And you're not allowed to film or watch
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  even though it's our elections.
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:04.560]  But as of right now, you can also
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  see that it was a memory card
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.560]  or anything of that nature as well, right?
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.560]  Because that hasn't been confirmed to my knowledge
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:12.560]  by anyone here.
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:14.560]  I don't think it was a memory card.
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.560]  Do you?
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:18.560]  I don't think it was a memory card either.
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:20.560]  So we can rule out a memory card?
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:22.560]  We can rule out a memory card that wasn't scanned.
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  It seems like it's human error.
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  It seems like it, but what's the evidence
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.560]  that would indicate it would be a human error
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:30.560]  issue?
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.560]  The ballots didn't transfer over
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:34.560]  and we could have been dealing with
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:36.560]  whatever program or program,
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:38.560]  but at this point, we really don't know.
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.560]  So potentially be a software issue?
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:42.560]  We're not going to speculate at this point.
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:44.560]  But you just said it could potentially be a human error
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:46.560]  or that was speculation?
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:48.560]  Correct, so that's why you're asking all these
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.560]  types of different questions.
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:52.560]  I'm just trying to give you any.
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:54.560]  I know what you're trying to do.
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:56.560]  We really don't have it embedded right now.
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:58.560]  We want to be able to give you
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:00.560]  the exact answer on what happened.
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:02.560]  Okay, thanks.
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:04.560]  It's a total disaster, folks.
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:06.560]  And the truth is
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  they can't do a recount because
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:10.560]  they don't have the votes
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:12.560]  and the electronic record of the votes
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.560]  is all they have and it's tarnished.
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:16.560]  It's been meddled with.
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.560]  It's been tainted.
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:20.560]  So they don't know what to do.
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:22.560]  And so then they call the elections officials
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  and the elections officials say, well, we're technically
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  doing a recount, but it's not going to count
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:28.560]  and we're just going to go with the original results
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:30.560]  because they can't do the recount.
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  The voting machines
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  have been hacked remotely.
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  They've had votes flipped.
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  They've had votes deleted and the tech guys
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  apparently you can't see their faces.
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  They won't answer questions. They're not allowed to.
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:44.560]  They just are in control of our elections
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:46.560]  and they just don't know what's going on.
[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:48.560]  No, they know exactly what's going on.
[1:57:48.560 --> 1:57:50.560]  Somebody hacked the voting machines
[1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:52.560]  remotely in Georgia.
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:54.560]  Somebody hacked the voting machines
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:56.560]  remotely in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin,
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:58.560]  everywhere.
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:02.560]  And the software guys go in there,
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:04.560]  the IT guys knowingly or not
[1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:06.560]  and they're like, oh, this is strange.
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:08.560]  Where are these votes? What happened to these votes?
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:10.560]  How come there's no record?
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:12.560]  They know really what happened, but oh,
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:14.560]  they don't want to be the ones
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:16.560]  to go on record and say it. Yikes.
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:18.560]  Yikes.
[1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:24.560]  This is so sick.
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:26.560]  Where's Joe Biden?
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:28.560]  Where are the Democrats? Oh, election integrity,
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:30.560]  election meddling, foreign interference.
[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:32.560]  They send our election data
[1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:34.560]  through Germany, through Spain,
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:36.560]  with Microsoft, with Amazon.
[1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:38.560]  And then it comes back
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:40.560]  dirty
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:42.560]  so that they can select whatever candidate they want.
[1:58:42.560 --> 1:58:44.560]  It's a selection and it's now been

[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:26.560]  79days.news
[2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:32.560]  We're waiting to hear from
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:34.560]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:36.560]  He has just left the state capital
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:38.560]  of Georgia there in Atlanta.
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:40.560]  Just so much coming in
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:42.560]  with the Democrat election theft.
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:44.560]  So much criminal
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:46.560]  behavior going unchecked.
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:50.560]  What America really
[2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:52.560]  needs
[2:00:52.560 --> 2:00:54.560]  more than ever before and I don't
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:56.560]  know how this can be done more than so
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:00:58.560]  than it already has.
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:00.560]  When you talk about the crimes of the Biden family
[2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:02.560]  all on record
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:04.560]  they even admit it in their own
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:06.560]  press conferences and
[2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:08.560]  the council of foreign relations.
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:10.560]  We have their emails,
[2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:14.560]  videos, everything.
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:16.560]  So it's like, how do you get more of an
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:18.560]  exposure than that?
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:20.560]  How do you get more of an exposure when we
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:22.560]  know everything about Barack Obama and
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:24.560]  Spygate?
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:26.560]  Well, you have the president
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:28.560]  with a team of lawyers sit down,
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:30.560]  lay it all out in an hour,
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:32.560]  two hour long press conference,
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:34.560]  and just
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.560]  immediately send in
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:38.560]  sheriffs
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:40.560]  or FBI or whoever you can get
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:42.560]  to arrest the criminals.
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:46.560]  And it's what this country needs.
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:48.560]  And if you're making
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:50.560]  the measurement on a political level
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:52.560]  oh, we can't do that,
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:54.560]  the left is gonna riot, they're gonna
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:56.560]  riot anyway. What are you waiting for?
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:00.560]  They'll sputter out in a couple of weeks.
[2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:04.560]  It's a house of cards
[2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:08.560]  with a castle built on sand.
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:10.560]  That's what this
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:12.560]  country needs because
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:14.560]  we have two polar
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:16.560]  opposite views of reality
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:18.560]  and they've been coming after
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:20.560]  our leader Donald Trump for four years
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:22.560]  with all the investigations in the world and found nothing.
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:24.560]  Now it's time to go after their leaders,
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:28.560]  expose all their crimes, put them in jail
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:30.560]  and give America
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:32.560]  the cleansing that it needs
[2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:34.560]  that it needs right now.
[2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:38.560]  And see, they take stuff like that
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:40.560]  and they turn it into a race thing
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:42.560]  or they spin it off out of context
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:44.560]  all these lies because they know what it really means.
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:46.560]  It's the Bidens,
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  it's the Obamas, it's Clapper,
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:50.560]  it's Comey, it's Brennan,
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:52.560]  it's Rice, it's the Clintons.
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:56.560]  Yes, it's the Bushes, it's the McCain's.
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:58.560]  Yes, they are the
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:00.560]  traders of America. They are the ones
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:02.560]  that have committed treason.
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:04.560]  Time and time and time
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:06.560]  again.
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:08.560]  And America
[2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:10.560]  must have
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:12.560]  this cleansing of our
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  institutions and our government
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:16.560]  from the massive criminals
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:18.560]  that have been running it.
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:20.560]  And then you talk
[2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:22.560]  about the average liberal street thug.
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  You know, it's one thing to
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:28.560]  you know, you've got
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:30.560]  someone in your family that's mentally ill
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:32.560]  really not in a good place
[2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:34.560]  and you feel bad.
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:36.560]  And you know, they're in a mental institution
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:38.560]  or something or at the hospital and you go visit them
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:40.560]  and you feel bad and maybe they're harnessed to their chair
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:42.560]  or they've got a security guard
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:44.560]  but you feel bad and you go visit them
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:46.560]  and you try to talk to them.
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:48.560]  That's one thing, that's not the situation we're in.
[2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:50.560]  The situation we're in is that
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:52.560]  you're in the mental institution
[2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:54.560]  and the
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:56.560]  Asylumes are running it
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:03:58.560]  and they've all got knives
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:00.560]  and they're looking at you.
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:02.560]  That's the situation we're in.
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:04.560]  They want
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:06.560]  control over our system
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:08.560]  and they're a bunch of rabid
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:10.560]  mental lunatics
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  that want to run the Asylum.
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:16.560]  So their leaders must be
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:18.560]  exposed and arrested
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:20.560]  to take any wind out of their sails.
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  Their mainstream news must
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:24.560]  be fully exposed for the frauds that they are.
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:26.560]  Again,
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:28.560]  how you can do that more than we already know
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:30.560]  is the challenge
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:32.560]  that Trump and his legal team face.
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:34.560]  Is the challenge that we face here at InfoWars.
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:36.560]  How can the mainstream news be more exposed
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:38.560]  as total frauds?
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:40.560]  Faking lies to get us into
[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:42.560]  wars, running with those lies.
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:44.560]  Faking lies about
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:46.560]  Russian inclusion, faking lies about hate crimes,
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:48.560]  faking lies about Brett Kavanaugh,
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:50.560]  faking lies about Trump.
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:52.560]  All they do, fake, divide,
[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:54.560]  fake, divide, lie, divide,
[2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:56.560]  lie, divide, deceive, divide.
[2:04:58.560 --> 2:05:00.560]  And then pretend they have the moral high ground
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:02.560]  because that's the only thing that they can
[2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:04.560]  muster up
[2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:08.560]  to get any sort of
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:10.560]  confidence or genuine
[2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:12.560]  touch to their
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:14.560]  news when it's all fake.
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:20.560]  And now they're using COVID
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:22.560]  to put a mask on your face,
[2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:24.560]  a foreign substance in your veins,
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:26.560]  lock down
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:28.560]  your business, shut down your business,
[2:05:28.560 --> 2:05:30.560]  lock you down,
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:32.560]  imprison you, keep your kids from
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:34.560]  going to school. This is a
[2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:36.560]  sick death cult.
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:40.560]  But you know, Obama in his interview is saying,
[2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:44.560]  most people believe
[2:05:44.560 --> 2:05:46.560]  now they send teams out to go door to door
[2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:48.560]  in like polling style
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:50.560]  and they send teams out to ask about the Democrat Party
[2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:52.560]  and they're now getting like 30%
[2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:54.560]  of the people respond saying, aren't the Democrats
[2:05:54.560 --> 2:05:56.560]  the leaders of a pedophile ring?
[2:05:58.560 --> 2:06:00.560]  So it's already out. The country has
[2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:02.560]  completely rebuked the Democrat Party.
[2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:04.560]  All they have is their charade. That's all
[2:06:04.560 --> 2:06:06.560]  they have. All they have is their shadow
[2:06:06.560 --> 2:06:08.560]  on the wall. As soon as you
[2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:10.560]  turn around and you see the puppet master, the shadow
[2:06:10.560 --> 2:06:12.560]  master, it's game over.
[2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:16.560]  As soon as that transmission is stopped, it's game
[2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:18.560]  over.
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:22.560]  America knows
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:24.560]  about the treason of Barack Obama.
[2:06:24.560 --> 2:06:26.560]  America knows about the treason
[2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:28.560]  of Joe Biden.
[2:06:30.560 --> 2:06:32.560]  America will not weep
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:34.560]  when these traitors are brought to justice.
[2:06:34.560 --> 2:06:36.560]  No, instead we will weep until they are
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:38.560]  brought to justice.
[2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:40.560]  And of course, the radical
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:42.560]  leftist terrorists are going to go out in the streets
[2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:44.560]  and riot and loot and burn and steal
[2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:46.560]  and do everything they do. They're going to do that
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:48.560]  anyway, folks. And they will continue to do
[2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:50.560]  that until the wind has been removed
[2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:52.560]  from their sails and that wind
[2:06:52.560 --> 2:06:54.560]  is the corrupt establishment and the
[2:06:54.560 --> 2:06:56.560]  criminals at the top of the political infrastructure.
[2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:58.560]  Obama,
[2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  Biden,
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:02.560]  the Clintons and the list goes on and on.
[2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:08.560]  But you need not know
[2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:10.560]  anything else
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:14.560]  about the Democrat Party than this.
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:16.560]  They want to give you the choice
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:18.560]  to kill your children,
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:20.560]  but you have no choice.
[2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  You must wear a mask. You have no
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:24.560]  choice. You must take a vaccine.
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:26.560]  You have no choice. You must
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:28.560]  close your business. You have no choice.
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:30.560]  You can't send your kids to school. You have no
[2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:32.560]  choice. You must go
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:34.560]  under house arrest. So you have no freedoms,
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:36.560]  no choice, nothing.
[2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:38.560]  They run your lives, except you get to kill
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:40.560]  your kid. They'll give you that one little freedom.
[2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:42.560]  And that's all you need
[2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:44.560]  to know about the Democrat Party politic right
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:46.560]  there.
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:48.560]  It's all you need to know.
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:50.560]  And now Joe Biden
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.560]  is forming the most Hitlerian,
[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:54.560]  totalitarian,
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:56.560]  authoritarian regime
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  that you've ever seen. He wants
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:00.560]  Ezekiel Manuel
[2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:02.560]  on his team. He's already put him on this
[2:08:02.560 --> 2:08:04.560]  team. Oh, that's just the guy that put death panels
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:06.560]  into Obamacare. So you turn
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:08.560]  your 75 years old,
[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:10.560]  Emanuel shows up and, you know,
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:12.560]  he kills you with the death panel. Oh, no, no, no, it's just
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:14.560]  part of Obamacare.
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:16.560]  He just
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:18.560]  appointed to his treasury team
[2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:20.560]  a lady who
[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:22.560]  worked with Kamala Harris
[2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:26.560]  Merza Bararadon
[2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:28.560]  Baradaran
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:30.560]  who wants
[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:32.560]  white people to pay reparations to
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:34.560]  black people.
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:36.560]  He has
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:38.560]  appointed Richard Stengel
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:40.560]  to his
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:42.560]  transition team
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:44.560]  who is anti-free speech
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:48.560]  and has said
[2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:50.560]  speech on the internet must be censored, especially
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:52.560]  hate speech or speech that could lead to violence.
[2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:54.560]  No.
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:56.560]  No.
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:58.560]  It's all a lie.
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:00.560]  Again,
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:02.560]  I was saying this on the war room. Here's the
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:04.560]  analogy.
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:06.560]  If you're at your neighbor's house having a
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:08.560]  barbecue
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:10.560]  and someone comes up to you, your wife is at
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:12.560]  home, and someone comes up to you and says,
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:14.560]  hey, man,
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:16.560]  a guy just broke into your house and is
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:18.560]  raping your wife right now. Do you get mad at
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:20.560]  him? You say, how dare you say that? You're
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:22.560]  inciting me to violence.
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:24.560]  And then punch him in the mouth? Or do
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:26.560]  you run across the street and save your wife
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:28.560]  from getting raped? I think the answer is obvious.
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:30.560]  No.
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:32.560]  The Democrats want you to be mad at the messenger
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:34.560]  and let them rape your wife.
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:36.560]  Hey, the Democrats stole the election. Don't
[2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:38.560]  say that. That could lead to violence.
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:40.560]  Hey, Barack Obama and Joe Biden
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:42.560]  sold you out to China and Russia
[2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:44.560]  and Ukraine. Hey, don't say that. That
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:46.560]  will lead to violence. No, they're the criminals.
[2:09:46.560 --> 2:09:48.560]  Introducing
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:50.560]  Info Wars Life, pure turmeric extract.
[2:09:50.560 --> 2:09:52.560]  This is taken
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:54.560]  under the tongue. It is pure
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  turmeric.
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.560]  It goes together very well with our
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:00.560]  body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:02.560]  that is taken as a powdered capsule
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:04.560]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:06.560]  This is absorbed
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:08.560]  under the tongue into the bloodstream
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:10.560]  and then the remaining also is absorbed
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:12.560]  by the stomach. So it's more of an intense
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:14.560]  delivery system. The two formulas
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:16.560]  are different, but both are concentrated
[2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:18.560]  and our first product got rape reviews.
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:20.560]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.560]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:24.560]  Some like bodies better.
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:26.560]  For me, they're both amazing for their
[2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:28.560]  anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:30.560]  And they fund the Info War. So get our new
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:32.560]  liquid turmeric extract

[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:42.560]  for all of our bodies. For inflammation
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:44.560]  and so much more. Get yours today
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:46.560]  at InfoWarsLife.com
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:48.560]  You know, something very sad is happening.
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:50.560]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  two and a half years ago when Info Wars got banned
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:54.560]  off of more than 60 major platforms.
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:56.560]  I warned everybody that was a precedent
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:58.560]  for the upcoming presidential
[2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:00.560]  election and that they would
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:02.560]  continue to ratchet down
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:04.560]  and tighten down the censorship until
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:06.560]  effectively there was a total
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:08.560]  internet kill switch in place
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:10.560]  against conservatives, nationals, and populists.
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:12.560]  And now that's happened. And then I told
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:14.560]  everybody that they would then start moving
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:16.560]  to arrest individuals that demonstrate
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:18.560]  in protest using a second
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.560]  COVID-19 lockdown
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:22.560]  and that Trump needed to get out front
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:24.560]  and fully repudiate COVID-19
[2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:26.560]  as basically an overblown hoax.
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:28.560]  He started to do that in the last few months
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:30.560]  of the campaign, but we have to
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:32.560]  understand that that's the pincer attack
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:34.560]  they're going to use. They're going to use
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:36.560]  Black Lives Matter and race war
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:38.560]  to stir up the American people and divide us
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.560]  and they're going to use economic warfare
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:42.560]  shutting down the economy to try to control us.
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:44.560]  I hope people will listen now
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:46.560]  to my warnings because I'm on air
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:52.560]  and I will vote for you.
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:58.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:11.560]  Music
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  The Republic is rising.
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:14.560]  America is roaring.
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:23.560]  America is roaring, but the deep state technotronic kleptocrats in the Democrat
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:28.000]  Party allied with globalists in the UN and the World Health Organization and
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:34.480]  Communist in China will stop at nothing to make you their slave, to make you a
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:39.960]  farm animal in the New World Order. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Owen Troyer
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:44.800]  filling in for Alex Jones. You know, it really is a sick, but you have to give him
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:50.800]  credit, effective psychological and cultural trap that the left in their
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:57.360]  media has put us in where they gaslight all day long, they lie all day long, they
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.320]  commit crimes and treason all day long, and then they cover it up. And then when
[2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:06.960]  you dare say it, they say, hey, that's hate speech. That's going to lead to violence.
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:15.640]  I try to make analogies here so people can understand, because I don't know if
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:19.480]  people can understand what I'm saying half the time. It's like, is it just in my
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:27.280]  head this makes sense? Or is this translating on air? If you're in the
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:35.560]  high school lunch room and there's a guy going around stealing everybody's
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:39.840]  lunch money, everybody's like, where's all my lunch money going? This is weird.
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:47.720]  And then you're like, hey, Steve over there has been going around stealing
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:52.160]  everybody's lunch money. And then Steve comes up to you and says, hey, man,
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:57.000]  don't say that. That's hateful against me. That could lead to violence against me.
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:00.520]  Well, hold on a second, Steve, you're the one that stole all the lunch money.
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:05.360]  That's who the globalists are. That's who the Democrats are. That's who the
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:08.800]  mainstream media is. They've stolen your country. They've stolen your
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:12.560]  integrity. They've stolen your freedom. They've stolen your reality. They've
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:17.400]  stolen everything. They've stolen your future. They've stolen your children's
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:23.560]  future. They've stolen our education system. They have taken from us everything
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:27.800]  except the very breath from our mouths. And now they're coming for that too
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:34.000]  with a stupid face mask. And so you just point the finger and you say, you've
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:38.160]  done this. You've committed these crimes. You've committed these atrocities.
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:42.160]  You're trying to make us a slave. You're lying to us. You're dividing us.
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:45.440]  You're gaslighting us. You're instigating us. You're doing it. And they
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:49.960]  say, oh, don't say that. That could lead to violence against us. Well, you
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:54.320]  know what? Maybe you deserve what's coming. You ever thought about that? Oh,
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:57.040]  wait, they have. That's why they're so scared.
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:15:05.680]  Did you really think we would just take this on our backs? You really thought
[2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:17.000]  you could control the mobs? No. No. But you know what? I think what President
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:21.720]  Trump is doing right now is he's giving these people one last chance. And he
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:29.680]  may have even given them a day and just said, you know what? I'm going to go
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:36.160]  away. I'm going to be quiet for about 30 days. And you guys can concede this
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:44.800]  election. And you can stop lying to the American people. And you can stop making
[2:15:44.800 --> 2:15:47.880]  deals with the Communist Chinese and stop working for the UN and the World
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:55.080]  Health Organization. And let me be president. Or you can continue to
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:16:02.600]  tick off the Americans. You can continue to tick off the Republic. And I'll
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:08.040]  unleash this beast. I'll unleash this cragen. I'll let this line roar. And you
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:09.160]  can deal with that instead.
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:18.280]  Because that's where this is going. Yeah, it's a million marchers in DC
[2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:22.240]  peacefully now. Yeah, it's going to be thousands of people peacefully in
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:26.640]  Atlanta this weekend. But let me tell you, if you steal this election from us
[2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:32.720]  and you put in a UN Communist corrupt criminal Joe Biden in the White
[2:16:32.720 --> 2:16:38.480]  House, it's not going to be a million peaceful marchers in DC. No, no, no. No,
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:43.320]  it's not. No, it's not. And you know, quite frankly, that's not a threat.
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:45.080]  Because
[2:16:47.720 --> 2:16:49.000]  I'm to the point where
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:53.640]  I mean, we can lead marches all day long. But
[2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:58.080]  I know I won't have to be the ones to get my I won't have to be the one to
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:01.080]  get my hands dirty. I could sit right here in studio and just broadcast the
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:04.480]  whole thing. It's going to be three million veterans. It's going to be three
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:12.560]  million fathers that have been fed up. And at the end of their rope for a long,
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:16.520]  long time, who have been screwed over by this system and are done.
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:20.680]  But I think that's what Trump is doing.
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:28.360]  I think Trump is giving them one last time, one last shot to just let it go.
[2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:30.360]  Quit torturing us.
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:32.840]  Quit interfering in our elections.
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:39.920]  Quit lying to the American people. Quit lying about the president of the United
[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:44.920]  States. Quit lying about Trump supporters. Just stop all your lies. Stop all your
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:49.800]  treason. Stop all your foreign deals. Stop all your fake hate crimes. Just stop
[2:17:49.800 --> 2:17:50.280]  it all.
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:55.600]  Trump's giving them one last shot. And of course, they're not going to stop.
[2:17:55.600 --> 2:18:01.280]  But see, just like they have to have that metaphysical comfort, just like they
[2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:06.080]  have to have that metaphysical comfort of you accepting the mask, you accepting
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:11.200]  the vaccine, you accepting the tyranny, you inviting the tyranny, that gives them
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:14.320]  the metaphysical comfort knowing they didn't force it on you. You accepted it.
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:20.720]  Trump, we have to have the same metaphysical comfort knowing that we gave
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:24.720]  them a last shot too. Hey, we gave you one last shot.
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:30.640]  We gave you one last chance to stop it. Stop with the enslavement of mankind.
[2:18:30.640 --> 2:18:35.520]  Stop with the lies that you're telling mankind. Stop all of it. Stop the election
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:38.560]  theft. You can stop it all right now. The censorship, you're coming after all of
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:42.960]  us and they won't do it. But they've been given the metaphysical opportunity now.
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:46.320]  So there will be no excuses.
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:54.160]  Now, coming up in the next segment, we're going to be joined by Alex Jones and
[2:18:54.160 --> 2:19:00.800]  by Nick Fuentes. And apparently Alex has a big announcement that he is going to be
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:05.840]  making and he really wants me to emphasize that. So Alex is coming up huge
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:09.520]  announcement next segment. I'm not sure what it is, folks. I'm just getting this
[2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:15.440]  information. I'm passing it along to you. So Alex is excited with a big announcement

[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:35.120]  when we come back, Nick Fuentes will be joining Alex Jones. And Alex Jones has a big announcement.
[2:20:35.120 --> 2:20:40.560]  He's really excited. He wants me to tell you, to tell your friends and family to tune in
[2:20:40.560 --> 2:20:44.000]  for big news coming from Alex Jones in four minutes.
[2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:51.520]  Look it up for yourself. The head of the Davos Group issued a report one six months ago calling
[2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:57.600]  for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19. And the COVID-19 was a
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:03.600]  blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint. Since then, Prince Charles and countless others
[2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:10.960]  have come out and said the exact same thing. The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:16.400]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down.
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:20.880]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:26.080]  That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debts.
[2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:37.280]  credit score surveillance threat. So you've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people
[2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:41.360]  and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown is doing. It's starving the third world millions
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:45.200]  and millions of deaths. It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission.
[2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:53.600]  Warning, warning, warning. There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover.
[2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:59.360]  The giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:04.960]  lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[2:22:05.760 --> 2:22:11.760]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a
[2:22:11.760 --> 2:22:17.840]  national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming,
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:24.400]  but most importantly, a new lockdown. That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:30.640]  and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID. Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:34.720]  work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it. And
[2:22:34.720 --> 2:22:39.600]  that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year. This is a permanent
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:46.000]  martial law plan. Trump must be putiated, exposed to oxygen gates and the UN takeover not play games
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:52.480]  with it. The great moment of truth this year. America discovered the last five, six years
[2:22:52.480 --> 2:22:57.120]  that we were under globalist control and the traders of both parties that sold us out to
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:01.680]  Congress, China and multinational corporations and we're establishing an authoritarian anti-American
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:06.800]  system. Well, now they've launched their counter assault and through fraud are trying to steal
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:12.160]  the election right now and complete the police state takeover by bankrupting the people of the
[2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:17.680]  United States, but also the entire world to bring us to our knees under the great reset.
[2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:21.760]  Info wars has never been more valuable or more important. I'm honored for the position that
[2:23:21.760 --> 2:23:27.040]  you've put me in and for God's blessing, but I'm asking all listeners to understand that info
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:31.920]  wars, they spend a more money we've ever spent in the fight to expose the stolen election.
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:38.080]  I did a 21 the great reset and the globalist takeover. So please visit infowarstore.com today.
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:41.600]  We have the big stop to still sell that I've extended through the weekend, but then it will end.
[2:23:41.600 --> 2:23:45.600]  Because so many products are about to sell out. Pre ship and triple pay to the points at 60% off
[2:23:45.600 --> 2:23:52.320]  info wars store.com. It really is simple. The left are into being deviant and I don't mean
[2:23:52.320 --> 2:23:57.520]  sexually deviant. That goes to territory. I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors,
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:02.800]  deviant against their own species, deviant against the order of nature. Even though that
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:07.040]  deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because they want to play God.
[2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:12.160]  Everything they touch, they destroy their, their sacrament is aborting babies and then
[2:24:12.160 --> 2:24:18.000]  using their body parts. Their, their religion is not taking care of the old, but euthanizing them.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:23.200]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor,
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:28.640]  ballooning populations and then watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:33.440]  reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again. They truly are the children of
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:36.720]  Satan. They are the children of the devil. And if you look at the slaves that serve the
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:42.400]  Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifested that being a slave of Satan is not profitable. Sin
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:45.920]  is not profitable. I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war.
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:25:04.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:25:15.920 --> 2:25:26.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to be joined by Alex Jones. He's got Nick
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:32.400]  Fuenz's with him. He's got big news coming up. Big news.
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:40.960]  But wow, I mean, you know, I'm just normally such a newshound here on air when I host the
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:46.480]  war room or I fill in for Alex or just all the live shows that we have here at Info Wars,
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:51.280]  but I'm just so enthralled by this stop, the steal that's happening right now because folks,
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:55.520]  America, I mean, they've been stealing our elections for a long time, but they've been
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:59.680]  getting away with it. Kind of like they've been faking news for a long time and getting away
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:03.040]  with it, but they're not getting away with it anymore. And the American people are more awake
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:09.920]  than ever. And we can now organize and activate Americans in less than 24 hours to show up by
[2:26:09.920 --> 2:26:18.400]  the hundreds, if not thousands in Atlanta, in Columbia, in Baton Rouge, in Raleigh, in Tallahassee.
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:27.040]  And so where does this pivot from here as the American people are organizing,
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:30.880]  activating and mobilizing, becoming more aware than ever.
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:36.480]  And now we're more aware than all the attacks against us, against our republic, against our
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.040]  children. We now know the names. We now know the faces. Nobody heard about Anthony Fauci.
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:49.840]  Now we know about that Nazi rat. So, Alex Jones is now joining us. He just had an event
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:54.800]  with Ali Alexander. Nick Fuentes, the Democrat State Representative Vernon Jones showed up
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:27:00.480]  and it was great as well. He joins us now with big news. First exclusive comments from Alex
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:06.640]  since the massive rally today, Alex. That's right. First off, I want to thank the great crew here
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:11.760]  in Austin and here in Atlanta. I want to thank all the great listeners and viewers for supporting
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:17.120]  our prayers. This historic moment, Rob Dewitt set up a great two person studio in here, but he got
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:20.640]  stuck in the crowd back there and didn't get in the car with us. So he's about to get here. We had
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:25.360]  to kind of hook up all this up ourselves. So we're going to have him here soon. We'll have two mics,
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:32.000]  but I brought Nick Fuentes along with me because he really, I think, had the best speech of all
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:37.280]  the great speakers and this Vernon Jones guy would make a great U.S. Senator. And he just
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:43.120]  was a black guy. He's awesome. And he laid it out so slick and so truthful and so good how
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:47.520]  there's total election fraud and all the proof. Now he switched from a Democrat to Republican
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:51.840]  recently because of all their corruption and Black Lives Matter being communist and not liking the
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:57.920]  Black family or any family and Antifa being scum. I was really impressed by a very gentlemanly,
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:05.920]  very smart guy. The second best speech, I think, it really goes between him and Nick Fuentes,
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:10.800]  but it's not about who gave the best speech. It's about the truth and the justice and the
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:16.960]  freedom. And you're absolutely right. We have forced their corruption out in the open and I
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:22.080]  don't feel depression. I don't feel fear of the new border. I feel a terrible, dreadful purpose
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:28.080]  of every cell in my body demanding we resist these people and say no to their GMO takeover,
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:34.880]  their 5G, their world government, the top epidemiologists, top, top expert on viruses
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:42.240]  in Canada says it's a giant overblown hoax, just a regular cold or flu that Bill Gates again owns
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:45.920]  so he can say everybody's guilty and that's going to cause a planetary depression, which it already
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:52.160]  is. This is Nuremberg trial stuff. This is the globalist admitting it's a war, a weapon and
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:56.400]  people finally get, I wasn't just making this up. So I want to go to Nick Fuentes here sharing the
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:02.000]  mic and have you kind of recap your speech where you laid out the real betrayal here and what this
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.640]  has shown us and what the Marco Rubio's of the world are doing and where we need to go next.
[2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:13.200]  Whether Trump can defeat this fraud or that we can defeat it, the battle's now and every day he
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:17.600]  doesn't concede to their fraud, they get more panicked with this new hoax failing. But at a
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:21.360]  sick level, if they're able to even put that corpse in, it's going to cause an awakening of
[2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:27.760]  galactic proportions. So Nick Fuentes of the Gropers here in Atlanta, Georgia doing an amazing job.
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:31.680]  Please repeat what you said at that speech. Yes, well, thank you so much. It's great to be with
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:36.880]  you, Alex, for truly the man of the hour and the man of the moment, I think, during this political
[2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:42.720]  crisis. And to reiterate what I said in the state capital, what's really important to focus on right
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:47.440]  now is our war, in my opinion, against the Republican establishment. And the reason for this is
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:53.040]  because we understand the threat that is posed by China, Joe Biden, we understand the threat posed
[2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:58.480]  by the World Economic Forum and the Democrats. We knew they would rig the election. We knew exactly
[2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:02.800]  how they would rig the election. Me and Alex have been talking about this for months, that they would
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:07.840]  use the mail-in ballots to rig the election in the swing states using the big city political
[2:30:07.840 --> 2:30:13.680]  machines, just swinging in favor of Joe Biden. It's called the Red Mirage. What we did not count
[2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:17.760]  on or what many people are not aware of is that within our own Republican Party, within the
[2:30:17.760 --> 2:30:22.560]  Republican establishment, there are elements that are working to sabotage President Trump
[2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:27.680]  and the will of the American people. We saw the fraud on election night. There's no question that
[2:30:27.680 --> 2:30:32.800]  it occurred. We all saw at 4 a.m. in the dead of night after everybody went to sleep, after all
[2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:39.360]  the poll watchers went home, after all the vote counters went home. We saw them inject 169,000
[2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:45.120]  ballots in Milwaukee, flipping Wisconsin. We saw 250,000 ballots come in in the same way
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:50.080]  in Detroit, flipping Michigan. We saw it in Georgia over the course of a week. We saw it in
[2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:55.200]  Pennsylvania over the course of a week. We know that it happened. Marco Rubio knows that it happened
[2:30:55.200 --> 2:31:00.640]  and he said nothing. In fact, he said that if the president doesn't concede, this is somehow
[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:05.200]  an affront to democracy. Mitch McConnell has said nothing. Nikki Haley has said nothing.
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:10.480]  Dan Crenshaw, Madison Cawthorne, all the people hailed as the future of the GOP have remained
[2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:16.560]  silent. Well, people like myself and Alex and patriots like you coming out to the state capitals
[2:31:16.560 --> 2:31:20.560]  have been doing all the work in fighting for this. So we have to take the fight to them no
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:27.520]  matter what happens with President Trump. And let's be clear. We know China Joe's a bot
[2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:33.680]  and paid for enemy. He's not even a traitor. He's just a robot. But when you've got Marco Rubio
[2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:41.040]  and you've got the gay pirate Crenshaw and all these fake people doing all of this,
[2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:45.760]  they are literally worse than the enemy because they act like they're with us when they're really
[2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:50.400]  establishment folks. I mean, within hours of them announcing Saturday and a half ago
[2:31:51.680 --> 2:31:55.760]  that a week and a half ago that Biden was the winner, Crenshaw came out and said,
[2:31:55.760 --> 2:32:01.200]  Trump needs to concede. When Biden always said, we're not going to concede. We're going to wait
[2:32:01.200 --> 2:32:04.960]  till it's all certified by the states. We're going to even battle the electors and try to
[2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:09.520]  take it away. We may even have the states succeed and form our own deal. And they said that to
[2:32:09.520 --> 2:32:12.640]  everybody everywhere. They said, get ready. But then they were able just to freeze it,
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:17.360]  put the numbers in with a sucker punch. That was their plan A and they went with it.
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:25.120]  And so now this is a real betrayal, but it's okay. We know who the rhinos are and we're taking over
[2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:30.400]  the party. We are the people. We are the populist movement. How would you describe the new right?
[2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:35.760]  Because, you know, we're just the new populist. Well, I call it America first because what
[2:32:35.760 --> 2:32:41.600]  distinguishes us from them is our interpretation of what is America. In our view, what constitutes
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:47.760]  America is the American people. It's not America as its economy. It's not America as its government.
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:59.360]  It's not it's America. All right. We are live right now. We have Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes
[2:32:59.360 --> 2:33:04.880]  are transmission there. Our connection has been interrupted. We will get them potted up as soon
[2:33:04.880 --> 2:33:10.160]  as possible. It does look like they've just received another land mic there. So we're going to get
[2:33:10.160 --> 2:33:14.480]  them potted up as soon as possible. But you know, Nick Fuentes makes a great point there too, where
[2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:23.200]  it's sad and we aren't surprised by this, but it's sad that the Republican leadership or the
[2:33:23.200 --> 2:33:28.800]  young bloods in the Republican party that need to, you know, chart their own path, blaze their own
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:33.120]  trail, if you will, are pretty much silent on this issue and actually coming out against Trump. And
[2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:38.080]  so I have to lead, stop the steel caravans. Nick Fuentes has to lead, stop the steel caravans.
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:43.120]  Alex Jones has to lead the million mega march in DC because the Republican establishment is
[2:33:43.120 --> 2:33:47.200]  nowhere to be found. You have Trump's team fighting. You have the people that have come to Trump's
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:54.000]  team fighting, but the Republicans, the GOP silent. They're not having events. They're not organizing
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:59.920]  and activating. In fact, they try to scuttle the actual grassroots organizing and activating like
[2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:03.760]  in DC this weekend. We've got a lot of behind the scenes information on that. We're just choosing
[2:34:03.760 --> 2:34:09.200]  not to release it because we don't want to do the infighting. But believe me, they did everything
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:15.520]  they could to even keep Alex Jones from being seen in DC this weekend, even though it was us
[2:34:15.520 --> 2:34:20.080]  here at info wars teamed up with other people like Ali Alexander and Mike Cernovich and Nick
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:25.280]  Fuentes that led that march. We organized it. We led it. Republicans tried to come in and
[2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:30.160]  steal that momentum and siphon it off to say, well, if Biden wins, still he wins. So it's okay.
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:37.280]  We're out here, but if Biden won, he won't know. No. So now we are, we are the new Republic.
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:43.520]  We are the populists. We are America. We'll be right back with Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes. Go
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:50.720]  nowhere. Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:55.920]  by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations. And now because the slaves have proven themselves
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:35:01.200]  to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns, you can't even leave your
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:06.880]  house for months and months are being announced. And in Germany, the police are using giant armored
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:11.840]  tanks with water cannons to blast men, women and children that protest the fact that Merkel,
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:16.880]  the dictator, has put them under her control. That's right. She's been rigging elections for years
[2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:22.000]  and years. And the same thing is coming here to the United States. This is world government.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:26.960]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested. They're
[2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:32.400]  announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you,
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:38.240]  to take rid of all your due process and absolutely transform the world into a prison
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:44.160]  planet. How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back. America is the last bastion.
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:50.240]  Stop submitting. Remember Hillary Clinton? Remember Pelosi? Remember Bill Clinton? Remember
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:56.160]  Obama? All of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage. We believe it's
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:35:58.960]  going to look like Trump's going to win in the landslide because they have the internal polls.
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:04.800]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin. And when he
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:11.360]  was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night and then they
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:15.200]  brought in all of the reserve ballots they had. This is completely transparent. So when they say
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:19.840]  that he is president elect, he's not. Trump has not conceded. None of the states have certified
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:24.880]  the vote. And now all these investigations have been opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:30.640]  election fraud has come out and already been documented in Georgia. Officials are on record
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:35.200]  saying we've already found fraud. So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in. They've run bigger
[2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:40.320]  and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed. But now this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:44.640]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America. As we know it, we will be Venezuela.

[2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:54.320]  by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sachs. They're
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:59.040]  saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:04.960]  starve to death. Incredible. They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:10.160]  that are causing the chain reaction, that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:15.760]  That is a fact. And all the hero's sheep, where the masks can go along with this are signing on
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:20.640]  to mass murder, bigger than what Hitler did. That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:27.440]  Nuremberg Code. This is a medical world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation,
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:32.800]  setting up world IDs and coming with forced inoculations. And now Bank of America says global
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.680]  unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression. That's stories on infowarstore.com.
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:41.920]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:46.080]  or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary great reset.
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:56.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:07.520]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:12.560]  George Royer is riding shotgun back in the studio. We had some more of those wonderful
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:16.720]  technical difficulties, but that's just the way it has been on the road. Nick Feuentes is here
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:21.920]  and we were talking about globalism and how it's not just our right or duty to fight it,
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:28.240]  that it is a multinational takeover. And then now you've got the head of the UN,
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.280]  we got the Communist Chinese, you've got Justin Trudeau, you've got the British Prime Minister,
[2:39:33.280 --> 2:39:38.800]  who's really turned out to be a Trojan, Horace Johnson, all saying, hey, world government,
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:43.760]  we're going to fuse humans with machines. You're going to take nanotech. There's no danger.
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:46.960]  All the studies show it's super deadly and poisonous. We're going to test on you.
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:52.320]  We're going to give the black people all shots first in Africa and in the US because we're not
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:56.000]  racist. And it's like, oh, it's for the black people. And it's literally Bill Gates who says
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:01.040]  he wants to get rid of people. This is beyond a science fiction nightmare movie. Why do you think
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:05.040]  Clow Schwab and the Davos group in the new world order are all being so public right now? Nick
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:09.280]  Fuentes. That's a great question. And it's the million dollar question because, you know,
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:13.440]  I've watched your content for many years and I know probably your listeners have as well.
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:18.240]  And I remember there was a time growing up for me when a lot of this information was very esoteric
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:22.720]  and difficult to come by. If you wanted to learn about globalism, if you wanted to learn about
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:28.000]  the global takeover by corporations or the UN, you had to do some digging. You had to look at
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:32.880]  documents you had to really dig in and it wasn't all over the place. And climb over fences at
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:38.000]  Bilderberg and get secret documents and steal them out of the trash can. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:41.840]  And now all you have to do is watch the Democratic National Convention and they say,
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:46.320]  build back better. And you could look at Macron and Justin Trudeau and Boris Johnson and they say,
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:49.360]  build back better. And that's the same thing that Clow Schwab and the world.
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:54.240]  That means collapse the world economy in their words to bring in the end of carbon and save
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:40:59.840]  us by killing people. Exactly. And they lay it out and they say it explicitly. It's in his book.
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:04.000]  It's called The Great Reset. They wrote a book about COVID. They talk about build back better
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:07.920]  and they describe exactly that. They say it on their website. You will own nothing. You will
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:12.000]  have nothing. You will have no freedom and no privacy and you're going to like it. That's what
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:15.920]  they write in the World Economic Forum. And it's not like they're even trying to hide it. They say
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:19.840]  that's their objective and now all the world's politicians in Europe, the United States and
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:24.560]  Canada are echoing that in their slogans and in their game plan. And the question why they're
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:29.760]  being so explicit and open about it, I think they're ready to force the issue. I think they're
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:34.720]  ready. Exactly. What we've been talking about, what you've been talking about for decades,
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:38.560]  what people have been sounding the alarms about and nobody was listening.
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:43.360]  It's finally transpiring in front of us right now. Their takeover. And I think they're pushing
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:48.800]  it because they know that concurrently with that people are beginning to wake up. The president
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:54.640]  has awakened the masses. So now it's a race. Exactly. It's a race between us against them.
[2:41:54.640 --> 2:41:58.320]  They force the issue and we're going to see some pretty crazy stuff. I think we're going to host
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:01.840]  some of the next hour when John Rappaport takes over and Owen Schwerer is going to pop in here
[2:42:01.840 --> 2:42:05.120]  in a moment. I'm asking him the same question, which I don't have audio. No big deal. I'll just
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:12.880]  pause, let him talk and then I'll just cut in. But how do people find you? Because nowadays,
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:16.880]  it's all about them not letting us use social media. But if people go find you,
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:21.280]  find us and share us word of mouth that overrides the enemy and that's what they fear. They have
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:25.520]  to cut our communications off them to win. But if we use human intelligence to spread this
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:30.720]  with a human grapevine, we will win. That's exactly right. Well, you can find me at dlive.tv
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:35.840]  slash Nick J. Fuentes, where I streamed my show Money Through Friday at seven o'clock central time.
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:39.440]  And you're exactly right. That's the play. They cut the communications. They cut the funding.
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:43.280]  They cut everything in pretty soon. Who knows if we'll even be around in any sense,
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:46.560]  but we got to get the message out where we can. Absolutely. And the great part is,
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:51.120]  as they censor us, more people have stood up. There's these giant crops of black, Hispanic,
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:55.920]  white, Asian, super smart, super cool people that just blow me away. Like I've heard of this
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:59.520]  state rep here in Georgia and heard he was a patriot and switched over from being a Democrat,
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:02.640]  because he didn't like Black Lives Matter and Antifa. But here in him, you have these speeches.
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:09.680]  I mean, it's just deep knowledge, incredibly down to what's happening and just unifying people.
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:14.160]  And then it's just so many. I mean, that's what the global sphere is, human talent standing up
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:19.520]  and us coming together and us resisting them and us having people power and us having a culture.
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:23.840]  And America is our culture. And it's about private property and God and the family and
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:27.600]  the Second Amendment. And they want to take all that away, folks. That's happening.
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:32.320]  Oh, and Shroyer from a few minutes here doing a great job hosting while we're out.
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:36.640]  What is your view on why they're uncloking right now in the global sphere being so honest about
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:39.680]  their plan to depopulate us and make us poor and enslave us for our own good?
[2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:48.160]  Well, I think it's two things. One, I think it's the metaphysical engagement of us having to accept
[2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:53.280]  the tyranny so that they have that metaphysical comfort that, oh, they're not actually authoritarians
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:57.760]  or tyrants. We accepted it. We accepted the vaccine. We accepted the lockdown. We did this to
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:04.000]  ourselves. You know, they just proposed it. But really, I think, Alex, it's because the part of
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:09.840]  their initiation of the world government, the part of their initiation of a one world currency,
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:14.400]  the part of their initiation of being able to just flare up a pandemic whenever they want
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:19.760]  to put you into lockdown and economic arrest. Eventually, it had to come out. You know,
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:24.640]  it can't lurk in the shadows forever. And this was probably the timetable, or maybe they're
[2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:29.280]  having to push the gas on it right now, because the people of the world, the people of America
[2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:33.440]  are more awake than ever. So I think it's a combination. I think that they realize
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:38.000]  they have to push the gas. So it all has to come out now. And then we have to accept it.
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:42.960]  Otherwise, they're never going to be able to pull it off. So it's a dead on arrival though.
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:47.840]  I can barely hear you now, but you're making great points. We had held them up patriots for
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:51.680]  decades long before me understanding the globalist plan. They would have Senate hearings back in the
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:57.600]  60s. They tried all this in the 60s and call it the universal total disarmament, the UN takeover
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:01.840]  of the world, no more nation states, no more families. We all live in communal buildings.
[2:45:01.840 --> 2:45:05.520]  That's how we knew it was coming. And they would have it in the front page of the New York Times,
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:11.760]  what they were going to do. And people rebelled against that said, no, Reagan got in kind of
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:16.320]  halfway, held it up, and then the Clintons got in and the Bush is all that, you know, history.
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:22.080]  But now it's here. They're trying to accelerate the program because they were so far behind.
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:27.040]  How do we strike back now, Nick Pointess? What are the listeners do now? And I want to do a little
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:33.600]  bit of a more next hour about contemporary times. Trump, can Trump still win? Can we stop the fraud?
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:37.680]  And how do we battle back? And what happens if they do put Joe Biden in Nick Pointess?
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:42.560]  Well, we have to get out in the streets because we see basically they revealed their hand in the
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:47.440]  months and the weeks building up to the election. They told us that if a candidate declared victory
[2:45:47.440 --> 2:45:52.080]  prematurely that they would censor that candidate. And we've seen it. Anybody that talks about election
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:57.200]  fraud online gets censored. Anybody that declares that the president won the election gets censored
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:02.320]  online. The solution is we have to get off of the internet, not that we have to get off of Twitter
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:07.360]  and Facebook and the platforms, but we need to get off of our our butts and our chairs and into
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:12.400]  the streets. We need to get out into the state capitals where Facebook and Twitter can't censor
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:17.920]  us. You can't flag like we just did in the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta. You can't flag and put
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:23.840]  a big label in front of 300 people standing inside the state capitol building saying that we demand
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:28.880]  a special session. So it has to happen that people go out into the state capitals in particular,
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:34.240]  in the swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, but even in
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:38.320]  your own state capitol, if you're in any other state, you got to get in the state capitals.
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:42.560]  And I'll tell you, I really like what I'm seeing with this trucker strike that they're planning
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:46.960]  later this month. I was about to say, I've been meaning to promote that for a week. If the trucker
[2:46:46.960 --> 2:46:50.720]  strike, especially on the East Coast is shut down, they should shut down blue states and blue
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:54.320]  cities. Hey, you're shutting us down with the COVID hugs. We're shutting you down and they
[2:46:54.320 --> 2:46:58.560]  should come to Georgia and other state capitals and just drive around honking the whole time.
[2:46:58.560 --> 2:47:03.520]  In fact, truckers, I'm calling for you on Thursday, Friday and Saturday here at noon every day,
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:11.200]  drive around the capitol honking your horns. And we're going to be there with you. Come here
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:15.440]  now. We love you. We need you. Please let's stand together briefly before we go to break.
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:20.320]  It takes a lot of money to do this. And I appreciate everybody's support. Plus we have great
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:24.640]  products. The big sale is about to end. And I've had a lot of big sales. We already sold out a
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:29.520]  lot of products. Some of the stuff that was sold out like alpha powers back in. Vaso beats are back
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:33.920]  in. We're very close to selling out X2, X3, the good halogen. We're very close to selling out
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:37.840]  vitamin refusion. Won't have more to just maybe December or January because of the way the supply
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:42.880]  chains are broken down. Huge sales. You only buy a lot of big sales now, which is great.
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:47.760]  30, 40, 50% isn't enough. We've got some of its 60s. We're making like 20%, 30% on some of these
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:52.320]  products. So I sell a ton of it, millions of dollars. But then that's hundreds of thousands we
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:56.800]  have to operate off of. And I just don't want to run out of money. We're so critical in this fight.
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:48:01.120]  So do your shopping for vitamins and minerals and supplements at infowarstore.com and get a
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:05.280]  t-shirt, get a book, buy a shortwave radio, get your storeable foods that are ready to be shipped
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:11.440]  in one day now while you still can because I think things are even crazier at infowarstore.com
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:19.040]  or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139 and keep sharing what you're doing, band.video. And if you can't
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:23.520]  share that on Twitter, they block it. You can share 79days.news. We told you to be 79 days
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:29.200]  of hell. We're in it right now. And we are seeing four or five times the traffic on the side.
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:33.280]  It's pissing off the globalists. They don't know what to do. They've got feds, FBI,
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:37.840]  that come in the restaurant, sit down every morning we eat breakfast. They put CIA stickers on our
[2:48:37.840 --> 2:48:42.400]  car, even in locked up garages. And they just want us to know they're watching. Of course we know
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:46.640]  that you're helping guide in the end of America and the merger with the New World Order. It's
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:50.160]  just going to be peaceful and good, but it's not. They're coming to sterilize our sons. They're
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:53.680]  coming with 5G. They're coming to fry us and kill us. That's their own damn admissions. They're
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:58.640]  going to depopulate us. And so all you FBI agents, remember, you're going to be thrown to the wind
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:04.000]  just like all these tyrants do. You're destroying America. You're destroying everything. So I feel
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:07.600]  good about what I'm doing, and I'm not threatening. I'm not demotivated. So I have 100 feds followers.
[2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:11.600]  If you want, you work for the Shai comms. And if you don't stand with us, you have that on your
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:15.760]  conscience. You have God to face and God's real and God's the real judge. We'll be right back with
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:31.680]  the fourth hour. Nick Fointaz and so much more. Owen Schreuer. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:39.360]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America,
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:43.200]  he really was telling the truth. They don't just work for the communist Chinese and the
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.800]  globalist, the EU and the whole Hollywood, America hating, God hating crew. They literally
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:54.240]  say that they are in control of our minds and believe they do own us and tell us who the
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:58.800]  president is, even though that's not in law. And they're just gaslighting the whole public over
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:03.680]  and over again saying Joe Biden is president elect, repeating it over and over again like a
[2:50:03.680 --> 2:50:08.160]  brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes.
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:12.400]  Most votes are being challenged. There's massive evidence of fraud. Again, this is so
[2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:16.320]  incredibly clear. Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front,
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:20.880]  that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote, no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:24.560]  Well, a lot of votes haven't counted and there's massive fraud being discovered. So
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:28.240]  we're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent. He's a
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:33.280]  globalist. He wants carbon taxes. He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and
[2:50:33.280 --> 2:50:40.080]  take control of us. This is war. Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:44.720]  civilizations and different mixes of the two. One is born of renaissance. The other is born
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:50.800]  of conquest. One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:57.200]  culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength. The other is based on the massive number of
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:04.480]  slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it. America is transferring out of a system based
[2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:10.160]  on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery. That's why the
[2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:14.880]  globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:19.520]  so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters. A global permanent lockdown is
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:24.080]  here that is already causing millions and millions of starved to death. When they're done, billions
[2:51:24.080 --> 2:51:28.720]  will starve to death. Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:33.520]  have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war. That's the
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:42.480]  fact. This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:51:58.640]  We're into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:07.120]  I'll ensure you're here in studio. Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes connected with us from Atlanta,
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:11.760]  Georgia. They're going to be leading the Stop the Steel rallies every day in Atlanta at noon.
[2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:18.720]  And I'm telling you right now, Alex, this Saturday is going to be massive, massive. This Saturday,
[2:52:18.720 --> 2:52:23.280]  I don't know what they're going to do in Atlanta. It's not a big area like DC when thousands, if
[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:29.120]  not maybe 100,000 patriots descend upon Atlanta, Georgia to stop the steel of the state of Georgia
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  from President Donald J. Trump. It's going to be huge. And I'm going to make huge two points when
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:40.960]  we start the next segment. One, look at it. Almost a million people, whoever it was in DC,
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:45.120]  no mask. And then all the cult members living in fear doing what they're told. This is literally
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:50.000]  the sheep versus the sheep dogs and the wolves. This is literally the chumps versus those that
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:57.600]  are awake. And now the top. Yeah, you know, that's it exactly. And again, we just have a bit of a
[2:52:57.600 --> 2:53:03.680]  connection issue. Just keep that feed down there. I can monitor the situation. It's really incredible
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:09.520]  how true that is to think about. And it's such a simple thing that you can see with your eyes
[2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:18.000]  and conceive very easily where in DC was the perfect example. The people in DC live under
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:25.200]  total tyranny. Washington DC is a communist hellhole. And so millions of Trump supporters
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:31.040]  show up. We don't wear the mask. We don't do communism. We don't do this crap. Oh, five people
[2:53:31.040 --> 2:53:35.200]  only at a restaurant. We're getting into town. We, folks, I'm telling you,
[2:53:37.600 --> 2:53:41.520]  watching the DC people walk around with their masks, get pissed off at Trump supporters for
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:46.320]  not wearing a mask is the craziest thing you've ever seen in your life. Because on one level,
[2:53:46.320 --> 2:53:53.680]  it shows how they've adapted and embraced the tyranny. On another level, it shows how their
[2:53:53.680 --> 2:54:00.960]  complete mind slaves. But then it exposes that Alex Jones just said it's literally people who
[2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:06.400]  are awake and can think logically versus the sheeple of America. Alex, the mask thing and
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:10.000]  what we saw in DC this weekend is the perfect example of that.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:16.800]  Absolutely. Oh, and here we are. Nick Foyntos is here. As I said, we love it. We're not complaining.
[2:54:16.800 --> 2:54:19.840]  Incredible technical difficulties. I don't have audio most of the time. Tomorrow we're going to
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:24.160]  have this all fixed. Everything was working great and then we had some snafus, but we're here. I've
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:29.200]  got big news, as I said, start of the next segment. I don't want to start getting into it now. The
[2:54:29.200 --> 2:54:34.800]  freedom streak of those of us that were pro-Trump, pro-America, we don't go away just if they still
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:41.040]  is election from Trump. And it's the fighting, the fraudulent election that puts us in position
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:46.480]  to absolutely now. If you thought Trump put a big dent in the new world order, well, we're just
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:50.640]  getting started. Trump is just one wave. I told Vice News that when he was president of elect
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:53.040]  four years ago, I said, even if they're able to keep him from getting into the office,
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:56.720]  which they were trying to do or they were moving as a Russian agent through fraud,
[2:54:56.720 --> 2:54:59.280]  it doesn't matter. We're just going to keep coming and coming and coming.
[2:54:59.280 --> 2:55:06.160]  Well, exactly. And what they've done is they've disenfranchised 73 million Trump supporters.
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:11.600]  The president gained 10 million voters between 2016 and 2020. There's more Trump supporters than
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:16.400]  ever. There's more patriots than ever that are aware of globalism. The idea that stealing the
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:21.520]  election from us, canceling our votes and disenfranchising 70 some million people
[2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:26.640]  that we go away after all of that, if they just get through, you know, they speed through the
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:31.360]  process, they seat Joe Biden, they think then that we just disappear into thin air. The only
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:35.600]  thing that that will accomplish is piss us off. And the same stuff that you're seeing right now
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:41.360]  between election day and inauguration day, you will see for the next four years, strikes, mass
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:47.040]  resistance, mass protests, people organizing in the streets, because people have had enough and
[2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:51.200]  they see what's going on. And people also understand the urgency and the stakes here.
[2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:56.320]  It's become personal now. For a long time, people were comfortable with what was going on in the
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:02.160]  country because they had all the creature comforts of television and going to concerts
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:06.960]  and fun with friends and so on. And now people are starting to have this impact their personal
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:12.160]  lives. They're literally being muzzled on their faces. Their gatherings, Thanksgiving,
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:16.160]  Christmases are being canceled. And now people are getting more angry than ever and they're
[2:56:16.160 --> 2:56:19.440]  waking up and it's not going away. And that was the next point we're going to get to when we
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:24.240]  come back. What is the psychology of the globalist? And what are they missing out on where they think
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:28.000]  this is going to work on us? This bullying and intimidation. Final segment with myself, Nick
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:32.880]  Pointess, now when Shroyer, then he's loaded for bear, the great John Revivore is coming up,
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:37.040]  and then the War Room, three to six a.m. today. I'm going to go get some lunch. I'll be back
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:41.760]  home with Owen today with Holly Alexander. Nick Pointess is so much more on the War Room. Stay
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:49.440]  with us. We'll be right back. The great moment of truth this year. America discovered the last
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:54.160]  five, six years that we were under globalist control and the traitors in both parties that sold
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:58.800]  us out to communist China and multinational corporations and were establishing an authoritarian
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:04.000]  anti-American system. Well, now they've launched their counter assault and through fraud are trying
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:09.680]  to steal the election right now and complete the police state takeover by bankrupting the people
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:14.880]  of the United States, but also the entire world to bring us to our knees under the great reset.
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:19.520]  M4 Wars has never been more valuable or more important. I'm honored for the position that
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:24.480]  you've put me in and for God's blessing, but I'm asking all listeners to understand that
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:29.680]  M4 Wars is spending more money than we've ever spent in the fight to expose the stolen election
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:35.840]  agenda 21, the great reset and the globalist takeover. So please visit infowarstore.com today.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:39.360]  We have the big stop to steal sales that I've extended to the weekend, but then it will end

[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:17.760]  The answers are all there. Good and evil are real. And it's all what energy resonate towards
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:22.880]  energy of light, openness and goodness or this destructive controlling energy. And man, I tell
[2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:30.080]  you, I remember reading stuff from the 20s and from the 1860s where the proto globalists were
[2:58:30.080 --> 2:58:35.200]  talking about a scientific control system and Brave New World was not a science fiction book.
[2:58:35.200 --> 2:58:39.760]  It's what Aldous Huxley's brother Julian Huxley later went on to run the United Nations UNESCO
[2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:44.960]  said they would do. He wrote it in 32 and 61. He wrote Brave New World revisited nonfiction
[2:58:45.680 --> 2:58:50.080]  and he said, Oh, it won't be like Georgia. Oh, well, we beat you with a Trojan. We're going to
[2:58:50.080 --> 2:58:56.000]  make you love your servitude being sterilized with global social credit scores. He described
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:59:01.840]  where we will punish you and reward you with Pavlovian systems and you'll willfully sign
[2:59:01.840 --> 2:59:08.960]  it on and agree to be euthanized for the earth. So I mean, I'm reading this stuff going on. What
[2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:15.920]  the hell? Then I'm going and finding UN documents later pushing it. And so I'm here to fight it.
[2:59:15.920 --> 2:59:19.920]  So we've got to show you're back at the ATX Command Center that Nick Fuentes here with us
[2:59:20.640 --> 2:59:25.600]  tomorrow on Thursday, Friday and then Saturday. I've got family stuff. I've got so much going on.
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:29.360]  I said I was going to be here to help kick it off and then kind of step back and see the big event
[2:59:29.360 --> 2:59:33.920]  Saturday. But I may have to change my flights to Saturday night because I got a feeling that
[2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:37.840]  Owen was right earlier when there's probably going to be 50,000 people here. I can smell it.
[2:59:37.840 --> 2:59:42.720]  There were probably 400 people there today, 500. When we left, hundreds were pouring in new people
[2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:48.400]  that were busy in out of town. Folks were flying in from all over the country. Just like Austin had
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:52.880]  500 and then 1,000 and 4,000 and then, you know, Phoenix, 5,000 and then, you know,
[2:59:52.880 --> 2:59:56.480]  about half a million, whatever it really was in DC, it was crazy. But Nick Fuentes,
[2:59:57.760 --> 3:00:06.000]  the psychology of the globalist, Hitler bombed London. He thought it would make the British
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:09.360]  stay out of the war. Well, actually 90 plus percent in polls were against the war because
[3:00:09.360 --> 3:00:13.600]  they'd already lost millions of Brits in World War I. That was Britain's fault. I mean, Germany,
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:17.440]  the Austrian, Hungarian Empire was doing nothing wrong for World War I. And so that was Hitler's
[3:00:17.440 --> 3:00:22.320]  beef was, hey, we were attacked. We were put under the very sized sanctions for, you know, decades.
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:26.400]  We were all made poor. We're being put under globalist sanctions. Not agreeing with Hitler as a good
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:30.320]  guy who's a bad guy, but that's why they put a strongman in like Hitler because they've been
[3:00:30.320 --> 3:00:35.200]  screwed over. But then when you look at part two, Hitler starts bombing London because they wouldn't
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:39.600]  give up. That made them go from 90 percent against the war, 99 percent for the war,
[3:00:39.600 --> 3:00:44.080]  and you saw what happened. So the globalists think, oh, our sheep, they already follow us.
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:47.280]  They get scared. They piss on themselves. They do what they're told. We lock them down.
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:52.080]  But now we're going to do it to the conservatives, to the Christians, to the nationalists. We're
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:55.680]  going to shut them down and say they're not essential and we're going to steal their vote.
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:01:01.760]  They are only activating a very terrible giant. I mean, literally we see it happening.
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:06.000]  Where is the disconnect? I guess when you're Klaus Schwab on a mountaintop in Switzerland,
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.640]  they just like Marie Antoinette left me cake. What's going on?
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:14.000]  Yeah, it's hubris. It's hubris, plain and simple. And that is the perfect analogy between Germany
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:18.800]  and the United Kingdom because it's the same premise. They're overplaying their hand.
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:23.280]  They're in a situation where probably they could have achieved total global domination.
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:28.400]  If they were patient, if they were maybe a little bit more humble, more calculating, but
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:33.120]  but because they are children of the devil because they follow evil, they're a hubris stick.
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:36.720]  And what they've done now is they've pushed and they've pushed. They've pushed the American
[3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:41.360]  people too far. And whereas people might have been complicit or complacent and gone along
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:46.320]  with this for a long time, now they've pushed them so far that it's not going back to the
[3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:51.520]  way it was before. They've crossed the Rubicon and that has consequences for both sides.
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:55.440]  They're going all the way and now the American people, you see them in the streets,
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:01:59.920]  that million maga marches, unlike anything I've ever seen in my life there. And that was the
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:04.320]  beginning pouring into the state capitals, pouring into the streets and things I think
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:07.840]  that we've never seen before in this country. It's unprecedented, the kind of pushback that
[3:02:07.840 --> 3:02:12.800]  they will get. And I've only had feds at Bilderberg following in restaurants sit down by us, but
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:16.320]  they had feds following us sitting down in restaurants, letting us know their feds,
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:20.880]  sticking stuff on our cards. It's like, dude, come on, you're the ones usurping the country.
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:24.480]  You are the ones that work for the chai comms. At least you're following orders to,
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:28.800]  we're not playing anything bad. You're the bad guys. You don't work for America anymore.
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:34.000]  Right. Yeah. And well, it's so funny, you know, for the past few years, all these liberals who
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:39.440]  were so anti-war in the years of the George W. Bush administration, now they're a flag-waving
[3:02:39.440 --> 3:02:44.800]  Patriots talking about the FBI and the CIA and James Comey and all these arrest all of us.
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:49.840]  Yes. Right. Exactly. Exactly. All these government spooks. Now they're all in favor of the feds and
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:53.440]  the intelligence community and all of that. And you're exactly right. They're the ones
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:59.280]  ruining America. The word is homogenization. They want the total homogenization of the world and
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:05.760]  the population. Not black, not white, not Jewish, not Muslim, not Christian. No, just one big corporate
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:12.080]  Exactly. The absence of culture. Well, destroying all the bonds that tie us together, the bonds of
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:16.320]  family, the bonds of marriage, the bonds of... And that's the thing about leftists. You think
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:20.560]  you're like winning. You're the useful idiots, the first that fell into the meekrinder. I don't
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:24.000]  even hate you. You're idiots. I don't hate those feds that fall us around. They look, there's
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:30.320]  a kind of guilty, you know, at the hotel lobby and at the restaurant. You know, like, it's ridiculous.
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:35.280]  Like, oh, we're scared now. I am scared for my children. It's why I'll do anything legal and
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:40.880]  lawful and proper in this spectrum to save things. And it's the globalists that are escalating
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:45.920]  when you're violent Antifa and the rest of it. The war is coming up. 45 minutes. John
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:50.880]  Rappaport's about to take over. Oh, Troyer, what else is on your plate, my friend? Then a final statement from Nick Fuentes.
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:55.920]  Yeah, we're going to have some good guests on the war room, Alex. I'm hoping you can join me for the
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:03:59.840]  first two segments. I know you don't want to break for lunch, but we'd love to have you out of the
[3:03:59.840 --> 3:04:06.080]  gates, if possible. But Alex, I want to answer the question you just had Fuentes answer to. You
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:10.480]  know, I think it's the same thing that happened in the Revolutionary War, Alex, where you remember
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:15.200]  the Redcoats, the British, their armies, their colonels, they thought the American people were a
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:19.120]  joke. They thought the colonists were a joke. They thought they'd march in, mop us up, and it'd be
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:23.920]  game over. They underestimated our will. They underestimated our spirit. And the one thing
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:27.920]  they can't underestimate because they can't even comprehend or understand it, it's our connection
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:33.680]  to God and how we have that providence. We have God's providence. We fulfill that providence.
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:37.360]  They can't understand it. And I'm almost nervous to even say that on air because I don't want them
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:41.360]  to realize they're underestimating us and the American people. But I do think that's the case
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:44.800]  right now, Alex, just like they did during the Revolutionary War. It's like Nick said, it's
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:48.960]  spiritual. They're blind. They have that satanic hubris. And that was the thing you said when
[3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:53.440]  you spoke to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands there at the Million Manga marches.
[3:04:53.440 --> 3:04:57.040]  You said God's on our side and God is on our side. As George Washington said, he's the real
[3:04:57.040 --> 3:05:03.600]  determiner of war. That's exactly it. And just like it was in 1776, it was God putting his finger
[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:08.720]  on the scales that let the Patriots win the war then. And for all the people that are feeling
[3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:13.120]  desperate for the people that are feeling miserable right now, you have to have faith.
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:18.000]  God is in control. You've got to call out to God. That's right. Pray and ask God for help.
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:23.200]  And you said it earlier and it's not said enough. God is real. God is real. And these people are
[3:05:23.200 --> 3:05:27.920]  evil and they are going to lose in the end. God won the victory already in the grand scheme of
[3:05:27.920 --> 3:05:31.040]  things. We have to ask Him for His help. That's what the devil just wants to hurt humanity.
[3:05:31.040 --> 3:05:33.360]  That's right. Why do they want to kill everybody? Why do they want to make us poor?
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:39.280]  Let's kill, kill, and destroy, man. He already lost the game. That's right. He's trying to drag
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:45.040]  us all down with him into annihilation, spiritual annihilation. But this is a life-giving movement.
[3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:49.600]  This is a movement that celebrates life. It's about life. It's the life giver. It's God. That's
[3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:54.080]  what it's all about. We're fighting a spiritual war. Don't forget, it's not about on some level,
[3:05:54.080 --> 3:05:58.880]  even Republicans and Democrats or globalists and people, although it is in some sense,
[3:05:58.880 --> 3:06:05.200]  it is about the rulers and the principalities of other realms, evil versus good. That's what
[3:06:05.200 --> 3:06:08.000]  it's always been. It's timeless. Other realms, other dimensions. The Bible's right.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:10.240]  Yeah, exactly. Take a point, Tess. How do folks find you again?
[3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:15.120]  It's dlive.tv slash Nick J. Fuentes. All right. And I think my son Rex is trying to do a show on
[3:06:15.120 --> 3:06:19.520]  there. He should have him on. Oh, and a fabulous show by friend in 45 minutes. Get some rest.
[3:06:20.320 --> 3:06:24.000]  I got to go feed this crew. So I can't come on your first two segments. I heard that.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:28.160]  You want me on later. It's fine. We're taking a break on election countdown at Nike as a limited
[3:06:28.160 --> 3:06:32.800]  crew. Deanna Raines not been gotten rid of. We're just taking a week off because there's no crew,
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:35.360]  because we're all over the country right now. We just don't have the infrastructure.
[3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:41.440]  So that's why by the products in fullwarstore.com. So we can try to hire more crew to be able to be
[3:06:41.440 --> 3:06:46.960]  on, you know, until nine or 10 at night and have crews to go out on the road. We just don't have it.
[3:06:46.960 --> 3:06:51.040]  So again, we're going to have the 79 days of hell election countdown emergency,
[3:06:51.040 --> 3:06:56.320]  79 show be back next week. It's just we don't have the forces to be able to have folks to run
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:07:01.040]  the shows. David Knight in the morning in full war is my show during the day, the war room.
[3:07:01.040 --> 3:07:05.040]  I mean, you know, which was it? Cancel the nighttime show or cancel David Knight? Well,
[3:07:05.040 --> 3:07:08.400]  we're not going to cancel David Knight. We love him. So, but if you get to a point where the
[3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:12.960]  funding gets cut, David Knight goes away or only goes away. Please keep buying products at

[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:14.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:26.000]  Okay, here we go, folks. A packed 45 minutes or so. Lots of info today. Good to be back on
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:33.920]  Infowars. I want to start out with this. I've got so many items here. Sydney Powell
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:40.880]  made quite astonishing statements when it trumps lawyers.
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:49.920]  She says she's got the exact algorithm, the Dominion Software Systems algorithm that was used
[3:10:49.920 --> 3:11:00.000]  to flip the election from Trump to Biden. She's got witnesses, affidavits, cases,
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:12.080]  smartmatic, Dominion voter systems, the whole nine yards, everything. Okay, so look, Sydney,
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:20.080]  we want to know the details. What cases and what states? Where are they at? What kind of cases?
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:28.640]  Are we talking civil suits? Are we talking about pleas for recounts or re-dues of election?
[3:11:28.640 --> 3:11:35.840]  We're talking criminal actions. What are the specific cases and where are they in the process?
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:45.920]  Because time is limited. What is actually going on? Because if this is not going to make it by the
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:11:56.480]  deadline, then publish everything. Publish everything. Let's see the algorithm. Let's see
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:12:06.800]  all of the evidence you've got. Let's see the affidavits. Let's see the whole kit and caboodle.
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:20.320]  Otherwise, we want to know about the cases. This is urgent business of millions and millions of people.
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:29.200]  Okay, I think I couldn't be any clearer than I've been about this factor.
[3:12:32.400 --> 3:12:40.240]  This is a war that your children are going to be fighting. This war is not going to end in 30
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:49.760]  days or 60 days. It has lots of moving parts and they're all moving against us. That's the plan.
[3:12:49.760 --> 3:12:58.480]  That was the plan. That will be the plan. Don't be under the delusion that if Trump is installed as
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:08.800]  the president in January that everybody can go home. That isn't it, folks. The 300,000 or million
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:18.320]  people who are in Washington DC, these are the people, the people who want freedom. It's not
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:27.600]  only stop the steal. It's freedom from the COVID fraud. All of the scientific fraud that I and others
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:33.120]  have been documenting for months that led to the lockdowns, the shutdown of the economy,
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:39.200]  the destruction of the economy, and countless lives and bankruptcies, closure of businesses
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:47.120]  and suicides, all part of the plan. It's a war against that. All of the people who were in
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:54.720]  Washington DC and more who didn't make it have to understand that and realize that this is not
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:14:03.280]  going to be over. This is the fight and the war that we are in. It doesn't matter which candidate
[3:14:03.280 --> 3:14:12.720]  you have to have or want. The war goes on. The technocrats and the globalists are going to keep
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:21.200]  fighting the war. They want to diminish and destroy and then rebuild on the ashes. So don't
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:31.120]  think this is short term. Understand to the depths why you were there in Washington DC,
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:40.240]  what that was all about, what it's still about, and what it's going to be about for the duration
[3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:53.520]  here. I'm 82 years old now. Certain things become clear. Certain things that you never thought you
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:15:01.920]  would ever be talking about. If somebody at 20, when I was 25 said to me, around 60 years or so
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:07.280]  from now, you're going to be talking about the Constitution. I would have said, was that a jazz
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:12.880]  club in New York that I haven't seen yet or I didn't go to because I'm there every night paying my
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:20.800]  $1 to watch the greatest jazz musicians in the world. No, it's a document on which the country
[3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:26.880]  was founded. Well, I'm free. I'm 25. I've got a girlfriend. I got a few bucks in my pocket.
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:32.560]  I've got a lousy job at a lousy bookstore, but what do I care? Life is good. You walk outside
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:39.600]  on an autumn day in New York, and it's fantastic. You never know what you're going to end up doing.
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:50.240]  But that New York, which I knew inside out is gone. It's now a desolate, boarded up
[3:15:50.960 --> 3:15:58.160]  site board. That's what the governor did. That's what de Blasio, the mayor did.
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:06.720]  Cuomo and de Blasio, the fascists. Back in the day, and I'm talking about the late 50s
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:14.000]  and early 1960s, you could have an argument with the dumbest person in the whole city of New York,
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:20.560]  and it would be a smart argument. It seemed like everybody in New York had a point of view.
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:28.080]  They were smart. They could argue that point of view. Whatever it was, they were independent,
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:35.360]  minded. They never would have stood for this insanity. A lockdown? Are you kidding me? Forget
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:43.840]  about it. But gradually degree by degree, the brainwashing took place. So to unbrainwash it
[3:16:43.840 --> 3:16:48.640]  is not going to be a walk in the park, folks, no matter who the next president is.
[3:16:48.640 --> 3:16:55.120]  And if you were in Washington, DC, among the million, or if you didn't get there, but you know
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:17:05.760]  what the Constitution and freedom are all about, the people have to rise up. The people have to
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:14.720]  rise up. That is the story, and we are the people against the entire insanity of this proposition
[3:17:14.720 --> 3:17:22.000]  of lockdown civilization and destruction by technocrats and globalists. That's the whole story.
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:30.880]  Scott Atlas said it. He's the only sane coronavirus advisor in the White House right now.
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:40.160]  He said, the people have to rise up. That's an extraordinary statement. He's on the inside.
[3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:46.800]  He knows all these coronavirus people. He knows people in the White House, and he understands
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:56.160]  that he cannot continue to argue the science with these people. The science that shows that the entire
[3:17:56.160 --> 3:18:02.720]  business of the pandemic is a fraud, and the case numbers are a fraud, and the test is a fraud,
[3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:09.360]  and there should never be lockdowns. He knows he can't argue that. He's appealing directly to us
[3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:18.640]  to you. The people must rise up if you want freedom. That is the story. That's where we are.
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:29.680]  That is what you have to understand. The CDC is planning green zone concentration camps,
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:40.160]  CD hotels, where people will be sent. We'll have more about that after the break. Stay with us. Don't go anywhere.
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:46.320]  I get asked all the time by listeners, by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show,
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:51.440]  and it's the fact that Info War is more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the Club
[3:18:51.440 --> 3:18:56.720]  of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying developed the hypothesis that the Communist
[3:18:56.720 --> 3:19:01.680]  China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:06.720]  destitute and position us into debt. Well, now China owns the debt. Now China owns Hollywood,
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:12.000]  all the one side of trading deals. It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again,
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:17.760]  it wasn't that hard. The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:23.440]  want to focus on that issue. We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at Info Wars.
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:28.000]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films,
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:32.400]  water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:36.320]  helped make up the world what's really happening. So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:20:02.320]  I want to thank you for your support.
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:32.320]  Thank you for your support.
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:35.760]  Without you won't be on the air. Again, I salute you and thank you all for your numbers.
[3:21:03.280 --> 3:21:09.440]  That is a fact. And all the hero sheep where the mask to go along with this are signing on to mass
[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:15.040]  murder bigger than what Hitler did. That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[3:21:15.040 --> 3:21:21.200]  This is a medical world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world
[3:21:21.200 --> 3:21:27.040]  IDs and coming with forced inoculations. And now back to America says global unrest is sure to
[3:21:27.040 --> 3:21:32.080]  trigger an even bigger depression. That's stories on info wars.com. That's why it's vital for all
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:37.200]  of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused
[3:21:37.200 --> 3:21:39.200]  by the planetary great reset.
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:22:07.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show news analysis reports it's the Alex Jones show.
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:10.960]  And now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:22.000]  Okay, I want to go back. I want to go back to. It's up to the people to rise up.
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:29.840]  And I want to specify what that's all about. It's about opening up the economy every single
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:38.080]  which way that we can because it's not going to be done for us. You can see that we're into the
[3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:45.840]  second and third wave of lockdowns, not virus lockdowns. They're getting more serious than
[3:22:45.840 --> 3:22:58.080]  ever in Europe in the US. They're anticipating a globalist victory opening up the economy every
[3:22:58.080 --> 3:23:07.520]  which way we can and keeping it open. That's the deal. That's what is the stake in the heart to
[3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:14.960]  the globalists. That's the difference between night and day. That's what the million people
[3:23:14.960 --> 3:23:21.760]  who came to Washington DC have to remember and that's what we all have to do in every way that
[3:23:21.760 --> 3:23:28.080]  we can possibly do it. Go back to work, open up companies, open up businesses, get the economy
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:35.680]  back every which way because they want to shut it down. They want to destroy it and destroy us
[3:23:35.680 --> 3:23:42.560]  in the process. I don't think I need to spell out what it's like to own a business and to try to
[3:23:42.560 --> 3:23:48.560]  open it up two or three times only to get shut down each time. I mean, you just get hammered over
[3:23:48.560 --> 3:23:54.640]  the head. Hammered over the head. The money runs out. It's time for bankruptcy. What are you going
[3:23:54.640 --> 3:24:03.280]  to do? What are you going to do? You've got to think differently and plan differently. It isn't
[3:24:03.840 --> 3:24:10.240]  a cookie cutter solution for everybody. You've got to be smart. You've got to be clever. You've
[3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:19.760]  got to be iron-willed and persistent because you're in this all the way. That's what the people rising
[3:24:19.760 --> 3:24:28.320]  up means in Michigan and other places. The governor says, we're locking it down. That's it. You're
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:35.360]  under house arrest in case there is any doubt about this.
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:47.280]  The Constitution of the United States does not permit under any circumstances, under any emergency
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:58.320]  whatsoever that might occur. Natural disaster, war, whatever, to cross that line and lock down
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:06.880]  the population and refuse people the right to work. That is not permitted. The Constitution
[3:25:07.440 --> 3:25:15.280]  and the basic freedoms in it are being trampled every day, every day in states from one end of
[3:25:15.280 --> 3:25:23.520]  this country to another. The principles, the same principles, are being spat upon and trampled
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:31.680]  in countries all over the world every day by fascist leaders who are under the gun themselves,
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:38.800]  who have sold out, who have bribed and taken bribes, who have been blackmailed, who are under the
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:48.480]  control of higher ups in the scheme, in the plan, in the spider's web. What do you think is happening
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:56.480]  with governors who are almost unanimously locked down the first time and are coming back from more
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:26:04.240]  in the US? The federal government just simply says to them, do you want money for the states?
[3:26:05.600 --> 3:26:14.640]  These states are all crooked and bent. Their budgets are a nightmare. They're in debt on debt
[3:26:14.640 --> 3:26:24.240]  on debt on debt. California four years ago unfunded liabilities of $250 billion. Are you
[3:26:24.240 --> 3:26:32.720]  kidding me? All underwritten by Goldman Sachs and other big players just to keep California
[3:26:32.720 --> 3:26:40.880]  government alive? And that was before COVID. Are you kidding me? These states are bankrupt on
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:50.480]  bankrupt. So the federal government officials just whisper in the air of the governors,
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:57.200]  do you want state money? Then lock it down. Lock it down. Do you want federal money for
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:04.400]  your states so you can continue your programs and your theft, et cetera, et cetera? Otherwise,
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:09.200]  I mean, then you really do have to shut down the governor, right? The governor say, yeah,
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:14.960]  yeah, right. Of course. Of course. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Well, if you want that federal money,
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:23.600]  then when you hear it's time to lock down, you're going to lock down. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:34.480]  Yes, sir. You would like to say it. Can't say it on the air. Can't say it on the air.
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:43.360]  Mustn't say it on the air. That's what they are. That's what they are. No balls at all.
[3:27:46.960 --> 3:27:56.720]  You and I, we're in this to the end. We're in this all the way for freedom. That's what the story is.
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:12.160]  So take Dr. Zeke and that you take. I don't want. He's the latest member of Biden's
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:20.240]  to be coronavirus task. He's a doctor. And in the past, he's made a statement, you know,
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:27.600]  one of these kind of very casual elite statements. I don't see that life after 75 is worth anything.
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:34.480]  I myself wouldn't take any kind of treatment except palliative treatment for suffering and pain,
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:40.400]  but not to extend life because I believe that by the time you reach 75, you lived a full and
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:47.680]  rich life. And that should be the case for everybody. It's very simple. He's now on the
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:55.040]  coronavirus task force. Does the man even know how old? Yeah, there he is. Zeke, Zeke,
[3:28:55.040 --> 3:29:06.640]  wiki, wiki. Does he even know how old Biden is? Does he know that just like, remember Soylent Green?
[3:29:06.640 --> 3:29:14.000]  Soylent Green, the movie Soylent Green is people. Well, COVID-19 is old people. They're killing
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:18.960]  old people. They're forcing the premature deaths of old people in nursing homes,
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:25.760]  long term facilities, hospitals with ventilators, and in their own homes all over the world.
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:33.920]  Millions upon millions of old people. That's what the statistics will show you
[3:29:35.040 --> 3:29:42.800]  that at least half the COVID so-called COVID deaths are all about. That's what they are.
[3:29:42.800 --> 3:29:52.960]  COVID-19 is old people. So well, I see Zeke's past statements and, well, just what would we do?
[3:29:54.320 --> 3:30:01.520]  Just let the body stack up. Who cares? People have reached the rich old age of 75,
[3:30:01.520 --> 3:30:09.120]  it's time to go on your way. That's what I would call population reduction.
[3:30:09.120 --> 3:30:17.600]  That's the Biden coronavirus task force. You ready for that?
[3:30:20.160 --> 3:30:29.520]  I don't think you are. I'm not. Not a chance. Not a chance. The people must rise up.
[3:30:32.560 --> 3:30:36.880]  What would happen if, say, a million people gathered in one place? It could be Washington,
[3:30:36.880 --> 3:30:44.000]  D.C. as happened a couple of weeks ago. It could be anywhere. And what if they decided to stay?
[3:30:45.360 --> 3:30:55.680]  You know what I'm saying? Stay. Establish camps at, say, governor's mansion or the governor of
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:31:05.200]  the state's headquarters. Occupy. A real occupy. And what if the real people in charge of that
[3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:17.120]  that million occupy were women, mothers leading the fight? Because mothers, you see,
[3:31:17.120 --> 3:31:23.360]  of children present a very different problem to the authorities. Remember the vaccine,
[3:31:23.360 --> 3:31:32.400]  autism movement, still alive. Who forced that? Who forced that? The mothers, you bet.
[3:31:32.400 --> 3:31:35.520]  We'll have more on this after the break. Don't go anywhere.
[3:32:03.120 --> 3:32:07.280]  Women and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her
[3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:12.880]  control. That's right. She's been rigging elections for years and years. And the same thing is coming
[3:32:12.880 --> 3:32:18.000]  here to the United States. This is world government. In Philadelphia, they've announced four people
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:22.960]  or more seen together will be arrested. They're announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is
[3:32:22.960 --> 3:32:28.080]  what the communist takeover looks like. To bankrupt you, to take red of all your due process,
[3:32:28.080 --> 3:32:34.640]  and absolutely transform the world into a present planet. How long have we warned you about this?
[3:32:34.640 --> 3:33:00.640]  But you can fight back. America is the last bastion. Stop submitting.
[3:33:04.640 --> 3:33:08.320]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had. This is completely transparent.
[3:33:08.320 --> 3:33:12.720]  So when they say that he is president elect, he's not. Trump has not conceded. None of the
[3:33:12.720 --> 3:33:16.400]  states have certified the vote. And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[3:33:16.400 --> 3:33:22.080]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[3:33:22.080 --> 3:33:26.800]  And in Georgia, officials are on record saying we've already found fraud. So ladies and gentlemen,
[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:32.080]  the fix is in. They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:35.200]  But now this is the mother of all hoaxes. And if they get away with this,
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:34:02.800]  it's the end of America. As we know it, we will be Venezuela in full wars.com.
[3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:13.040]  But we have bodies, ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level.
[3:34:13.040 --> 3:34:18.080]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerated and bringing into the cells of the body.
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:21.600]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock. And despite that, bodies,
[3:34:21.600 --> 3:34:28.400]  ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping and triple
[3:34:28.400 --> 3:34:33.680]  patriot points and infowarstore.com. It's bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:38.960]  If you haven't tried it, learn why it's got thousands of five star reviews at infowarstore.com
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:45.120]  and you can't lose. It funds the infowar. It really is simple. The left are into being deviant.
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:50.400]  And I don't mean sexually deviant. That goes to territory. I'm talking about deviant against
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:55.360]  their ancestors, deviant against their own species, deviant against the order of nature.
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:34:59.760]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:05.200]  they want to play God. Everything they touch, they destroy. Their sacrament is aborting babies
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:11.680]  and then using their body parts. Their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them.
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:16.960]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor,
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:22.400]  ballooning populations, and then watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:27.440]  reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again. They truly are the children of Satan.
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:30.480]  They are the children of the devil. And if you look at the slaves that serve them,
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:35.680]  Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifested that being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:36:04.720]  Sin is not profitable. I'm Alex Jones, and this is The Info War.
[3:36:06.320 --> 3:36:12.560]  I want to go back on a little science here now. I published an article with No More Fake News
[3:36:14.240 --> 3:36:24.720]  recently, Smoking Gun PCR Test, Fauci. The test is the basis for the fake case numbers,
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:32.320]  which lead to all of this hysteria. Oh, the cases are rising, rising, rising. So we have to lock
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:37.840]  down. That's what you're hearing. That's what's being broadcast, not only in the US and various
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:47.520]  states, but in Europe as well. Same deal. Case numbers, where they come from, the test, PCR test.
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:57.280]  The test is done by taking a very, very tiny piece of a tissue sample from the patient,
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:09.920]  swab, bacteria, run this complex, very complex test. It's run in cycles. Each cycle is like
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:16.720]  blowing up a photograph a huge number of times. It's an amplification or magnification of the
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:24.800]  original tiny piece, which is far too small to observe in any way. So how many of these
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:33.360]  amplifications or cycles is the test run at? Well, it turns out Anthony Fauci went on the record
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:41.600]  and said, well, if you run it at 35 cycles or amplifications or more, it's ridiculous. You
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:47.200]  don't get any kind of reliable result, whatever you get, false positives. It's meaningless.
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:59.920]  So I put that together with a CDC document on the FDA website page, which says that the FDA
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:06.880]  recommends, and they are the interim guidance people. They are the ones who certify these tests.
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:16.320]  They recommend that the test be run up to 40 cycles. So they are recommending that this has
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:22.160]  to be done at a level which is meaningless and which will produce many, many false positive
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:29.360]  results, which will say that people are, quote, infected and jack up the case numbers to the sky,
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:35.280]  resulting in the justifications for the lockdown and the destruction of the economies and so on
[3:38:35.280 --> 3:38:40.720]  and so forth. And that is the building. That's the edifice. That's the architecture. That's the
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:48.640]  chain upon which this fraud is being built and it's exposed. There it is. I've given it to you
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:38:56.160]  in a minute and a half. There it is. Labs all over the United States and in Europe as well.
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:03.440]  Looking at the interim guidance or other guidance, this will say, well, we should run the test up
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:09.920]  to 40 cycles to see if we can, quote, find the virus. And so they do. And so the results are
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:16.160]  meaningless. And so they produce false positives. And here's the capper, the grand finale,
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:23.760]  the finishing touch on all of this. So pay attention. In the US,
[3:39:25.840 --> 3:39:34.320]  neither patients nor doctors are informed when they get a test result for a patient.
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:44.320]  They're not informed as to how many cycles the lab ran the test at. Got it?
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:53.600]  So this means the labs can keep it a secret. They don't have to say. They don't have to tell anybody.
[3:39:55.760 --> 3:40:01.440]  So nobody knows. But because they're following the guidelines of the FDA,
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:10.080]  they're running it up to 40 meaningless destructive cycles. That's the con. That's the hustle. That's
[3:40:10.080 --> 3:40:16.880]  the scam. That's the whole basis for the fraud that is being perpetrated night and day everywhere
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:30.080]  around the world. In a nutshell, there it is. And yet, who's doing anything about it inside the
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:39.120]  government? Any government? Who's blowing the whistle? What governor is standing up and saying,
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:46.320]  guess what I just learned? The whole test is a fraud. What prime minister is standing up and
[3:40:46.320 --> 3:40:52.880]  saying, guess what I just learned? Scientifically speaking, the test is a fraud. Well, I can tell
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:41:00.720]  you that in the last day or two, reports are coming out that in Portugal, an appeals court
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:08.400]  has rendered that verdict absolutely and canceled a quarantine on that very basis by ruling that the
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:16.160]  test is a fraud. That is, in a nutshell, their ruling and their statement and their decision.
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:27.840]  Somebody woke up. Some lawyer argued the right case. Some lawyer came through and some court said,
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:33.760]  you know what? The light has just entered the chamber.
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:47.280]  The science has been revealed in detail to be a fraud. That's what we have discovered.
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:57.920]  I hope that gets through everybody, everybody, everybody, and everybody.
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:06.160]  I want to talk about a potentially different kind of vote fraud in this election.
[3:42:07.760 --> 3:42:12.800]  There's a guy named George Webb, a very smart guy. You can find him in different places.
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:22.080]  And he calls it the middleman strategy. And basically what this involves is hacking.
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:35.600]  A person on election gets into a machine, a computer, that is, and sets up what Webb would call
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:43.120]  and does call a command post. In other words, a post from which to interfere in the transmission of
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:49.360]  data pertaining to the election, which would be the vote count. So this is not technically the
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:57.680]  same thing as Dominion Software or ESNS or Smartmatic Software is designed with a backdoor
[3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:08.640]  like Promise Software, if you remember that scandal. I mean, these softwares are designed routinely
[3:43:08.640 --> 3:43:13.120]  with backdoors, but we're not exactly talking about that now. We're talking about something else,
[3:43:13.120 --> 3:43:24.320]  the man in the middle, to be able to change and alter numbers of votes in transmission
[3:43:25.200 --> 3:43:32.560]  en route, as they would say. And so I'll boil down a very quick story that happened to me in 1994
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:37.760]  when I was running for seat in the US Congress and things were very primitive and punch cards.
[3:43:37.760 --> 3:43:45.200]  This was in the 29th District in Los Angeles and on the night of the election, we went down to
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:50.160]  the county registrar building in Norwalk and all the lights were on, a lot of action,
[3:43:50.160 --> 3:43:55.680]  a lot of vote counts and so forth. And so we were observers and we were taken on the tour.
[3:43:56.400 --> 3:44:01.440]  And the first stop on the tour was a vote count room where there was a railing and we stood at
[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:07.520]  the railing and we watched about 30 people sitting at machines feeding punch cards in.
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:14.800]  What are you going to see there? I don't know. Then we moved to another stop where compact
[3:44:14.800 --> 3:44:23.760]  computers had been redesigned as processors and the count or yes, the count from the counting
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:30.000]  room were being transferred into these compact computers. And so our tour guide said, you see,
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:36.080]  this is what's happening right here. And we looked and we saw machines. What is there to see?
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:43.520]  Okay, what happens next? Okay, now we take an elevator up four floors and now there's a room
[3:44:43.520 --> 3:44:49.360]  and we can't go into the room. And in a corner is a freestanding big computer. And we're said,
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:56.880]  told, look at that. That's where the compact computers send their totals into that machine.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:04.480]  And so I said, well, is that the end? And the tour guide said, no. This computer in the corner
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:14.560]  sends the totals to a much bigger computer four miles away. And then that computer does a
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:27.040]  flipping blip and sends back the final numbers of the moment. Really? Yes. That was the tour.
[3:45:27.600 --> 3:45:35.120]  That was observing the count. That was getting as close as we could to what was actually happening.
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:39.840]  Actually, we got a little closer. That's a different story. And we saw that the
[3:45:39.840 --> 3:45:46.480]  percentages of the votes between my opponent and me, which were updated every half hour,
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:52.240]  did not change all night, except for one tiny two percentage change. Otherwise,
[3:45:52.240 --> 3:45:59.600]  they stayed exactly the same during every update. It's another story. My point is, there are many
[3:46:01.120 --> 3:46:08.000]  terminals along the line where the vote can be changed. The vote count can be changed and altered
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:14.160]  but technically just not have to do with software system. It has to do with interference if somebody
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:21.200]  is in there and has set up what amounts to a command post. And so you have another avenue.
[3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:38.240]  Sydney, Powell, we want to hear from you what's happening with the cases right now.
