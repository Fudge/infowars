[00:00:00.805 --> 00:00:04.226]  The longing of the soul.
[00:00:04.226 --> 00:00:08.167]  When our founders declared a new order of the ages.
[00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:14.929]  When soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty.
[00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.691]  When citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner of freedom now.
[00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:26.973]  They were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.
[00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:28.994]  History has an ebb and flow of justice.
[00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:36.761]  But history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty.
