[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]  The longing of the soul.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  When our founders declared a new order of the ages,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner of freedom now,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]  they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]  History has an ebb and flow of justice,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty.
