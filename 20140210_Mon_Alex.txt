[00:52.680 --> 01:01.240]  massive financial news that we're going to be breaking down today as well we
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.880]  just have huge huge amounts of information on every front it is an
[01:06.880 --> 01:13.440]  absolute deluge of info that I'm gonna attempt to break down on the broadcast
[01:13.440 --> 01:18.800]  today obviously there's also a lot of news coming out about Hillary and all of
[01:18.800 --> 01:23.800]  her bizarre activities and their enemies list and how they persecute even
[01:23.800 --> 01:30.280]  Democrats that are rivals to their criminal operations we're going to be
[01:30.280 --> 01:37.240]  looking at moves to nullify the NDAA and indefinite detention at the state
[01:37.240 --> 01:43.520]  level also more on the woman held by TSA for reading Jewish newspaper going
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.440]  public and she's now speaking out we broke that story Friday
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.640]  drudgereport.com picked it up and now the New York Post and other people are
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.800]  freaking out over it because the TSA is proud of themselves they say we're
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.000]  going to ask you what you're reading well yeah they data mine here's the big
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.400]  story I'm gonna get into this later the TSA for over a decade but now they're
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.680]  public last year data mines via NSA and open networks everything about you and
[02:13.680 --> 02:18.160]  they're being set up as a domestic security spy force that will then roll
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.120]  out on the streets of America now that's already happened and I told you 12
[02:22.120 --> 02:24.840]  years ago when they were first set up that they would be on the streets of
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.280]  America because I saw their founding meetings repeatedly on C spam with
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.520]  Governor Ridge and others of Homeland Security so I've known their plan all
[02:33.520 --> 02:36.840]  along you're going to have TSA on the streets everywhere they're going to have
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.680]  a data pad with what you ate for dinner the night before at a major chain
[02:41.680 --> 02:45.280]  they're going to know how many guns you own where you live everything about you
[02:45.280 --> 02:51.120]  whatever wrong data gets into the databases which we see constantly in
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.040]  fact I was saying that that Alex Jones lady from England the big talk show
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.680]  house is born on the same day no they put my birthdate in as her birthday and
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.240]  that's even listed I was looking by the BBC in one area as her birthdate my
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.640]  birthday that's just an example Wikipedia's had my name spelled wrong
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.040]  Emrick they have the wrong spelling of Emrick up there and they always have and
[03:13.040 --> 03:16.960]  that and I sent him a copy of my driver's license and they will not change it
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.520]  they said well you're the person this is about so we can't believe anything you
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.880]  say I'm like I am the public figure Alex Jones is like five years ago and they
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.280]  said prove it send us some info so I sent it to one of the editors they said
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.640]  now we're not going to do that so now when I try to get on airplanes and stuff
[03:34.640 --> 03:38.320]  they've asked well the spelling we have of Emrick is like this and I go that's
[03:38.320 --> 03:41.800]  wrong and I show him my driver's license and this I still have had issues I
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.640]  don't know five or six times because of that and that's an example just because
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.920]  of Wikipedia people ask why am I I'm kind of digressing here it was just a
[03:51.920 --> 03:58.320]  factoid that's why our that's why our one of our big Facebook says 700,000
[03:58.320 --> 04:02.440]  members has Emrick spelled wrong because it was a fan page somebody made for us
[04:02.440 --> 04:06.560]  and gave to us they use that disinfo so it's not only are they getting your
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.840]  information wrongly and stealing it a lot of it is incorrect ladies and gentlemen
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.440]  especially if you have a common name like Alex Jones I mean oh my gosh I have
[04:17.440 --> 04:21.520]  been blamed for more stuff other Alex Joneses have done and other Alex Joneses
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.760]  have bemoaned to me that they get blamed because people that don't like me for
[04:25.760 --> 04:29.920]  everything I do so it just shows how dangerous these
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.840]  technocracies are it's kind of like in the movie Brazil where the bug falls in
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.000]  the typewriter and instead of buttle it's tuddled and they come and arrest him
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.800]  and disappear him and ruin his life and ruin other people's lives all because
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.120]  the police state got something wrong all right that's a side issue I'm gonna
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.320]  regroup when we come back on the other side and I'm gonna attempt to hammer
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.960]  through oh my gosh the top story Bloomberg has been caught in a secret

[08:24.760 --> 08:30.560]  gentlemen if I come to you from the capital of America Austin Texas which
[08:30.560 --> 08:34.800]  obviously the enemy has captured we are here trying to remove it from the hands
[08:34.800 --> 08:43.880]  of the kleptocratic Democrats who obviously are completely run by foreign
[08:43.880 --> 08:50.440]  offshore banks you know during the last break when we went into break from the
[08:50.440 --> 08:57.080]  first segment on this Monday 10th day of February 2014 transmission I saw a
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.080]  quote from Obama up there about comprehensive immigration reform on CNN
[09:02.080 --> 09:07.120]  as we got CNN Fox you name it on the TVs out there monitoring dinosaur media
[09:07.120 --> 09:12.440]  and it was Obama saying quote did the Republican support comprehensive
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.240]  immigration reform in 2006
[09:16.840 --> 09:23.600]  everyone knows the answer I rest my case as if they're just part of Sun Lee in
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.120]  the house blocking legalizing tens of millions of illegals and then allowing
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.720]  them to bring in their families who then promptly get put on welfare and
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.320]  promptly vote to take everyone's guns and promptly vote to make us a communist
[09:37.320 --> 09:44.560]  country basically a lot's changed since 2006 the libertarian movement has begun
[09:44.560 --> 09:50.480]  to take over the Republican Party in the words of Joe Biden and Barack Obama and
[09:50.480 --> 10:02.440]  Carl Rove all those guys are on the same team the enemy of their enemy is their
[10:02.440 --> 10:09.560]  friend sure Carl Rove and the Democrats aren't on the same team because they all
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.080]  want to have control of the system of the bureaucracy but when it comes to
[10:14.080 --> 10:17.680]  knocking out the real tea party that's all they meet about when you learn about
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.600]  Democrat and Republican top strategy meetings with all the blue bloods and
[10:21.600 --> 10:25.720]  all the establishment people they talk about one thing at Bilderberg and that's
[10:25.720 --> 10:30.680]  stopping a liberty movement in America because if the United States can be
[10:30.680 --> 10:36.760]  rested from the clutches of the monopoly capitalist anti-free market pieces of
[10:36.760 --> 10:43.640]  garbage we can roll back their entire program worldwide the fate of the world
[10:43.640 --> 10:50.440]  rest in the United States 1776 will either be launched from United States to
[10:50.440 --> 10:58.040]  rollback tyranny or 1984 will continue to be pushed and and funded by the blood
[10:58.040 --> 11:04.160]  sweat and tears of the once great Republic because the globalists have
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.840]  already sucked dry and debilitated every other country with their parasitic
[11:07.840 --> 11:13.960]  garbage and so they came here with their systems of monopoly and the British
[11:13.960 --> 11:19.120]  Empire model that the United States adopted after World War two and here
[11:19.120 --> 11:25.840]  we are 65 years later run in to the ground I guess it's longer how long
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.840]  since 1945 in the World War two when we became the global Empire you really say
[11:30.840 --> 11:37.400]  really an empire by 1950 that's still from 1950 and now 64 years unbelievable
[11:37.400 --> 11:42.800]  back to World War two it's almost 70 years ladies and gentlemen to the end of
[11:42.800 --> 11:48.160]  World War two when our forebearers came home after the war for the first time in
[11:48.160 --> 11:51.200]  modern history since our country was founded said we trust the government
[11:51.200 --> 11:57.160]  now we're the good guys we're gonna do what's right and that's why suddenly all
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.160]  the veterans almost all the white veterans that's really led the civil
[12:02.160 --> 12:06.160]  rights movement said we're not gonna be part of this racism anymore we're not
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.720]  gonna be part of segregating people forcibly we're not gonna be part of
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.560]  not letting folks vote all over the country corrupt boss hogs got overthrown
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.280]  and it wasn't even racial it was just people overthrew them and all over the
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.320]  country people said I'm not gonna be part of this and vets all basically ran
[12:23.320 --> 12:26.760]  for office like my grandfather in freestone County and got elected to
[12:26.760 --> 12:34.520]  office and help push the civil rights act that Eisenhower put through it'd
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.640]  been the supreme Allied commander because it was the idea of we're the good
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.960]  guys we're really gonna do the right thing but the bad byproduct of that was
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.520]  buying into the government's good and the very same eugenicist elements that
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.760]  had been running the country pre-World War two that had set up Hitler and the
[12:52.760 --> 12:56.280]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute this is declassified this was never even
[12:56.280 --> 13:01.120]  classified this has been known since the 20s who set up all the eugenics
[13:01.120 --> 13:10.760]  worldwide England created it the United States seated it worldwide and that's the
[13:10.760 --> 13:20.600]  system that we now have in place on a planetary scale we just add one little
[13:20.600 --> 13:25.040]  note to you guys I started getting white noise piercing at the level of a dog
[13:25.040 --> 13:29.120]  whistle into my earpiece I don't know what just changed 20 seconds ago but
[13:29.120 --> 13:33.000]  just give you that I keep going it's fine it's just it's pretty annoying okay
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.960]  now let's stop right there and get into the top story here today ladies and
[13:37.960 --> 13:45.040]  gentlemen the top absolute most important story period and one of the most
[13:45.040 --> 13:48.760]  important stories I have ever covered and you know every few months I say this
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.000]  is one of the most important stories and it's hard to tell which one is the most
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.600]  important of all time the missing new still missing confirmed to be missing
[13:56.600 --> 14:01.880]  almost the entire nuclear command removed the launch officers removed there
[14:01.880 --> 14:07.040]  is a coup going on in the military that's absolutely giant Fukushima's big and
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.120]  not even the radiation that's a big issue but the non-response and not caring
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.720]  and other reactors leaking all over the place just shows the madness just shows
[14:15.720 --> 14:19.520]  the insanity of the elite bunch of narcissist control freaks power
[14:19.520 --> 14:25.160]  tripping control freak demons I mean there's been so many other huge stories
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.520]  so many incredibly important things Syria almost happening that could lead to
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.320]  World War three that getting backed off that's a huge story by the way coming up
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.360]  Iran is being extremely belligerent and you know I've been anti-Iranian warb but
[14:40.360 --> 14:46.120]  they are really asking for it and really pushing it and I'm now sure of what we
[14:46.120 --> 14:52.200]  already knew but couldn't confirm currently that Iran is in league with
[14:52.200 --> 14:56.240]  criminal elements of the New World Order and that the moolas and 79 were put in
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.560]  power by basically NATO forces out of France and that they're playing a
[15:01.560 --> 15:05.360]  triple game and I'm gonna be breaking that down coming up later in the hour
[15:05.360 --> 15:11.240]  it's absolutely essential sending ships to our coast threatening to nuke Israel
[15:11.240 --> 15:19.160]  and showing missile attack maps this is staged this is absolutely asking to be
[15:19.160 --> 15:23.000]  attacked because the only way the moolas can stay in power is if they're on the
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.400]  verge of war and it's disgusting it is disgusting that they would threaten the
[15:28.400 --> 15:32.840]  world with World War 3 when the forces of peace here in North America and
[15:32.840 --> 15:38.560]  Europe have already stopped an attack on Iran it is out of control and I have
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.840]  analyzed it and I'm telling you it's it's it's a set up
[15:45.760 --> 15:51.320]  it is a setup and I'm gonna break it down it's very sophisticated very hard
[15:51.320 --> 15:55.120]  to articulate I'm gonna do the best job I can and say 45 after guys make me get
[15:55.120 --> 15:58.440]  into that so that's a huge story I mean the point is we're just being hit by
[15:58.440 --> 16:04.120]  giant stories everywhere but one of the biggest stories for human liberty an
[16:04.120 --> 16:11.200]  absolute gift an absolute bonanza an absolute lottery winning ticket has
[16:11.200 --> 16:19.240]  fallen into our greedy for liberty lapse and if we don't use this information
[16:19.240 --> 16:24.200]  and if we don't make a big deal out of this information I want this top story
[16:24.200 --> 16:27.760]  on the nightly news tonight I'm gonna shoot a special video today with all the
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.120]  clips condensed to break down the treachery and the treason if the
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.680]  rest of the of the real media the pro-liberty media the survival media
[16:34.680 --> 16:40.600]  the common sense media the non-self-destructive media the pro future
[16:40.600 --> 16:45.320]  media I mean that's really who we are it's just normal people who aren't
[16:45.320 --> 16:49.920]  completely insane if everyone doesn't pick this up and write your own
[16:49.920 --> 16:53.560]  articles about it and if everyone doesn't run with the ball on this we
[16:53.560 --> 17:00.000]  deserve what we get because this broke on Friday and it has now Saturday Sunday
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.800]  and Monday it's a Kit Daniels article confirmed and it's gotten almost no
[17:05.800 --> 17:12.600]  attention and a lot of pro-gun people have not given this any attention because
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.920]  they're like tell me something I didn't know already but the plan is to register
[17:16.920 --> 17:22.160]  and then confiscate all guns all guns in America that has now been confirmed by
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.240]  a major mayor who was in the meetings with Bloomberg and who was buying into
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.200]  sensible gun control sensible gun control yeah we should know about mentally ill
[17:30.200 --> 17:33.200]  people with guns we should register I mean you know why do you gun owners care
[17:33.200 --> 17:35.840]  we just want to stop the bad guys because we know it's gonna be used to
[17:35.840 --> 17:40.880]  take them that's why it's unconstitutional they were registered before
[17:40.880 --> 17:44.960]  and people knew who owned guns and who was in the militia so that British came
[17:44.960 --> 17:49.640]  to confiscate them in 1775 folks this has happened before everywhere else in
[17:49.640 --> 17:53.080]  world history in the last hundred years they register they always confiscate
[17:53.080 --> 17:58.600]  it's two plus two equals four this is so huge but gun owners go we already know
[17:58.600 --> 18:03.360]  that no no you know that but even this mayor of a major you know town in New
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.120]  York didn't know he was there believing it and they were all rubbing their hands
[18:07.120 --> 18:10.600]  together going once we register we're gonna confiscate just like the mayor of
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.720]  Austin proteam Mike Martinez said in that speech they had signed saying don't
[18:15.720 --> 18:22.440]  confiscate our guns no gun confiscation with a stop sign I've known that guy
[18:22.440 --> 18:25.680]  for 18 years comes out with that same sign a stop sign saying you know no
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.680]  to confiscation and Martinez said hey we're not doing that now but as soon as
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.200]  we as the man said don't take our guns he goes hey the guy's right in the front
[18:34.200 --> 18:37.480]  row he goes look he looks at from 10 feet away and he goes hey we're not gonna
[18:37.480 --> 18:41.840]  take your guns now but after we get done registering we are so you keep that sign
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.800]  you're gonna need it folks the thing is they lie to the public usually and say
[18:46.800 --> 18:50.000]  we're being reasonable nobody wants your guns we're like well in New York or
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.040]  Chicago where you're in control you do these are literal mobsters folks and if
[18:55.040 --> 18:58.280]  you go out to the anti-gun folks most of them mean well they really are just
[18:58.280 --> 19:01.320]  scared of guns and believe the propaganda they don't know more guns
[19:01.320 --> 19:04.520]  means less crime they don't understand everywhere else they've been taken they
[19:04.520 --> 19:08.560]  understand it's about enslavement all the government arms against us if you go
[19:08.560 --> 19:11.920]  out with the video of Mike Martinez Democratic officials part of mayors
[19:11.920 --> 19:16.800]  against gun violence and mayors against illegal guns is their new name and you

[19:20.280 --> 19:23.680]  to try to sue gun manufacturers out of existence while he has 15 bodyguards and
[19:23.680 --> 19:30.040]  armored compounds and jet copters and he carries a gun on record just like Michael
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.600]  Moore and all these other people and Feinstein and all all of them when you
[19:34.600 --> 19:39.560]  realize it it's treachery that will wake the public up the whole world is a

[19:43.280 --> 19:49.000]  take this treachery this sneaky and in literal rooms with these people and the
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.160]  fact that it's leaked and push it out there we're gonna come back and play

[23:12.520 --> 23:16.360]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take
[23:16.360 --> 23:21.520]  action a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has

[24:42.920 --> 24:46.400]  getting our guns they're going to take everything else
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.440]  tension funds bank accounts factories jobs it's all about domination and
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.600]  control but I got to say this a huge awakening is happening I took my
[24:57.600 --> 25:03.120]  children to nut job and it was an anti-agenda 21 movie an anti-Obama care
[25:03.120 --> 25:09.880]  movie it was incredible with Liam Neeson and then I took him to the Lego movie and
[25:09.880 --> 25:14.400]  I thought when I walked out multiple listeners came over and said we thought
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.040]  you made this movie and I'm not going to give away the Lego movie but it is
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.160]  pro-libertarian pro-human pro-individual anti-nsa anti-surveillance state I'm
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.480]  telling you folks there is a rebellion all the old guys are dying or are
[25:29.480 --> 25:33.440]  senile like Sumner Redstone that I know personally has stopped a lot of
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.680]  libertarian conservative movements in LA he has generaled that I got contacted by
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.040]  a big celebrity yesterday the day before yesterday when I came out of that
[25:44.040 --> 25:47.960]  movie and turned on my text messages he was saying keep going with the Hollywood
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.080]  stuff you're absolutely on target with that and I know I'm on target with that
[25:53.080 --> 25:57.920]  I was out with a huge movie producer yesterday shooting you know one of the
[25:57.920 --> 26:02.480]  biggest movie TV producers out there just a great guy and we went out shooting
[26:02.480 --> 26:08.040]  with my kids he invited the kids out to his ranch and he said shoot some video
[26:08.040 --> 26:11.520]  for me but I don't even know if I want to put it out because you know guns they'll
[26:11.520 --> 26:19.000]  come after me but you're shooting the 50 cows you name it Reaper 308s M4 223 it
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.400]  was just awesome 300 yards he was shooting bullseye first shot a lot of
[26:24.400 --> 26:31.040]  fun but that's some tracers out the point is is that almost everybody I run
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.080]  into from Hollywood is already awake and it's not a liberal or a conservative
[26:36.080 --> 26:39.880]  they know about the New World Order they know about the social engineering they
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.660]  don't like where everything's going it's only a few globalists at the top that
[26:43.660 --> 26:47.840]  are running this whole show and once people are aware of their system it's
[26:47.840 --> 26:57.480]  over it's over now I want to get into this gun report right now and I want to
[26:57.480 --> 27:02.200]  break this down because it's very very important here's the headline in the
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.320]  video I shot yesterday afternoon breaking this down this needs to go mega

[27:34.280 --> 27:39.320]  million comments because in it in fact I want I want kit and everybody to keep
[27:39.320 --> 27:42.960]  doing articles on this would explain me give it the sensational headline it

[28:44.480 --> 28:50.600]  explain that we have an opportunity to literally destroy the anti gunners and
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.000]  remember whenever the day that Sunday I was on the air four years ago when the
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.800]  Copenhagen Treaty got leaked to Lord Monkton confirmed to be accurate when
[29:00.800 --> 29:08.240]  the Russians hacked the University of East Anglia and got all the UN
[29:08.240 --> 29:12.000]  documents that worldwide they were fixing all the professors to lie and
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.680]  covered a decade of decline and temperature increase now it's actually
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.320]  reversing and getting colder they said hide the decline and all that we blew
[29:19.320 --> 29:22.440]  them wide open but the mainstream media wouldn't report on it I actually got
[29:22.440 --> 29:27.480]  champagne here on air and began drinking okay and then of course you saw it in
[29:27.480 --> 29:31.160]  the next few days explode and you help push it out there just like we got the
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.760]  plastic out of the you know one major fast food chains bread now they're gonna

[34:02.320 --> 34:07.000]  able to resist these people it is an absolute imperative to fight the
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.280]  globalist it is not something you think somebody for I'm simply trying to survive
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.480]  and build a future for my family and your family in a good world together based
[34:16.480 --> 34:22.960]  on justice and building not on based on fraud and lies and deceit and gangs and
[34:22.960 --> 34:29.920]  destruction so again thank you so much for joining us again they're acting like
[34:29.920 --> 34:33.880]  they have the moral high ground with the anti-gun movement oh it's for the
[34:33.880 --> 34:40.760]  children have care about the kids at Sandy Hook care about the children don't
[34:40.760 --> 34:46.840]  you want more to die and we need to say how dare you when mass shootings are
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.440]  flat overall gun deaths are down 51% since 92 just department own numbers
[34:52.440 --> 34:57.200]  wherever you have more guns you have less crime people are using firearms to
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.360]  frustrate and stop crime literally I kept seeing 14 times that was one just
[35:02.360 --> 35:05.320]  department number they've got new numbers out that have been independently
[35:05.320 --> 35:10.120]  gathered I was seeing a few weeks ago 70 plus times every time there's an actual
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.640]  crime with a gun guns are used to stop crime they have domesticated and
[35:14.640 --> 35:18.840]  disarmed everyone else but a handful of countries Switzerland the United States
[35:18.840 --> 35:26.320]  and the UN openly said July 7th 2001 that they want a worldwide gun
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.120]  confiscation plan in their unideer meeting go look it up they said civilian
[35:32.120 --> 35:35.440]  ownership of firearms threatens a legitimate power monopoly of the state
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.240]  and that the main goal is the abolition of private ownership of firearms period
[35:40.240 --> 35:46.520]  I just quoted it to you go look it up can type in what I just said and pull it
[35:46.520 --> 35:54.280]  up on their website they're open about it in their own policy papers and then go
[35:54.280 --> 35:57.840]  we don't want your guns we don't we don't there's no death panels in
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.080]  mobama care there's no doubling prizes you can keep your doctor that that's all
[36:02.080 --> 36:09.480]  lies of those conspiracy people that read the bill and of course Feinstein's
[36:09.480 --> 36:12.920]  been truthful and said we want to ban guns Michael Moore has been trivial
[36:12.920 --> 36:17.000]  for it said the goals to ban guns Obama as a state senator you can read his
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.400]  quotes in the newspaper where they would send out questionnaires when he was
[36:20.400 --> 36:23.760]  running for Senate got into the state Senate got into the federal Senate he
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.360]  said I want a total gun ban the goal is to ban guns and have a quote peaceful
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.600]  society except they have all the guns see they don't lay their guns down in
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.700]  government they're arming to the teeth with war wagons tanks helicopters
[36:37.700 --> 36:42.160]  billions of rounds of ammo training to take over major cities that's why the
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.920]  military's totally waking up because they've got them in these briefings at
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.560]  the non-commissioned officer level and up openly preparing for war with us and
[36:50.560 --> 36:53.920]  the troops are going this is all true all these years with all the
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.520]  conspiracy people said where do you think we learned all this high-level
[36:57.520 --> 37:02.840]  military elites that's why we know the whole game plan so if we lose this
[37:02.840 --> 37:10.040]  fight we deserve it folks we've got the entire enemy attack plan we know they're
[37:10.040 --> 37:13.640]  an enemy we know they're usurpers we know they're illegitimate I'm getting
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.360]  chills right now we know they're horrible and want to shut this country down and
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.280]  reeducate us basically the globalists have a score to settle with America
[37:22.280 --> 37:26.760]  because we were free compared to other nations they want to extinguish that the
[37:26.760 --> 37:30.600]  globalist are generational they want to destroy you because of who your great
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.560]  grandparents were folks you better get with the program and understand this I
[37:36.560 --> 37:40.080]  can't believe we even have to have a debate about what side you should join
[37:40.080 --> 37:43.760]  out there if you work in the system it doesn't mean you have to do a bunch got
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.840]  to do a little bit you got to leak information you got a legally and
[37:47.840 --> 37:53.520]  lawfully slow down you got a sabotage legally and lawfully there's lots of
[37:53.520 --> 37:58.040]  ways to not go along with the criminal tyrants you've got to identify who else
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.520]  is awake you've got to get prepared and when you can or if you're committed go
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.260]  public speak out everybody can do different things and together we will
[38:07.260 --> 38:11.480]  bring down this system as individuals this system is designed to bring us
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.960]  down it's designed to bring down productivity and independence we must
[38:15.960 --> 38:19.800]  bring down the system that is designed to bring us down we're being fed into a
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.880]  collective wood chipper we have to sabotage the engine we have to blow the
[38:24.880 --> 38:28.680]  engine they're already literally shutting our power plants down our factories
[38:28.680 --> 38:33.080]  our small businesses trying to sabotage the young and impressionable minds of
[38:33.080 --> 38:37.120]  young children screwing them up in school with two plus two equals five and
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.520]  you know everybody's got two daddies and five-year-olds need to learn how to
[38:40.520 --> 38:45.080]  masturbate with the perv schools trying to push inoculations and all this other
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.080]  garbage and abortions and all the rest of it I mean this is a wall of crooks
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.440]  that we've put up with who at the end of the day are mentally ill our psychopathic
[38:54.440 --> 39:01.320]  our sadistic and literally love screwing up good wholesome things I was
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.400]  looking and nobody was perfect back then and there were the evils of that day as
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.400]  well but I was looking at high school yearbook annuals for a memorial from
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.480]  uncle coming up next week with all his friends military buddies coming to town
[39:14.480 --> 39:19.640]  I'm all over the country but I'm gonna be speaking at and we were going through
[39:19.640 --> 39:23.960]  all the photos of my grandmother's house on Saturday and she's almost 90 years
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.680]  old and I mean seeing pictures of my uncle you know winning the hurdles and
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.120]  what good shape he was in and how everybody looks so healthy and so good
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.400]  and they had like posture awards at McCallum high school where he went to
[39:37.400 --> 39:43.600]  school and here in Austin and and it was all about you know awards for being
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.400]  honorable and like you know helping disabled children and just and people
[39:48.400 --> 39:51.920]  were really into that they were really be into being good but the evil system
[39:51.920 --> 39:57.440]  manipulated their goodness to carry out evil missions later and to literally
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.760]  empower this systematic takeover of the planet while the globalists were also
[40:01.760 --> 40:06.480]  attacking that goodness and undermining America at the same time because it's
[40:06.480 --> 40:12.560]  full spectrum attack it's full spectrum takeover so here is the top story
[40:12.560 --> 40:19.920]  ladies and gentlemen mayors nationwide gun confiscation is goal of mayors
[40:19.920 --> 40:23.640]  against illegal guns and the headline really should be it's a good headline
[40:23.640 --> 40:29.720]  it should be mayor blows the whistle on secret gun confiscation plan I mean this
[40:29.720 --> 40:37.760]  is so big that he's in the meetings with mayors for a disarmed enslaved America
[40:37.760 --> 40:42.280]  should be the real name and then we have the the mayor for a protein in Austin
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.440]  who's part of Bloomberg's group on record trying to get gun shows banned
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.000]  trying to get everything registered saying to somebody with a sign that says
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.760]  don't take my guns we're gonna play that clip in a moment don't worry we're not
[40:54.760 --> 40:58.920]  gonna do that now but after we do this registration remember last year they're
[40:58.920 --> 41:02.200]  trying to pass that we're gonna do that you're gonna need that sign the
[41:02.200 --> 41:06.000]  incredible evil that they go on the news and say this is just reasonable
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.640]  nobody wants to take your guns that's a conspiracy theory don't listen to those
[41:09.640 --> 41:14.560]  people when it's their stated goal of the UN handgun control incorporated the
[41:14.560 --> 41:17.920]  violence policy center all of it they're literally like in the military in
[41:17.920 --> 41:21.600]  World War one with loudspeakers the Germans started it and the British
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.760]  picked it up they would they would say in English we're you know your people
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.560]  have surrendered we're coming over put your hands up and we won't shoot you
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.280]  don't have to fight you don't have to die and people would panic in the trenches
[41:33.280 --> 41:37.200]  and drop their guns and you have the officers going no it's a ruse no no
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.240]  you're lying you're lying colonel it's not a ruse I get to not fight I get to go
[41:42.240 --> 41:45.600]  home to mommy and the curl up to pull his sidearm and start shooting his own
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.080]  troops and then the Germans will come pouring over I just start swattering
[41:49.080 --> 41:52.680]  bayonetting it's the same deal we're not we're not coming for your guns
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.600]  there's no Obamacare increasing prices there's no socialist takeover there's
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.440]  no plan to legalize the illegals even though we are gonna do it there's no
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.760]  plan to have a fund in arm al-Qaeda nothing happened in Benghazi on and on
[42:05.760 --> 42:10.560]  and on and on it's a military tactic of which it's we're not kind of take your
[42:10.560 --> 42:16.160]  times we just take them everywhere we're in control every city every country it's
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.040]  just like Mars attacks don't run we are your friends you guys cue it up I mean
[42:20.040 --> 42:29.240]  this might as well be the the White House's announcement and it works people
[42:29.240 --> 42:32.960]  in the movie put their hands up when they say don't run we're friends and they
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.600]  see the aliens shoot people and they disintegrate and they still put their
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.640]  hands up and you know that's actually how it works I could walk up with a
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.080]  hatchet and go don't block this because I'm not gonna hit you in the head with
[42:44.080 --> 42:47.820]  it and just hatch at you in the head again it's like that scene and save it
[42:47.820 --> 42:51.960]  probing Ryan we need to find that scene where he's beaten the German soldier
[42:51.960 --> 42:55.800]  they're rolling around with daggers with bayonets and that's actually really
[42:55.800 --> 43:00.360]  happened in war and he goes let's be friends and he gives up for a minute he
[43:00.360 --> 43:04.600]  gets the initiative and drives that knife right into him and and you know we
[43:04.600 --> 43:08.440]  have all their battle plans if we sit here and believe these deceitful liars
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.360]  we get what we deserve the point I'm getting at here is this such a big idea
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.360]  and it's so simple but at the same time I can't even say it it's so incredible
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.560]  they are treacherous enemies taking over for corporate interests that want to
[43:21.560 --> 43:25.240]  monopolize and control the economy and make us poor to control us they've
[43:25.240 --> 43:28.320]  taken the guns they're lying to the public saying they don't want to take
[43:28.320 --> 43:32.240]  them I know you know their plan is to take them but you've got to get this
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.880]  info out to everyone and say listen do you understand the government's arming
[43:37.880 --> 43:40.640]  to the teeth and corporate interest are while they want to disarm the general
[43:40.640 --> 43:45.360]  public do you understand that actual gun crimes dropping because gun ownership
[43:45.360 --> 43:48.800]  is increasing you understand the gun culture is actually seen as sexy and
[43:48.800 --> 43:52.800]  cool and all the liberals are buying guns look women in bikinis with guns
[43:52.800 --> 43:56.920]  could save the planet you make guns a sex symbol again which is starting to
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.080]  happen it's over it's over folks that's why we have a big center fold of a
[44:02.080 --> 44:06.340]  bunch of fast cars American Eagles and in Leanne McAdoo with you with 50
[44:06.340 --> 44:11.680]  caliber rifles in the new February issue because that's how we're going to
[44:11.680 --> 44:17.480]  win is with our own symbols of what's good and wholesome and strong versus the
[44:17.480 --> 44:25.720]  horrible broke back globalist weak dependent welfare crime-ridden Chicago
[44:25.720 --> 44:31.080]  New York big-city crime boss cesspits okay we have to get on the offensive and
[44:31.080 --> 44:36.840]  say listen you little dirty stinking grimer warm tongue speaking in our ear

[44:47.720 --> 44:54.320]  your loudspeakers your Tokyo Rose saying lay down GI you're like Baghdad Bob
[44:54.320 --> 44:57.560]  saying we've kicked the Americas completely out of Iraq they're not even
[44:57.560 --> 45:02.760]  in the country as bombers fly over and explosions two miles away we're kicking
[45:02.760 --> 45:06.320]  your butt so go ahead and nuke cities and blame them on a liberty movement go

[45:33.440 --> 45:37.960]  again and now as you suck the resources out to make us poor it's gonna have the
[45:37.960 --> 45:41.840]  opposite effect because we're gonna tell everybody who did it do you understand
[45:41.840 --> 45:48.920]  that scum do you understand me so again here is the giant news ladies and

[48:53.240 --> 48:57.240]  much good if we just realize that they've taken over the churches they've
[48:57.240 --> 49:00.660]  taken over the culture they have literally poisoned the society so
[49:00.660 --> 49:04.760]  Crohn's like Hillary Clinton punch up drugs report calm look at that ugly
[49:04.760 --> 49:11.360]  evil I mean ugly spiritually ugly evil witch and realize is that maggot meant
[49:11.360 --> 49:20.120]  to dominate us are we meant to be her slave no excuse me the point is ladies
[49:20.120 --> 49:28.600]  and gentlemen is that I am so excited about this because if you realize we
[49:28.600 --> 49:33.160]  have them sneaking around in secret meetings with the plan to register the
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.080]  guns to confiscate them to violate the civil rights of all Americans this is
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.400]  civil right like not letting black people vote or not you know all the rest
[49:41.400 --> 49:44.840]  of it is they want to steal your right to defend yourself they literally want
[49:44.840 --> 49:50.040]  you domesticated they want to dehorn you declaw you this is what they think
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.520]  and you've got to realize it and take it personal I mean I cannot believe
[49:55.520 --> 49:59.120]  Daniels wrote an article about this on Friday and no other big gun publications
[49:59.120 --> 50:04.000]  no one picked it up I mean it's in the city's newspaper
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.160]  Mayor John C. Tezinski I'm pronouncing that right I want to get him on how you
[50:11.160 --> 50:18.360]  pronounce that TK AZ Tike Zeke said he quit the group Tosiek after he quit the
[50:18.360 --> 50:22.120]  group after realizing it was simply a vehicle for Michael Bloomberg to promote
[50:22.120 --> 50:26.160]  his personal gun control agenda he goes it didn't take long to realize in the
[50:26.160 --> 50:32.440]  meetings that their plan was to not stop felons from getting illegal guns he
[50:32.440 --> 50:37.880]  goes under the guise of helping mayors facing a crime and drug epidemic the
[50:37.880 --> 50:40.640]  group is intended to promote confiscation of guns from law abiding
[50:40.640 --> 50:43.080]  citizens and he goes on to admit that's what they talked about in the
[50:43.080 --> 50:46.840]  meetings and then we've got the mayor pro team of Austin who's part of it
[50:46.840 --> 50:51.760]  saying that's the plan but he loves it he loves it because he has an instinctive
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.560]  evil I need to dominate people better than him smarter than him so he can feed

[54:54.320 --> 54:58.760]  people trying to get our guns and the Republicans won't even get vicious they
[54:58.760 --> 55:03.920]  argue back and forth about now we are for sensible gun control but you know
[55:03.920 --> 55:07.720]  this provision goes too far it should be look you've taken guns everywhere you've
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.280]  ever been stop acting like you don't want to take them shut up here's Morgan
[55:11.280 --> 55:16.200]  redcoat trash go back to England with your crime rate 10 times higher than ours
[55:16.200 --> 55:19.920]  when it comes to mugging, stabbings, and killings oh yeah there's almost no gun
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.080]  crime because all the guns are confiscated and the thugs run around
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.560]  raping and killing whoever they want the facts are in England has the highest
[55:28.560 --> 55:31.920]  crime rate in Western Europe Switzerland has the lowest in the world
[55:31.920 --> 55:37.320]  because Switzerland everyone is packing full auto which isn't really that good
[55:37.320 --> 55:41.360]  I don't like full auto the point is they can select fire down to single or three
[55:41.360 --> 55:49.280]  bars the point is is that it's just such a fraud and Adon Salazar's got a big
[55:49.280 --> 55:54.920]  article coming out shouldn't have been yelling earlier or growling actually
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.880]  Don Salazar's got an article coming out 50 mayors have exited because they were
[55:59.880 --> 56:03.400]  in these meetings with Bloomberg since this broke he's now found mainstream news
[56:03.400 --> 56:07.000]  buried or 50 mayors have exited the group saying they don't want to confiscate
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.680]  guns it's happening it's happening so so the implosions happening but if the
[56:10.680 --> 56:14.320]  tree falls and nobody's there to hear it didn't make a sound you've got to get
[56:14.320 --> 56:17.120]  the articles that are going to come out and the articles that have already come
[56:17.120 --> 56:21.680]  out and my basic video that's up on info wars calm and you've got to get it out

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.440]  alex jones
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:42.200]  it is Monday already the 10th day of February 2014 we have a guest popping
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.000]  in for like 10 minutes at the bottom of the hour with a really important
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  initiative to expose the legal NSA spying grid and more than a national
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.400]  campaign to try to get attention on that kind like we did last week where the
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.880]  food babe launcher program here to get the plastic out of the subway bread a
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.960]  bunch of other fast food chains have as well but if she would attack them all
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.920]  it would have just been absorbed by focusing on one like a laser beam now
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.320]  the others are all scurrying and Schumer wants to act like he's a hero now
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.840]  that he knows the waves going that way so New York senator saying he wants to do
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.880]  something about that and try to get it banned like it is everywhere else see
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.920]  that's how it works that's how it works ladies and gentlemen we can do the same
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:29.080]  thing on the NSA all of it there's also an idea out there that Snowden must be a
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.640]  government operative and this is being done to kind of roll out the idea the
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:40.040]  NSA not the way this is going not the way this is happening I just don't buy
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.680]  into it and the Russians would have picked up on that it's like Lee Harvey
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.000]  Oswald who they basically kicked out of Russia and who came back I just don't
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.880]  think he's a Lee Harvey Oswald but I'm tempted to get somebody like Steve
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.000]  Pachanikon who's been calling us and saying he wants to come on to say all
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.240]  that you know I just all that does is create I mean I just don't buy it my
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.440]  gut does not buy it and it he could be being used by somebody and they're gonna
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.720]  try to spin whatever he does in that direction but there is major intelligence
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.960]  community shifting going on Pachanikon says like what they saw before 9-11
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.200]  oh undoubtedly they're gonna need a big catalyzing event they're saying in all
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.960]  over the news that barring a big catastrophic global event they're not
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.840]  gonna get their new world order through they can't pose as saviors they need
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:31.240]  destabilization a wrecked world so they can play God and savior while feeding
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.840]  on everyone so that is all coming up
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.760]  NSA secret role in assassination program comes out and now US News and World
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.680]  Report lights out for NSA Maryland lawmakers pushed to cut water electricity
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:57.680]  the spy agency and we're going to be covering all of that actually coming up
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.240]  after the break that's gonna be my top story because that ties in top story in
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:09.520]  this hour to New Hampshire House passes Bill nullifying NDAA's indefinite
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.480]  detention New Mexico's moving to do that a whole bunch of states and again it's
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.920]  the moral high ground authority that we have we can beat these people and then
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.360]  we expose all the private corporations they're doing the same thing Google
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:28.400]  Microsoft Apple all of them are in a race to steal as much data to build it
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.280]  in but then we just demand software and programs and create a whole new market
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.520]  that can get America and the world going again in delinking and countering all
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.520]  this and then they'll come back when new systems to spy which just creates a new
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.400]  market to counter them so instead of an arms race it's a privacy race that's
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.800]  how economies work folks that's how you create new economies you have to
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.360]  innovate and have goals and something to push back against to be able to build
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.640]  into the future and the enemy wants to end building and competition to
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.960]  stagnate control and end the Renaissance we're looking at a 500 year war against
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.000]  the Renaissance right now toe-to-toe with the flower of the Renaissance 1776
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.200]  July 4th literally dealing death blows to the 1984 monster I mean this is two
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.960]  different spirits two different ideas two different systems in conflict but we
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.200]  can use the enemy's push against us in a judo move to actually energize that we
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.920]  need their attacks to make us strong this is the animating contest of liberty
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.960]  this is the secret it's a secret to everything is that giving in laying down
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.640]  is the death of your soul folks you need to choose you need to decide which side
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.880]  you're on will your metal go through the fire or will it boil away and be thrown

[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:35.440]  to wake people up why does music like that resonate with 14 year olds because
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.040]  they're young they're fully energy remember when you were a child you wanted
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.880]  to run around all day and it wasn't work it was fun and you'd all get hot and
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.280]  sweaty and just get all those endorphins and go crazy and just play war all day
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.720]  in the woods or go walking down the street some kids start a fight with you
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.080]  you know whatever the whole point is is that it's about having fun it's about
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:06.640]  being alive it's about being wild I got the boys to make a noise feel the
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.200]  crack you know that that right there is he's saying I got the boys to make a
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.480]  noise we got the team you guys are the boys you like it you like being on the
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:27.920]  ship in full wars going in going in hard on the enemy 110% baby all right let's
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.480]  get serious I tell you I think the metal health really drove me mad shooting
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:38.080]  those 50s last night and then the 308 223s long colts I just love it it was
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.600]  and it was so fun to just be sitting there with the long colts you know
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.400]  hitting bullseye at 300 yards because you could like shoot way high above it and
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.840]  it would be hitting was so fun to be shooting those 50s hmm I think I actually
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.600]  get high though off the 50 caliber guns smoke you know you're not supposed to
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.360]  breathe for a couple seconds after because when you're aiming you don't
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.720]  breathe already you tend to suck in when you shoot but the military you know
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.360]  teaches folks that you don't want to breathe for three seconds after and I'll
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.640]  tell you why one time I pulled the trigger and then looked when I breathe
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:19.600]  it out and I've got this old B-52 ammo that shoots super hot out of the rifle
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:25.200]  and it's armor piercing and scenery we weren't shooting that last night that'll
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.520]  really you know though they've done studies that it releases the same
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.840]  hormone shooting high caliber weapons that other things like high level
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:41.320]  exercise and well intercourse does I'm not kidding and and and so it is a very
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:48.560]  serious stress reliever to I love hand firing the 50 cows I was doing that
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.720]  again last night 10 rounds just cross a lake just boom boom boom and then
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.360]  watching the tracers hit the water and then skip you only do it when you're on
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.840]  a giant ranch and just like photon torpedoes disappearing out into the
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.760]  woods beyond you know I'm actually here to cover news today ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.760]  and I apologize but I've been jogging and swimming for years and now I finally
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.240]  got back into weightlifting and I've been doing legs and full body stuff and I'm
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.040]  getting into heavier weight and it boosts testosterone naturally and on top of
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:26.040]  the the the supplements for him for his life I mean I am crazed so I apologize
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.920]  for that now without further ado ladies and gentlemen on this day before my

[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:41.160]  down I mean that's not even big enough muscles to show off there that that was
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.400]  the Austin Chronicle saying make a muscle because I don't know how the
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.280]  Austin Chronicle got like the one muscle picture of me I was at a gym like
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.800]  when I was 22 and they said oh man where I'm a trainer up here and we have a wall
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.000]  of people I train and I don't train you take your shirt off we take a picture
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.840]  and then that ended up years later getting the Chronicle back when I was
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.740]  in shape Google Alex Jones muscles if you want to see when I look like Bruce
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.840]  Lee on steroids without the steroids that's when I was in shape pull that

[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.800]  good mood right now because we're gonna take the fact that Bloomberg got caught
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.640]  in secret meetings with all these mayors secretly saying the plan is to
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:34.640]  bankrupt the gun industry buy up buy up whoever we basically can't get and what
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.800]  was the rest of it it was also go in and take over the different states through
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.640]  the cities which is backwards is unconstitutional and then ban guns after
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:50.320]  we register them that right there just causes me total endorphin rushes because
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.240]  they've been caught so much saying that's not the plan I'm gonna break that
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.440]  down on a concise report in the next segment ahead of all the other news but
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:01.840]  now without further ado let me give you the news more good news New Hampshire
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:08.360]  House passes bill nullifying NDAA's indefinite detention on February 6th
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.800]  the New Hampshire State House of Representatives approved a bill that
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.440]  would protect citizens from being indefinitely detained by the federal
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.840]  government as permitted by the National Defense Authorization Act and then I've
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.920]  got another one dealing with the NSA lights out for NSA Maryland lawmakers
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.640]  pushed to cut water electricity spy agency headquarters because they are
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.720]  committing felonies every time they take down without a warrant I mean they're
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.080]  turning on your cameras and your phones it's all on record folks it's ridiculous
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.540]  and they just hope you're ignorant and don't research that morning Mexico's
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:43.720]  following suit a bunch of other states simply amazing and they say oh we need
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:50.200]  this to stop another 9-11 that is not the facts here folks we have the whistle
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.520]  blowers to Bill Edmonds and others who were at the NSA and the FBI who heard
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.520]  all the chatter and the order of the stand-down then we have Colonel Shaffer
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.920]  Tony Shaffer and others who were on the other end being ordered to stand down and
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.760]  she can cooperate him being told to stand down to not kill bin Laden two weeks
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.680]  before and two days before 9-11 they had him absolutely could have killed him
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:25.080]  the U.S. Army and wasn't allowed to unbelievable so we've got that information
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:31.480]  continuing here now look at this type of a political correctness this is being
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.480]  reported by the University of San Francisco California school force to
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:44.080]  remove racist menu they said that turkey is offensive because it's associated
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.320]  with the pilgrims and with honkies a lunch menu that was part of a celebration
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.360]  of black history month was stereotypical of black southern culture that comes
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.280]  from the same place where the n-word comes from according University of San
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.200]  Francisco professor and again will turkey be seen as offensive during
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:08.160]  Thanksgiving well yes and ladies and gentlemen by the way give me southern
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.600]  cooking I don't think it's just the black people that like chicken fried
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.640]  steak and sweet potatoes and and collard greens that's just what people in the
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:22.120]  South feet and by the way in Austin all the liberals like Sandra Bullock and the
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.280]  rest of them they all own southern cooking places that are great I mean there's
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.800]  nothing racist about chicken fried steak and sweet potatoes folks and watermelon
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.040]  that this is just all complete bull okay I mean it is insane ladies and
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.360]  gentlemen my grandmother made excellent fried chicken and other new with black
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.920]  people and the fact that they had good taste for good food I mean I have just
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.280]  absolutely had enough of this ladies and gentlemen cream gravy and mashed
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:54.400]  potatoes is not racist it will make you have a heart attack though I will kill
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.520]  you eat too much of it the point is is that I have just about had enough I mean
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:05.840]  I like Cajun food and I make it fun of French people from from Canada I mean it
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:13.040]  just it literally while all the real abusive stuff is going on while all
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:20.680]  this stuff is happening they're getting us to obsess over an American flag
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:26.920]  upsetting people on Cinco de Mayo here's another one black residents reject
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.480]  Trader Joe's because it would attract too many white people that is in the
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:35.760]  Oregonian the Portland African-American leadership forum said that they do not
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:44.040]  want a white store in the area I mean this is the mind control ladies and
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.400]  gentlemen that is going on here and again that's all leftist ideology they
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.440]  actually want to keep everybody in their own little subgroup and then keep the
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.160]  guilt going and keep the economic wargaming going on they want everybody
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.960]  divided into groups they can control I know that's elementary now now here's
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.280]  the really big news that I haven't gotten to yet I will cover this at 45 after
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.200]  when this guest leaves us this guest that's popping in this is so huge I ran
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:15.280]  warship heading to Atlantic barely survived earlier tangle with US Navy
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:23.160]  that was in Operation Praying Manus the Iranian frigate Sahand burns after
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.960]  being attacked by US destroyer and a 6e intruder aircraft in the Persian Gulf
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:33.520]  April 18th 1988 but I'll just give you some background about Operation Praying
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.760]  Manus now let's go further here this is what's currently in the news Iran TV air
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.920]  simulated bombing of Tel Aviv US aircraft carrier showing the city blowing up
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.360]  not a very good idea to do that with a country that's got 800 nuclear weapons
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.280]  the highest technology let's continue here here's another one Jerusalem post
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.160]  Tehran sending messages warships approach US and I've gone and checked it
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:03.400]  it's in the Iranian press this is out of control provocations ladies and gentlemen
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:08.960]  I've done everything I can to try to stop a warb with the Iranian to try to
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:13.480]  stop the wrongful attack and backing of al Qaeda and the Wahhabist Sunnis in
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:19.120]  Syria and Assad is not been promoting war not been promoting attacks on Israel
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.600]  it's wrong to do what we're doing to him it's a war crime but Iran is really
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.800]  asking for it and I will break down why coming up at 45 after when this guest
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:37.240]  leaves this is popping in this is a big big big big big deal and then we're

[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:32.480]  huge breaking news up on info wars dot com right now ladies and gentlemen we
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:39.920]  have caught them mayor Bloomberg who heads up a national movement of mayors
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:45.320]  calling for force registration banning of gun shows ending private sales so that
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.040]  they can then confiscate the guns we've always known that they've admitted that
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.320]  in their literature but in an article that came out Friday and we have new
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.520]  articles coming out in a mere minutes a mayor has gone public it was in the
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.120]  meeting saying they talked about the real goal once they registered being
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:08.920]  confiscation since this broke Friday 50 mayors plus have announced they are
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.920]  leaving the group because of the gun confiscation plan Adon Salazar is
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:21.000]  literally 15 minutes away from having this go up with a red link this is so
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  huge because it proves their sneaky plan now let's go over some of the history
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.040]  of this if you're a new viewer or a new list because even if you're for gun
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.320]  control it's not about quote restricting mentally ill people or
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.960]  whatever I'm getting guns that's already done Adam Lanza got his illegally from
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.560]  Sandy Hook try to get him five times stolen from his mother it is about
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.800]  disarming the general public so a political criminal class can dominate
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:52.320]  us here is Feinstein saying the plan is get the votes for Mr. and Mrs. America
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.280]  turn your guns in if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:05.400]  States for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr. and Mrs. America
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.480]  turn them all in I would have done it and that's back when she thought she
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:12.560]  could have gotten the votes nowadays they go we don't want your guns
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.880]  Bloomberg says I'm pro-gun just the city I run they're totally banned except for
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.000]  people like me who have bodyguards and Michael Morris bodyguards now here's
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.720]  Mike Martinez who was mayor pro team speaking in Austin at a gun rally if
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.160]  you're a radio listener pointing for the guy that has a sign saying stop gun
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.120]  ban the guy says don't ban my guns he says hey we're not gonna do that now but
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.680]  after we're done with this registering that's what they were pushing you're
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.240]  gonna need that sign yeah he's busy he's in the meetings too but he likes it he
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.880]  likes the Treasury he likes the sneakiness he likes racketeering in my
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.960]  view to get government and corporations together to register guns to then ban
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:54.820]  them while lying to the public organizing secretly to violate God given
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.720]  civil rights and disarm people that's like trying to keep black people from
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.660]  voting folks I mean this is literally disarming people that this is taking our
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:05.320]  rights the right of self-defense the most important quite frankly other than
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.360]  free speech and we go crazy over free speech as well here's Mike Martinez
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  last year all right so now we have 50 mayors since this weekend as I was
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.200]  saying nothing's happening no one's covering it suddenly articles just came
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.360]  out separately that mayors are distancing of themselves it's begun one
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.800]  guy stood up now they're all standing up now it'll be hundreds of mayors
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.960]  thousands of mayors this how you win folks I can tell a chink in the armor
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:49.840]  when I see one smog is missing his whole breastplate right now you can just
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.840]  close your eyes shoot a black arrow he's going down but we got to collectively
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.440]  pull the arrow back you got to get these articles at info wars comm and get
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.800]  them out to people and make every gun magazine cover this and get on the
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.480]  offense oh it's kind of extreme to be pro-gun kind of extreme to say they have
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.480]  a plan to enslave us know it's not guns and ammo know it's not gun
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.120]  publications when you're hit with a hardcore attack you respond with how
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.280]  you're being attacked if somebody's mugging you don't say oh this neighbor
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.120]  is being rude to me no you're being mugged when they try to take your guns
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:24.680]  it's a criminal action respond to it get aggressive we can defeat them because

[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:43.120]  that points the most to the fact that our government isn't listening to the
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.480]  people and we are the government that's the sheriff in Erie County that's got

[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.680]  saying they're going to pull out that chemical or similar chemicals there's a
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.760]  whole family of them it was on CNN ten years ago the McDonald's nuggets have
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:03.440]  silicone in them our FDA says it's okay for melamine to be in baby formula they
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.000]  execute you for that in China I mean this is a big deal there's a reason we
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.360]  have the highest diabetes the highest cancer because we're a dumping ground
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:18.400]  for toxins now I bring that up because we have the NSA and the things that is
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:24.480]  going on with it and there is the day we fight back dot org which is non-partisan
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.000]  that's what I like trying to get left right center libertarians like
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:36.160]  ourselves together from across the political spectrum to say no and this
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.040]  is coming up in 10 hours and everybody's gonna put a banner on their website I
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:45.880]  put it some of our rotating banners for everybody to say no we don't want the
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.880]  NSA spying on us we're aware of what's happening you see states like Maryland
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:56.000]  moving to turn off the power to the NSA New Mexico Utah is looking at that what
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.320]  they're doing is illegal and they want to divide us on race religion culture
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.040]  liberal conservative on this issue the NSA it's the fourth amendment that's what
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.040]  always tell establishment leftists who really believe in gun control because
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:15.640]  they're ignorant is if they can take your second amendment they're going to take
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.960]  your first which they're doing so we stand up for everybody's first amendment
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.160]  everybody's second fourth fifth tenth that's what it's all about and so
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.200]  joining us is Nathan white Washington representative for demand progress and I
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.000]  appreciate you coming on tell us about the initiative you guys are launching
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.280]  now you've had some other initiatives that have been successful around the
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.320]  Bill of Rights and what people can do to help promote awareness well first of all
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.280]  thanks for having me on the show I really appreciate your attention to this
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.320]  important matter and appreciate you participating in February 11th the day
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.720]  we fight back against mass surveillance well tell us tell us about it yeah but
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:55.800]  so last summer we found out we had confirmation of what we've been hearing
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.640]  for a long time the government is buying on us it's a matter of fact the
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.720]  government is buying on it if you use a computer if you use a telephone if you
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:09.240]  use any sort of modern system of communication the government is buying
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.200]  on you that's a problem you just said it is a violation of the fourth and I would
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.160]  argue also the first amendment the United States Constitution when the
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.480]  government does that it's going too far and when it violates the Constitution
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.360]  that isn't a left-right issue the Constitution is the thing that holds the
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.960]  left and the right together trying to chill free speech exactly they're trying
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:33.240]  to chill free speech so it is an attack on free speech as well you're right so
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:38.200]  we've got together and we wanted to take a moment to bring everyone together to
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:43.000]  speak with one voice to say no this is not okay and this is got to stop and we
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.640]  chose February 11th is the day we fight back the websites the day we fight back
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:52.360]  or and we have a really broad coalition from everybody from Greenpeace and APLU
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.600]  all the way to the Libertarian Party and Campaign for Liberty and Freedom Works
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.440]  we've got corporations we've got websites we've got activists we've got
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.480]  thought leaders we've got everybody because everybody understands that this
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:10.480]  is a problem it cannot continue and it's up to us to take this moment to make
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:16.080]  sure it stops tell us about the initiative and how folks can promote it
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.280]  well the website is the day we fight back that work that's where you can get
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.960]  into the network and sign up to participate so far we have almost 5,500
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:29.080]  websites some huge some small willing to participate that they're going to host
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:33.520]  a banner saying today is the day we fight back and ask you to participate we
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:36.280]  already have tens of thousands of internet users who have signed on to
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:41.120]  participate and what that means is really open up to you we have a widget
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.440]  where you can put in your address and your zip code and it will tell you the
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.120]  phone number of your senator and your members of Congress so you can call and
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:52.600]  say no stop it I don't want this but if we're also encouraging people to go
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.800]  further the internet is such a dynamic interesting place because it's millions
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.600]  of people working together to do whatever the hell they want and this is
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.760]  that opportunity of you know you are the hero this is your story this is your
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.520]  internet this is your fight do what you think you know some people are going to
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.800]  have creative tweets we're asking people to put together memes post on the
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:17.120]  internet to do whatever they can whatever they feel comfortable with to do
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.400]  what they can and it's a very least we're also asking people to go ahead and
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.040]  call Congress because at the end of the day we are going to need Congress to do
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:28.920]  something absolutely you know to do anything is tough exactly and I love
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.960]  some of the groups on there some of them not so much doesn't matter it's about
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.720]  getting in the habit of working together it's about getting in the habit of
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.400]  agreeing on what we can agree with each other it's about getting in the habit of
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.600]  getting outside the left-right paradigm and and saying hey there's things that
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.560]  everybody agrees on the NSA over 90% are upset but that doesn't even matter it's
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:56.200]  illegal no free society does this the government Bush and now Obama have been
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.360]  caught lying about what's happening clapper committed perjury saying that
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.600]  they're not spying on us when it's on record what else don't we know how deep
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.400]  does it go and we need to have solidarity with all these states across the
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:14.040]  country that are moving to block this as well to literally culturally create a
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:20.440]  stigma around big brother type activities you know there are so many
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.920]  different reasons why this is wrong you just outlined some great reasons why we
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.720]  need to stand up for civil liberties but this is one of those interesting cases
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.920]  where doing what's right for business is also what's right for the common good
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:36.440]  right now one of the most innovative job creators we have is the Internet it
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.160]  allows the smallest corporation to compete against the biggest corporation
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:45.080]  it allows Netflix to be thrown blockbuster and it allows any sort of
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.200]  competition between the smallest in the larger but when we we shut that down and
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:56.000]  we don't have that open ability to communicate then we end that innovation
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.480]  we're seeing that most particularly in the future of cloud computing where we're
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.440]  seeing our overseas partners they're afraid to do business with American
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:07.240]  corporations because they don't want local Sam reading their email when the
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.520]  company says I'm losing tens of millions perhaps ultimately billions of
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.080]  dollars because our partners our friends in our allied countries even in
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.080]  Europe don't want to do business with us not only are we violating the civil
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.600]  liberties but we're also violating the business community and that brings
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.160]  another aspect into this and it's another ally between businesses the right the
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:33.080]  left the middle everybody who is aware of what's going on it is against it and
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.200]  we're asking people tomorrow February 11 to say this is the day we fight back this
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.560]  is the day where we're all going to speak with one voice so if you're listening
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.760]  check out the website today we fight back or see what you want to do see how you
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.880]  can participate but also sign up if call your members of Congress tomorrow also
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.240]  let your friends know you're participating if you're on Facebook
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.800]  change your images post status updates do whatever you can to let people know
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.720]  that this is not okay and we're gonna have to stop it you know the
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.040]  establishment is really scared right now Nathan and I know you've got your
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:08.200]  finger on the pulse as well so I want to get your take on this briefly but when I
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.960]  talked to members of Congress Democrats Republicans independence you name it
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.160]  they say no doubt the public's the most awake the most angry we've ever seen
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.600]  across the board nine percent approval rating now has gone to six percent for
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:25.480]  Congress that's why they're trying to up the partisan politics is to you know
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.560]  desperately make us think that we're not really together on most issues but
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.720]  this has got a really scary the establishment that we're forcing a
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.240]  conversion to take you know the different BPA out of the plastics we're
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:45.480]  forcing a conversion to organic food we're forcing just across the board when
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:52.640]  people get involved we have victories well you know I some of your listeners
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.160]  may not agree with this but I do still claim to be a Democrat but I recognize
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.360]  that in the two-party system you know the only winners and losers are the
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:05.280]  parties that we don't elect a core blue or color red to represent us we
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.360]  represent people to represent us and those people need to be more than
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.160]  ideologies they need to be more than just a machine that wants to get
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:16.400]  promoted within the party structure they need to be people that have our art
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.560]  interests at heart and they need to represent those interests and if they
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.600]  don't they've got to go whether they're left right red or blue they've got to go
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:27.360]  if they're not working for us but when you look at USA when you look at the
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.760]  surveillance there's a bill in Congress called the USA freedom act which
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.720]  actually on the house side has more than a hundred and fifty co-sponsors and the
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.160]  most interesting thing about it is it's bipartisan it isn't a Republican bill
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:43.320]  it isn't a Democrat bill it's that people who look at this realize it's
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:47.560]  illegal realize that people are against it they come together and that actually
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.920]  gives me a lot of hope that you know sometimes when the people are outraged
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.280]  when we get together when we fight back together left right brother and sister
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.640]  we can still make a difference and that's why I'm so passionate about making
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.520]  sure we do the best we can tomorrow absolutely it's very exciting Nathan
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.120]  White thank you so much for spending time with us and we'll get some updates
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:09.960]  in the aftermath all right well I really appreciate it and thanks for all you do
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:14.680]  you bet thank you the day we fight back down to ORG and folks expanding on that
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:17.560]  even if and then we're gonna send them an image they're gonna put our little
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:25.600]  logo up there as well here's the issue just like the Second Amendment we're
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.840]  pushing back against the establishment reaching out to the left the so-called
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:37.080]  Democrats I know in the last five years have been out buying guns there's a
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.480]  paradigm shift that's happening right now and that's why we reach out to these
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:45.680]  people is that there are people in the system in the left and the right who are
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.080]  not just automatons who do want freedom and the last thing the
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.240]  establishment wants is anybody working together they want Balkanization now we
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.040]  don't work together in compromising our freedoms with somebody where we give
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.800]  something up and then they give something up because they never really give
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.280]  anything up but when we can get people together around the Bill of Rights the
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.040]  Constitution organic food the Second Amendment the Fourth Amendment we do
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.800]  it but it's the same thing with guns the gun culture that the system dreads so
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.520]  much and I even met Nathan dreads by actually talking to Nathan and working
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.600]  with Nathan we'll end up getting him to come over to our side which is just the
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.600]  libertarian pro-human pro-common sense side and that's what's happening and let
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.120]  me tell you how you wake people up and win the Second Amendment war you take a
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:34.080]  socialist you take a progressive you take one of these people out you get them
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.440]  to shoot and it's over folks it's over they're gonna be running around in a
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.440]  John Deere cap and overalls before you know it I'm telling you liberals I've
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.200]  seen it in Austin they move it from California they are starting to go
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:50.960]  native they are starting to just worship country music real country music
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:56.600]  Hank Williams of Rockabilly you name it and I see our victory happening our
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.960]  culture of freedom is dominant is beautiful is good compared to the
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.560]  Hollywood culture of death and what the system is pushing and we're winning
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.480]  ladies and gentlemen we are winning and they've tried to paint all Americana as
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:16.920]  deliverance and there is some elements of that in there but we reject that there
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.720]  are the good elements of Americana the world has been a wasteland the cultures
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.560]  have just been really bad folks in in most periods in history and including
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.920]  Europe or Asia and the Renaissance culture is the very best that
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:37.400]  civilization east west you name it ever produced and is the flower of science
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:42.520]  and human empowerment and that's where we need to go that's what we need to do
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:48.800]  it's a very very serious situation so again I don't even think you can go get
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:51.960]  their banner we're gonna put it up just in solidarity to be nice on info wars
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:57.280]  tomorrow is one of the rotating banners but you everyone should make their own
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:03.840]  anti-nsa anti-police state banners their memes send them to info wars dot com
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.120]  and we'll take a bunch of the best ones that are sent to show tips info wars
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.360]  dot com send them by tonight we'll post a big page with them we'll send some of
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.240]  them out on Facebook out on Twitter I'm gonna tell my graphics department I want
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.320]  to basically go get all the good in essay graphics they're already out there

[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:44.160]  really of the day here other than the huge Bloomberg news caught in secret
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.240]  meetings pushing nationwide gunman after registration pretty devastating in the
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.960]  treachery and we've caught them in literal racketeering treacherous activities
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.200]  here's the bottom line in a nutshell the Iranians if you know the history in 53
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.960]  pro-america mohammed mozadek was set up with radical Muslims who were told they
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:05.040]  be given the country they blow up a bunch of mosques shot stuff up plain mozadek
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.920]  was behind them and use that to overthrow mozadek they executed most of the
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:15.640]  top military people then they brought in the little princeling the shaw dude you
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.840]  know his father had been in control previously as the king under a horrible
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.480]  tyranny and then he was very oppressive and evil until the late 70s he was then
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:31.240]  removed in 79 and out of France and NATO backing this is on record the iatola
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:36.760]  Humane Khomeini was flown in and then they staged that whole hostage deal and
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:40.720]  held them until the next Reagan came in I mean that's been declassified folks that
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.080]  was all stage that's why they were scared of Reagan they let him go the day he was
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.280]  elected yeah right so all of that went on I'm not even saying Reagan was
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:52.720]  involved in that they gave him tow missiles all these weapons the deal was
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:58.600]  Iran contra later now it doesn't mean they control or run the Iranians they
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:03.720]  they just let them get in there the Shiites and it's it's it's it's racially
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.520]  based off of the prophet and who can connect back to the prophet and it's
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:13.640]  one of the oldest forms of Islam and it's 20% of Islam it's arch enemies with
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:18.800]  the Wahhabiists that run Saudi Arabia and that's Sunni that's a minority the
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:23.440]  Wahhabiists of the majority group about 79% roughly the other 1%
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.240]  minority groups Alawites and others but that's really a Shiite group as well the
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.920]  point is 79% roughly are Sunni and so that's what this whole proxy war is
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:38.320]  about the west backing Saudi Arabia giving them Syria so that they can then
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:42.320]  take out Iran the problem is Syria has been very friendly pro-west lately not
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.360]  doing anything wrong and that they've got a big Christian minority being mass
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:51.520]  murder by Al Qaeda right now now inner Iran running videos on their news of
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:55.720]  blowing up Tel Aviv blowing up US aircraft carriers saying they'll attack
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:58:01.960]  sending aircraft of sending warships into this ocean on a course for the
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:07.000]  United States here's the Associated Press Iran says warships headed close to

[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.880]  maritime borders for the first time a senior Iranian naval commander said
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:18.800]  saying it's a counter to our ships being there we're barely gotten it where
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:22.960]  the Pentagon didn't attack Iran months ago and start World War 3 and they
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:27.320]  barely could control Obama and you got the Hawks the neocons pushing for war
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.560]  the Iranians are not crazy doing this they're in a deal with the neocons just
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.920]  like they were in the 80s to do this is a political provocation and we come back
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:44.880]  I'll break down with what I think's behind it stay with us this is GCN the

[01:58:54.760 --> 01:59:00.000]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the

[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:21.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:36.480]  alright folks we just joined us I'm breaking down Iran really turning up
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:41.600]  the rhetoric about blowing up Tel Aviv showing simulated videos of missile
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.720]  attacks on Tel Aviv showing simulated attacks on US aircraft carriers out in
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:52.680]  the gulf out in the Persian Gulf of the Strait of Hormuz I mean this is really
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:59.120]  war provocation and the you had the Iranian supreme military commander we
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.720]  just put me that again last week saying we have sleeper cells inside the US and
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:11.720]  have asymmetrical warfare which we know which we know and the globalist by the
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:16.240]  way would like to have a major war they would like to be able to nuke Iran so
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:21.120]  what is Iran doing at a higher level there's double-dealing the Navy wants
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.800]  to get its ships expanded and that funding is coming up in about a month
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:29.640]  but the debates going on right now here in the US Iran wants to be able to keep
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.680]  the fear going or the moolahs are 70 plus percent major studies you look them
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:41.080]  on unpopular Iran half their population is under 30 and it's accelerating they
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:46.240]  they they they want they want rock and roll in porno movies folks I mean let's
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:49.920]  just get down to the truth here and the point is they really don't like the
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:55.240]  moolahs okay so that's what's going on and I'm not even saying it's good to
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:59.760]  want Western culture but the point is that the the the moolahs are very
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:03.120]  unpopular so they want to have more war rhetoric they don't want the fighting to
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:08.320]  end the West doesn't want the fighting to end Israel is going to be able to use
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.360]  this as a political fodder but it's too dangerous folks that's why the joint
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.800]  chiefs would not you know told Obama a the military knows it's wrong me we
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.640]  don't like funding al-Qaeda everybody's going public we are not going to be part
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:25.920]  of an open-air war against Syria people know the Christians are being
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:33.360]  persecuted it's very evil to kick out a sod who's not doing anything and who's
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:38.720]  democratizing slowly but surely and then put al-Qaeda in I mean no we're going to
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:42.680]  totally lose our soft power here just from a corrupt point of view this is
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.720]  very discrediting and what happens when these al-Qaeda people get all those
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:49.200]  surface-to-air missiles they've gotten from Benghazi in other areas all the
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.880]  Israeli top generals on the record last week Jerusalem post saying they're
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:56.360]  going to attack Europe in the United States and Israel because they're not
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:02.040]  they're not they're not controlled by the West they're turned loose folks like
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:09.280]  letting King Kong go in a china shop or a bull loose in a china shop and that's
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:12.480]  what's going on and in the globalist the big bankers and the rest of them they
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:17.080]  sit back and manipulate and control the chaos because they run the system to the
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:21.760]  bigger the war the no bid contracts flow the bigger the war the more power they
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:24.960]  get the more right they can take meanwhile you're destroying competition
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:30.880]  destroying our society threatening World War three stop it you people are bad
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.800]  for business short-term midterm long-term eat just from a prospectus if I was a
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.680]  globalist I would not be acting like you people you people can't even run
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.880]  nuclear reactors properly they're leaking everywhere 91% of them you people
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:50.120]  I've become delusional you're lazy your control freaks your idiots you have old
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:54.520]  scores of subtle with Western culture you want to destroy the globalist have
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.400]  they have hated Western culture that has made them powerful for hundreds of
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.760]  years they hate the uppiness of it they hate the Renaissance they hate people
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:04.920]  being free they want to get rid of it because they always have to contend with
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.080]  it well I'm sorry you've got to contend with competition I'm sorry you've got to
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.120]  contend with innovation I'm sorry you've got to contend with that okay but you do
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.920]  have to contend with it and I would tell the establishment stop trying to blow
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.120]  the engine of progress you people will only bring yourselves down you cannot
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.320]  bring others down and then not end up having a comeback on you you cannot win
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:31.360]  at this scenario if you had wisdom instead of just smarts you would look
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:34.880]  ten steps down not three steps down you would see where this is leading and you
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:38.880]  would turn back now so Iran wants political divergence so does the West
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:43.720]  it's a huge provocation Iran don't miscalculate and think Israel won't just
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:47.880]  nuke you and there's of course it's so fashionable to hate Israel folks all
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.880]  these countries are run by the same top people come on stop being naive chumps
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.320]  out there these wars let bad people run all these countries that's what bad

[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:43.200]  drudge probably every day because you can't cover the news and not talk about
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.440]  Matt drudge and his great team over there that are like updating every two
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:51.400]  minutes now just stories I can't keep track of like a radio wonderland dream
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.080]  I've got like a hundreds out 200 articles here I should cover problem is
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:58.680]  I'll go into one of them and go off on a 10-hour jag and not give the phone
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:03.080]  number out and take your calls but getting back into the Clintons and
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:06.680]  Clinton running around raising money off poor black kids and keeping almost all
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:12.400]  of it for his fleet of jets and houses and Hillary all her crimes not just been
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:17.080]  gauzy and all the new stuff but all the things they did I was a talk show host
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:22.000]  from 95 when Clinton had only been in for two years right through 2000 we left
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.160]  office and I covered him six days a week just back then I did Saturdays and five
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:32.320]  days a week weekdays and then Saturdays so I was natural to go back six seven
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:35.080]  years ago to doing a Sunday show there he'd always done a weekend show that
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.880]  sometimes I did seven days a week because of other hosts wanted me to fill in I
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:41.480]  wanted to get on air I wanted to talk about the New World Order I wanted to
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.440]  warn people nobody was talking about this back then except places like drudge
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.400]  report because they would they would cover big brother and things that were
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.680]  coming you could kind of see the libertarian pro-freedom you know ideas
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.480]  even then on the drudge report and drudge report would link to a world net
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:00.280]  daily article that I was in and took photos for a second I was on the drudge
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:05.000]  report way back way back in the mid 90s like 97 98 when black helicopters would
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.160]  you know come in and blow up buildings they'd secretly leased to terrorize the
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:12.880]  public and have psychological warfare people they're gauging what Americans
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:16.600]  would do you know I was breaking stuff like that world net daily would pick it
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:20.760]  up my website didn't look professional enough you know even be linked to but
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:23.640]  but they would pick up my article in my photos a world net daily he'd link to
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:30.000]  that so that's the kind of stuff that Jay Leno talked about as well about black
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.920]  helicopters in our report because it was pretty darn interesting they were
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:37.400]  crashing in Houston blowing stuff up in Kingsville and tried to bribe the police
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:42.280]  chief and then took our video at gunpoint and that made the news I mean
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.960]  and the media would go look at this crazy guy in Texas he thinks black
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:51.040]  helicopters are after it except here's Jay Leno I can't do a good imitation
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:57.520]  except there's one thing that's funny it really did happen yeah but the issue is
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:02.240]  is that the Hillary papers to give you an example of what independent free press
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:08.800]  could do back in the mid 90s 95 96 when drugs was rising and before that when he
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:15.600]  had his online newsletter email no one was doing what he was doing which was
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:19.040]  just real newshound stuff that people were doing 50 years before a hundred
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.280]  years before before the hundreds of independent newspapers got bought up by
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:26.760]  the big four and he was just well this looks interesting this little piece of
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.520]  news that nobody's covering or this piece of news I got sent or this little
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:37.760]  local story he was decompartmentalizing because I mean 20 years ago folks if
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.400]  somebody in a town shot a burglar coming in their house the national news
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.440]  would never cover that or if an abortion doctor got arrested for being a
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:49.120]  Satanist and eating dead babies you know stories like that in the mid 90s that
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:53.240]  would never be a national story because they wouldn't cover it nationally so
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:58.240]  that's what I've been able to do after drudge did it but but soon after was
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:02.560]  cover news globally just whatever I thought was interesting whatever I
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:06.480]  thought exposed tyranny or promoted liberty I would just as a natural
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:12.600]  free will person with no agenda but freedom report how I saw things give
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:19.800]  my take on things and really just report the truth of what was going on no
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:26.120]  formal training and drudge I don't think has any formal training and that's why
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.200]  it was so much better was because the system is there to basically train you
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:34.920]  how to conform to their control paradigm that is a micromanaging system I
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.680]  would liken it to the new Lego movie that has an excellent message and I
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:43.040]  literally had three people when I walked out separately say I thought you made
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:47.120]  this movie I can't believe this I'm like no I didn't make this movie people that
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:50.800]  want freedom made this movie and got it out and now that all of Hollywood is
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.480]  rebelling at every level they're having trouble putting your message out plus
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:13:01.480]  all their anti-freedom movies don't make money now the revolutions on folks
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.660]  but side issue everywhere I look at stuff because I tracked the news that
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:10.800]  drudge made end up happening and there's other huge websites out there but
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:16.040]  they don't know how to make a story big because they don't know how to pick
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:20.320]  stories that are really big drudge knows when something's important that's why
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:26.080]  it becomes big because it deserves to be big guarantee the same reason drudge
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.760]  links to us all the time because the stories are not being reported by
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:33.240]  others and we're breaking it and we're credible we make occasional mistakes we
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:35.960]  own up to what we do but we're trying to tell the truth so we're on the drudge
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.280]  report routinely and then I'm just here reading out of the Washington Free
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:45.840]  Beacon this has come out of the archive of Hillary papers that no one else will
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:49.400]  report on at the Washington Beacon so now it's on drudge and now the media will
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:54.920]  be forced to cover it and it's so good to not be able to have them ignore us it's
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:58.560]  so good to not have these crooks be able to suppress us anymore and guess what
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:06.880]  it turns out that in May of 1992 Stan Greenberg and Salinda Lake top pollsters
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.120]  for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign issued a confidential memo the memo
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:17.640]  subject was research on holy Clinton and guess guess guess you they were worried
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.040]  about their conclusion was voters find slick and Bill Clinton they find
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:29.440]  ruthless and Hillary fast forward to the mid 90s they were circulating memos
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:33.640]  about Matt drudge saying do we take Matt drudge seriously six months later
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:37.800]  drudge would break the story of an affair between Clinton and 22 year old
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.280]  White House intern Monica Lewinsky setting in motion the events that would
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:45.800]  lead to the president's impeachment and then it goes into it up here it was the
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.720]  reports of him raping women which he settled these cases by the way you
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:57.520]  don't settle stuff you didn't do in almost every case sometimes people do
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.800]  but in Clinton's case it happened over and over and over and over again I
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:05.080]  remember all these this was in the Clinton Chronicles it was coming out
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:11.920]  about Tyson foods the payoffs cattle gate all of it and drudge would simply
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:17.360]  find these reports regionally post links to him or the newspaper didn't even
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:21.680]  have a site he would just write a blurb about what was in that local paper and
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:26.200]  then it I mean it totally shook up Clinton and almost shot down their
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:31.300]  disgusting dynasty and then it goes over in this report just all the horrible
[02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:36.560]  things they did in the Hillary papers to try to suppress the press and anybody
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:39.440]  that would dare challenge the Clinton East is and listen there's a lot of bad
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.040]  people in Washington but I mean the Clintons you know I'm sick of looking at
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:50.040]  them I'm tired of them they're disgusting I think it was CJ said that and I
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.440]  think he's right I he bets Bill Clinton dies that they kill him and claiming he
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:57.000]  had a heart attack or something when Hillary starts to run just because
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.760]  they're not gonna want him as a political diversion and the sympathy
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:04.000]  factor message to Bill Clinton you already look like a reanimated corpse
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.840]  walk around from all the drugs you've used and the 10,000 women you've had sex
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:12.080]  with God knows how many diseases you've got you rapist message to you I bet
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:16.640]  you're you better watch your six because they're gonna want that sympathy vote and
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:21.920]  I think I think you're right I think they'll try to kill Bill Clinton I really
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:25.680]  want to talk about that on air CJ turn your mic on because because we got a
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.720]  lot of CJ's we got Chris Jordan we got CJ we got it's like we'll call some
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:33.360]  people know around here it's just you know just because so we got so many we
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:37.840]  got three CJ's or something there's plenty of us there's plenty of us so why
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:42.240]  do you think that for the sympathy vote well I think she's the obvious candidate
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:46.400]  because it's what the media is building up and I think that's the easiest way to
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.000]  usher him in or usher her in is to get the sympathy vote that way it's
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.520]  plausible and machines do the voting anyhow that's right and but oh America
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:00.920]  and it's the first woman why are you against women Alex turn your guns in
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:05.000]  except by then Obamacare will be four times more expensive than the previous
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.240]  except four times over except turning your guns in except five-year-olds being
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:14.680]  taught to dress like girls and the girls like boys except for snoculations
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.560]  why do you hate women Alex why do you hate CJ why do you hate women to say
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:24.560]  something like that I mean she's a known lying criminal witch that sold out our
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.520]  missile secrets to China and undoubtedly was involved in murder events foster and
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:32.760]  covers up for the serial rapist Bill Clinton and they steal pension funds
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.280]  everywhere they're involved they're total criminals what just just support

[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:59.400]  demon I mean bow down to Michelle Obama I'm gonna right now all right about I
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.840]  think Michelle Obama is the sexiest coolest most powerful woman I've ever
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.360]  seen the only reason I said those things about our earliest because I'm
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:13.080]  jealous of her man even when I'm joking lying feels bad literally I just felt

[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.280]  tell the police everybody else are on power trips and I'm not saying all the
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:55.040]  police but the ones that have been trained that you're God you're gonna
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:00.720]  find out who God is and it's called reality if the civil war starts and 1%
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:10.040]  of the 170 million it's grown gun owners fights back that is 1.7 million
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:15.440]  combatants and most of them are former military who know they've been DU'd know
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:18.800]  they've been screwed over shot up and they're just they don't want let me
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:22.240]  well someone want to kill people and you know that and a lot of them don't want
[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:27.240]  to do it but once they start man I mean whoa I mean you idiots take somebody
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:30.360]  like me out of Ron Paul or sort of resting folks I mean you're gonna be
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:35.640]  dead and I and by the way listen to me I don't look forward to that I don't want
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:39.240]  you to die I want you to live old and I want you to have long days pleasant
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.520]  nights and live long and prosper but let me to Spock says let me tell you
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.320]  something this is the ultimate globalist plan and it is on the drawing board on
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:51.400]  record and I've confirmed this with top-level brass most of them have been
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:55.920]  purged but the point is that they do they think they can win a civil war and
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:59.680]  they've done the computer war games and they think they know that they're
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:05.600]  incredibly wrong they think they'll be a year to two war breakdown of a lot of
[02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:09.040]  essential services they're gonna harden the main cities are already doing that
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:13.440]  and then try to have a war against the rural areas and then poses savers and
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:16.800]  create a ratting out process kind of turning all of America to a giant
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:21.840]  reeducation camp and then they plan to release soft plagues to debilitate folks
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:26.520]  it's already going on it's gonna be bad I mean by the way they're gonna go for
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:30.280]  broke and the military and police that work with them will be given real
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:33.640]  inoculations that are going to protect you and your family from what's
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.360]  released but when they're telling you oh sorry the general public can't have it
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.940]  because it's not enough remember that's a soft kill during the civil war the
[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:46.120]  civil war will be accompanied with bio weapons I want you to understand that
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:52.520]  okay and it's just unbelievable and a lot of military and police are gonna go
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:57.760]  along with it just so they get the get the treatments it thought all this out
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:04.040]  I just and I'm even like talking about this on air and believe me the NSA is
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:07.760]  freaking out right now that I just said that on there let me continue by the
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:10.560]  grace of God am I still alive here and they're not ready something civil war
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:13.680]  yet now I've told the story a lot of times about deer hunt when I was a kid
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:19.000]  we see a good-sized buck come out chasing some dough and my dad would say
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.240]  you know what wait wait there's gonna be a bigger one if you want a trophy
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:25.560]  usually coming out in about a minute or two he'll let that young dumb one come
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:29.940]  out he's watching and then means to get your guns up get ready and then here
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:33.360]  would come a big buck running right out after the other one that's the same deal
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:37.000]  they don't want to take me down until they are ready to take the whole deal
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.080]  down here's how it will work said he gets nuked they say Liberty Movement does
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:51.520]  it I will be hit simultaneously or right before they do that you'll never even
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:54.480]  hear I've been taken out you just won't hear about me anymore it'll be
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.560]  simultaneous or right before they rolled a bunch of their fake terror networks
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:02.840]  right before 9-11 the day before September 10th into the 11th they were
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.520]  already rolling them up to keep their mouth shut that they knew it was really
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.160]  an inside job they were rolling up any witnesses the day before well it goes the
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:14.160]  same for resistance Ron Paul will either be cold shut up or you're dead they're
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:20.160]  not gonna trust him he'll have a stroke or a heart attack or the gas man you'll
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:26.440]  hear is blown up at his house I'll be dead they'll send in their best merc hit
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.440]  teams up front and they will kill people like Judge Napolitano you name it
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:34.560]  anybody they see as a leader anybody they think can resist and organize people
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:39.600]  then they're gonna roll out in phase 2 preachers and local leaders and authors
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:43.560]  and everybody they always had a score with they're gonna go after everybody
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:46.960]  they're gonna go into libertarian party and other groups and say look you get
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:50.400]  with the program and do what we say or you're gonna be arrested as well for
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:55.440]  connection to the new king of X city then the bio weapon it's like oh the
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.120]  illness it's you know it's spreading it's it'll kill a couple million probably in
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:01.560]  the first couple months the fear but don't worry we're trying to get the
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:08.720]  vaccine it's the people that didn't take the vaccine they caused this to the
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:12.920]  whooping cough to mutate something like that and and then that's why it's
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:16.880]  killing everyone this super pneumonia it's the fault of the non-vaccinators
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:21.400]  they're the reason Trishon seven is you know out or whatever and our
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:25.640]  scientists have proven it and then it's just gonna be hell on earth and I would
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:32.760]  guess because enough people know the game plan I I would say a third of the
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:37.880]  police in the US will be killed in the first year and I would say you'll have
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:41.240]  said it'll be like it'll be like World War two level you'll have hundreds of
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:44.480]  thousands US military will be wiped out which is great the globalists love that
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:48.640]  it'll be terrible for those of us that care about the military and then they'll
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:53.240]  bring in the stabilization force Canada Mexico first it starts on paper to help
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:59.160]  during the attack I mean thank God they were here to help and then the European
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:04.120]  trips are gonna pour in then the UN trips the whole nine yards I mean it is
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:08.480]  just gonna be Saudi Arabia and Pakistani whole world ganged up Chinese are
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:11.800]  gonna land in California troop carrying ships they've already been given the
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:15.920]  whole the whole Pacific they've already been given the entire Caribbean all
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.760]  pre-placed on record and we're gonna face a million Chikoms I just
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:26.240]  unbelievable how horrible it's gonna be and all of you see how you just got
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:31.520]  organic wargaming right there I mean and that's by the way that's the plan but
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:35.440]  first they want to wipe out the military police in the first year in the first
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:41.640]  wave and identify who won't play ball so go ahead play ball get your vaccine
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:46.400]  you're being watched the whole time you will be absorbed down the road it's
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:50.160]  gonna be hot cotton for you guys for a while though raping pillaging killing all
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.280]  you bad guys that work for the system you have a lot of fun except all the
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:58.080]  former special forces people are gonna be killing you 24-7 and that's another
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:02.520]  thing you've got to understand is the minute the minute the nuke detonates or
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:06.600]  you hear a bio weapons been released in New York and people are dying in like
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:10.320]  12 hours the minute you hear that and you it may be some false alarms you've
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:14.760]  got a bug out immediately no cell phone tracker communications you know that
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:19.000]  you've got to immediately pull out because when they wipe out people like
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:22.440]  myself they're then gonna wipe out former military leaders they're gonna
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:25.980]  wipe out special forces type commanders who they're afraid who they've been
[02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:29.480]  tracking that they know could lead a resistance so let me go over this for
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:33.640]  you they're gonna go after media leadership military leadership they're
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:36.400]  gonna have a congressional leadership they're gonna kill people in Congress
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:42.840]  they're gonna have to kill and arrest members of the media and it's gonna be
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:48.480]  bad and hey you know this is what's got to happen it's what's got to happen just
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:53.920]  know this we've got the jump on them big time because of all the human
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:57.320]  intelligence we've had for 50 years of the Patriots they wanted to try this
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:00.880]  stuff in the 70s the 80s the 90s they've tried it over and over again but I'm
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:04.480]  gonna hear to tell you it looks like they're getting ready to try it I'm
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:09.320]  this is this is the biggest attack formation we've ever seen and they are
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:13.120]  look like they're going live with this now all I'm telling you is just get
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:16.880]  ready and believe me you may think you've served the system your whole life
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:21.000]  they've already got your psychological profile they know you're not evil if
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:26.240]  you're not evil they're going to kill you do you understand that it's like oil
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:33.680]  and water folks it don't mix understand that so you want to be part of
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.560]  something really evil all you like evil you're gonna really get a big taste of
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:41.960]  it just like Germany did 20 million dead at the end of that little little
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:46.480]  escapade over five years I mean you want front row tickets to Armageddon you're
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:51.960]  gonna get them hardcore communist collectivist socialists run by foreign
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:57.640]  banks having their way they want pure power to line up and torture and kill
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:02.680]  whoever they want and they've got all their collaborators at every major city
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:08.600]  and I would just tell people this use your brain the police and military even
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:12.040]  of their brainwashed and even if they're firing on you you want to stay out of
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:16.600]  their way remember who collaborated politically economically culturally
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:25.480]  remember who collaborated who runs things who runs things that's that's the
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:30.120]  enemy now also that another sign you're gonna see top people fleeing the
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:32.920]  country right before this happens and they're already been doing it for a
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:35.760]  while because they're so jittery when they've been letting on these plans and
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:38.640]  by the way these mayors that are in meetings of Bloomberg they're going
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:46.480]  you're really registering to take them and they're all yes we are I was for I
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:50.120]  was for registering to actually try to stop crime you're going I'm not gonna
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:56.800]  be part of this 50 mayors just exited 50 mayors see folks I've told you I've
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:00.480]  held back information for years but now's the time for you to really start
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:03.600]  hearing what I think is really going on and unfortunately it is what's going on
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:08.520]  I'm not wrong this is not my opinion I have 95% of the data confirming
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:13.640]  everything I've said the puzzles almost put together here that's why I just get
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:17.440]  absolute chills every time I think about it next so wild on air because this for
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:20.560]  me is just like absolutely risking my life putting myself completely out there
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.000]  against this enemy and I study this enemy so much I know this enemy and and it
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.680]  just makes me sick to think about what they're gonna do to people once they
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:32.400]  get control and so I try to just get aggressive and angry instead of crying
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:37.040]  folks because my god this evil we're facing is just unbelievable there it is
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:43.720]  50 of Bloomberg's mayors bailed over gun confiscation agenda I would say
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:46.520]  that's a good headline but it's just so horrible there's no way to describe it
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:55.920]  properly 50 of Bloomberg's mayors quit that might be be but quit over gun
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:01.480]  confiscation plan that leaked what's the best headline
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:07.640]  now 50 of Bloomberg's mayors well they quit the group so we can say technically
[02:45:07.640 --> 02:45:12.040]  as long as you explain that 50 of Bloomberg's mayors quit after gun
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:16.040]  confiscation plan leaked that's the headline changes to that 50 of
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:19.960]  Bloomberg's mayors quit they quit his group put that in the subhead line or
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:23.600]  whatever New York Mayor warns that group promotes confiscation of guns and from
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:26.820]  law about existence that's an excellent subheadline the point is 50 of
[02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:31.260]  Bloomberg's mayors quit after gun confiscate after nationwide gun
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:35.000]  confiscation plans leaked you want a short headline but let me think of that
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:42.160]  how do you crystallize it Matt drudge was there you can tell me how to do it
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:50.880]  Joseph Farrell 50 because I mean how do you crystallize this evil 50 50 put the
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:56.480]  headline back up here 50 I see it there 50 thanks 50 of Bloomberg's mayors
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:00.640]  quit that's the group but it was already done the article 50 of Bloomberg's
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.960]  because that's what isn't there in his group so they quit 50 of Bloomberg's
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:09.680]  mayor's quit after gun confiscation plan leaked that's it after gun
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:14.320]  confiscation plan leaked and folks this is the new article with all the intel
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:21.160]  all the data David Knight's report on this last night all of it right now ready
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:28.600]  at info wars.com at info wars.com at info wars.com and it's been tweeted out at
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:33.160]  real Alex Jones retweeted immediately and we're gonna add to that some of the
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:37.000]  videos where they said they're gonna confiscate the guns and of course the
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.600]  mayor pro team in Austin saying oh the plan is to register and confiscate so
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:45.680]  that's that's key data of their deception and their evil now here's the
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:51.560]  article this is out of WASZ news channel three mock disaster training exercise
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:59.400]  in Skotow County is that right socio and it goes on to say the Army National

[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:23.160]  who are disgruntled over the government's interpretation of the second
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:26.040]  amendment plot to use chemical biological radiological agents against
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:30.120]  members of the community that's right the gun owners see the headline on this
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:37.240]  should be military trains to fight gun owners or military runs Cyop to catch
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:41.800]  military cast gun owners his enemy see that's see see what we really need to do

[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:13.320]  are gonna attack the school right here WASZ and then even though the article
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.240]  that's breaking national news I'm not criticizing it is Ohio National Guard
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:23.320]  training and visions right wing terrorism no it doesn't the military is
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:29.040]  training in all in drills all over the country with police casting gun owners

[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:46.640]  it is now it isn't just some group or club they're in but a lot of people we
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:49.120]  didn't even think we're our friends or our friends now because they realize how
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:54.560]  serious this is we only stop this by being bold you're only gonna stop this by
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.840]  speaking out you're only gonna stop this by it's going on but we don't have time
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:01.560]  to screw around hey look around you folks wherever you're listening to this
