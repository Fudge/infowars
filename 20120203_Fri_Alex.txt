[03:13.720 --> 03:20.440]  book it was a black-covered book with white text on it and Aaron remembers the
[03:20.440 --> 03:25.120]  exact name it was something like how someone becomes a terrorist and in
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.600]  subtext how you catch them before they know they're one I mean they give these

[03:40.000 --> 03:44.240]  you take your shoes off your belt off you get a body scan and then most people
[03:44.240 --> 03:47.960]  I've seen body scanned so every time I fly I'll sit on the other side after
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.720]  one of the checkpoint and refuse the scan and I'll watch them and most people
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.800]  are groped and let me tell you if you see a woman who everybody's whistling at

[04:06.120 --> 04:13.760]  agreed to go through the microwave oven and then Dr. Paul said I know oh you
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.880]  said there's something on my leg no no I pulled up his pants and they said look
[04:17.880 --> 04:21.000]  we're gonna grab your your genitals and he said no you're not I'm gonna go back
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.560]  through the scanner and they said well you're not gonna leave here then they
[04:25.560 --> 04:28.800]  held him for an hour and a half and got caught lying and said he got irate but
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.800]  now they admit that they that that it alerted for a random search that happened
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.360]  last time I fly out of Austin I went through it wasn't the sound of metal it
[04:38.360 --> 04:42.920]  was like a beat he goes oh you've been chosen for a random grope and I said no

[08:39.720 --> 08:45.360]  the Sunday abbreviated transmission as well as there's so much news we don't
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.560]  take a long weekend around here I'll be live this Sunday okay we're to begin
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.400]  TSA trains Super Bowl hot dog sellers to spot terrorists and they're training
[08:57.400 --> 09:01.720]  school teachers to spot and they're training gun dealers and barber shops
[09:01.720 --> 09:08.320]  we've shown you the training manuals that barbers and auto mechanics and swap
[09:08.320 --> 09:15.040]  meat organizers are given by the FBI and they say if someone's wearing jeans or
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.880]  has a cell phone or has a camera oh that's the big one if someone has a
[09:20.880 --> 09:26.880]  camera or if the police pull you over and you have a snorkel and mask heaven
[09:26.880 --> 09:30.520]  forbid that means you must want to blow up a dam because that happens so often
[09:30.520 --> 09:36.040]  because there's so many terrorists of course if they attack Iran Iran might
[09:36.040 --> 09:40.440]  actually fight back in and that's some of the headlines today the Defense
[09:40.440 --> 09:44.240]  Secretary is quoted in the Washington Post and their publications is saying
[09:44.240 --> 09:48.120]  Israel is set to attack according to the Secretary of Defense I don't know this
[09:48.120 --> 09:55.240]  is true I ran in April and Iran has been told not to defend themselves or it is
[09:55.240 --> 09:58.920]  going to be the greatest evil the most outrageous thing ever seen and if I ran
[09:58.920 --> 10:06.240]  as much as lifts an arm to block those bunker busting missiles coming in it
[10:06.240 --> 10:10.040]  will be called the biggest outrage on earth will be hyperventilating on the
[10:10.040 --> 10:14.960]  news screaming pulling out of hair oh my god I ran actually defending themselves
[10:14.960 --> 10:17.880]  because everybody knows I'm not being sarcastic here this is actually being
[10:17.880 --> 10:21.120]  said a couple months ago they were beating people in an occupy event and
[10:21.120 --> 10:28.160]  the cops charged the people with resisting for balling up so so now
[10:28.160 --> 10:34.200]  balling up is resisting and I guess if I ran I guess if a giant missile was
[10:34.200 --> 10:37.600]  coming and you balled up they'd be on the news and say when they knew the
[10:37.600 --> 10:46.200]  missile was coming they balled up oh my kill them all glass parking lot them but
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.320]  and by the way that five-year-old was was running in the playground arrest them
[10:52.320 --> 10:57.600]  over that's associated press it's an insane sick society that we now live
[10:57.600 --> 11:04.440]  in so we have that report TSA trains super bowl hot dog sellers the spot
[11:04.440 --> 11:10.640]  terrorist viper search team should be out in force before Sunday's game the
[11:10.640 --> 11:17.400]  TSA has trained the gropers that'll be groping you and your wife and children

[11:23.160 --> 11:30.280]  gonna be breaking all of that down also we're going to continue with our cover
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.200]  to latest developments on fast and furious where the mafia government has
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.360]  been caught perjuring themselves before Congress where they have been in
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.760]  contempt and where they will not release any of the documents now some of the
[11:43.760 --> 11:49.800]  documents have been leaked to CBS news and others and and yes it was a plan to
[11:49.800 --> 11:57.200]  blame the second amendment a plan to blame the second amendment and if you're
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.160]  a new listener just just type into the search engine documents reveal ATF wanted
[12:02.160 --> 12:05.640]  to blame fast and furious on second amendment and it was a plan to try to
[12:05.640 --> 12:11.480]  take your liberties and destabilize Mexico but also fund and arm certain drug
[12:11.480 --> 12:15.600]  cartels like Sinaloa that were waging war against other cartels that were not
[12:15.600 --> 12:19.840]  laundering their money through the proper US banks which Bloomberg also
[12:19.840 --> 12:28.400]  reports in just the last two years laundered 300 and 76 billion dollars
[12:28.400 --> 12:32.680]  just Wachovia and Wells Fargo alone you know Wells Fargo the good little guy
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.440]  the good little guy Warren Buffett who's shut down the big oil pipeline coming
[12:38.440 --> 12:42.680]  to the US from Canada so his trains can carry it to the west coast of Canada to
[12:42.680 --> 12:47.680]  China again Bloomberg and AP reported the nice little man that says raised
[12:47.680 --> 12:53.160]  taxes on the rich he means middle class so he can be given it and bank or bail
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.440]  out money as he has been because he became this big billionaire because he's
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.400]  such a loving person and he gives the money to Planned Parenthood who's under
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.040]  criminal investigation of course and who's gets taxpayer money in Travis
[13:08.040 --> 13:12.160]  County where I live to pay for the abortions and who sucks all this
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.560]  government money and who on record is a eugenics outfit even if you're for
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.560]  abortion understand Margaret Sanger Planned Parenthood got awards from
[13:21.560 --> 13:26.880]  Adolf Hitler and they gave him awards and they said we were established to
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.480]  kill black people because they're subhuman and of course there were according
[13:32.480 --> 13:35.400]  to Planned Parenthood there are of course with the big scandal three years ago
[13:35.400 --> 13:38.440]  where grants were given to Planned Parenthood and they accepted to make
[13:38.440 --> 13:42.400]  sure it went to abort black babies they're like I just want this money in
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.040]  the tape conversations to go to getting the black babies and they're like oh we
[13:46.040 --> 13:54.800]  understand oh yes you can pull those up because again real real fascist
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.760]  eugenicist don't run up in a Nazi uniform and say Seig Heil that's usually
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.240]  some federal operative you're trying to pass some hate law they've been caught
[14:03.240 --> 14:06.520]  dressing up like Nazis for media consumption the feds have been caught
[14:06.520 --> 14:12.520]  and others have on record just type in Nazi rally in Orlando run by feds
[14:12.520 --> 14:18.360]  Nazi rally in New York run by feds Nazi rally in Houston run by feds Nazi
[14:18.360 --> 14:22.600]  rally in Salt Lake run by fed I mean you'll get Orlando sent an old Salt Lake
[14:22.600 --> 14:28.760]  city tribune look it up the real Nazis have got long hair and sandals and they
[14:28.760 --> 14:32.080]  mix him with the regular hippies and people that are actually against races
[14:32.080 --> 14:40.480]  and they're like women choice trendy they've got that NPR voice they've
[14:40.480 --> 14:50.480]  learned how to get the job done in fact later I'm gonna get to this stack of
[14:50.480 --> 14:55.960]  news and I have some audio clips putting it all in all in perspective but the
[14:55.960 --> 15:02.600]  Daily Caller reports after cutting ties with Planned Parenthood the Coman
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.000]  donations up 100% which basically means they doubled and they cut it saying we're
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.600]  only concerned with breast cancer and there's too much controversy with Planned
[15:10.600 --> 15:13.840]  Parenthood and they're under criminal investigation so we're not gonna fund
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.600]  them now I thought I'd give you some background we have a video clip later on
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.440]  this Pelosi girl scouts relationship with Planned Parenthood very valuable
[15:23.440 --> 15:27.880]  yeah they teach women it's their right and sacrament to not have a man in the
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.560]  house and to have abortions and again even if you love your abortion and
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.080]  think it's a special goodie you have the the the point is this is all about
[15:37.080 --> 15:42.640]  eugenics and then of course I have another clip that we'll get to later if
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.000]  we have or you can just type in Pelosi and population control and you can find
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.160]  her one of the interviews on Meet the Press another was with what CNS news but
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.640]  here's a quote contraception will reduce cost to the states and to the federal
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.720]  government and she goes on population reduction is needed to balance the
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.720]  budget remember that three years ago now let me just give you a background here
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.960]  we've shown you actuaries gone over the numbers that even insurance companies
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.880]  have put out this is no secret that the baby boomers they're gonna be less
[16:16.880 --> 16:23.720]  people born to baby boomers baby boomers on average one male one female baby
[16:23.720 --> 16:31.400]  boomer on average together both of them together replicate 1.3 in the United
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.360]  States same number in Canada even lower in Europe the only reason our
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.840]  population has gone up is the immigrant influx 50 plus million in the last 40
[16:40.840 --> 16:46.840]  years or so okay we'd be like Russia with an imploding population in their
[16:46.840 --> 16:53.400]  wasn't a giant immigrant flood okay so the Pat Buchanan wrote a book on a death
[16:53.400 --> 16:59.200]  the West it's a mathematical fact Japan's got 1.2 Italy's got 1.2 so for
[16:59.200 --> 17:03.440]  two people they have on average 1.2 and then I get idiotic emails every time
[17:03.440 --> 17:08.560]  going how does a person have point to it's an averages averages don't build
[17:08.560 --> 17:13.880]  strong men to deny what I'm saying people out there on average baby boomers
[17:13.880 --> 17:22.040]  from 1946 on the baby boomer generation people born from the late 40s up until
[17:22.040 --> 17:26.520]  about 1960 or so the baby boomer generation people coming home from war
[17:26.520 --> 17:31.400]  coming home from death every culture has a boom after a big war it's genetic
[17:31.400 --> 17:34.960]  survival mechanism that's what the globalists are up against by the way
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.440]  they're trying to turn off our survival mechanisms survival instincts with
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.400]  eugenics teaches to hate ourselves through fake environmentalism look
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.680]  humans aren't in are in control of themselves to a certain level but not to
[17:46.680 --> 17:52.080]  an at base levels of survival and procreation you're gonna be defeated in
[17:52.080 --> 17:55.480]  new world order you're no no amount of hormones in the food and water are gonna
[17:55.480 --> 18:02.480]  turn that off but side issue baby boomers populations explode okay now
[18:02.480 --> 18:10.480]  they have on average 1.3 children lower in some areas of Europe and Japan as I
[18:10.480 --> 18:16.720]  just mentioned they can't now pay for the old people or take care of them so
[18:16.720 --> 18:21.360]  what happens what did the globalists say they do in the 40s they saw this
[18:21.360 --> 18:25.640]  beforehand they said we'll teach people to euthanize first it'll be your right
[18:25.640 --> 18:30.520]  to euthanize and kill yourself and I don't really know who can disagree with
[18:30.520 --> 18:33.240]  that I'm not for it I'm not saying it's moral or it's good but you're an
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.440]  incredible pain you're sick of it whatever nobody can stop you but see
[18:37.440 --> 18:41.560]  the state wants to be involved to turn you off and then make their decision and
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.560]  that's now going on and I've documented with Wall Street Journal writer
[18:46.560 --> 18:51.840]  Wesley Smith and others over the years thousands of people on record who were
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.640]  paralyzed neck down begging to live but because the state was their ward they're
[18:57.640 --> 19:03.440]  dehydrated but you but that's never the poster person that the media chooses to
[19:03.440 --> 19:08.240]  sell this they'll choose a terry shy of the media will because you could debate
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.160]  whether she's brain dead or not but terry winlan others he could he could walk
[19:13.160 --> 19:20.640]  he could bowl he he was in his butt but his he was brain damaged and the state
[19:20.640 --> 19:25.760]  had him and they chained his butt down and killed him dead or in a hammer I
[19:25.760 --> 19:31.280]  mean look up these names look up these people they're every time I cover this
[19:31.280 --> 19:34.400]  and open the phones up I can open the phones up for two hours with nurses
[19:34.400 --> 19:38.000]  calling saying right now in our hospital there's people chained down being
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.320]  dehydrated they're murdering people all over the world right now okay so all
[19:43.320 --> 19:45.800]  you yuppies that don't want to have kids don't want to get married think you're
[19:45.800 --> 19:49.320]  having fun right now when well they're already announcing you're not gonna get

[24:25.000 --> 24:32.560]  alright getting back into Nancy Pelosi and her statements about we got to have
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.600]  more abortion we got a reduced population it'll save money that's a
[24:37.600 --> 24:45.160]  predatory implosion economy that's a cannibalistic economy that's a win-lose
[24:45.160 --> 24:52.520]  economy on a win-win and the fact that the West is dying and doesn't have
[24:52.520 --> 25:00.520]  enough people to take care of their parents to pay into the social security
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.080]  system that's the reason not only because the bankers have stolen all the
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.800]  money to begin with but that's the reason you're being euthanized is because
[25:09.800 --> 25:12.400]  your money that you've put in your pensions is to be stolen through
[25:12.400 --> 25:18.800]  inflation through taxes and through outright seizure I mean they announced
[25:18.800 --> 25:21.760]  last week they're writing what's left of the federal pension funds and putting
[25:21.760 --> 25:27.560]  IOUs in it the money's gone and when you do get it it's gonna be an inflated
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.320]  garbage it's not gonna be worth one-tenth of what it was supposed to be but
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.280]  they'll do it over a decade so most people don't notice it people don't
[25:37.280 --> 25:44.440]  notice creeping death creeping corruption they notice a frontal assault I've
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.960]  told the story of you know personally in my life and seeing in other people's
[25:48.960 --> 25:55.800]  lives people will get violently angry if you walk across their yard or if your
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.240]  dog goes to the bathroom in their yard we had neighbors when we moved because of
[26:00.240 --> 26:03.720]  it would come over and say your cat's going to the bathroom in our yard and
[26:03.720 --> 26:08.640]  we'd say we don't have a cat and the old woman said I know about you and your
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.280]  TV show I know your cat's doing it and I knew right then she was a mentally ill
[26:12.280 --> 26:16.760]  servant of evil and I could have you know so we don't have a cat shut up but I
[26:16.760 --> 26:20.120]  could tell she was gonna start making stuff up and really getting evil I know
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.120]  when to hold them know when to fold them because other stuff she was saying so I
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.880]  just looked at her and I said where is it anytime it happens I'll clean it up
[26:28.880 --> 26:32.440]  and went over in her little piles under some bushes with it some cat was
[26:32.440 --> 26:36.000]  burying its and my wife said that's crazy and I said look put the house up
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.080]  the cell right now they don't want us here they're gonna make stuff up well
[26:39.080 --> 26:41.600]  let's let's go you know let's stand up against them let's sue them let's and
[26:41.600 --> 26:46.720]  I'm like no no let's just move can you imagine being this kind of person
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.360]  let's just get out of here I don't want to be close to it and now I'm out in the
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.880]  country and you know I got a neighbor firing machine guns every day and
[26:55.880 --> 26:58.880]  sometimes I hear him ricocheting around and stuff but that's the price of
[26:58.880 --> 27:02.320]  freedom because I can't live so far out in the middle you know that there's
[27:02.320 --> 27:09.680]  nobody around me I don't have the money to buy some ponderosa but quite
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.560]  frankly is the sound of freedom it sounds like the neighbor has a artillery
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.720]  simulator is going off some days though but then I found out they're filming a
[27:19.720 --> 27:24.640]  reality TV show next door so I guess that's what's going on the point is is
[27:24.640 --> 27:33.160]  that I'm digressing off in the stories as I always do but look at this story
[27:33.160 --> 27:39.520]  Holder no cover-up in fast and furious no effort to hide details of the
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.240]  operation and Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky and
[27:44.240 --> 27:50.720]  read my lips no new taxes and there are WMD's and anthrax and Iraq and all the
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.560]  rest of it Fox News is reporting at her new general Eric Holder vigorously
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.120]  denied a cover-up by the Justice Department he's been caught perjuring
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.400]  himself by the way operation fast furious telling a house panel investigating
[28:04.400 --> 28:08.000]  the botched it's wasn't botched was designed to ship guns into blame the
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.480]  Second Amendment gun running program that he was had nothing to hide and
[28:13.480 --> 28:18.120]  Justin the probe is a political effort to embarrass the administration but see
[28:18.120 --> 28:22.000]  the globalists have news core in England with all their hacking and spying
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.080]  criminality so Fox News dare not go for the juggler on Obama after all the
[28:27.080 --> 28:30.080]  Rupert Murdoch gave money to Hillary Clinton and Obama it's all just part of
[28:30.080 --> 28:34.360]  a stage left-right deal there's no attempt of any kind of cover-up Holder
[28:34.360 --> 28:38.320]  told lawmakers well into the hearing about whether he had been forced right
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.400]  in responding to request of the House oversight and government relations
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.880]  committee for now a year led by Chairman Darrell is a Republican California
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.800]  we're not going to be hiding behind any kind of privileges or anything he said
[28:50.800 --> 28:54.160]  yeah they're not claiming executive privilege they're just saying we're not
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.200]  we can't find all these documents folks I've been telling the controlled
[28:59.200 --> 29:04.440]  prostitute media for over a year down they were having press conferences in
[29:04.440 --> 29:12.240]  2009 and 2010 this broke in early 2011 about guns and
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.200]  Mexico from the US and that's why they wanted to ban semi-autos and assault
[29:16.200 --> 29:20.280]  rifles and how many guns you could sell they were already doing fake stings at
[29:20.280 --> 29:24.520]  the Austin gun show with illegals with fake IDs with private sellers and
[29:24.520 --> 29:27.920]  sitting in the jail we told you this was happening before it was on the news
[29:27.920 --> 29:33.760]  because of our intel and there were press conferences with Holder talking
[29:33.760 --> 29:39.080]  about the program but not saying that they were the ones shipping the guns so
[29:39.080 --> 29:45.800]  so they've been caught lying so has mr. Napolitano I mean mr. madam Napolitano
[29:45.800 --> 29:53.480]  miss madam mr. we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[36:53.600 --> 36:57.080]  the US government on record we broke that with eyewitnesses a month and a
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.520]  half before it was admitted in Congress the Times Square bomber was protected by
[37:02.520 --> 37:05.600]  the government Major Hassan was protected by the government looked this up
[37:05.600 --> 37:09.800]  they've declared national security the Fort Hood shooter the shoe bomber was
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.040]  protected by the government this is SWAT guy MI 6 ran with patsy's they set up
[37:15.040 --> 37:18.560]  as part of a drill the 7-7 London bombings that's come out Fox News London
[37:18.560 --> 37:23.520]  Telegraph BBC years after I told you it's all in my film terror storm history
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.440]  government sponsored terror the Al Qaeda has been given Libya Al Qaeda has been
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.440]  given control now of areas of Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood they're now
[37:32.440 --> 37:39.760]  using Al Qaeda in the LA Times admits it against Assad and the Syrians in a
[37:39.760 --> 37:44.200]  major Western proxy war to overthrow that and now Hillary saying invade they're
[37:44.200 --> 37:50.040]  using them against Iran and the point is is that Al Qaeda was created by the New
[37:50.040 --> 37:54.600]  World Order they were used against the Serbs to take over Kosovo they were used
[37:54.600 --> 37:58.000]  against the Russians and Brzezinski's written two books so big to Brzezinski
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.040]  bragging about it and I've shown you the quotes and so it's obnoxious when a cop
[38:04.040 --> 38:07.480]  pulls me over and says you got any drugs or anything in the car I'm like no I
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.720]  don't have the products publicly brought in and admitted in six different
[38:11.720 --> 38:17.560]  congressional commissions by the US government and it's the same thing when
[38:17.560 --> 38:23.800]  some power tripping control freak wants to rub all over my chest and and grab my
[38:23.800 --> 38:32.480]  genitals at the airport because Al Qaeda it's baloney it's a hoax and I can't
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.560]  take it anymore I mean that's why when they're like go to the body scanner no
[38:37.560 --> 38:40.840]  there's radiation no there's not I'm like you guys have been caught lying
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.880]  Johns Hopkins didn't say these don't have radiation Congress is trying to pass
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.720]  a law to make you follow radiation rules right now don't sit there because they
[38:49.720 --> 38:53.680]  lied to you and lie to me I'm not bad because I don't want to get in your
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.560]  microwave oven and I'm not bad but I don't want you touching all over me the
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.960]  airline pilots refuse they would get mad they get in fights they throw up other
[39:04.960 --> 39:07.960]  TSA workers they'd make fun of each other's genitals so they got in fist
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.640]  fights they're they they're robbing people who do you think people that are
[39:12.640 --> 39:17.720]  desperate for a job or people that are it want to get into a control freak
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.640]  operation and they always when you say no to them they call over the attack dog
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.920]  who comes over and gets off on bowing up on people all day for their tiny little
[39:25.920 --> 39:31.840]  shriveled egos let me tell you this gets to me this gets to me last night Ted
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.040]  Anderson flies in we meet him at a restaurant my wife and children and I
[39:37.040 --> 39:41.360]  we have dinner we drive out to my farmhouse my wife drives home in the
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.880]  car I ride over with Ted and the rent car he's in and Ted goes yeah in
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.360]  Minneapolis they've got all the scanners you know turned off you know I fly every
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.200]  month as you know I fly a lot you know Ted was saying to me and they're turned
[39:53.200 --> 39:59.160]  off in Newark they're turned off in Minnesota but he goes everybody was
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.360]  being forced through him at Bergstrom in Austin he goes when I went through I
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.920]  stopped and watched and I said yeah I know I've heard that and you know why
[40:06.920 --> 40:10.760]  it's because state reps got angry and Dallas having their kids grow up we
[40:10.760 --> 40:14.960]  almost passed laws against it and they want us to know and reportedly they're
[40:14.960 --> 40:20.360]  trying to make people not even be able to fly and throwing you out when you
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.600]  say I don't want to be groped I mean they're there like you don't like it
[40:23.600 --> 40:29.720]  we're gonna force you they know Austin is the city council Commission the
[40:29.720 --> 40:33.160]  Transportation Commission said remove them they're dangerous we don't want it
[40:33.160 --> 40:39.720]  the Fed said you don't have jurisdiction in our jurisdiction so
[40:39.720 --> 40:47.240]  they know what's going on they know exactly what's going on and and and I'm
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.600]  gonna tell you poor TSA people something because I I know you're not all bad I
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.440]  have flown all over the country and about half the time they're listeners and
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.800]  I've had them say you know you don't want to go through that Alex everybody
[40:59.800 --> 41:02.800]  scan that one go through that one hey like what you're doing hey we're gonna
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.840]  get unionized I'm worried about the scanners and I have your autograph I
[41:06.840 --> 41:10.760]  understand I mean I had a bunch of people that quit as TSA agents come to our
[41:10.760 --> 41:14.040]  protest or our storming of the Texas Capitol we don't ask permission we just
[41:14.040 --> 41:18.920]  storm it I made national news and good job we almost got it passed you know
[41:18.920 --> 41:24.160]  that the law is enforced that you can't grow people a sworn bonded state
[41:24.160 --> 41:29.240]  police officer or police officer FBI agent who are actually sworn and bonded
[41:29.240 --> 41:35.720]  in the court and duly empowered in their limited powers cannot stick their hands
[41:35.720 --> 41:39.440]  down your pants unless there is an absolute emergency life-threatening
[41:39.440 --> 41:45.280]  thing all right I'm already digressing it's just totally lawless that's why
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.840]  they created a new agency and I mean it's federal law you've got to have a
[41:49.840 --> 41:53.720]  radiation officer and radiation monitors and badges are not extra
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.400]  equipment they just ignore that and now they've got seven-fold increases in
[41:59.400 --> 42:09.480]  cancer at Boston Logan where they first put them in nine years ago look it up
[42:09.480 --> 42:15.960]  and when the TSA agents complaining on healthcare and I want workers comp
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.000]  they're told it's a conspiracy theory and there's a bunch of lawsuits and then
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.120]  they quietly settle with them but most of them die so what does it matter and
[42:24.120 --> 42:28.080]  they're getting cataracts they're getting testicular cancer and they're
[42:28.080 --> 42:31.800]  getting breast cancer what do you what tissues you think it hits I mean look it
[42:31.800 --> 42:37.280]  up seven-fold increase I mean I always wonder how there's no radiation badges
[42:37.280 --> 42:41.400]  in the past when they sit there and run them through with only light shielding
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.640]  around the x-ray machine there's not a door closing there's x-ray stuff
[42:45.640 --> 42:51.000]  blasting out of there on everybody what about all this government obsession
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.680]  about wear mask on airplanes and and everybody's you know thermometer tested
[42:55.680 --> 43:00.640]  and face scan for heat when the flu's there but they have everyone at the
[43:00.640 --> 43:03.920]  most busy airports in the world people coming from third-world nations with a
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.680]  Bola and every other disease and bubonic plague and and and and and rotovirus and
[43:09.680 --> 43:16.440]  all of this and they have you take your shoes off and walk through it I never
[43:16.440 --> 43:23.200]  had athletes foot since I quit swimming in Dallas and playing football I had
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.240]  athletes foot constantly when I played sports no matter if I had my parents
[43:27.240 --> 43:32.200]  bought me new shoes every six months my dad said put desinex on wear socks you
[43:32.200 --> 43:37.240]  know I mean I'll change socks repeatedly I had athletes foot all the time as an
[43:37.240 --> 43:42.280]  athlete until I learned to leave my shoes on at the gym when I was you know
[43:42.280 --> 43:47.640]  got out of high school and go home and take a shower never had athletes foot
[43:47.640 --> 43:53.120]  again until the last eight nine years with the take on the shoes off and every
[43:53.120 --> 43:57.600]  time I walk through now I have to go get my bag and I pull it right up and
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.200]  every time I forget I get athletes foot I got to get a fresh pair out take those
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.800]  socks throw them in the trash because they've got every mutation and variant of
[44:05.800 --> 44:10.160]  fungus you can imagine especially in LA they got stuff to eat your feet there
[44:10.160 --> 44:13.520]  I mean I've got athletes foot going through LA I don't know what it is by
[44:13.520 --> 44:18.560]  the time you get home four hours later your feet are bright red skin peeling
[44:18.560 --> 44:24.920]  stuff coming up on it so I learned I walk through I take my socks off I throw
[44:24.920 --> 44:30.720]  them in the trash I put fresh socks on loaded with desinex I mean literally it's
[44:30.720 --> 44:34.680]  a biohazard when I'm leaving now to fly somewhere I have to get ready for
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.560]  humiliation I have to get in there in the bathroom my wife hate how it smells I
[44:38.560 --> 44:43.200]  get the desinex out and I get the pair of socks I'm gonna be using after I go
[44:43.200 --> 44:47.520]  through and I go and put it in there and get it all ready an anti-fungal and
[44:47.520 --> 44:51.520]  have those socks and I have to go through the thing they admit they don't
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.600]  change their stinking gloves until the shift changes I watch them going in
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.720]  pants going in waistbands I mean just these disgusting looking slobs that I
[45:02.720 --> 45:06.600]  see them going in their pants and rubbing all over and they come over
[45:06.600 --> 45:10.800]  these gloves I'm like we're gonna search you now and I'm like don't touch my
[45:10.800 --> 45:15.720]  genitals or I'm gonna sue you and take and change gloves if you wish well you
[45:15.720 --> 45:19.680]  want gloves to touch me punk why do I have to have everybody else you've
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.560]  touched on me and only let him do it once because I wanted to get out of
[45:25.560 --> 45:30.960]  there and he didn't touch my genitals but he was rubbing on my chest I've only
[45:30.960 --> 45:33.960]  had the doctors maybe four times in my life when I've had checkups I don't go
[45:33.960 --> 45:37.880]  to the doctor touch on me and let me tell you I didn't like it ladies and
[45:37.880 --> 45:43.000]  gentlemen I didn't like it one bit and he was obviously enjoying it you'd have
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.800]  to enjoy to want it talking to me and I'm just I gotta go right here and I'm
[45:49.800 --> 45:55.800]  just like oh my god I mean this this is a joke this is a joke and I got angry
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.880]  last night we get out of the car I'm taking Ted in the house you show him

[46:12.560 --> 46:17.840]  wondering why I was getting so angry and why I was blowing up at everybody when
[46:17.840 --> 46:24.200]  I normally not like that and he goes it's the TSA it's the TSA because it's
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.000]  weird as a man to have laughing people who all know who you are with Ventura
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.520]  when I've flown with him rubbing on his genitals right in front of me and he's
[46:32.520 --> 46:38.160]  just going this is East Germany I can't stand it and they're going I mean this

[48:01.120 --> 48:04.880]  it was in an area where there was only two escapes on highways and if cops shut
[48:04.880 --> 48:08.080]  the highways down whatever run up to checkpoints searching all the cars
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.840]  that's once a year that's a specific thing you don't that's probable cause
[48:12.840 --> 48:17.960]  that's an emergency situation you don't shut the whole world down and say to go
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.160]  to a ball game even high school games or anywhere they're now groping people at
[48:22.160 --> 48:25.080]  UT football games I had family go to all those who want to take the kids to
[48:25.080 --> 48:29.320]  UT game it's fun I like football I like UT my grandpa went there and played for

[48:44.680 --> 48:55.160]  not gonna happen not gonna happen oh I got all this other news I mean the head
[48:55.160 --> 49:02.080]  of the Justice Department is telling us like we're morons that oh I didn't lie
[49:02.080 --> 49:05.640]  we're not hiding anything and they're like we'll release all the info oh we
[49:05.640 --> 49:10.880]  can't find it they're caught lying they're caught lying but the Republicans

[55:12.040 --> 55:20.440]  got a lot of other news here obviously that we need to go over as well speaking
[55:20.440 --> 55:31.080]  of serious danger to our society the US seeks to play down Panetta's Afghan
[55:31.080 --> 55:37.920]  comments when he said that they'll be pulled out by mid 2013 they always say
[55:37.920 --> 55:40.600]  they're gonna be pulled out in a year and a half two years that's standard
[55:40.600 --> 55:46.400]  stalling they want that 500 billion in opium money continuing is Israel
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.160]  pairing to attack Iran Washington Post and now Defense Secretary Leon Panetta
[55:51.160 --> 55:56.360]  has a lot on his mind these days from cutting the defense budget to managing
[55:56.360 --> 56:01.520]  the down the drawdown of US forces in Afghanistan but his biggest worry is the
[56:01.520 --> 56:05.240]  growing possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran and then it goes on to say
[56:05.240 --> 56:10.400]  Panetta believes the likelihood is strong that Israel will attack Iran in
[56:10.400 --> 56:17.080]  April, May or June and now they're saying that Iran may attack the United
[56:17.080 --> 56:22.000]  States and Israel first and they could attack on their own or something could
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.680]  be staged and blamed on them and I read to you the Brookings Institute and
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.760]  others putting out big white papers saying it'd be great to have a
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.600]  provocation and we know Gulf of Tonkin was staged a lot of other events were
[56:33.600 --> 56:37.280]  staged and we know that big CFR member Gary Hart wrote a letter to
[56:37.280 --> 56:41.600]  Ahmed Denizide five years ago saying we will stage terror attacks and blame them
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.720]  on you see better do what you're told just type in Gary Hart lettered
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.280]  Ahmed Denizide Denizade and in fact type that in folks it's Huffington Post is
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.120]  where he publicly published it open letter to him so that's how dumb they
[56:55.120 --> 56:59.800]  think we are Russia threatens to veto UN Syria draft they're talking about
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.520]  actually having peacekeeping forces invade how like they did in Libya to
[57:04.520 --> 57:09.520]  back up al-Qaeda taking over the country I'm not a fan of Assad but you're gonna
[57:09.520 --> 57:16.280]  replace them with al-Qaeda oh boy I tell you they just think we're idiots I mean
[57:16.280 --> 57:19.120]  they can't even get their script right we've got to give our rights up because
[57:19.120 --> 57:24.440]  of al-Qaeda but then al-Qaeda works for the globalist Kurt Nemo's got an
[57:24.440 --> 57:28.920]  article in infowars.com Iran defiant threatens retaliation over oil
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.080]  sanctions and says they were gonna shut down the Strait of Hormuz the
[57:33.080 --> 57:37.280]  sanctions on the contracts are going to start hitting in the next two months
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.840]  because contracts are always about three four months out and they and of
[57:41.840 --> 57:45.880]  course they had a month ago here's another headline US uses the platoon
[57:45.880 --> 57:50.480]  uranium makes graveyards in Afghanistan just incredible burnt effects and
[57:50.480 --> 57:54.120]  problems going on there according to medical reports coming out our own

[57:57.080 --> 58:01.880]  but the government hates your guts so what do you expect we're all just trashed
[58:01.880 --> 58:06.360]  to the new world order here's another article by Paul Joseph Watson and it
[58:06.360 --> 58:10.640]  links to strat for another intelligence groups US warns Iran not to fight back
[58:10.640 --> 58:15.280]  against Israeli attack can you imagine outrageous it would be if Iran fought
[58:15.280 --> 58:20.760]  back that's terrorism that that's what cops now say if they punch you in the
[58:20.760 --> 58:26.680]  nose don't even raise your arm or it's assault goes on a US warship remains a
[58:26.680 --> 58:32.160]  Strait of Hormuz amidst simmering tensions and they've told irans or

[59:47.880 --> 59:57.200]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com waging war on corruption Alex Jones on
[59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.160]  the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:27.320]  Alex Jones you know what frustrates me so bad again about the TSA is it's an
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.440]  admitted federal takeover violates 9th to 10th amendment states rights 4th
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.200]  amendment against unreasonable search and seizure for a person's papers and
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.040]  effects are absolutely barred from being touched on doesn't matter they're just
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.600]  criminally involved in a total revolution against the spirit of America
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.800]  against basic freedom against the Magna Carta against everything dear and they
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.080]  know what they're doing and federally funded checkpoints all over the country
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.320]  federally funded blood draws without proper warrants then it's just rubber
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:07.640]  stamps and now TSA checkpoints on highways everywhere TSA has said on
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.360]  C-SPAN you're gonna have to go through them to get a job anywhere to have a
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.080]  driver's license to be hired as a police officer they are the federal
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.520]  goon force and tyrannies under Stalin and Hitler and under Mao always use kind
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:29.520]  of a minimum wage thug potbelly force because in every society old guard
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.080]  governments that were even oligarchical we're afraid of big powerful out of
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.080]  control internal militaries so they always created a spree decor and system
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.160]  even an ancient rum where the military wasn't allowed to be involved
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.160]  domestically because the ruling elite knew they'd be overthrown by it and so
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.440]  they teach checks and balances to the Praetorian class and that you don't
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.440]  violate these rights you don't do this you know you don't fight your own people
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  so they can't get rid quick enough of all those checks and balances in police
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.040]  and military though they have to a great extent but if they create a whole new
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.180]  force hire people that are control freaks that low IQs and tell them they're
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:14.640]  God well they'll do it Hitler and Stalin and Mao opened up the prisons hired
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.840]  thugs street thugs pedos and it's the same thing today who else do you think
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.600]  likes to grab you and your wife's genitals and oh we have a double drudge
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.400]  now let me see that this is fun because it's fun to be exposing the TSA and have
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.600]  the mega massive big sis taps hot dog sellers to hunt terrorists it's super
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.400]  bold and then under it red link let's click on that and again this is the
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.640]  biggest link you can get on the internet it's like the Super Bowl of

[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.560]  article I think drudge likes Paul Watson Paul Watson is a great writer I
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.920]  like him too okay it is just again it's like boom three-pointer boom three
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.240]  pointer battling the New World Order doesn't get any better than this because

[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:26.120]  revolution in Liberty about getting our health back not letting them ban our
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:32.080]  supplements I got into young Jebedy about a little over a year ago did a
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.080]  little bit of it got some response but wasn't committed so I didn't promote it
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.320]  a lot knew it was good but eh whatever then Aaron Dykes went on it and in six
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.360]  months lost 65 pounds my mother had incredible results so she can exercise a

[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.000]  gotten around to getting her to do that yet but the point is that wow I better
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.280]  really follow this because I know it's real that's why I was promoting it but
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:06.800]  I wasn't following it two months 37 pounds lost and and I'm gonna recap all
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.480]  this it's not even about weight loss now pharmacist Ben Fuchs mainline

[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.880]  government over assassination of US citizens ACLU demands information
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:39.360]  regarding a CIA kill list and drone strikes on Americans also climate
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.960]  depot read all about it Al Gore's melting Antarctic claims refuted by
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.720]  reality climate depots a to z all these top scientists are coming out and
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.960]  saying there's now starting to cool and that we actually want heating and the
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.600]  carbon dioxide is what we need on this earth and it's not evil so they have
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.000]  all this fake environmentalism to cover up the real problems that they're
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.840]  causing here's another one thousands wrongly labeled as criminals this is
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.400]  out of London Telegraph more than 20,000 people end up getting picked up or
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.040]  arrested because of computer mistakes I saw the same thing in the LA Times a
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.560]  month ago where it was tens of thousands in California and sometimes I was one of
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.680]  the cases said it took the guy almost two months to get out of jail and they
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.720]  just they had the name wrong he's like I have a criminal record here's my
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.400]  license and like well we your license is now under this criminals record very
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.520]  scary so that's just some of the news we're gonna get to on that front also
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.840]  new report shows illegal aliens are leaving Arizona yeah because the
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:41.720]  economy is falling apart also tritium leaking and 48 of 65 nuclear reactors
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:47.880]  across America reports US NRC that's the Nuclear Regulatory Commission now
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:55.560]  this is a question I keep asking why suddenly in Illinois Nebraska California
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.800]  New York two places in Canada all over Europe I showed you the articles
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.400]  yesterday radiation levels just skyrocketing not just from Fukushima
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:09.320]  reactors suddenly they're belching radiation they're having power outages
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:15.080]  what is going on now I I heard about the cover this in third hour some with Bob
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.280]  Chapman I heard about this for years but that's ridiculous but the scientists
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.720]  were saying this some of going to a cycle and that these space particles
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.440]  different types of them can actually cause problems not just in the power
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.280]  generators but but but in the nuclear reaction somehow since then I've done
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.240]  some research on it and it turns out that that may be one of the reasons that
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.080]  suddenly you're seeing all these problems and there's a big article from
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.800]  when technology fails by Matthew Stein I want to get him on and it says 400
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.480]  Chernobyl's solar flares EMP and nuclear Armageddon and it goes through
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.440]  reactors where they admit have already had blow-ups and problems and all the
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:59.920]  scientific papers London Guardian I this is just I've got to do a whole hour on
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.520]  this sometime how the hell this is already going on this is already going
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.440]  on and here's another one concerns grow over volcanic eruptions USA today so
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.200]  they used to think volcanoes blew up every million years or something but
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.880]  look all the civilizations they got destroyed by them they used to think
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.240]  big giant meteorites hit every million years now they're saying it's every 10
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.560]  thousand or so you know that so so a big article in USA today about that I'll
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.320]  cover some of that in the third hour you don't want to miss that more on
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.960]  penata saying Israel is going to strike Iran and all the fireworks are going to
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.640]  come out of that I mean talk about a roll the dice regardless of which side
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.760]  you're on or if you're just anti-war and don't want to see this happen
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.520]  Pakistan's got a hundred nukes that could flip them over I mean this is cuckoo
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:52.800]  anyway you slice it we've got all of that but I'm also about solutions here and
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.560]  and there's a lot of solutions people are waking up over 90% of Americans hate
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.240]  the TSA and believe it's unconstitutional in major polls I saw just
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.280]  last week alternative media is the new mainstream media to the mainstream
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.240]  media is teaming up the old mainstream media with the government openly
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.920]  calling for censorship that's only waking people up faster the government's
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.720]  passing laws saying we'll secretly arrest you that's waking people up even
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.720]  faster but for the next hour and a little bit into the next we're going to be
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.400]  joined by Ben Fuchs Dr. Corey Golds coming in later Ted Anderson and MZ
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.280]  if we can drag him in here because I was doing a lot of research and I knew
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.000]  that our soils were depleted and I knew that that's why people were go beast
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.880]  because they had to eat all these calories even if it was supposedly
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.320]  healthy vegetables just to get the trace elements and minerals because most of
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.400]  the fields are not just a devoid of the proper minerals and nutrients but they're
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.120]  using toxic fertilizers that manipulate the growth of the plants but but where
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.240]  they have no value and actually have a bio accumulated toxicity the honey bees
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.280]  are dying the wildlife that eats it yeah I mean it's it's a bad situation not
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.360]  just counting the GMO nature so I've gotten off most GMO I was drinking more
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.560]  water eating less jogging four or five days a week and I could lose about five
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.040]  pounds and that was it I couldn't detoxify and about a year ago or so
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.920]  Teddy Anderson got me in touch with one of our affiliate folks owns a few
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.960]  stations were on and said listen you know Ted had started it and he said I'm
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.760]  losing weight my knees were hurt and feel great you ought to really try this
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.880]  and so I knew it was good stuff I knew it made sense started promoting in about
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.240]  a year ago didn't really follow it though because I've never been a vitamin
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.680]  mineral guy and I've taken vitamins before him because I guess I didn't absorb
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.200]  him didn't do much Aaron Dykes here one of our writers and filling hosts and
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.040]  researchers he went on it and followed Ben Fuchs talks about farmers has been
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.840]  who's about to be here with us and he lost 65 pounds you've seen the
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:07.400]  transformative change in six months and has incredible energy it's just amazing
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:14.320]  so I finally about now I don't know eight weeks ago a little over two months
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.440]  ago said okay I'm gonna actually follow this I'm actually taking tangerine
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:25.000]  twice a day instead of doing toxic coffee I'm gonna do a pollen burst I'm
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.880]  gonna take a wayshake all the products are again or an info wars team calm
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.920]  because they've got the best all right there in one spot you can sign up and
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.320]  get a discount you know it's pay 10 bucks get a discount on the products or you
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.360]  just go there and buy them as most people do but it is a business
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.720]  opportunity but that for me that's a side issue it's the products and they
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:49.600]  really work now the only side effect is because things like taking tangerine
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.760]  doesn't have caffeine but I'm crazed the only problem is it's like I'm 22 again
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.840]  I'm or it's like old radio was 15 years ago where I'm yelling screaming more
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:08.680]  getting aggressive it the only side effect is is that I am crazed now and
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.600]  and and and and and the more I now I can jog eight miles instead of four miles now
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.960]  all of this is happening and I just think everybody should find out more
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.520]  about tangy tangerine and all other info wars team calm and your purchase also
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.960]  supports our alternative media operations and I invite our radio stations
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.560]  which a lot of them are doing to sign up at info wars team calm and all voice
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.480]  ads for you and everything and I think your stations to sell it I know MZ's
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.640]  got a model where he could beat all the big guys for you know decade 15 years
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.880]  with young Jevvie trying to put him out of business selling in Jevvie and
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.000]  that's why they came to me with this and said this will also help your stations
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.480]  so I'm really sold on it you've seen the change 37 pounds in two months
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.400]  Ben Fuchs joins us here Ben what is going on with Alex Jones I mean you're
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.000]  a pharmacist I should say by training go ahead right so many there's so many
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.080]  different ways we could take it but basically you've been anti-domesticated
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.200]  that's how I look at it see we're domesticated through our foods we're
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:09.360]  made dumb through our foods we're made weak through our foods we're made docile
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.160]  through our foods and what you're experiencing is changes in your
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.080]  biochemistry specifically it seems like around estrogen around insulin and
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.480]  around the male hormone testosterone testosterone gives you virility gives you
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:27.040]  strength it gives you power it gives you the get-up-and-go over time we become
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.520]  resistant to hormones specifically insulin that reduces our testosterone
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.600]  response and makes us makes us more passive makes us more docile and that's
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.240]  what it is my testosterone yes you've resensitized your body to testosterone
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.440]  through the hormone insulin and this is really the key by dropping your insulin
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.560]  you become more sensitized to testosterone we become insulin resistant
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.120]  we lose our anabolic our building edge so the key to anti-aging the key to
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.240]  wellness and the key to power and the key to vitality is re-sensitizing your
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.320]  body to insulin the hormone insulin and you do that by dropping your calories
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.520]  dropping your intake of refined carbohydrates upping your intake of
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.240]  micronutrients and upping your intake of protein and you're a living
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.800]  testimony to this and I also want to say one other thing people lose weight I
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.820]  was joking around before we went on air I said we should tally up the amount of
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.640]  pounds that everybody lost it would be it would be tonnage I mean you talk about
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.080]  Aaron lost 60 pounds I get letters from people are losing 70 pounds Ted lost
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.960]  25 pounds you lost 37 I think it's 35 yeah the point is is the weight will drop
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:30.080]  but we don't want to focus on the weight you don't even say we don't even sell
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.600]  this same weight loss no it's funny it's the ultimate weight loss it doesn't say
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.160]  it you're carving up your body to where it should be by giving yourself good
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.720]  nutrition you get more energy you think more clearly you have more get up and go
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.160]  and you lose weight let's say it's 8 o'clock at night I got the munchies I
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.960]  want to I don't go eat a ham sandwich I just have a tangy tangerine that's
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.320]  that's right exactly me a straw for that that's what you're having right now
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:59.000]  exactly to point is is that we become we developed these habits based on our
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.800]  our need for nutrition and we're getting the calories without the nutrients as
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.640]  we talked about before when we feel like snacking before bed it's not calories
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:12.280]  we want it's nutrients that we want but our only option is caloric intake so we
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.760]  have milk and cookies but why do I get craze when I drink tangy tangerine more
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.440]  than a pot of coffee you call craze I call it energized craze is just a
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.800]  negative spin on it you have more energy well no no but I am craze naturally so
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.480]  that might be the problem but but most of us just get more energy we just get
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.240]  up more get up and go don't you think that one of the most important people
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.320]  can have a health wish come true don't you think it would be more energy don't
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.080]  you think it'd be more get up and go I mean weight loss is important but to me
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.320]  it's the vitality it's the zest health is not the absence of disease health is
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.000]  feeling great about life imagine if we all felt powerful and great about life
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.480]  the disease the weight loss the the markers the blood markers like
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.840]  cholesterol and like blood sugar they would take care of themselves if we could
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.040]  take care of the zest part of the energy part of the vitality part the
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.520]  numbers would take care of themselves that's why I never talk about weight
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.520]  loss with beyond tangy tangerine I talk about feeling better and that's what
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.120]  happens now everybody who's lost weight they notice the weight loss but if you
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.800]  ask them they will also tell you they have more energy and they feel better
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.280]  and that's really what this is the difference in the other times when I
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.120]  force myself to lose like 20 pounds by hard dieting and exercise it's grueling
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.280]  and I'm my stomach hurts and I'm hungry right you shouldn't be that way it
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.800]  should be loving exercise I mean the human body craves exercise we secrete
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.560]  pleasure no I want to leave early now to go run again because we secrete
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.040]  pleasure hormones when we're exercising also I want to stomp people that's not
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.080]  good you just stop people and grab them stomp people stomp people no that's the
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.840]  testosterone thing you may you may need a little maybe we want to get you a

[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:23.320]  and more info at info wars team.com but Ted Anderson's stand at my house last
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.440]  night was on intending to even get him on air we were talking about young
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.480]  Jebedy and having a Tangy Tangerine or was it a polymer so the Tangy Tangerines
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.440]  was at night we go out to eat after before that and Ted said look at my
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.600]  cholesterol numbers because it was over 300 they were saying we got to put you
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:43.200]  on Lipitor you know it's admitted that stuff so bad for you that medical doctors
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.480]  on saying it literally eats your brain and Ted started only eating oatmeal and
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.480]  stuff couldn't really lower it and then he went on the young Jebedy products and
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.320]  came back a few months later it goes from 300 to what 160 something there it
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.840]  is Apple Valley Medical Clinic blood test all of it we'll do a document cam for
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:07.200]  viewers but Ted tell us about this well I mean as you can see I mean my triglycerides
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.960]  were at 368 my brother had bypass surgery three bypasses when he was 42 my dad
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.920]  has stints in them my grandfather died of heart disease heart attack it was
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:25.280]  after I think it was ninth one in the 1970s you walk into any medical clinic
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.320]  and have a physical and they find 368 on your triglycerides they're gonna put
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.520]  you on statin drugs now now there it is 300 something you go up now 164 yeah
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.760]  164 after I after I got off the oatmeal in the morning it started taking a
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:46.600]  protein shake by Ben's recommendation my cholesterol and also the the tangy
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:55.040]  tangerine and and essential fatty acids went from 368 to 164 in one year I
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.960]  mean you can't even hardly do that with their statin can you imagine if a drug
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.080]  did that can you imagine what they say if a drug did that with no side effects in
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.760]  those toxicity except you feel better that's the side yeah that's the thing
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.240]  I'm like they used to burn women whenever they knew how to use all the herbs and
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:12.160]  things and that was the old leech doctors it's always been the establishment
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:16.920]  medical system dot wants to give you lead mercury in fact they used to give
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.720]  Andrew Jackson mercury that is you know to get him up out of bed when he was
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.720]  really old because I guess a poison will make you actually get up for a while
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.840]  instead of hey why don't you just have nutrition that your body needs right
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.640]  exactly I mean I didn't know about this I mean personally I've been walking
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.480]  around with a bum knee for how many years they want to go in and do
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.920]  anthoscopic surgery to fix it and eventually talking about knee
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.080]  replacement I take beyond tangy tangerine within two months I'm walking
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.200]  without pain I mean a little bit of glucose jolly so that product to you
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.800]  find it right up on him for worse and by the way your dad it who has Alzheimer's
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.920]  you're able to get him on it and the doctor said no and I brought that up to
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.880]  Ben and then the Alzheimer's came back I brought it up to Ben you said the
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.760]  doctors say yeah no vitamins that's crazy but here's the thing you know you're
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  saying no green vegetables they tell no green vegetables because the clot your
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.680]  blood has vitamin K in there but here's the thing you guys are surprised and
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.600]  amazed and I can see why you're surprised and amazed think of me I see this

[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.960]  years because this is the way the body works we're not sick we're starving we
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.080]  don't need to be fixed by any medical model we need to be fed correctly with
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.120]  nutrition and nutritional supplementation and dietary strategies well
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.680]  I'm convinced and I get to see those emails and it'll thousands of people are
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.480]  convinced along with you right it's just amazing I mean Alex but the proofs in

[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.440]  cut your risk of degeneration as you grow older and it's one thing to die
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.800]  early but it's another thing to rot on the way down and once you start taking
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.200]  care of your nutritional needs not only are you going to increase your longevity
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.440]  and feel better but you're going to decrease the likelihood that you're
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.000]  going to have one of these awful awful degenerative conditions and Chad I know
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.240]  it's a sad story but you volunteered for me to tell it I mean your dad got to
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.600]  where he didn't really know where he was when you said fishing and after what
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.960]  six months on young Jebedee on the tangy tangerine and essential fatty acids
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.240]  yeah in your own words he knew who he was again was having a good time yeah
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.360]  but then the doctor tested the blood and said you're not allowed to have vitamin
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.880]  K well because what happened when he went off of it he's on kumitan I mean he
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.680]  lost his memory again I mean when he was on the beyond tangy tangerine I came
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.120]  over for a party one day he told me what my brother was doing and why he
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:54.000]  couldn't be there on time what his wife was up to all the short-term memory
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.160]  stuff that he just your dad was back yeah he was back he had his
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.560]  cognitive skin but the doctor the God says no yeah yeah because how do they get
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.040]  away with that Ben I mean their medical deities we created a model through
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.240]  marketing and Edward Bernays and PR and spin and commercials and mass hypnosis
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.400]  we've created this model it says that you do whatever the doctor said how many
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.040]  times you see these commercials ask your doctor make sure you ask your doctor
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.840]  what about doctors in the 50s saying smoked cigarettes they're good for you

[01:29:51.200 --> 01:30:01.840]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a little over a
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:06.320]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.560]  sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.680]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.680]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.520]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.920]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.560]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young Jevity the

[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.280]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:30.040]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:34.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:33.240]  the globalist and it's a big way for patriots everywhere to get into business
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.480]  waking others up that's how the free market works that's what I did going
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.760]  back 17 years ago making my own videos funding my own organization slowly
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.240]  growing it so we can now challenge the globalist toe-to-toe and I invite people
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.560]  to join info wars team comm its 10 bucks to sign up and get discounts all the
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.320]  products or just go buy them outright I know I've got my family signed up because
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.360]  again it take I mean I believed in it knew it was good so I was promoting it
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:00.640]  but didn't really buy it into it I'm two months in and I'll say this I've lost
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.520]  37 pounds about a week and a half I really haven't lost any weight and it
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:08.000]  is because I still eat a big steak or picked out on Mexican food last night
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.120]  eight two buckets probably GMO chips but I mean just the just just the eating a
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.480]  little less than drinking the tangy tangerine and pollen burst it's
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.640]  incredible so I'm not even going the extreme stuff like Aaron Dyches and by
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.320]  the way he says he's crazed now and most of stuff doesn't even have a caffeine at
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:30.840]  most these products now what I'm breaking down here is the fact that if we get
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.480]  healthy and realize what's happening if we have the building blocks we need
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:40.760]  aren't starving for nutrients not empty food then the globalist the system is
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:45.320]  going to be in deep deep trouble and Dr. Corey Gold who's a dentist just like
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:51.080]  my dad he's a dentist from UC San Francisco product formulator for 20
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.920]  years a lot of famous products out there like pollen burst one of my favorites
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:57.480]  I used to drink coffee at five to the nightly news and it would just give me
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:02.440]  like this this dirty you know awake buzz and a headache later not pollen burst
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:06.160]  full of B vitamins and the rest of it wow it does a little bit of caffeine as
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.600]  well but formulated just right he's also a team leader at info wars team dot com
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.960]  and he works with young Jebedee in fact some of his companies basically merged
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.600]  with them so he's in studio with us but I learned I already knew this but he's
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.240]  down in the San Diego area right by the reactor that released a bunch of
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.440]  radiation and they admit that and I was just mentioning the start of the hour
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:34.360]  and he was bringing it up that that that he heard alarms going off in his
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.480]  neighborhood with this so give us an update on what's going on with what
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.880]  happened in Southern California yeah my home is not too far away from Santa
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.320]  no friend nuclear plant which is on the coast between Orange County and San
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.360]  Diego and we're just sitting in our house my wife myself and all of a sudden
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.480]  these sirens go off like what the heck is that like once or twice a year they
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:55.320]  have these tests but they always tell you we're gonna have a test next week so we
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.800]  do it every twice a year so don't worry about just a test there's no test what
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.520]  the heck's going off to get in the car where we go and all of a sudden they go
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.960]  away and then we hear them again a few minutes later what's happening so I go
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.280]  on the internet and they say there's a leak at Santa no friend nuclear plant but
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.560]  don't worry it's contained go about your own business there's no problem at all
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.920]  everything's just fine there's there's leaking radiation about 10 miles away
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.400]  but don't worry about it's all good but stay out the sun of course you know make
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.440]  sure you stay out the sun but nuclear radiation leaking that's just fine just
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.660]  go about your business by the way you guys hadn't heard this and and I don't
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.920]  blame me for kind of double-taking I mean you know I don't make stuff up but
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.960]  you were like really I told you cast Sunstein the White House regulations are
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.200]  said first restrict and block their websites but we should look at arresting
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.560]  he wrote public papers for Harvard and the White House and Chicago a business
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.280]  school three of them you can go read them but he said infiltrate people that
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.160]  question he said including alternative health that's conspiracy theory and he
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.200]  said people that say any son is good is dangerous and damaging people they
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.460]  should be arrested and he said if you question man may global warming you
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:06.680]  should be but then literally as you know hundreds of mainline studies that
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.480]  moderate son is essential I don't need to know that if I get a little bit down
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:14.360]  in the winter I everybody knows go to the coast get some son even if it's 60
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.120]  degrees get some son I feel great it's like a drug you know as a dentist as a
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.240]  researcher as money's looked at this a why is son so important and why are they
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.160]  telling us it's bad and I know it's linked to getting cancer not getting
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:32.080]  son and guys type in cast Sunstein conspiracy theory son is not good for you
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.000]  or cast Sunstein says son is not good for you I want to show them this because
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.360]  they were doubting and I could tell go ahead no I wasn't down to you I'll put
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.600]  that on Ben but anyway there's a whole disease out there no I don't blame me if
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.920]  you do it's unbelievable there's a whole disease called seasonal
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.880]  defective disorder for people in Alaska and people up in Sweden they get it
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.680]  where they're not in the sun enough they actually their brains don't work well
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.040]  their brain needs a son your body needs the studies the eyes also take the
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.480]  light and does a chemical reaction tone in the melatonin our connection
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.560]  spirituality our connection to mental well-being northern Europe was having
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:08.480]  huge suicides as you know until now by law they have to provide sun rooms and
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.760]  they put artificial sun in the buildings there's an intimate link between
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.560]  the Sun and the pineal gland in fact the pineal gland itself has photo
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.680]  receptor cells so that it's a little bit of eye it's literally like an eye in
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.120]  your head and it's connected to to the to the two holes in your head that you
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.960]  call your eyes the lake goes in through your eyes and communicates with your
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.560]  pineal gland and converts serotonin to melatonin the ancients knew that everybody
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.840]  knows that's right the ancient people did know that they used to do these
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.800]  things where they bury you for three days and then open up the crypt and you
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.000]  get this big hit of light after being in building up all of these neurochemicals
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.840]  in your brain and the big hit of light would go through your eyes and would
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.320]  convert the serotonin into melatonin or the melatonin into serotonin
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.240]  instantly you have supposedly you have these initiatory reactions via the
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.280]  conversion the connection between light and brain health is unbelievably
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:02.040]  important and by the way skin cancer and cancers that are related to the Sun
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.600]  have a link to nutritional deficiencies because when you eat nutrients
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.520]  specifically phytonutrients and antioxidants they're literally stored
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.240]  in your skin and secreted in your sweat and in and in your sebum so that when
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.880]  you get the Sun you have antioxidant protection built in when you're taking
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.360]  your nutritional supplements well think about any parent at home knows this when
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.180]  your kid's not feeling well what's the first thing you get him some son wait
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.200]  give him some but also you look in their face you go your color doesn't look good
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.540]  your color doesn't look good because your skin doesn't have the nutrients in
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.720]  it your skin is devoid any parent but even mainline doctors in the old days
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.560]  said get plenty of fresh food water and son here's another thing phytonutrients
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:45.120]  plants have these pigments chlorophyll and and carotenoids and and different
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:51.240]  kinds of color pigments that require an adequate digestive system in order to be
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.880]  absorbed and put into the skin specifically fat absorption so when you
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.360]  have you're absorbing your fats you're breaking down the vegetables and the
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.960]  phytonutrients are getting delivered to where they need to be delivered in the
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.360]  skin if you have your gallbladder removed if you have liver problems fatty
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:09.120]  liver any kind of digestive issue that compromises fat absorption you are now
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.440]  at risk for problems with the Sun because you're missing these nutrients in
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.400]  your skin most people now are getting fast to the wrong kind of degraded fast
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.440]  because they're getting from potato chips and french fries and pizza which has
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.440]  fat in it but that's what about narcolepsy connected and not getting sun
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.480]  I haven't heard some brain chemistry reports on that but but obviously we're
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.600]  designed to get some sun that's what our skins for if that's how we process the
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.160]  vitamin a correct vitamin a your body makes vitamins from the Sun a person
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:39.480]  who's healthy look at Ben Ben Ben is healthy his skin looks vibrant and
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.280]  that's because he's getting plenty of Sun go to Colorado if you're getting
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.960]  plenty of Sunday look alive go up to Alaska they could use some Sun you said
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.080]  Alex said it right don't you feel better when you're out in the sun how did we
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:52.720]  let people bamboozle us into thinking that this is some demon in the sky that's
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.440]  that's hell bent on our destruction when we all know that we feel better when
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.400]  we're out in the Sun you go take a survey on people and ask them if they
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.640]  feel better when they're out in the Sun and across the board people say but
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.360]  it's we're just like it's like plants need Sun I mean we need some Sun we're
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.000]  designed to have it anybody who says that we're not supposed to have Sun is
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.200]  telling you fib by the way do you guys find the cast Sunstein says that they
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:18.640]  should censor people that said there it is Obama's informations are calls for
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.320]  banning free speech no more opinions on content and there it is blow it up second
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.280]  rated thank you for radio listeners Sunstein also cites the benefit of
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.360]  global Sunstein also cites the belief that the global warming is a deliberate
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:39.400]  fraud as another marginal conspiracy theory to be countered by government
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.400]  action in reality the majority of Americans now believe that the man-made
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.560]  explanation global warming is not true and that global warming is natural
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.960]  according to latest polls I guess you didn't find the part where he says don't
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.280]  good because I mean it's in his paper he says I know Paul Watson wrote about it
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:58.120]  he says it says that it's a lie that you need Sun so that's the part about go
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:02.920]  after folks that say global warming isn't real well the other fact he has Sun
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.480]  in his name isn't that hysterical oh yeah and then oh I get it you can't have
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.800]  Sun it I can't think of what they're trying to make the most basic things if
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:15.000]  they can tell you the Sun is bad then what else won't you believe I mean when
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.360]  they can take that away from you that being in the Sun is a bad what about the
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.880]  UN two years ago at Copenhagen people are pointing out the Sun's driving
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:26.520]  climate not us and they they had a vote and said the Sun does not affect climate
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.720]  well the quick thing they voted yeah because doesn't affect climate yeah is
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:35.120]  that what they said okay guys type in UN votes it says Sun is not affect climate
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.120]  you're not gonna believe me that big nuclear reactor out there isn't
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.640]  affecting anything I guess not it's like when it was it get cold at night
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.080]  because the Sun's gone it's you know yeah affects climate just a little bit now
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:48.320]  now you were talking about mainline medical doctors are good people they're
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:52.360]  just ignorant they're indoctrinated into a system that tells them how to think and
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:55.840]  because of that they come in there with good intentions they want they want to
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.760]  do the right thing but they're told the right thing is something else and
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:02.200]  because of that that's what they do if you get a car accident you want to see a
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.560]  physician right away they know how to fix bones and take care of you they're
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:09.400]  great at critical care but when it comes to preventative medicine they're told a
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:12.560]  whole story in a mythology and they bought into it because if they don't
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.360]  they're not in anymore they're on the outside and they don't make money I mean
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:20.440]  if they tell you hey this nutritional reverse this and the big metal companies
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:23.800]  that finance the medical schools aren't gonna give them money but the average
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:27.240]  the average doctor doesn't even know any of that he does he's not tied into a
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.200]  big money in the medical school he's just tied into wanting respect of his
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:33.880]  peers and believing what his teachers tell him is true so if all you hear for
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:37.320]  your whole life is this way of thinking that's what you adopt you know also we've
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:41.680]  abdicated we've voluntarily given up responsibility for our health and we've
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:45.400]  created a vacuum in a sense and the medical people have just taken up that
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:50.160]  role medicine should be about heroic measures if you have a heart attack if
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.360]  you get hit by a car if you need stitching up and it does wonderful
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.560]  work in that regard but somehow they've taken on a role that should be ours as
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.120]  individuals well they're trying to take control of the whole society I mean I
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.800]  mean that the technocrats above them say that they want to make us sick so they
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.880]  can then sell us what allows us to live well they're managing they're managing
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.560]  things now it's not about helping you get better it's about how we manage well
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.440]  it's a binary illness they the big farm of the system you know the bad food the
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.320]  GMOs the additives give you the illness and then they give you the treatment well
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.160]  we are to me we're a via nutritional supplementation via dietary strategies via
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:32.680]  lifestyle modification we have so much power we can do so much to take the ball
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.880]  back into our own court to restore our health it shouldn't be the medical
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:41.480]  models responsibility to make us better it shouldn't be the medical models
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.240]  responsibility to keep us healthy unless we have an accident our day-to-day health
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.360]  is our responsibility the responsibility of parents for their
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:54.600]  children and the responsibility of individuals themselves and to me they're
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.040]  just taking on that we created a vacuum but the government's fostering that look
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.560]  in Chicago where if you bring your own lunch to school there's some schools
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.240]  will they take your lunch away and throw in the garbage even though the parent
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:06.000]  packed the lunch because they were we don't care that you pack the lunch we
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.440]  don't care that you could parent we're throwing the garbage because this is what
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:11.000]  your kids gonna eat yeah so the the government's becoming the best right
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.520]  well there's been a nanification it's the nanny state it's this idea that we
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:17.040]  can't do it ourselves that we have to have somebody else take care and they
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.960]  make you they make you weak of course we need the government to protect us from
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.040]  everything even from our own thoughts even from our own food that's why in
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:26.880]  those nanny state cities they take the guns the crime rate goes up it doesn't
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.120]  make you safe the cops can't protect you all the time no but they get you
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.880]  dependent to the point where you need someone else to take care of you you're
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.240]  not supposed to think for yourself I mean even in school nowadays excellence
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.320]  has breathed out of you excellence is breathing no they said they admit that
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.320]  you're right doc now now now dr. Cory Gold what woke you up you know I much
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.760]  maybe I'm always encountered to a lot of things I'm always a crunch contrarian
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.080]  when everybody's talking about one thing when everybody's thinking the same
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.160]  thing somebody's not thinking and I think very early on I was listening to a
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.480]  few of the alternative thinkers out there and said you know some there's
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.520]  something there's something organic about that that rides in my chest I
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.320]  just can't not listen to that message and hear it because sometimes the truth
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:08.800]  is out there you just you just it rides with your heart and you go there's
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:11.440]  something that guys know your subconscious brains more powerful it
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.520]  knows bull well yeah but and also then you start saying wait a second why do I
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.520]  think what I thought before well just because everybody's telling it to me
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.160]  doesn't mean it's accurate maybe they just heard from somebody else no
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.360]  repeating the same bad thing around and so I started reading and going to school
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.960]  and in school they teach you how the body works and we start saying it well
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.840]  when I just give it what it needs right that's what we said pharmacy school right
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.720]  and so we start saying why don't we just provide it what it needs it never it
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.600]  doesn't mean nothing ever will go wrong right but why should we assume it will
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.720]  go wrong why don't we try to fix why don't we try I take care of my car a lot
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.880]  people take care of their car better than they take care of their body because
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.880]  they know exactly what to do I change my oil every so often I do this every so
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.240]  often but they don't know through their own bodies because they were trained not
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.600]  to know I think that you hit the nail on the head it's this detachment that we
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.340]  have from our own bodies that allows us to go to some outside authority to tell
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:59.360]  us what's wrong with us most of us don't really feel inside our bodies we
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.160]  don't know where our pancreas is we don't know what our liver does we don't
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.040]  know about our skin so we feel somehow detached and disconnected and that allows
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.200]  us to go to a doctor and say hey you tell me what's wrong with me hey you fix
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.800]  me so it's this idea that we have to become reacquainted with our bodies we
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:18.320]  have to be a come reacquaint with how our bodies work but I mean the best way I
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:22.600]  mean to describe this is as you know breast cancer off the charts us as the
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.880]  highest in the world thousands of percentile what it was 50 years ago
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:30.560]  spreading all over the Western world wherever we follow this modern GMO you
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.560]  know tainted food additives all this garbage that we're just told is the way
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.960]  it is and they're only talking about how to find a cure for it once you get the
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.600]  breast cancer they're not asking why is it exploding right yeah everybody's
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.040]  walking to find a cure was everybody fine walking to find the cause Kentucky
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.640]  fried chicken sponsors the race for the cure I found that pretty pretty
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:54.240]  interesting we should find the race for the cause race for the cause I know
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.760]  this I can eat one piece of Kentucky fried chicken is a scientific test one
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:03.440]  drumstick days of headaches feeling dirty I mean by just grungy you know I
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:07.240]  mean it is I mean it's got so much MSG well you know the story MSG tell him
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.280]  right well MSG monosodium glutamate isn't excited it's a very fascinating
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.720]  story the Japanese pioneered it so that they could feed their soldiers the
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.080]  crappiest food ever and it would it would taste good MSG's an excitotoxin it
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.240]  makes your brain excited it makes your brain happy so you'll eat spam and your
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:28.200]  brain will go yeah exactly it makes your brain happy and excited so they
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.200]  figured well put it in everything and it allows you these additives are our
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.360]  artificial drugs basically they make you think that you're eating the filet
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  minyom when you're eating spam well you're a pharmacist whether they on
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:43.040]  average they teach them more than doctors about the metabolic system with
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.360]  this what is MSG doing MSG monosodium glutamate is classified as an
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.720]  excitatory neurotoxin meaning it stimulates the brain to make it think
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.920]  it's really happy and really excited just like other poisons like methamphetamine
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.840]  now you have excitatory neurotoxic excitatory neural peptides in your
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.800]  brain that's a normal part of brain chemistry the problem is when you eat
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:08.000]  lots and lots of them these excitatory neural peptides are regulated tightly as
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.360]  they should be because if you have too much of them they're toxic the problem
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.240]  is is we're getting them in all of our foods Kentucky fried chicken and fast
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.960]  foods and spam and so it's the amount of these excitatory compounds that make
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:23.360]  some toxic and then your body gets used to them and when you go back to eating
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.280]  foods that don't contain them they don't taste as good to you anymore because
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.840]  your body saying wait a second I need a drug to feel like my food tastes good
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.800]  this tastes bland to me what is it it's regular organic food what doesn't taste
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.320]  good that's what my dad used to tell when I was a kid he goes you don't need the
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:41.160]  sugar cereal he said that makes it to where you can't taste it chew it and then
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.520]  just chew the regular wheat cereal then you'll be able to taste the sugar and I
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:47.440]  try to get you at a month then it suddenly gets sweet that's exactly right
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.480]  if you suck on any kind of piece of bread and let it sit in your mouth you
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:55.000]  will taste sugar that's right and the problem is is that we become just like
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.880]  we become dumbed down to excited excitatory neurotransmitters we become
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.640]  dumbed down to insulin or to sugar and we need more and more sugar to give us
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.080]  that high so that's what we were talking about earlier about resensitizing your
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.440]  body to the sweet taste and resensitizing your body to insulin well and
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.680]  that's one reason why people are hungry all the time because their body doesn't
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:15.600]  have any nutrients so by his way second there's a disconnect here I've been
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.000]  eating a lot but I'm still hungry why is that and it's because you're not getting
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.720]  any nutrients are getting lots of for eons whenever we got calories we got
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.920]  nutrients I mean this whole modern way of eating is only a hundred or 200 years
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.560]  old for thousands and thousands of years for even millions of years when we
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:33.920]  got calories we got nutrients so the body sees calories it's wondering where
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:37.440]  the heck the nutrients are it sends us out sends us out for more and and big
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.600]  farmer that owns the big food companies they industrialize the food they roll
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.320]  it out they put their petrochemical additives into it to addictus because
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.720]  they're all drug pushers like crack dealers who can put the best crack on
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:53.400]  the street just like cigarette makers with additives they're all competing one

[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  now the really informative stuff's going on during the break Dr. Corey Gold
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.680]  you were bringing up a BIM was saying hey bring up you know the Nazis and the
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:28.600]  Soviets on record put fluoride in their work camp water that's on record if you
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.320]  look it up but then you were bringing up the fluoride in the water all these the
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.520]  states now because cities are removing and are saying okay it's the law that
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:40.840]  violates the Geneva Convention the Nuremberg code you can't forcibly drug
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.640]  somebody now they're talking about lithium in the water absolutely they're
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.560]  talking there's government agencies out there and panels out there talking about
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:53.040]  now saying some people aren't feeling happy all the time therefore having
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:56.640]  negative emotions is bad we might want to put lithium in the water therefore no
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:00.560]  one will ever be unhappy zombies yeah well because having an emotion is now
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.440]  and is a bad thing you can't you shouldn't have emotion so let's put
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:06.840]  lithium in the water and some people might be a little aggressive let's put
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:09.800]  some fluoride in the water or remember during the war they used to put salt
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.240]  Peter let's let's put things in the water let's put people food things in
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.400]  food to make sure that people don't have emotions that might not be the most
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:20.880]  and then take the iodine out and then all these women have thyroid problems
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.120]  because the iodine isn't there so the fluoride is able to get into the
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:27.960]  thyroid and by the way the fluoride is specific for the pineal gland that
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.440]  center that gland in the in the center of your brain that's responsible for your
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.840]  spiritual connection that is involved in serotonin and melatonin production
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:40.920]  dreams floor dreaming and higher consciousness fluoride is specific for
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:44.840]  the pineal gland and so if you can take religion out of everything because you
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:48.160]  start giving some drugs that make you not have that emotional attachment to the
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.640]  world and to spirituality then who are you bonded to which is the state and to
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:56.920]  some degree I think a large portion of this is who should be your god which is
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:00.360]  the state no that's it folks there's gonna be an event here in austin's other

[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.760]  to fight yourself away from the buffet table so that you'll naturally not want
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.840]  the pizza and that's the key if you have to go against hardwiring in your

[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:05.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:10.360]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:15.480]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:20.040]  attention. Full the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal

[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.200]  I know is they're gonna put TSA on the streets and try to grow up my children
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:40.400]  it ain't happening all the borders stay wide open also we're gonna get into
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:47.440]  the latest on fast and furious the latest on what Holder is up to and the
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:51.920]  Super Bowl I personally am boycotting it because now they've turned it into a TSA
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.600]  grope fest and turning the hot dog sellers to be spies. Now Michael's
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:02.240]  whirling known as MZ owns a couple of great stations out in California that I'm
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:08.840]  on and he introduced me to the young Japanese products I know they're great
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.440]  but it took me a few months to even start trying them and I did and you know
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:15.560]  the whole story but there's another angle to this I'm just saying try the
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:18.560]  products because they're great and it supports our operation and it really
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:22.120]  works and it's revolutionary against the globalist but Michael just briefly
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.080]  people can also sign up and be distributors of this and this is now
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:29.760]  one of the and I don't even call this MLM because all it is is a way to have
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.600]  distributors and it really works and it's just growing and growing and then
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.480]  around 15 years and is now one of the biggest and only really successful ones
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.160]  and that's why it's the only MLM I've ever been involved in. Well it's a great
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:46.840]  organization I've been involved with it for 15 years now ever since its
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:54.200]  inception and you know it's it's made it possible for KSCO and KOMY to be
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:02:00.400]  true independent radio stations with a heart and a soul and a personality
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.640]  whereas most of the radio stations these days Alex robot drones exactly you know
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:12.720]  all they are is conduits for programming for big multi multi large
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.840]  corporations and your stations are amazing that's some great syndicate
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.280]  stuff like my show but also just all the locals all it's wild yeah now we've got
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:27.560]  characters really gravitate to Santa Cruz in the moderate Bay Area and we say
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:33.600]  sort of take advantage of that you know but yeah in fact very recently the
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:41.600]  most successful talk radio station in the country KGO in San Francisco died the
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:46.680]  corporate suits who own KGO now who are more Wall Street bankers than
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:50.920]  broadcasters decided to put a bullet in the head of KGO. I was talking to
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.440]  ManCal and I went and looked the numbers up he was making them like five million
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:58.880]  dollars a year profit back before the Y2K stuff and all that he was making them
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:03.920]  something like it was like one year 25 million they still just because it got
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:07.560]  bought a parking lot and fired him and he's back syndicated and stuff but yeah
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:12.400]  tell folks how they what they can do at mfallwarsteam.com. They can sign up to
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.000]  either use the products or if they want to get into a business for themselves and
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:22.320]  it's a really inexpensive business to get into it's a one-time $10 sign-up fee to
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:30.080]  get a distributorship that you can use to promote using new media which is you
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.920]  know the internet there are no barriers to YouTube your local radio show radio
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:38.640]  affiliates are signing up a bunch of them and really loving it. Yeah yeah what
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:45.480]  started in 1996 we had Dr. Wallach who owns the young Jeopardy company we put
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.840]  him on and started syndicating him to other radio stations around the
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:55.720]  country and each one of those radio stations who carried Dr. Wallach became
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:00.680]  distributors for for our company. I know a bunch of those that are still going
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.320]  like the one in Kansas City just doing a great job with it. Sure exactly you know
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:09.840]  a lot of stations been with us for a long time and once you once you get the
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:17.560]  feel for residual income you won't ever want to do anything else I mean there's
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.440]  it's it's almost like getting royalty getting reuse fees over and over and over
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.680]  again this is a wonderful wonderful business to be involved in and like I
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:31.040]  said it's kept my radio station going so that I can do this to the big guys and

[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:00.440]  stories in the country right now it and by the way the Twitter bomb did work
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:04.640]  you did yesterday it made our story about the naked body scanners in the top
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:09.480]  10 on Twitter it didn't really do that on reddit but hey first you don't succeed
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.400]  try try again and of course it is the top link on drudge right now the the
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:19.040]  biggest link on the internet the crème de la crème the big kahuna the Death Star
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.920]  level media power to set the agenda I guarantee the globalist don't like this
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:28.880]  big sis has responded to drudge linking to this stuff repeatedly before big sis
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:35.960]  taps hot dog sellers to hunt terrorist at Super Bowl amazing he I love how he
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:40.120]  takes our headline and makes it even better that's how we learn from our
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.800]  might have been curl over there one of the guys that does a great job with him
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:48.640]  TSA trains Super Bowl hot dog sellers to spot terrorist viper search teams to be
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.280]  out enforced before Sunday's big game and you know I make jokes about this but
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:10:01.520]  it's not funny all over the country truck drivers barbers everybody doctors my
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.800]  dad was approached by Homeland Security to spy on his patients and then the guy
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:09.280]  had a badge and cards and my dad couldn't believe it it was one of his
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:14.920]  patients for over a decade so he made calls and it was real and then he thought
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:17.720]  it was because he was my dad was freaked out went talk to other dentists they're
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.800]  like no we got visits at home by separate agents this is last year they're
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:28.280]  everywhere I mean it is you know for what what well I guess if they attack
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.400]  Iran there might be some real terrorists but none of it has to do with Muslim
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:36.200]  terrorists or whatever foreigners it's all about gun owners libertarians
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:41.560]  conservatives and they're creating this giant grid of just and now when you fly
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.760]  you don't just get groped or microwave they ask you questions and you better
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:49.560]  answer them it's pathetic it's a total overthrow of our system I'm gonna get
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:52.280]  Bob Chapman's take on that in a moment but I got to get to this because it
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:59.440]  concerns the unborn even if you're for abortion you need to understand that it
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:04.400]  was created by eugenicists who wanted to kill black people that is modern
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:08.160]  abortion Planned Parenthood Margaret Sanger they said we gotta how do we kill
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:12.000]  these black weeds you can read her quotes it's on record look it up and they
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.320]  said we hire liberal blacks we get them to be our front people we sell it as
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:22.400]  women's rights that's how we'll reduce the population now Hitler was for
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:27.000]  abortion I just want you to know where where the modern movement comes from and
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.360]  I don't like my tax money in fact I moved this was the final straw I moved out
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.320]  of Travis County my office is still here but I moved my home out of Travis
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.320]  County it's the only county in Texas where they take massive amounts of money
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.360]  from you property taxes and the hospital district and give it for
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:48.200]  abortions and women come from all over the country now to get abortions here
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:52.600]  in Austin paid for 100% by the government of Travis County Planned
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.880]  Parenthood has fundraisers they suck money out of the government everything
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:06.800]  and and and it is a Nazi organization but my point here is after a cutting
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:14.040]  ties to Planned Parenthood the Coleman Foundation donations up 100% for the
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:17.960]  fight breast cancer and and they said they're there that they're cutting it
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:21.280]  off because that they've got word that Planned Parenthood is under criminal
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:26.600]  investigation oh you bet they are all sorts of criminal stuff going on now
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.040]  continuing with the babies and the rest of it and pressuring women to have
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.120]  abortions they're not there to counsel you that are to pressure you into it but
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:39.640]  I wanted to play this clip from cnsnews.com Pelosi girl scouts relationship
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.200]  with Planned Parenthood very valuable when you put your child in girl scouts
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:47.720]  or brownies or boy scouts which were all great organizations previously you're
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.440]  being taught anti-gun anti-family anti-abortion anti-america garbage I
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:57.240]  mean and just look into it they work for Homeland Security they actually train
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.920]  the kids this is in the handbooks some people rebel and don't teach it doesn't
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.920]  mean that there aren't still some good ones out there maybe you should go join
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:09.920]  and run it yourself and then subvert the globalist and not teach this Nazi
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:14.080]  garbage globalist garbage whatever you want to call it but the point is it's
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.720]  being taken over almost completely here is Nancy Pelosi on the girl scouts where
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:23.240]  they teach them how great abortion is here it is the girl scouts has had some
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:27.120]  ties to Planned Parenthood do you think that's a valuable relationship to have
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.440]  like working together the girl scouts have relationships with many
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:35.720]  organizations and yes I think they're all very valuable thank you that's enough
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:46.360]  from that witch with her fake smile now let's go to another clip of Pelosi she
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:49.520]  said there's a bunch of places but she says contraception will reduce cost to
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.200]  the states and the federal government that's why we have 1.3 children for
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:56.560]  every two people now and can't replace ourselves so they're gonna cut off all
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:01.400]  the social security and euthanize your hind in societies that don't match the
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:07.240]  last-generation die in fact right now at many actuaries and experts on
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:10.680]  population say it can't be reversed let's play this last clip and get Bob
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:15.960]  Chet oh it's not ready that computer crashed we're getting new computers we've
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:21.240]  got old Radley PCs cobbled together with Linux systems and we got this this has
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:27.240]  got windows on it but we don't have that clip because we got it at the beginning
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:34.560]  of the show all right the point is is that all of this is going on and they're
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:37.960]  in there in the schools they're in there in the boy scouts the girl scouts
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.920]  telling girls get your Gardasil telling him how great abortion is all of this is
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:47.760]  being pushed on and on and on and it's wrong it's wrong and it's time that we
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:54.400]  stand up and say stop taking our tax money it's time we say stop using our
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:57.960]  own money to kill kids if you know it's one thing if you want to go out and
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:01.440]  have this abortion or whatever and I understand it's a hot-button issue all
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:05.880]  right we don't have the clip let's go to Bob Chapman okay Bob Chapman well we'll
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:10.280]  get to that clip later you can just type it in and find it for heaven's sakes Bob
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:14.200]  Chapman of the International Forecaster what do you make of the TSA training
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:17.520]  everybody to be spies rolling out at checkpoints on the highways it's all
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.480]  coming true secret arrest of Americans announced secret killings of Americans
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:26.640]  announced I mean there's no more denial is there Bob absolutely none and it's
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:32.640]  something that you've been talking about for a long time and I think your
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:40.320]  reference to Nazism national socialism is the perfect one and that was followed
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:49.080]  up during the Cold War in what used to be East in Germany and when they took the
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:59.200]  wall down they immediately grabbed their best propagandists and people who are
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:06.320]  specializing in spying of one kind or another and one of the most unbelievable
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:12.760]  things was that Marcus Wolf who was the head of Stasi I used to stuff I used to
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:21.480]  spy against them and this guy it was a monster I mean he was responsible for
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:27.960]  millions of deaths and he didn't do anything to him and all I can say is
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:34.800]  based upon that is he had to be with them all the time but the professional
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:43.000]  ism of the people who were into spying like they found out after the wall came
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:48.560]  down I guess two or three years later in their surveys but about 70% of the
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.720]  people in Eastern Germany was spying on each other now it's not funny I know but
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:58.560]  that's an incredible amount of people and whether they paid him or not I don't
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:05.120]  have those details but this is just like that and it's going to get a lot worse it's
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.760]  going to be so that you don't want to discuss anything with anybody because he
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:15.240]  might be paid or whatever by the US government well Bob we know what's
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:20.360]  happening the idea is intimidate us like our normal political speech is somehow
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:26.120]  dirty and bad so that we don't want to talk to no one hears us I say up it and
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:31.360]  get even more flamboyant banner hangs bullhorning in their faces calling them
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:34.920]  out don't be afraid of little snitches reporting on you not being a traitor
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:39.000]  scum they these little again it's this idea that we're bad and everybody's
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:45.200]  watching us and to create this chilling effect I say counter their ice with fire
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:51.840]  the fire of the human mind and tongue what do you say Chapman the same thing
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:57.840]  go get them confront them and there's a lot of ways to do it the ones that you
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:05.800]  mentioned in course on the program and in the written word as well we got to go
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:12.240]  after them on this it's outrageous I mean in the streets body-scanning people
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:18.720]  going into a football game this madness and so you're absolutely right it has
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:24.080]  to be pursued is there has to be a program set up somehow that we can
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:32.360]  pursue them on a directed basis now Bob we did find that clip we had a
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:37.200]  duplicated under under two names in the computer system here it is Pelosi on CBS
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:43.160]  saying yeah we need to find Planned Parenthood contraception abortion and
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.160]  she responded to it later in other clubs saying yes it saves money to get rid of
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:49.760]  people really I thought it meant we didn't have another generation and we had
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:53.240]  to euthanize the old folks I thought that's what it meant you which here it
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:57.800]  is hundreds of millions of dollars to expand family planning services how is
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:03.880]  that stimulus well the family planning services reduced cost it reduced cost the
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:10.240]  states are in terrible fiscal budget crisis now and part of it what we do
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:15.760]  for children's health or education and some of those elements that are to help
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:22.440]  the states meet their financial needs one of those one of the initiatives you
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:27.920]  mentioned as a contraception is will reduce cost to the state and to the
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.520]  federal government no apologies for that no apologies no
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:36.640]  all right we're gonna come back with Bob Chapman on that and that was ABC she
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:41.440]  also said similar things on CBS there's a bunch of these clips and she said later
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:46.120]  yes I mean abortion so abortion you killing people not having new
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:49.280]  generations is the answer and they're like well these are poor people that
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.080]  you end up in prison oh really you mean the ones you ship drugs into the
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:57.120]  government we'll get Bob Chapman's take on that I ran the economy a lot more in

[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:42.760]  459 to audit the Fed it's up to 199 all they need is 218 we didn't get a full
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:46.560]  audit last time as the Senate played games but 10 years ago Ron Paul couldn't
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:50.840]  get one co-sponsor and so even though Ron Paul leaves office whatever happens
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:56.240]  now this movement's alive now people know in fact Aaron Dykes was showing me
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:01.240]  another document a new article written by Zabigniew Brzezinski about his book
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:05.360]  coming out and it's all about how the global leader in trouble and how there's
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:08.240]  a global awakening I know we covered on the nightly news a few nights ago when
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:11.440]  he filled in but I'm gonna cover that when we come back with Bob Chapman and
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.520]  then your calls but Bob I want to get into the admission of QE3 gold going
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:21.560]  back up all these economic numbers coming out what this signifies the EU
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.800]  dictatorship over the sovereign countries but and then we'll get into that
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:31.520]  Brzezinski news but things are just getting wild give us your breakdown on
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.720]  what's happening right now in the economy well I think we're seeing in an
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:42.080]  extension of money that's been available by the Fed through the banking system
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:49.120]  that wasn't expected it's being called QE3 we predicted it and this time they
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:53.520]  giving money to the banks taking that bad bonds away from them putting on the
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:58.960]  balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and they are telling the banks look you go
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:04.600]  out there and buy treasuries agencies and also make a lot more loans and you
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:08.800]  than you have been making so that we can keep this thing going sideways at worst
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:15.760]  and we are also seeing a displacement of funds and this is very interesting it's
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:21.280]  something very few people would catch even the pros what's happening over in
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:28.760]  Europe the US the Federal Reserve lent the European Central Bank a trillion
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:33.520]  dollars which can be made into ten trillion which I won't go into and it
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:42.440]  was illegal and the word is now 523 banks have taken in close to 800 billion
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:52.560]  and they sent it all back digitally to the European Central Bank but a number
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:58.680]  of those banks that receive that money are using it to buy us treasuries and
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:06.360]  that funding process of the money going into the US treasuries assist the
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.280]  Federal Reserve in the sense that they don't have to buy as much so that
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:17.240]  relieves a burden burden monetizes the money but on the other hand not only
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:24.400]  do the banks in Europe buy the bonds but they can then take the bonds to the ECB
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:31.640]  and they can use them as collateral on a three-year 1% loan and so what they're
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:38.360]  doing here is you might call it Ponziing but what they're doing is they're
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:44.320]  creating more money that you'd never know about unless I told you how much I
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.360]  don't know yet and then they hoard it for themselves and then loan it back we
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:52.120]  give them money and back it up and are told how we're in debt to them and how
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:55.720]  we and we have to have higher taxes and lower standard of livings and then we
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:00.000]  give it all to them they loan it back to us at huge interest and then grandstand
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.560]  as our saviors when they're publicly criminals and ran the whole scam I mean
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:10.000]  it is amazing how ignorance of the public of finance and layering of Ponzi
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:16.120]  schemes has allowed them to do this well I want to go one step further I don't
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:21.680]  think 75% of the professionals who have figured out what they're doing and this
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:24.600]  is not going to be front-page news because I don't get on the front page and
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:29.680]  I quite frankly have not seen anybody else write about it but they will and
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:36.320]  hopefully lots and lots and better than I but you are asking about the economy in
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:42.280]  America so some of that money's coming in to augment whatever they spend in QE
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:50.360]  3 what will it be 800 billion to 1.3 trillion is the estimate we don't know
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:56.560]  until we get there but the money is going to make the economy rise how much
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:03.840]  well they would have had a one and a half percent minus the 2% minus GDP for
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.680]  this year and with all that money coming in it's probably going to be close to
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:12.720]  the 2% and so the US economy is not going to do as red-full unless some
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:18.680]  unbelievable a bend happens as people had thought and in Europe they'll do a
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:24.120]  little bit better than they would have otherwise in the same in England because
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:29.680]  they'll be lending that wasn't taking place before so the economy this year is
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:37.560]  going to go sideways to upward all right Bob we're gonna be right back and I go
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:43.280]  to phone calls and other news as well but I've got a big stack of news here
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.120]  that I'm gonna interspersed with the calls it is all coming up and we'll get

[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:58.800]  west of the east and how is it being affected by the new reality of political
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:04.080]  awakening humanity and of course he has a full CFR speech two years ago where he
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:09.240]  says humanity's awake they see the elite not just the front puppets and so it is
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:13.880]  this awakening Hillary Clinton said last year that the globalist are losing the
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:19.480]  info war right now that they're losing the info war that is with the
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:24.280]  alternative media they're freaking out because people know they're liars they've
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:27.680]  lost credibility so what is cast Sunstein the White House regulations
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:33.680]  regulations are say he says well what we'll do is we'll just infiltrate and
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:38.040]  pose as alternative media and try to get people in fighting so whenever you see
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.240]  news organizations pop up that are around usually about a year they ever wait
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.280]  longer and then they make about half their business attacking others or wild
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:49.520]  stories that can't be proven and in fighting and claiming they're the only
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:53.880]  legitimate news organization look out there are lots of legitimate
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:58.960]  alternative media groups and people out there okay tons of them and they're out
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:02.400]  there getting news out not trying to get people fighting with each other and
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.760]  you know gatekeeping and the rest of it so that's another big sign from their
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:10.760]  documents Bob Chapman your take on what Brzezinski said my point about the
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:17.160]  co-intel pro-infighters well this goes back four years is you're well aware and
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:23.200]  he made a number of speeches usually on behalf of the Council on Foreign
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:27.040]  Relations what was in Toronto and then another one in New York another one in
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:36.520]  New York and he's sort of their watchdog nowadays and you've read his
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:46.520]  illustrious past this guy here is demonic but anyway I remember once you
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:52.600]  said Alex we discussed this before Brzezinski saying we're breathing down
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:59.360]  their collar and Brzezinski said the people at the CFR you'd better get it
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:02.520]  together because these people are catching up and they're not going to give
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:08.120]  up and so that's where we're at in this book this book is not for you and I
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:14.000]  we're not supposed to read that stuff I wasn't supposed to be a subscriber to
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.320]  foreign affairs which is the house a literary organ of the Council on Foreign
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:24.880]  Relations this 1960 where they openly admit all their treason absolutely and
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:29.360]  they can't keep their mouth shut I mean they even blew it when we had this
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:35.360]  North North American zone where they wanted to merge Mexico the United
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.600]  States and Canada together I mean they just couldn't stop talking about it
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.360]  they laid all the plans out for it but then getting back to Brzezinski they
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:50.920]  are terrified and that the bottom line is if we continue to pursue them we can
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:56.080]  win and it's not going to be any nice guy
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:01.920]  now what about how Brzezinski and others and as well as Sunstein talk about
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.200]  getting us to end fight I mean you've been fighting the Globals for 50 years
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.800]  can you talk about hey we've always see people kind of emerge as patriots and
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:12.760]  then they automatically start attacking and then later we find out they were
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:19.680]  federal agents or federal minions I've seen them sincerely 60s and we used to
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:29.520]  call them change agents and they always almost always were completely unsuccessful
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:38.000]  and we saw plenty of them I think what people have to look out for is people
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.680]  who seem genuine but they're not it's a hard call because you just
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:47.080]  don't know especially if you haven't been trained to spot this sort of thing
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:57.000]  and they're just going to continue to infiltrate society with these kind of
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:04.640]  people I'm seeing them already on the right some of the writers some of the
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:09.840]  moderators and I don't want to get into it in the program but I know who's
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:17.560]  doing what to whom and they're not fully me one bit well Bob all I know is is
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:20.360]  that we're really starting to have an effect and that's why the system is
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:24.400]  now announcing it wants to come in and start censoring the internet talk radio
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:29.600]  you name it I mean they're really getting scared they certainly are and they
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:35.120]  should be just in America alone we got 300 million people cut it in half and
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:40.920]  we'll say we got 150 million adults there's a lot of people to reach yet but
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:44.560]  this is reaching out all over the world very very strong that's a talking point
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:48.560]  I've always heard we need solutions all you're doing is talking bad about the
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:51.800]  globalist for 15 years the founding fathers put out committees of
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.640]  correspondence exposing the crime of the redcoats and the British crown
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:42:00.400]  violating Englishman's God-given rights under Magna Carta it's the same thing
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:04.040]  the solution is pointing out that the mega banks and the globalists are
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:08.440]  causing the problems the wars the tyranny the breakdown the narcotics
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:12.640]  being shipped in the solution is pointing out they're the criminals
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.360]  they're the main problem they've screwed things up so bad I mean if we got
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:19.840]  rid of them today we'd still be in deep trouble and our own weaknesses and our
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:25.400]  own problems and our own laziness sure but I mean the prime conscious
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:31.400]  premeditated movers of corruption and imperial domination over freedom and
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:36.360]  monopoly capitalism the opposite of freedom and free market it's the enemy
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:41.720]  cronyism insider garbage shutting down our oil pipeline that we need to be
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.120]  somewhat independent and then shipping the on trains to the west coast to China
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:50.080]  so Warren Buffett makes money shutting down our power plants letting China
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:53.880]  build new ones China gets new trains we get nothing because the globalists have
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:57.200]  decided to move there they're done with us they used us to build the world
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:01.680]  government they want to leave us behind as a police state and something in a
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:07.040]  group to supply mercenaries and that's it and you know we've got to be smart
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:10.520]  enough to see the big picture to get outside the controlled paradigm and
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:15.360]  defeated and we're doing that I want to go to some phone calls Bob but you know
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:18.720]  this just shows with Brzezinski and Hillary Clinton and their own CFR
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.160]  speeches I watch body language and I used to watch globalist 15 years ago on
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:28.280]  TV they were arrogant they were on power trips they are scared to death now and
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:31.640]  they are shaken in their boots because they're trying to convert things to
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:35.360]  total tyranny and it's not going well we're not cowering like they thought on
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:38.760]  average we're getting angry and disgusted and getting a fighting spirit
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:42.440]  despite the fluoride and the brainwashing and they're starting to
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:54.680]  really get scared and they should be got comments on that Bob yes I do and that
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:44:02.680]  is that this superior position that they've been in is starting to break down
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:08.160]  now they deliberately have caused the problems that we're seeing today
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:15.400]  throughout the world in regard to currencies economy finance they're the
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:20.120]  ones that made that happen they did it deliberately I don't know that they can
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:25.720]  still control it and I doubt that they can and that is their Achilles heel and
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:32.400]  the reason why is the seat of all their power the key to all their power is the
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:39.520]  control of money the monetary and fiscal control of governments and the whole
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:45.200]  commercial area so to speak you know people ask me a lot about well why would
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:50.800]  they do that I mean doesn't that hurt them and the answer is yes but in the
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:54.800]  final analysis they think they're gonna be the only ones that get any money left
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:58.200]  and they can buy everything for five cents in the dollar and it's not gonna
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:05.280]  work that way all I know is it's us or them these control freaks have gone too
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:10.600]  far they're hubris is what's scary let's go to Janice in Texas and then Noel
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:16.200]  Chip and others go ahead Janice welcome hi Alex hi Bob Harry I'll do it good
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:22.200]  welcome good good and I have three points one young Jevity point and comment
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.680]  on the TSA and the King cockroach that you've always warned about Kirk Watson
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:31.720]  you're not gonna believe him I got on the young Jevity products everything that
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.680]  Ben Fuchs and you were talking about is completely correct I'm transformed and
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:40.360]  but the mental clarity it's like I've stepped out of a fog literally I can
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:44.840]  put the pieces together okay and expanding upon that my comment about the
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:49.800]  TSA is you know we all know it's admitted that they don't want anybody with
[02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:54.760]  the above 70 IQ or whatever they prefer high school dropouts but also I would be
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:59.520]  willing to bet money that none of those people have ever had a passport or been
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:03.800]  anywhere in their whole life the same with the Stasi when I got accosted by the
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:09.080]  Stasi in 1982 on a night train to Berlin and I saw that same jealousy and
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:14.600]  contempt in their eyes and anyway so that's my comment about that but yeah
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:17.440]  no no I mean I've been to some authoritarian countries and I've seen
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.920]  slimy you know cops and in like Honduras where everybody's scared of them and I
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:28.200]  see the same slimy criminalness in that I'm just I can't handle it it's it's so
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:32.960]  offensive and just my natural instinct to live in a free society is I have
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:37.880]  contempt rage anger I mean I know that's the enemy I mean that's the enemy
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:42.360]  that's yeah that's an enemy banker occupation force just like Chinese
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:46.800]  troops or Russian troops walking down my street I mean that's red dawn federal
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:51.800]  banker government trying to grab my wife I'm just it gets me hotter than a
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.400]  pistol God bless you I want to get Bob Chapman's take on that well said man
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:59.760]  Bob I mean how do you handle it because I mean I'm getting the point where I have
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:05.680]  just got real anger problems well you're not as old as I am so you don't get the
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:13.360]  anger problems but which I don't you know you you don't argue that you defeat
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:18.400]  him and that that's what we have to figure out to do and her experience the
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:24.920]  young lady who called in on the trip the night train to Berlin and I know that
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:32.440]  train very well it that was you know part of the course and that's what you're
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:38.800]  going to see in America sir give me a papers please and that sort of thing
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:43.600]  they don't even say please like like do they want you know your scum well some
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:49.120]  do some don't but it all depends on whether you are a foreigner or not
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:54.160]  they're usually a little bit more lacks with foreigners but you're gonna see
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:58.080]  that in America you're gonna be a foreigner in America it's gonna be
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:03.080]  dreadful and when we have to do what you're talking about yeah well I can't
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:06.640]  handle a mess with my family and I just and you know that's gonna happen more
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:12.640]  and more people are just not gonna put up with it Bob well that's why gun sales
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.640]  keep on going up not that that's the final answer but people are frightened
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:20.480]  that's Ron Paul came out and said that oh I'm not looking for trouble either but
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:25.440]  I mean you know I mean I cannot handle this and I am not I am I just I I just
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:29.080]  know they work for a murdering narcotics trafficking banker occupation
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:31.960]  government I mean our country's been hijacked by criminals I know they're
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:35.920]  the bad guys and I don't care what amount of baloney the minions of this
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:39.280]  system fill their brains with I'm right and they're wrong and that's the end of
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:42.600]  it I mean let's go ahead and talk to Noelle in Illinois you're on the air

[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:08.120]  line and I would have been late to my train my girlfriend would have been

[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:50.480]  would happen about a year ago before news even broke that we would have that
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:55.480]  because the sugar daddy Rahm Emanuel is I remember you now my memory you
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:00.080]  called in and said since sugar daddy's been elected I predict the next G20 is

[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:22.640]  freedom lover Michael I'll try to get to Austin Bob Chapman's our guest they're
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:26.920]  coming out with a new aspartame that's the I guess what's left over from these
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:32.840]  E. Coli calling it Neotame and now the FDA is announcing you will not be allowed
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:37.000]  to know on labels if it's in your food that's the new thing I don't want you
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:43.400]  know it's GMO oh you stop buying it we just won't label it this is the FDA we've
[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:49.040]  all been taught to worship that's I mean almost the entire FDA is former
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:55.160]  Monsanto and then they go back into Monsanto and go up the carousel of getting
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:58.040]  paid more money I mean it is just we're gonna cover this on the nightly news
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:04.160]  tonight Bob Chapman again we always do this would happen but by forcing pressure
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:07.400]  under the tyrants people are like well we're gonna get us that's the whole point
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:11.920]  make them go from creeping around to coming out in the open and and it's
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:15.240]  working I mean they are just across the board oh you don't want shots we'll make
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:18.920]  it the law you don't want fluoride we'll make it the law you don't want aspartame
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:23.320]  we'll put it in your food and not tell you I mean they are really showing us
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:28.240]  what they are aren't they Bob they certainly are and I'm afraid you're
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:32.680]  gonna see far more of that in other preparations that people don't want to
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:38.620]  have or eat and it's gonna force people toward the all natural food and if they
[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:43.640]  can get it and next they'll be going out to the gardens I think I told you
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:50.080]  before my daughter produces 80% of what they eat in the little garden and like
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:57.160]  18 eggs a week and they get rabbits and and they live in the city and so you
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:00.120]  got to think about those things Bob they're already going after gardens
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:03.720]  everywhere bro they're saying you got to pay a fee to have one you got to have
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:07.960]  inspections to make sure you're not growing drugs preemptively cuz you're
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:13.520]  guilty until proven slave in America no it's true just total scum I mean it's
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.760]  like Stalin banned people having gardens Bob that's right I mean it's the same
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:25.800]  thing they did during that epic and they survive because of it I don't know
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:29.480]  whether they charged them for the gardens or forbid them well no first
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:33.280]  you know you're right first they banned them especially in the Ukraine and then
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:37.240]  the commies couldn't even get foods they said you're allowed one small area and
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:43.320]  pay us a fee yes that's how it works that's why most of the 60 plus million
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:46.840]  died under Mao it's on record he wouldn't let them have their own gardens
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:51.400]  you know about that this is standard commie takeover commies don't let
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:54.760]  prisoners grow food you don't grow fruit and land of the free home of the brave
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:57:03.000]  we think you grow food in America in Monsanto poison what do you think you're

[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:14.120]  bullet hits the bone a freedom lover in Florida you're on the air welcome hi
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:20.520]  Alex I wanted to with your permission I had an email exchange with one of your
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:26.000]  frequent guests and I wanted to get your take on what he had to say to the
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.560]  questions that I asked him in short I asked him if there was a coalition of
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:37.800]  you know good people that have influence you know back by good members of the
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:44.080]  military and police what he did if he actually fought the republic whether
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:48.880]  it could be restored to what it used to be and with your permission I'd like to
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:52.400]  let you know well sure I mean you can I don't know if the person said this or
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:55.840]  who it is you can send it to me but I mean just and so what did the person
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:03.000]  say about that that the globalists are right on schedule with what they're
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:08.760]  doing that the public has adapted to the changes that have already taken place
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:14.960]  in there you know living the double thing for being global and still being a
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:18.520]  republic that I mean we have a lot of guests on who get pessimistic and I
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:22.280]  understand why but we're actually having great strides against tyranny and I've
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:25.520]  proven that I know what I'm talking about so I mean I don't agree with every
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:30.360]  thing in my guess say a lot of guests I have one I disagree with but just that
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:36.840]  verbiage what is who is that Alan want yeah I mean Alan Alan Alan's really
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:39.320]  studied their writings you can see the in the and the globalists are very
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:43.280]  arrogant and very confident and I mean Alan's a really smart guy but I think at
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:47.320]  a subconscious level people kind of just see the master the master plan and
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:50.480]  think how will the general public defeat this it's not gonna be the general
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:54.960]  public that's gonna defeat it and and so it is a it is a tough road we fight but
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:59.440]  I mean you can't just roll over to it so you know I've had discussions with Alan
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:03.000]  about that I could tell that's like sounds like something he'd say but I
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:07.200]  mean well let's get Bob Chapman's take on that Bob well first of all that's an
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:13.960]  incredible answer I don't know how you pick that out but anyway you have to
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:17.840]  compartmentalize what's going on and then you then you have to put it all
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:24.360]  together and most people don't have time to do that and there's always you know
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:31.920]  in the background things that very very bright people refuse to deal with things
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:36.000]  that they don't like well I think part of it is I have a photograph a semi
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:39.760]  photographic memory it used to be photographic so I have heard that person
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:43.080]  say things word for word that's how I knew it's not very hard actually when
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:45.800]  you know it but I mean I could see that's his view that you know it's very
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:49.400]  hard to beat them I agree with it in a way but but but yeah I mean I mean look
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:53.280]  we don't have a choice but it's a mind game you will defeat them if you believe
[03:03:53.280 --> 03:03:57.840]  you can and take action it's not enough to have faith faith and action that's what
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:05.600]  wins any war Bob Chapman I think you're absolutely right and you keep on grinding
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:11.120]  and grinding and grinding and refusing to accept defeat because defeat is death
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:16.800]  in this case and so there's a lot of people that don't want to go beyond a
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:22.440]  certain level and there's a lot of reasons why and that's okay because they
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:27.360]  can take it to a level and this higher levels that I handle like people like
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:32.920]  yourself and myself who don't have those we'll call them hangups or problems
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:38.640]  well look I mean I a lot to this thing it just isn't spotting these people in
[03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:42.080]  telling them what they're doing you're gonna tell them the history and why they're
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:46.160]  doing it and you do that all right well Bob Chapman thank you so much the
