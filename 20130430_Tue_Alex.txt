[01:01.360 --> 01:07.440]  phones as well today here's the deal i might go on a week-long family vacation once a year this
[01:07.440 --> 01:13.040]  was supposed to be like a three-day one but as things go one of the children of course got sick
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.520]  as we traveled up to arkansas so i've decided to stay a couple more days and i've got so much
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.840]  going on that it was put in the schedule last week for an esquire cover story reporter who's
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.840]  done them on ron paul and others i think he's done a pretty good job in the past being fair
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.160]  to come down interview us but uh i tell you that's how you impress people is to stand them up
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.040]  and so the esquire reporter is sitting there in the office in austin texas right now
[01:37.040 --> 01:42.800]  while i am sitting here uh just trying to uh i swear it's like vacations are more stressful
[01:43.520 --> 01:49.920]  than just staying at home but i've decided to stay a few more days uh in arkansas and so we're
[01:49.920 --> 01:54.080]  going to see what's going to happen with that who knows i might fly if he wants to the esquire
[01:54.080 --> 01:59.280]  writer up and we'll have gonzo journalism with him here not in studio but in hotel room with me
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.400]  tomorrow who knows if we do that richard we ought to get one of their banquet rooms uh you know one
[02:04.400 --> 02:07.840]  of their smaller business offices and maybe do the interview in there tomorrow we're gonna have
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.960]  two microphones did we bring two microphones we brought two microphones so who knows um actually
[02:12.960 --> 02:17.600]  tomorrow's mike adams so it would be thursday maybe we'll have the uh i'm inviting the esquire
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.360]  writer i think i was just told he is going to be coming here so we should just have him here with
[02:21.360 --> 02:31.120]  us in studio uh in hotel room doesn't sound right uh in in studio okay folks obviously it is an
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.560]  insane day a ton of crazy things going on this radio show broke into the mainstream with a
[02:36.560 --> 02:43.120]  political mind a long time ago but the establishment played this weird game of denying we existed
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.760]  or only demonizing us occasionally that damn has completely not just ruptured but completely
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.760]  collapsed and there is a national review article you know the gospel according to alex jones i was
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.840]  just told about i haven't had time to read the whole thing yet david knight our reporter is
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.200]  analyzing that he'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour and and this is not a gonzo show where
[03:05.200 --> 03:10.640]  i sit here and talk about myself all day other than the fact that what happens to this broadcast
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.480]  more and more is tied to what happens to the republic it's kind of like what happens to ron
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.640]  paul or ran paul or uh people like ted cruz is tied to the future of the republic what happens
[03:20.640 --> 03:25.280]  to drugs report.com is tied to the future of the republic i mean there's not that much resistance
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.800]  to this tyranny in the media and the government there's massive resistance in the grassroots in
[03:30.800 --> 03:37.440]  the fruited plane so if we are are able to be successful then that is a bigger hole in the
[03:37.440 --> 03:44.320]  enemy's fortress that's a bigger chink in the dragon's underbelly armor so what they do to us
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.080]  is really what they do to the liberty movement period you know it was national review that went
[03:48.080 --> 03:55.520]  after the john birch society in the 60s for saying the war in the war in vietnam was wrong
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.000]  and the globalists were actually funding communists and using it as a galleon dialectic to
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.880]  consolidate power and create a fake liberal counterculture and that of course has now been
[04:04.880 --> 04:09.600]  declassified uh welch and others were exactly right so when i first heard national review done
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.440]  a big story i thought oh goodness gracious are they going to come after me like they did the
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.120]  john birch society because you know at that time william f buckley was cia that's all again been
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.520]  declassified you can look that up and was there to basically control the conservative liberty
[04:23.520 --> 04:29.280]  movement in this country just like carl rove is on fox news lecturing everyone to don't listen to
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.040]  the tea party don't listen to these anti-new world order people don't listen to them about all this
[04:33.040 --> 04:39.920]  radical conspiracy theories he's saying basically the same thing that uh you know white house run
[04:39.920 --> 04:44.560]  media matters and people are saying okay when we come back all the big news on the second amendment
[04:44.560 --> 04:51.520]  on syria and your phone calls big broadcast ted nugent you name it and a lot more coming up today

[09:13.920 --> 09:23.040]  with wiretap orders that is just some of the news we're going to be covering today also the gao
[09:23.040 --> 09:31.840]  the general accounting office to now investigate homeland security ammo purchases and that's from
[09:31.840 --> 09:40.560]  u.s news and world report right now and of course i was going to that link uh via
[09:42.560 --> 09:48.880]  drudge report and drudge report.com right underneath that link backlog on gun owners hits
[09:48.880 --> 09:56.400]  two million guns while questions continue to swirl about the department of homeland security's huge
[09:56.400 --> 10:03.840]  ammo spree americans are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain firearms while backlogs surge
[10:03.840 --> 10:12.560]  despite strum ruger gun shipments surpassing 500 000 for the first time in history almost every
[10:12.560 --> 10:18.880]  gun manufacturer i talked to uh has six months to a year to two years backlog that's why a barrett
[10:18.880 --> 10:25.200]  50 cal a year ago was five thousand dollars that i bought as an investment knowing this was coming
[10:26.080 --> 10:32.000]  and is now worth 25 000 so if i ever need to cash that in to keep funding the media operation we
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.840]  have it and so i said wow this is working and let me get another one uh you know as i saw the price
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.720]  going up about that i don't know six seven thousand dollars and it's 25 000 just an example
[10:42.720 --> 10:50.480]  of what's happening here and notice they've gone now in the media from saying that it's a
[10:50.480 --> 10:57.520]  conspiracy theory that they bought bullets to it's a conspiracy theory that we should be concerned
[10:57.520 --> 11:03.520]  about the bullets that's now what they're saying that that it's a conspiracy theory that we're
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.920]  concerned and i was just during the break reading the national review article that i just was told
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.760]  about right before i went on air uh the gospel according to alex jones and it says you know his
[11:13.760 --> 11:20.400]  conspiracy theory of the bullets has now gone mainstream it's kind of like saying his conspiracy
[11:20.400 --> 11:26.560]  theory that george washington exists has gone mainstream his conspiracy theory that jesus
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.880]  christ exists has or existed has now gone mainstream his conspiracy theory has gone
[11:32.880 --> 11:40.400]  conspiracy theory that the atlantic ocean uh is east of new york city uh has gone mainstream his
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.680]  conspiracy theory that mexico is the country south of the u.s border
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.600]  in the south is a conspiracy theory i mean they they are everything they've got is betting on the
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.800]  fact that you're stupid that you're not informed that you can't go verify our articles from over
[11:58.800 --> 12:04.880]  a year ago that linked to the federal biz site with the federal purchase orders and bids that
[12:04.880 --> 12:11.440]  under federal law are public so what are they going to do about things that are public they're
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.640]  just going to sit there and hope that you don't go click the links in an info wars.com article
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.840]  or a drudge report linked article and they are just hoping that you don't go look into it but
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.000]  what are they going to do even when fox news and and forbes are going well actually they did buy
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.560]  some bullets we should have a national discussion well big sis sits up there in congress and goes
[12:30.560 --> 12:36.800]  those are not credible media sources a known liar who ran fast and furious a false flag terror
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.240]  attack killing thousands of people hundreds on our side thousands in mexico conservative numbers
[12:42.240 --> 12:46.880]  are 400 some of the numbers are as high as 8 000 i mean there's like 60 000 plus dead the last you
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.720]  know five six years in mexico and growing but they just oh that's a conspiracy theory too i've
[12:52.720 --> 12:59.120]  seen articles saying alex jones pushes the fast and furious conspiracy theory i mean cbs news a
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.640]  year ago got the documents saying that they staged it to blame the second amendment that came out in
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.560]  the memos of course they shipped the guns into mexico to then track them back to deaths on both
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.720]  side to blame the second amendment how did i know that when obama first got in four years ago they
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.680]  gave press conferences with big sis and eric holder and the rest of them you all remember
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.440]  we've we've done the nightly news pieces we've we've played it here showing them when they said
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.600]  we know nothing about fast and furious we didn't know about the operation gunrunner we didn't know
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.240]  anything about this then we showed clips of them going we're running an operation gunrunner to

[13:42.160 --> 13:46.880]  conference and the media is like gee did they lie did they lie to congress saying that they didn't
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.560]  know they were up there saying we're tracking guns that came out of the us back you know into mexico
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.040]  and back here causing murders and the mexican president came out and said it's your fault

[14:01.120 --> 14:07.920]  per capita where the citizens have their guns taken but but the government and the mafia still
[14:07.920 --> 14:15.280]  has it that's the definition of a recipe an atmosphere a climate a soup an ether in which

[27:58.960 --> 28:03.520]  defense the ammo act there it is friday would prevent agencies from buying more ammunition

[34:30.160 --> 34:38.640]  magazines say kasenich is a infowars conspiracy theorist so now if anybody on the left right
[34:38.640 --> 34:44.800]  libertarian anything says hey our government's set up iraq with wmds our government's putting al-qaeda
[34:44.800 --> 34:51.040]  in syria that's an admitted fact even the cfr admits that if dennis kasenich comes out and
[34:51.040 --> 34:56.480]  says hey this is wrong and says the sky is blue he's now an infowars person see notice they're
[34:56.480 --> 35:00.960]  going after infowars they're now going from ignoring that name to trying to discredit it

[35:41.200 --> 35:45.520]  and it's so bizarre but then you look at history and look what all the other corrupt governments
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.600]  get away with and then i'm having my liberties taken because of al-qaeda threat and they go oh
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.320]  yeah the al-qaeda threats see the boston bombing the al-qaeda threat those guys are clear intelligence

[40:02.240 --> 40:09.040]  all of this said showing that i guess i'm one of the only people crazy enough to go up against
[40:09.040 --> 40:15.920]  these people i mean it's my instinct i mean whatever choice do we have they what i've always
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.320]  dreaded privately and i've even said this on air is that when the national review comes after info
[40:20.320 --> 40:26.160]  wars dot com that means we're really effective rachel maddow comes after us it's not a big deal
[40:26.800 --> 40:30.240]  cnn comes after us you know it's not a big deal because libertarians and conservatives
[40:30.240 --> 40:35.040]  will immediately go oh alex is good when you really know i'm effective is when they have
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.960]  the republicans come after me the same ones who all day try to keep libertarians and conservatives
[40:40.960 --> 40:46.960]  on a reservation of mitt romney type republicans who'll give us open borders anti-gun garbage
[40:46.960 --> 40:52.080]  i saw a fox news piece where they go you know the zarnev brothers they came here and got a hundred
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.640]  thousand dollars a year in welfare that number's out you know they got the american dream of free
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.760]  housing and everything i've got this clip we may play it later and then they turned on us so the
[41:01.760 --> 41:08.240]  american dream is not free welfare and all this garbage then they have this anti-immigrant talk
[41:08.240 --> 41:13.680]  but it's only in in words to then act like they're doing something about it america is being
[41:13.680 --> 41:19.040]  systematically conquered economically and financially and and well the same thing and
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.960]  culturally by the globalist they're bringing in people from countries that have no history of
[41:22.960 --> 41:27.920]  freedom because they'll go along with it god bless them i wish they had freedom america doesn't
[41:27.920 --> 41:33.200]  export liberty it's been conquered it now exports tyranny but they can compare us to another
[41:33.200 --> 41:39.920]  tyrannical country and go well um you know what are you for russia or you don't know i live here
[41:39.920 --> 41:45.680]  this is my republic i want america back and because i espouse ideas that are truly americana
[41:45.680 --> 41:49.440]  i'm under attack so pray for us spread the word about the broadcast because when you have national
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.960]  review coming out in big stories and basically demonizing alex jones yours truly and then saying
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.960]  oh it's a religion they believe in the new world order they believe the bullets were bought they
[42:00.960 --> 42:06.240]  believe there's globalism while the globalists brag in newspapers like the financial times and
[42:06.240 --> 42:10.000]  newsweek but from a perspective of global government's good see if global government's
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.560]  good and you say it's good i'd be invited to the cfr i'd be all over national news i'd be the darling
[42:15.840 --> 42:21.920]  i don't want to be on your sinking ship sorry but if i say it's bad oh then it doesn't exist
[42:21.920 --> 42:27.040]  now here's the thing do you pass or fail the test america are you so dumb as to see all this
[42:27.040 --> 42:32.560]  happening and not realize how transparent the propaganda is they're using the same propaganda
[42:32.560 --> 42:38.320]  on me they used on barry goldwater and that they used on the john birch society that they used on
[42:38.320 --> 42:44.160]  ron paul bashing him in the 90s now they don't do it so much because ron paul won he won the hearts
[42:44.160 --> 42:49.840]  and minds and see we're we're winning now this is not the 50s and 60s and 70s where where a guy with
[42:49.840 --> 42:57.040]  a fake at atlantic british accent i was saying what do you think about the future the integration
[42:57.040 --> 43:08.240]  of the systems uh american system worldwide the play forward in fact i'm going to now i'm going
[43:08.240 --> 43:14.560]  to now do this interview with um because i'm the son of a robber baron steel cold baron who made
[43:14.560 --> 43:20.720]  his money off of consolidation of monopolies for example then i'm going to intellectually um
[43:21.360 --> 43:29.920]  here speaking right now with uh the man named david knight in four wars david what is this you
[43:29.920 --> 43:35.520]  have to say about the religion of allah the church of alex jones national review because
[43:35.520 --> 43:45.840]  william f buck has been what should i say resurrected here today with a fake atlantic accent
[43:45.840 --> 43:53.040]  to discuss here with us on air uh this uh dangerous young man uh david knight again
[43:53.040 --> 43:59.760]  william f buck here for the national review uh here with you on pbs so we're on the pbs but
[43:59.760 --> 44:05.760]  we're anti-government though what what are we now saying what what is your defense of your pitiful
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.160]  alex jones well you know alex so what we're seeing here from the national review you had the
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.760]  you had msnbc which is really the neo-con cia left now we've got national review which is
[44:15.760 --> 44:22.080]  really the neo-con cia right attacking you and i find it interesting because the first part of the
[44:22.080 --> 44:26.320]  the article well the whole article is really about how it's not about information but it's about
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.720]  faith and uh she says in the second paragraph jones's theories have sometimes gained currency
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.920]  out of outside of info wars recently he reported that homeland security was buying a notable amount
[44:37.920 --> 44:43.040]  of ammunition as if it was just a single report and then that that uh she mentions the fact that
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.560]  congressman and senators are now having issues with it but now listen to the way she ends it
[44:46.560 --> 44:53.120]  here she says but as tends to be the case with info wars narratives it turns out to be a non-issue
[44:53.120 --> 44:58.080]  the dhs buys large quantities of ammo to use as at law enforcement training centers and there's
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.920]  little change in the quantity purchased this year compared with previous years that's absolutely not
[45:03.920 --> 45:07.920]  true i mean if they're going to try to destroy you they need to get a little bit closer to the truth
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.480]  well they're counting on i mean here's the deal and they're also trying to demonize tea party
[45:12.480 --> 45:17.840]  republicans who they're now discovering a lot of them are my listeners yeah we'll call congressman
[45:17.840 --> 45:23.120]  from tennessee or the carolinas and as guests i go well guess we'd love to come on i listened
[45:23.120 --> 45:26.800]  yesterday to the show you know when i'm talking to these guys during the breaks they'll they'll
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.640]  have a little bit of distance once they're on air which is fine but but the truth is they're
[45:30.640 --> 45:34.800]  listening they're going and checking they're finding out 99 of the time we're telling the
[45:34.800 --> 45:41.840]  truth do i make mistakes sometimes yes but again now it's enough to 35 year war it was a 25 year
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.640]  war uh in iraq and it's thousands of bullets more than each person in the military uses
[45:46.640 --> 45:51.600]  four times they're buying armored vehicles and all this they cannot deny that they're that they're
[45:51.600 --> 45:58.480]  militarizing and having drills every day now in major cities of martial law to acclimate us and
[45:58.480 --> 46:03.760]  the army manuals say for gun confiscation because i'll tell you what they're really scared of david
[46:03.760 --> 46:08.080]  they're scared they're now gonna not just look at the bullets but the army manuals for fema camps
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.160]  and the army manuals for gun confiscation guys type them in put them on screen for tv viewers
[46:12.160 --> 46:15.840]  they are scared to death because now if the rest of the country listens to us
[46:15.840 --> 46:21.440]  and by the way folks you can kill me shut me down destroy me the message is already sent america
[46:21.440 --> 46:27.440]  knows there's an authoritarian takeover happening and of course the cia east coast establishment
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.720]  fake right wing that took over real conservatism in this country and and you know help stop the
[46:32.720 --> 46:39.200]  john birch society from from saving america early on you guys are not fighting in 1965 okay people
[46:39.200 --> 46:45.120]  know the truth now look at the gun purchases going on we know national review and and i'm
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.000]  sorry go ahead david well the whole thing is really kind of a snarky attack the very first
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.120]  sentence says info wars is a misnomer at its core 9-11 truth or alex jones's infamous website is
[46:55.120 --> 47:00.080]  not about info it's about faith and then it goes on to say he's an evangelist looking for converts
[47:00.880 --> 47:07.440]  the whole thing is basically set up to make uh you and your listeners look like idiots
[47:07.440 --> 47:13.280]  but they look like idiots when they try to uh spend this story about the ammunition i mean
[47:13.280 --> 47:18.160]  the facts are out there we've actually linked to the places where they were doing the purchases
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.840]  because we knew that people were going to push back against us look that count on this for over
[47:21.840 --> 47:28.080]  a year sure yeah let's go back to the 9-11 stuff let's go back to that okay they always spin it
[47:29.200 --> 47:34.400]  i mean this was an exact quote when i bullhorned him at the dnc in 2008 in denver people can pull
[47:34.400 --> 47:41.760]  up alex jones you know bullhorns msnbc and and chris matthews says alex jones says bush was at
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.840]  the towers with a plunger like wiley coyote and blew it up i never said that in fact i said bush
[47:47.840 --> 47:51.120]  probably didn't even know because i talked to somebody that was in the bunker that night
[47:51.840 --> 47:57.760]  and and and said you know bush was running around well well i think it was marvin bush or one of
[47:57.760 --> 48:00.880]  them came back and even gave a speech at uti of day pub where he talked about him in the bunker
[48:00.880 --> 48:04.320]  running around you know scared his underwear and i was told that by somebody else that was there
[48:04.320 --> 48:08.800]  you know it's at night you know he's asleep but he's kind of watching tv freaked out he either
[48:08.800 --> 48:12.960]  that he's a great actor which he isn't i'm even and i'm not defending george bush he was a bad
[48:12.960 --> 48:18.400]  globalist puppet the point is is that the military industrial complex in the pnak documents september
[48:18.400 --> 48:24.480]  20th wrote anybody can read this dick cheney we need a pearl harbor catalyzing event to be able
[48:24.480 --> 48:28.880]  to get americans to accept giving up their liberties and launching these wars 3 000 deads
[48:28.880 --> 48:34.400]  what pearl harbor did 3 911 incredible we have all these documents this history of it and you
[48:34.400 --> 48:39.280]  have norad standing down and you have the dean of the defense language school going public and
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.840]  saying muhammad ano was trained in his class you have the head of the u.s embassy in jeddah saying
[48:43.840 --> 48:48.480]  they were ordered to let the hijackers back in the u.s just like when more stuff gets blown up
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.280]  by al-qaeda or they or they take the fall i'll be on air going our government gave al-qaeda the
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.840]  heat-seeking missiles in bengazi our government's putting them in charge this is wrong and they'll
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.760]  be how dare you traitor after al-qaeda blew down the jetliner you know that's coming folks how dare
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.480]  you say the government did it no criminal globalist networks want to take our liberty
[49:10.480 --> 49:15.680]  they're funding radicals to do it now that is very simple and easy to understand and i'm sick
[49:15.680 --> 49:21.520]  and tired of them anybody that goes along with this government is aiding al-qaeda when i said
[49:21.520 --> 49:28.080]  obama is the global head of al-qaeda a month ago it's true it's true he heads up nato and nato runs
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.960]  al-qaeda david knight well you know she says uh that basically these bullets don't exist that
[49:32.960 --> 49:37.440]  you're a crazy paranoid conspiracy she says here's the way she closes the article she says
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.360]  it's easy to write him off as a kook and a lunatic that's what they did to jeremiah but the
[49:41.360 --> 49:45.680]  difference between jones and prophet jeremiah is that jones appears to be a paranoid well i
[49:45.680 --> 49:50.480]  tell you what uh you know jeremiah looked pretty paranoid to the people that he was prophesying to
[49:50.480 --> 49:54.800]  and while we're on that just in case you think this is all paranoid listen to this it just
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.640]  broke and on bright bart jakari brought this into me this is a quote today we face incredibly
[50:00.640 --> 50:05.840]  well-funded gangs of fundamentalist christian monsters who terrorize fellow americans by
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.360]  forcing their weaponized and twisted version of christianity upon their helpless subordinates
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.880]  and our nation's armed forces these words were recently written by mickey weinstein
[50:16.880 --> 50:22.080]  founder of the military religious freedom foundation this is a guy who goes on to quote
[50:22.080 --> 50:26.880]  the southern poverty law center and guess who he's really talking about here none other than
[50:26.880 --> 50:33.040]  people like dr james dobson leader of focus on the family so we've seen now in just a
[50:33.040 --> 50:37.520]  couple of weeks we've seen the most mainline christian conservative groups out there i'm
[50:37.520 --> 50:41.120]  going to have you back in the later in the third hour to talk about this because i want to get
[50:41.120 --> 50:45.440]  into this and you have christian groups being shot up now yeah and people say they did it for
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.000]  the southern poverty law center and then you have the army manual saying christians period
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.080]  are extremists folks these are the authoritarians trying to take our country over absolutely let's
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.360]  get that clip and play that later we're also going to get the clip of the brothers saying
[50:59.360 --> 51:06.240]  they didn't do it of course that's where he got his throat cut out curious about what comes next
[51:06.960 --> 51:11.680]  next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house
[51:11.680 --> 51:18.480]  has been ransacked by burglars fool the bad guys with a new improved fake tv you asked for it we
[51:18.480 --> 51:24.080]  listened and we made our new fake tv three times brighter than our previous model the brightness

[51:31.040 --> 51:36.160]  while you're away from home and when burglars think someone is home watching television they're
[51:36.160 --> 51:42.560]  likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake tv is only $39.95

[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.880]  known now than ever and uh there is a positive energy of defiance and uh of voter retaliation
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.800]  taking place out there because the corruption abuse of power in this government is at an all-time
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:20.480]  evil and criminal you're absolutely right uh you know the the establishment the corrupt
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.360]  kleptocrats are really doubling down and i think that's because they know they're in trouble
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:33.200]  the real spirit of 1776 is rising again why do you think that's happening well again now you
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.520]  don't have to go far let's just go to the uh correspondence dinner the medium the celebrity uh
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.320]  stupid orgy and and i'm sure you watched it because we have to know how the enemy operates
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:55.760]  and i i hope that everybody can youtube or witness the masterful the absolute gobles hitler-type
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:04.800]  deceit from president barack hussein obama this guy has been so groomed and so nurtured and so
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:13.520]  trained on his masterful deception deceit abuse of power where he he makes jokes as the ultimate
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:20.320]  deflection that he looks in the mirror and doesn't see the the handsome uh tough rugged muslim
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.840]  socialist that he was a short while ago and everybody roars with laughter because that is some funny stuff
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:35.040]  but he he does it to make sure that he blows holes in those types of accusations when the evidence
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:42.800]  against this man the evidence against the felon recommending the felony recommending vice president
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:51.520]  the felony a criminal uh gun-running attorney general the felony treasonous hillary clinton
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:13:00.160]  secretary of state in vengazi i mean it really is beyond the pale what they're getting away with and
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:07.280]  how many clueless americans are buying this crap and so we have to examine their tactics because
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:15.600]  his tactics you have to admit alex he is the best that i have ever known in the smoke and mirrors
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.440]  and deception but that doesn't take away that here's the same guy that will tell america that
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.120]  because the republicans won't raise the debt ceiling because the republicans because we the
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.920]  people won't allow the abandonment of accountability when it comes to spending in the government and
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:41.360]  he and his family spend a hundred million dollars on vacations but as the republicans thought that
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.360]  there's not enough money for children's medicine and it goes on and then he sends the jets the most
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.600]  expensive jets we have to our enemies in egypt that are have already warned us and threatened
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:00.320]  us that they'll use them against us i mean i just hope that americans who are who know the scam the
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:05.920]  depth of the evil in this scam perpetrated by the corruption in our government and the corrupt
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.880]  officials in our i hope we are not just listening to alex show is that we are talking to our friends
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.240]  and our colleagues and our fellow workers and our family and our people at church and school
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.920]  we've got to educate americans to the level of criminality in this government right now
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.240]  i agree with you if you go up to drudgereport.com he's got a big giant link up there at the top of
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:39.120]  the screen to mainstream news boston herald one hundred thousand dollars a year to the two brothers
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.720]  that reportedly were involved in the bombing and and and then now they're trying to restrict black
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.840]  powder which i like to hunt with my 50 caliber black powder gun my son loves to load it and shoot
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:56.080]  it as well the one i bought at cabela's about a year ago and they're now trying to tell me that
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.440]  i've got to register a new background and then and then keep a certificate to buy black powder
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.840]  for what somebody that they brought in and funded and protected five agencies it was one two three
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.360]  four five agencies knew what was going on and let these guys do it so they can take my freedom and
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.080]  come after my black powder what do you say to that ted nugent well i'm going to do something
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.000]  that you know i don't know if you've ever done i don't get to hear your show all the time alex
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.960]  but i talk to a lot of people these nightly meetings on tour and these people are real
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.280]  concerned about the corruption and the criminality in our government so they tell me what a great job
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.960]  you're doing but let me do something different because i i know the guys in the federal law
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:43.280]  enforcement agencies i know the dea and the atf the fbi and the secret service i know the u.s
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.960]  marshals but i can they come to my concerts and we break bread and we we compare animal and we
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.920]  train and we we hunt together sure they were upset about fast and furious i'm just saying it's clear
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.840]  that why do you think the federal government funded these guys 100 000 i'm sorry go ahead
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.200]  well it goes into what i'm about to bring up and that is hey my friends in the fbi
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.760]  where are the warriors where are the the whistleblowers how could the how could we
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:15.200]  investigate how could the heroes of the of the fbi maybe it wasn't the heroes maybe it wasn't
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:21.760]  the actual warriors in the fbi but how do you investigate these guys check them out see the
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:28.720]  list that they're on see the list that there's their mother is on see that she hottest relationship
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:35.440]  see the radicalization from the islamist voodoo punks that these guys were associated with and
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:46.000]  then not sound below what the hell are you guys doing well i mean we know it's now obama's justice
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.480]  department we know good guys blew the whistle on fast and furious but that ended up going nowhere
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.800]  when they were caught red-handed lying and now they're going to use it to take our our basic
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.040]  liberties i mean imagine just imagine this going on 20 years ago in america what's your take on
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:06.640]  them going after black powder well again that that's smoke and mirrors it's just like the uh
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:13.520]  the squalor that president obama and all his anti-freedom america haters that rallied behind
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:19.280]  him at the press conference they claimed that you and i don't care about innocent children
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:27.360]  being slaughtered because we didn't support his good lie the absolute scam of background check
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:35.440]  nonsense which was actually counterproductive to reducing crime and reduce mass murder same
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:42.000]  with the black powder it's all smoke and mirrors when you've got a a vice president that recommends
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:51.280]  publicly on television to commit enemies with the double-barreled shotgun to to violate all proven
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.640]  tactics for self-defense by blasting your double-barreled shotgun through the door if
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:00.960]  you think somebody's attacking them even though it might be your friend your neighbor your child
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:07.200]  unbelievable and then you've got the atf recommending that somehow black powder muzzle
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:13.840]  loader hunters might be behind the slaughter of innocents i mean alex this wouldn't make a
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:19.680]  believable saturday night live skit it wouldn't that was my next question what did you make of
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.560]  them foaming at the mouth trying to find a right-wing patsy or libertarian patsy and the
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.080]  media even said we've made an arrest on that wednesday it looks like it's going to be a
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.320]  right-winger then they said no we haven't made an arrest they were really trying to blame the
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.600]  tea party for this bombing well they've done it so many times in the past because what the tea
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:44.160]  party represents and what you and i represent and what's what what the awakened american represents
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:52.800]  is a is a an intelligence to the scam the big scam is being led by the uh the groomed america

[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:34.720]  are in absolute frustration and and and heartbreak that their boss their commander in chief violates
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.800]  the constitution that he has made an oath to while their hero warrior blood brothers are being blown
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:48.080]  to smithereens and blown up while executing their oath in the same constitution that the president

[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:28.560]  kandahar and fallujah and uh kosovo and uh tikrit and taji and unnamed mountain passes in afghanistan
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:36.160]  where we uh escorted flag great coffins home and the sensation i get in my mind conclusively is
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:43.200]  that these guys take that oath to the constitution to heart as seriously as anything mankind is
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:50.320]  capable of and when they see the the abuse of power and the corruption and the sheer criminality
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:58.080]  and the violation of their oath to the constitution by their commander in chief these guys just can't
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:04.080]  understand that that they're giving their life they're watching their brothers get blown to
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:10.960]  smithereens alex coming home and flag great coffins and then they see the commander in chief
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:18.160]  who is their boss violating the oath that they're dying for the frustration level is is evil it's
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:24.720]  palpable it's it's it's it's like a disease and their frustration so my goal is to challenge
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:30.000]  everybody listening to us right now on the alex jones radio show get involved with the military
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.840]  charity reach out go to a va home sit down and tell these guys that yes the leaders of our
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.360]  nation are corrupt but we the people dearly appreciate and thank them and we're getting
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.840]  exactly america may have been captured at the federal level by globalists but the real america
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.480]  is still here and alive and you know turn their energy against fighting corruption once they get
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.480]  out of the military don't turn it against themselves but i know it's got to be confusing
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.120]  obama is a hijacker of this country we were talking during the break about how they're
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:04.000]  funding radical muslims funding al-qaeda and i believe letting them attack to then take our
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.280]  liberties they now say the tea party is the main focus not al-qaeda and you agreed with me uh
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.320]  uncle ted what do you think's happening with the funding of terrorists well again when when we
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.840]  look the other way i mean all we have to do is go back and really examine 9 11 when all the different
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.360]  federal agencies were warned about guys learning to fly planes but not land them and the guys are
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:32.400]  in cells and guys are are being caught and guys are stopped at customs and then waved through and
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.680]  guys are on terrorist lists and then they're monitored but then they're lost in the shuffle
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.800]  and and the agencies weren't even allowed to communicate because of the wall the bill clinton
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.640]  law that forbid various federal agents to even share information i mean alice you just got to
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:56.400]  be kidding me and the point is here in 2013 that kind of anti-americanism that kind of manipulation
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:03.280]  still goes on with the the welfare scams and the grants that go to these organizations that try to
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:10.000]  tell us that the islam suicide bombers are a religion of peace i mean it just is all so
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.720]  offensive intellectually bankrupt and ultimately treasonous i use the word treasonous because it's
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.560]  accurate it is in closing a minute and a half left now they have to admit two billion plus
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.120]  bullets billion delivered billion more coming roughly 12 times any previous record in a year
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.440]  now congress is investigating their hopping man what do you think the billions of bullets and
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.080]  all this domestic training to go up against well you know against tea partiers uh is for
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:43.680]  well i saw jed palatano with her scam of an excuse making groomed and scripted uh response
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:50.960]  and i don't believe the world will be at present is manipulating conditions to do what he can to
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:56.720]  start a civil war i believe that he's brainwashing various agencies but let me leave you on this note

[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.920]  the randomness of ted nugent you know calling him to the show what happened is he tried to get in
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:09.600]  yesterday at the end of the second hour and i guess couldn't get through show he's got the
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:14.000]  hotline number now he called in a month or so ago on the sunday show when he was at his ranch

[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.320]  hardcore a spirit of victory it's infecting libertarians and conservatives and i'm telling
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:29.760]  you ladies and gentlemen that's the spirit we need that is the spirit we need is a spirit of
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:35.280]  positive victory but also outright nastiness because the globalists are nasty in what they're
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:41.760]  doing we need to get nasty in their faces and not care what they say about us not care uh because we
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:47.040]  know we're in the right and i'm again i'm a nice to my friends and family i'm a very sweet person
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.120]  but these you know these globalists are funding al-qaeda to murder christians in mass right now
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:57.040]  in syria they're funding radical muslims to attack this country you know off air nugent was like he
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.640]  was like oh yeah there's no doubt they're using it to take our liberties you know on air he basically
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.960]  went there but not all the way the point is anybody who's got a brain knows what's going on here
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.440]  and the media will spin it going alex jones says there's no radical muslims and bush had the
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:14.560]  plunger on 9 11 that's not what i said i said they're funding them and letting them attack us
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:20.640]  to take our liberties and in some cases totally staging it criminal networks that want to be able
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.400]  to take the basic liberties of this republic and i personally have had enough of it that's what
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.600]  i'm getting at that's what i'm saying now that said i'm gonna go to david knight for about 10
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.960]  minutes and i promise your calls to the bottom of the next hour when uh the editor of american
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.800]  free press joins us and that of course is mark anderson he's taking the mantle from jim tucker
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.680]  who does have real bilderberg sources i mean i've had a camera crew with him in istanbul covering
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.320]  it when he literally had to duck into shops and even though he had really bad hips he was suddenly
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.600]  sort of jogging to hide another shop until his source met him and it's a big deal having him
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:03.600]  die and anderson did get the two sources um pretty amazing stuff and we believe we know where it is
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.480]  this year in england i wasn't going to go to england i was going to send some of the crew
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:14.560]  and i've got to make that decision now i'm going to make that the next day or so but i think i
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.480]  really need to go to bilderberg this year you know i love to travel i have a wanderlust but
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:26.160]  at the same time i don't travel a lot i'm traveling right now obviously because i can
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.640]  just get more done at the office i can just you know have five tvs on and computers everywhere
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.040]  and just kind of get in that zone and then handle all the other stuff that goes on at the office
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.320]  like we need to put light bulbs back in and carry the trash out uh you know take care of the house
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:46.960]  and the dogs and visit my grandmother and all the other stuff and take the kids to you know
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:54.240]  sports practice but i am extremely extremely tempted to go to bilderberg this year we're
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.200]  going to have watson obviously covering it with his brother steve uh and i'm not sure i don't
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:05.040]  and i'm not sure i don't want to give away who i'm going to send right now but i'm definitely sending
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:09.200]  crew obviously okay that said uh ladies and gentlemen that's coming up at the bottom of the
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:15.520]  next hour uh please support the broadcast i mean we're in the eye of the storm we're being attacked
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:24.400]  by rachel maddow by cnn by uh the new york times by nightline by rolling stone just by everything
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.800]  and by national review and they don't have national review come after a libertarian or
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:33.120]  conservative unless they think you're really dangerous and you know what i am dangerous to
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:38.560]  tyranny i mean look i have an organic right as a free human and and to not be a slave and the
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.520]  globalist mafia are stealing 85 billion a month gutting my children's future you're coming after

[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.400]  women's bathroom if they want you're like well big deal that's their gender it's all about these fake
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:03.680]  rights that don't exist versus my basic liberty being taken it's not that i'm against people that
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.400]  think they're a woman or a man or whatever i don't even care give me a break it's not even in my
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.000]  radar screen i could care less i care about people but other you know there's articles up now where
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.080]  colleges are going to let you choose i mean i dealt at access tv with a famous austin transvestite
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.480]  transvestite who died a few years ago they're talking about building a statue too going in
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:33.680]  the bathroom men and women and vomiting all over the walls when they would do whatever they were
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.000]  doing in there i mean i'm talking about several transvestites cramming their way into the men's
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.640]  bathroom the women's bathroom you you'd go in there to comb your hair before you went on air
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.160]  there they were and they finally got thrown out of there because of it and said it was discrimination
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.480]  because they were transvestites no it was because whatever they were injecting in there
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.320]  made them throw up all over the i mean imagine every week throw up all over the walls
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.800]  okay that i mean and then i had an office by this guy the bad luck is i had an office where we would
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.760]  look down turn out he lived around the block and i would have to watch him every day in the
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.880]  cheerleader outfit through my office window on the air doing deals and stuff in cars and stumbling
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.760]  around everywhere and and then and then i'm not a trendy because i don't bow down i have to go in

[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.040]  know the military is now trying to make men and women be in the same bathroom that isn't breaking
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:12.800]  down gender barriers that's breaking down humanity it takes a lot as a man you know when you're in
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:18.000]  the civil air patrol or something quasi-military to sit there in a barracks next to guys you know

[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.080]  to the bathroom or men i've read about in foxholes while people are shooting at you for two days you
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.480]  can't get out of the foxhole in the battle of fallujah while a guy's crapping in a plastic

[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.040]  conscript our girls now they want to bring the draft back and make them go war is dehumanizing
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.560]  and civilized civilized cultures don't put their women in that probably get some great place you
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.640]  get to go and i don't want my daughters growing up in a country where some transvestite comes
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.320]  walking into the thing hopped out of their brain on drugs vomiting and crapping all over the place

[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.360]  i am so sick of the anti-human ugly garbage being forced on everybody and i'm sick of it
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.200]  it has nothing to do with disliking people for what they're into what they do is they
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.880]  take the worst examples of heterosexuals homosexuals it doesn't matter and then they
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.000]  put that out there to show us an ugly version of humanity instead of a beautiful version of
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.760]  reality to teach us that ugliness is good okay and i'm tired of it i you know what's going to
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:38.320]  you know what's going to save us is beauty and honor and purity and strength that's what leads
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:42.640]  civilizations out of the dark age and we're entering a new dark age by a bunch of criminals
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:48.400]  that want us so jacked up and so screwed up and so confused and so dumbed down by this culture that
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:53.360]  we don't know evil when we see it happening we are under a curse richard's sitting over there

[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:01.760]  older crews been there longer they saw what i was talking about we had to sit there every day and
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:08.880]  deal with it and let me tell you i get really sick of it sometimes um i mean it's just come on man
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:16.560]  this is all about people i'm just so sick of it and ron paul says police manhunt for suspects
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.920]  scarier than attack that's in the washington times we posted his article uh yesterday at
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.920]  info wars dot com ron paul liberty was attacked in boston as well and it certainly was now
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:33.200]  that said we are under unmitigated total attack the family's under attack christians are under
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.840]  attack and now more than ever i want to hire more reporters i want to hire more camera people more
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.400]  video editors we could do so much more if we have the funds and info wars has to be strong
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:49.520]  because i'll say this you know my dad's mother and dad had some money he still put himself through
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.400]  dental school without any of their help i think once when our only car broke down they got us a
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.880]  new car refused to not you know sit back and not give us help i didn't get any help starting info
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:06.320]  wars dot com even though my dad had some money i i i ladies and gentlemen built this operation
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.480]  with your help and now over the years i've got a little bit of family money and things i've gotten
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:15.520]  i've put it into the operation the truth is i've run info wars dot com some years at a deficit
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:21.600]  and put my own money into it but the issue is why didn't my parents help me out more because they
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.840]  knew if they helped me out it would make me dependent and i would never flourish i was
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.280]  watching gerald cilente host the third hour yesterday i just sat back and watched it he was
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.440]  talking about the new york times bragging and they do that on purpose to condition you and break your
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:39.680]  will to accept all this there they were bragging about all these people that would give a hundred
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.800]  thousand dollars or seventy five thousand dollars to to the governor in a in a in a bribe but it's
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.040]  a legal bribe that they made it legal and then how their son or daughter would get a seventy five
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.600]  thousand hundred thousand dollar a year job which over the time would be millions and i mean they
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:00.000]  just flaunt this stuff in our face but see my parents didn't want me to be like that so i built
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:07.520]  info wars a hundred percent on my own a hundred percent on my own with your support and that's
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.160]  what they're scared of and again my parents did that so that i would sink or swim so that i would
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:17.280]  be somebody they didn't want me to be an apathy and and that's what the society's turned into now

[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.560]  us cultural death so that we just get used to squalor and corruption and death and tyranny and
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.880]  death and tyranny and evil and injustice show that we have no compass so they can overrun us
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.360]  david knight absolutely alex and what they're doing is they're also as you mentioned they're
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:53.840]  attacking the family and no better example of this is the the memos that we saw from lieutenant
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:01.680]  jack rich lieutenant colonel i should say and now we've got some information from a mr michael
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:07.120]  weinstein he is the founder of the military religious freedom foundation and uh you know
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:11.200]  they're portraying the american family association the family research council
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:16.720]  focus on the family they're portraying them as hate groups and we've seen the family research
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.200]  council actually attacked physically attacked with a guy who wanted to shoot it up and he was
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.320]  a follower of the script from the southern poverty law center and yet those organizations have never
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.720]  engaged in the kind of hate speech that we see coming out of the southern poverty law center
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.680]  people uh listen to what this this guy said and and to understand who this guy is now the other
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:41.280]  guy was a lieutenant colonel this guy is a consultant to the pentagon to develop new
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.960]  policies on religious tolerance and of course one of those policies is court-martialing military
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:53.520]  chaplains who share the gospel during spiritual counseling in the military so uh listen listen
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:59.520]  to what he says about uh james dobson he says that he illustrates the extremist militant nature of
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:06.640]  these virulently homophobic organizations and their rhetorically charged propaganda let's call
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:12.400]  these ignoble actions what they are the senseless and cowardly squallings of human monsters and then
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:18.320]  he says we need to uh support and applaud lieutenant colonel frank rich who uh i'm sorry
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.840]  jack rich who attacked the uh american family association family research council he says
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:29.680]  we should vigorously support the continuing efforts to expose pathologically anti-gay islamophobic
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:36.240]  and rabidly intolerant agitators for what they are die-hard enemies of the u.s constitution
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:41.600]  monsters one and all to do anything less would be to roll out a red carpet to those who would usher
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:49.040]  in a blood-drenched draconian era of persecutions nationalistic militarism and superstitious
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:54.800]  theocracy so uh that's what he's calling for and he one last thing i'm going to say what he does is
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:02.640]  he goes further in his remarks to link uh sexual assault in the military to to proselytizing in the
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.360]  military to sharing the gospel with someone he calls that spiritual rape so uh it's i i've never
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:15.520]  seen such over-the-top rhetoric and yet this is a guy who is a consultant to the military but the
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.840]  way christians need to react to this i think is not to get caught up in this culture war
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:26.800]  uh of us versus them and piling on now that it looked like initially that christians and
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.480]  constitutionalists are going to be in the crosshairs of those who are going to be blamed
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:36.400]  for the boston bombing and now that they're blaming islamicists on this we need to not just
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.400]  pile on and say yeah yeah kill all the muslims because what's happening with this is we're seeing
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.480]  really kind of a narrative set up on this and these these brothers may have in fact done it
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.600]  they may have been patsies they may have had a part in it but they are not the lone bombers and
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.760]  there was not a lone radicalizer what we've seen coming out in the last several days uh it's clear
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:03.120]  to everyone including a pretty funny clip from george w bush they came out and he actually talked
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.520]  about uh well i think this might have been a concert and he stopped right in the middle of
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.320]  that word conspiracy and they were asking him to compare it to the 9 11 bombings and so he said
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.040]  this might be another conspiracy is what he was starting to say and he backed off on that but the
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.560]  bottom line is is that they're trying to they everybody knows that these guys were not acting
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.080]  alone and so what's the bigger uh story here and they're trying to pin this on a guy some mysterious
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:35.360]  missha and so the press is saying that they found missha but the guy that they're fingering is
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.640]  actually a guy who lives in rhode island he in a small house with his elderly parents he doesn't
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.200]  have a lot of money to give these brothers new sports cars like they're reportedly driving around
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:55.440]  in and in terms of him being a radical uh islamic uh recruiter his father escaped armenian or armenia
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.560]  as an armenian christian who is under uh i'm sorry not armenia but he escaped asher baijan
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:06.800]  uh under islamic persecution as an armenian christian so they're kind of running into a
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:12.240]  dead end with that but they also need to under they also need to explain this uh pretty lavish
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:18.400]  lifestyle this secular lifestyle these supposedly radical islamic terrorists were leading so they're
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.760]  coming out with a uh story that's everywhere today all over the news absolutely and remember it was
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.600]  absolutely and and going out to break here it was missha that supposedly said he loved infowars
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.000]  well now missha has been interviewed by two different papers he said he barely once i didn't
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.640]  even know him or barely knew him didn't give him any funding this is all just complete bull he
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:44.160]  didn't say any of that why would they try to write infowars.com into the narrative because i'm the
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:50.160]  one saying intelligence agency sent the older brother to georgia under a cia program and no
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.760]  one has challenged that what came out in the russian press absolutely this is smoking gun info
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:00.480]  they're funding and radicalizing and setting up patsies to take our liberties that's the motive

[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:25.920]  you know saying while they're being shot at we didn't do it we didn't do it
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:32.800]  look if the cie funded them just admit it and then say they were double agents or something or say
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.600]  okay we had a drill but they don't want to look at any of that and you know the big issue is here
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:44.960]  they're then using all the anger over welfare to point at this and to make a big issue out of it
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.920]  over and over and over again like oh look they got their money from welfare when they were getting
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.080]  more money than they could have gotten from welfare just like the supposed aurora shooter
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.960]  got 30 something thousand dollars a year in a darpa funding now the truth is these guys were
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.440]  being handled now there's one chance in a hundred they could have been real double agents who double
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:09.280]  crossed and bombed but they don't fit that profile so bottom line government is the author of this
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:15.520]  again to take our freedoms david knight putting bookends on that yeah it's uh there's articles
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:19.680]  all over the web about how they got a hundred thousand dollars and it people are assuming
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:25.840]  that's over just one year there's only one or two sources that i've seen one of them is wcvb
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.960]  in boston television station there they reported that that's been since 2002 in other words that's
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.480]  something over a decade so first of all divide that number down by 10 so that's about ten
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:39.200]  thousand dollars that's also for the family that's not just for these boys that would be the parents
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:46.160]  that were there but what they're ignoring is jp morgan got 560 million dollars in processing
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.240]  welfare payments and before i get to that though let me just say that one of the reasons i believe
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.480]  that they're doing this publicizing this hundred thousand dollar figure is because they have to
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:57:01.440]  explain all the fancy cars and the secular lifestyle that these supposedly radical muslims
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:06.720]  were living these muslim terrorists that they're portraying them as and they don't have a source
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:12.400]  that can explain that so they're trying now to take the cumulative uh welfare recipient uh
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:18.400]  receipts for a period of 10 years and imply that they got all that money at once because this guy
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:24.400]  that they fingered as the mysterious misa is absolutely a dead end i mean even the fact that uh
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:28.720]  the people that supposedly fingered him are now both dead but again he's somebody doesn't have
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:34.000]  any money even if he was a radicalizer even if he rejects his armenian christian father's uh faith
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.760]  he came here to escape persecution for being a christian and supposedly his son is now a radical
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:46.160]  islamic uh you know uh radicalizer but even if you buy that the guy doesn't have the money so
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:52.400]  they're trying to do that but we reported on the story about jp morgan getting 560 million dollars
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:58.240]  and they're making money off of every food stamps transaction and this is something that
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:04.880]  they're plugging the department of agriculture is actually sending spanish flyers uh to mexico
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:11.920]  oh no no 15 years ago i saw articles where california state was putting ads in spanish
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:17.520]  speaking papers in mexico saying come here have your baby for free and you all get on welfare
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:24.000]  they want to bankrupt the country and then citizens literally do not get any of these
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.360]  services so this is the goal this is the plan david knight thank you so much you'll pop in

[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.240]  like-minded people i've been mobbed here in hot springs arkansas with listeners
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.000]  yeah um first thing i want to get into is did you see the cnn headline yesterday
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:16.720]  where uh sharia came out and said that uh the west is uh manipulating manipulating the evidence
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.760]  of weapons of mass destruction just like they did in iraq i mean yes and then it was called
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:27.680]  a conspiracy theory uh that oh they have a conspiracy theory that we lied about iraq
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.400]  when everybody knows they did well now that's a conspiracy theory and then and then asad also
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:38.000]  said you're using al-qaeda against us which is illegal which is on record and they call that a
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.760]  conspiracy theory so i'm looking outside it's a sunny day like i'm gonna aim the camera out there
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:50.800]  so everybody can see it it's a sunny day uh out there but no that's a conspiracy theory ladies
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:58.880]  and gentlemen that is a conspiracy theory uh that uh any of this is going on what do you make of that
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:06.400]  oh i completely agree i this is this whole boston marathon bombing is obama's 9-11 and it followed
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.560]  the same thing over and over again first it was the bombing then it was the license now it's
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.360]  weapons of mass destruction it's the same thing over and over again i mean and people don't
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:22.320]  understand it no matter how many times i say it people don't get it i i live about uh maybe 40
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:27.440]  minutes from boston i was actually in boston that day that the bombing happened and i was
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:34.560]  going to call in a couple weeks ago and my father was actually driving up to boston the day uh
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:41.920]  on friday one day a couple weeks ago before the bombing and he saw homelands uh homeland security
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:47.680]  tanks being brought in there that was about two weeks before the bombing so i mean people out
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:52.960]  there can do the math for themselves well again that is a conspiracy theory that's a conspiracy
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:58.720]  people out there can do the math for themselves well again that's the kind of thing reporters look
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.840]  at we've got a lot of calls about that we're told hey there was a drill turns out it's in the paper
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:08.800]  then they say no there wasn't don't look at these photos troops everywhere 400 troops thousands of
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.400]  police and yes we've gotten the intel you should have your father contact us he should go on record
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:19.200]  and say what he saw but yeah how could they have what looked like a hundred armored vehicles and
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.640]  all that at once if they didn't redeploy it and that's the thing about these staged events is that
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:29.360]  you know they they put out a nice story hey it's the foreigners america you're sick of foreigners
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:36.000]  running all over you isn't it fun they did it but we killed them usa usa and it's all a fraud
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:44.160]  it's all a hoax and uh another thing i wanted to bring up i didn't hear you cover this but uh
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:54.640]  if if you go on uh the social security death index record uh it shows that adam where the guy who
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:04:01.200]  supposedly shot up that school and sandy hook uh was actually killed a day before the shooting
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.800]  ever happened in new hampshire and i found that on three different websites so i've had people
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:11.520]  tell me oh it was probably a grit uh a glitch with the site but i found three different websites
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:15.040]  we're all says the same thing well the last thing they want you to do is investigate you're supposed
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:19.600]  to sit there and believe what known liars tell you here's all what i need to say to you
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.680]  your dad needs to go on record with how many armored vehicles he saw beforehand and what
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:29.520]  happened that's why anytime folks you see something happening you see something say
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:34.480]  something about these occupiers these globalists that have occupied us god bless you sir i appreciate
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:39.120]  your call uh and yeah the whole adam lanza thing stinks to high heaven do i know exactly what
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:44.720]  happened no but if the globalists would say that a half million dead iraqi kids was a good price to
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:50.720]  pay then then your life's worth nothing as well the globalists are known certified lying murdering
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:05:02.240]  killers and you believe what they say at your own peril more calls coming up hello i know you

[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:25.440]  shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas the first
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:32.000]  report to say that president kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big

[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:23.520]  uncomfortable job to do this in an american city global governance at last is it one world the
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:28.560]  central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:39.760]  live from the infowars.com studios it's alex jones
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:47.200]  that's right i'm coming to you from hot springs arkansas and david knight is there in the
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:52.400]  infowars.com austin studios by the way i didn't even say i was in hot springs
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:59.600]  on sunday and i went down into the ballroom of the famous hotel i'm at
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:06.240]  old hotel there's a couple of them here in town and i ran into multiple groups of listeners
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:12.560]  one fellow with his wife a couple other guys that were here who just literally came into town to
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:18.240]  find me and i'm not bragging hey i'm a celebrity i'm saying no wonder the globalists are attacking
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:23.040]  us because as i walk down the street here in arkansas every other head turns and looks at me
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.120]  people come over and say hey alex don't want to bug you but have you seen this in town have you
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:33.840]  done that i mean arkansas is awake and this is the hometown of bill clinton hot springs arkansas
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:39.840]  man i love this town i've been coming here since i was like two years old my parents love this town
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:45.120]  and i haven't been here in like you know 15 years until about a year ago i brought my kids here and
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:49.440]  they love it so we were here last year we're here this year i if i was going to move somewhere i
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:53.360]  got to be honest it'd be like northern california or it'd be somewhere like uh
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:00.080]  hot springs arkansas or it'd be like the coast of florida or something just because it's so pretty
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.600]  uh if my allergies continue to get as bad as they've been in austin austin's a great town
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:09.920]  but it's the capital of the country of allergies there's so many different flora coming together
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:18.560]  that uh i may actually set up an office somewhere else during the allergy season it might be hot
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:23.520]  springs arkansas ladies and gentlemen i'm serious i'm not playing around i might set up a satellite
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:30.000]  office and it's either going to be that or like tampa or or maybe the east coast of florida not
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.720]  the west coast i don't know i guess they got bad allergies here though they say you get them after
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:37.680]  you've been here well okay i'm digressing i'm going right to your phone calls and we're going
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:44.000]  to get to boston bombers during shootout we didn't do it paul joseph watson audio feed
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.360]  suspicious brothers may have been set up oh really think so
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:12:00.640]  and so this is um this is just some of the some of the info we're going to be getting to here in
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:07.680]  just a moment uh but um let's go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to philip in texas
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:15.680]  thanks for holding philip and then ron and others here on the air hey alex uh name is phil a huge
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:22.080]  fan uh especially of your body work and your sense of humor but i have some some bad news for you
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:30.720]  guys uh obama came out with a press release apparently they think it's very unlikely that uh
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:37.680]  al-qaeda is going to use chemical weapons serious though that is great news i mean what do you mean
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.560]  it's bad news that's great news uh that means nobody's buying into it because he had hagel
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:47.840]  uh of course obama always plays the part and i haven't seen this yet but i believe you i'll
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.160]  check it in fact guys pull that up for me um i can't really talk in time at the same time at
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:57.200]  least not very good what he'll have his surrogates like hagel come out and say it's clear they've got
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.480]  wmds they've got them we've got to act right now as sec def and then obama will be like hold on a
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:06.640]  minute now i don't know about that we don't know if al-qaeda is going to get chemical weapons
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:10.960]  so there's a lot of stuff going back and forth but they've always wanted to say that they're
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.880]  going to use chemical weapons and go in and go after them uh but uh you're seeing bad news for
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:23.600]  you guys that is super good news turning uh syria over to al-qaeda to destroy those ancient
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:29.840]  communities there and those archaeological sites is a war crime i mean when i read yesterday and
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:34.080]  saw the news piece about a woman who the the hospital was giving the baby antibiotics for
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:37.760]  the flu and the baby was getting sicker and making mistakes she said i'm going to go to another
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.560]  hospital so they sent a group of police to physically attack them and take the kid that
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.400]  hits me in my gut i have a a a a release in my stomach like when i get a call and hear one of
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:54.000]  my kids has fallen and gotten hurt or something you know that same adrenaline rush i get that
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.280]  when i see this stuff it's why i get angry so uh what do you mean it's it's bad news for us
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:05.840]  that they're not now trying to uh i mean that's great news i guess uh i'm kind of being ironic
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:11.040]  they're saying that uh asad was the one that's implementing chemical weapons prior as but a lot
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:16.640]  of people were saying it was the rebels but now they're saying they it's very unlikely that al-qaeda
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:23.200]  would ever use chemical weapons in syria i just thought that that was ridiculous but uh i also
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:30.160]  would like for you to kind of speak to as far as uh you know uh rachel maddow and uh just basically
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:40.400]  putting out lies about uh you and uh you know the right wing extremists or whatever uh see like i
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:45.200]  mean they can't just lie on air right isn't that kind of laws against like yellow journalism and
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.560]  just kind of seeing if you're considering like civil suits or anything like that regarding that
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:56.800]  no uh because i'm a public figure and i'm not big on lawsuits i only file suit if somebody
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:00.880]  says i'm a drug dealer with no proof uh or if somebody goes after my family
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:07.040]  um i mean i it's not fun to sue people because then i've really got to make sure i win and
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:13.920]  i've got to perfect the suit it's a serious business uh it costs a lot of money listen uh
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.600]  rachel maddow can come out and say i'm an axe murderer for all i care that just sends more
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:23.760]  people to me i'm not an axe murderer uh people can say uh i'm a liar i know i'm doing my best
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:28.080]  to be accurate and i'm pretty pretty accurate you know super accurate compared to these people
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:35.040]  um i mean they're a bunch of hoaxers and you know they'll say alex jones says nobody died at sandy
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:40.640]  hook i've never said that i've said that there's clear evidence that there's government involvement
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:45.360]  uh same thing with with boston they're like alex jones says none of it happened when i say it's a
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:50.560]  hoax this government has a history of doing this their fingerprints are all over it they stand to
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:55.600]  gain from these type of events they sit up there and script and cry like they care that's the issue
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:01.520]  god bless you i appreciate your call let me look at this article out of mbc dfw in dallas
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:08.160]  uh airline airport employees caught abusing security badges letting friends and family go
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:16.080]  through without ids i was at austin berksstrom and the mainstream media totally ignored you know the
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:20.960]  national news stories they did ignored why it happened drugs linked to our story so it actually
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:26.640]  got out what happened to their chagrin uh but i mean i'm watching young people old people you
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:33.280]  name it go through 25 year olds you name it well now they say under 12 uh you know over 74 you
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:39.600]  don't have to take your shoes off and i'm like hey everybody's not taking their shoes off what
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.360]  about me and they jumped on me and threatened to arrest me and i did threaten to sue them then
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.240]  because i was so angry but then i just you know whatever uh it was such a big victory with the
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.720]  piers morgan thing i just kind of dropped the whole deal uh but i mean it's all selective we're
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:56.880]  we're three years ago we were gonna have a national opt-out day for a whole week it turned into
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:00.560]  they just turned the scanners off for a week because they weren't going to let us show that
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.200]  we could shut them down like black people joined by whites and others saying no at the lunch
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.360]  counters we're going to shut your lunch counters down if you won't serve black people can you
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:13.840]  imagine saying you know you can't come into this restaurant and and the people can argue well
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:18.640]  that's that's private property and i get not renting your you know your your garage apartment
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:25.360]  to a devil worshiper i mean you should be able to you know you know say politically who you want to
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.160]  rent to but to have an open restaurant and say no that's wrong and people then had a right to go in
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:37.280]  politically and shut that down so again there's a balance in all of this but they it is security
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.520]  theater but more than security theater it's security training to train us to basically be
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:49.680]  slaves uh let's talk to ron in florida ron you're on the air hey alex listen i think it's time for
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:55.600]  change in tactics because they're amping it up and light speed and when i say that i'm talking
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:18:01.200]  about citizens grand juries i don't know how familiar i think you are familiar with james
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:09.200]  manning's won it in columbia but every citizen in every state should start one they have before
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:15.840]  i want to say this citizen grand juries under common law are real if they address real crimes
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:21.840]  and then create and then produce an investigation investigational findings that are given to the real
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:26.640]  grand jury the official grand jury and then if it doesn't do its job then there are remedies there
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.880]  the problem is there are a lot of groups that take it completely serious and say it's an official
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:35.840]  verdict but no that's our founders had a grand jury you know basically when they did the
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:42.480]  declaration of independence uh so yes uh but we need the states to also uh do that as well but i
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:47.760]  think it is time to publicly try these globalists and then produce the findings put them on youtube
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.360]  and then that investigational informational will help bring down the globalist all right
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:58.320]  they're basically committees of correspondence that were little underground newspapers exposing
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:10.640]  the the pro-king pro-tyranny publications of the 1760s and 70s alex yeah uh one thing that
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:17.920]  was shocking to me besides seeing uh christians listed uh was the absence of shia muslims
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.520]  well the new world order is going to team up with islam it's it's radicalizing it and i've got to
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:30.960]  say in the clash of civilizations they they really do plan to use islam because it's a
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:35.360]  billion 200 million people they plan to take it over radicalize it and yes set up a world
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:40.240]  government with it more and more that is the game plan and that's why obama is a muslim has
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:45.200]  been a muslim admittedly in his own that's why he makes jokes about it uh he's a socialist muslim
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:49.040]  and and what they're gonna do is they're gonna put other muslims of the sword that don't you know
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:54.720]  join al-qaeda our president is the world leader of al-qaeda it is true the media makes jokes about
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:20:00.240]  that because they know it's true it's over the top it's hiding in plain view obama commanding

[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:26.880]  in the hospital alex says he did it alex he admitted to us that's not what you do in a free

[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:48.160]  level seven please uh you're on the air from florida sir hi alex how are you i'm pretty good
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:55.120]  good good listen the reason i'm calling is that um you obviously have spent a tremendous amount
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:03.360]  of energy studying history um and i was curious has there ever been a tyranny of psychopaths like
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.800]  we have today that dynastically go back hundreds of years if not some people complain you know
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:13.040]  thousands of years um they're like jeffrey dahmer i mean these people have no conscience
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:21.200]  have they ever been intimidated into stepping down in in a peaceful way um or has it always
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.280]  had like our founders you know after spending so much time and energy trying to speak to the king
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:33.280]  and trying to get him to back away from his policies ultimately it came to the sword i'm
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:38.640]  just wondering is this the first time in history that we're attempting to try and take down
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:44.480]  an amazing tyranny i mean you know the the brilliance with which they've affected this
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:51.280]  that is undeniable and and the the completeness of of how they've attacked this food air water
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:58.560]  education helps i mean you know every single aspect of our lives has been taken has been
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:04.640]  taken over by these people uh and in order to change this i'm i understand that you don't
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:09.200]  advocate violence i'm not asking you to make that statement i'm just saying that was a really good
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:17.440]  caller and and and did he drop off or did i drop off guys so i'm okay well i lost my audio feed
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:23.280]  from the caller for a moment i'm sorry go ahead sir well i was just saying that because of the
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:29.840]  completeness of this tyranny which has affected every aspect of our lives is will this be the
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:35.600]  first time if we're successful at turning back this tyranny uh in the way that we're trying to
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:42.320]  through an info war um will this be the first time that psychopaths have ever been turned away
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.240]  without the use of violence
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:53.360]  that's a great question and here's the answer the pentagon in its own research papers in its own
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:28:00.720]  reports says that 90 of war is info war so understand they use lies and twisting and
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:04.960]  dumbing down we use truth and energizing and empowering and telling you you're good and
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:10.560]  telling you you have a future because you do if you believe it resistance is victory so 90 of
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:17.920]  war in in modern warfare the last 60 years that's the number uh some argue it's like 99 uh in the
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:26.480]  past it was 50 50 most statisticians and military uh historians have have have said so right now
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.800]  we're in a war this is war they're trying to kill my credibility with lies i'm trying to kill their
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:38.000]  credibility with truth a year of soldier in this fight uh if you know history the renaissance the
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:44.480]  enlightenment starting about 500 years ago started very very small and little bitty victories and
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:51.360]  little people learning to just disdain the establishment disdain the corrupt uh and not
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:57.120]  just follow orders blindly but it was also people in the establishment who weren't psychopaths
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:03.920]  and weren't sociopaths in their own families who got in love with beauty and got in love with
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:08.480]  empowerment and you see because there's there's always the good the bad and the ugly in society
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:13.360]  and and the bad aren't the only actors so yes there are technocracies but a lot of times it's
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:17.040]  good people in the technocracy that say no that hold it up that's why the new world order is more
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:22.080]  like 20 years behind most their statisticians say 10 uh most their tacticians say 10.
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:28.400]  so it's an incredibly serious you know huge issue i can talk for hours on what you've raised we hope
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:32.160]  for the best prepare for the worst you see all the guns getting bought you see everybody training
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:36.480]  body armor getting bought we're not nobody's going to fema camp if they want a civil war they're
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:42.000]  going to get one but we right now are hitting them and affecting the battlefield space in the info
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:49.200]  war and it's savage and it's intensifying because we're effective we're over the target so yes many

[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:35.680]  about the passing of a great patriot and true journalist jim tucker who wrote for major
[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:40.640]  newspapers across the country was the editor of major daily newspapers and in places like
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:46.880]  washington dc you name it who found out in the 70s about the bilderberg group and for 25 years
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:51.200]  exposed it before they even admitted it existed talking about a decade to find out its name
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:56.640]  then we'll get to jerome and aaron and others in a tiny bit of overdrive if they want to hold
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:02.080]  but but the the last caller if you just joined us i've just sent the the crew over to the other
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:07.680]  journalist offices where i have a a poster of a photo my mother bought me in east germany
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:11.600]  what was formerly east germany when she was in germany visiting family that's in the military
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:20.080]  over there just a few years ago as of a famous photo of an east german soldier and a family had
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:24.320]  just gone through the barbed wire right after they put up the barbed wire was in the military
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:29.360]  and millions of germans were trying to get over into into west germany and and more freedom and
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:33.520]  a little boy because there's a series of photos this is just one of them got caught in the barbed
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:39.600]  wire and so the east german soldier untangles him and helps him go with his family that's a normal
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:45.360]  instinct he was disappeared and reportedly tortured to death he was never seen again but
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:50.400]  decades later the german military in east germany stood down and i've had some of those men that
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:56.240]  stood down who now live in america stood down when my family behind the scenes helped bring
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:00.320]  you know bring down its small way east germany i won't get into all that but there are a lot of
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:04.000]  patriots out there you know my family working through a charity christian charity you know
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:09.520]  helped helped in some ways and and this is just what you have to do to bring down communists or
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:14.000]  any other form of authoritarianism listen if you don't fight for freedom you're going to be a slave
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:20.560]  it is just that simple and uh david knight found a more recent photo that he wants to talk about
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:24.640]  dealing with this david knight reporter there at the info wars command center then we'll show the
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:28.480]  famous photo of the east german uh soldier that we have hanging on the wall here it is
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:33.840]  you know alex uh you're wrong about one thing uh that east german soldier didn't just disappear
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:39.120]  nobody ever saw him again millions of people have seen that picture and uh he did the right thing
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:46.080]  even if nobody ever saw him do the right thing you know he's looking around one of the things that
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:50.080]  makes that such a great picture is he's looking around nervously at at who's seeing him well
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:54.480]  obviously they did see him obviously even the photographer saw him but you know that's the
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:36:00.560]  sort of thing doing the right thing and uh we've got a picture that uh pull that back up on the
[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:06.960]  screen they just had that up there last may 19th 2012 in frankfurt germany you've got a protest of
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:12.800]  20 000 people protesting the european central bank and what you see there in the front is the
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:18.240]  policeman taking their helmets off and leading escorting the protesters and that's exactly what
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:22.400]  happened at the berlin wall as well so we've got the situation of right at the height of uh
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:28.800]  the nazi uh take over we got the this uh uh soldier who's helping that child get out get
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:33.680]  through the barbed wire fence you've got uh east german soldiers who decided at some point that
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:37.760]  they're not going to shoot on civilians who are trying to cross over the berlin wall and now you've
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:43.360]  got just a year ago uh west german police taking off their helmets and instead of opposing the
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.240]  crowd they're peacefully leading them that's what you see happening in germany the problem
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:53.440]  in america is that far too many people believe that the type of tyranny that people have
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:59.360]  experienced in germany they believe falsely that that can't happen that's right absolutely and and
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:04.320]  so we were able to show viewers that poster my mother gave me yes yes we had that up all
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:07.440]  right good job david knight with that information we're going to go to anderson here in just a
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:12.320]  moment i have one more piece of news we're going to get to but this is the heart of what we're
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:18.000]  talking about uh i i saw a newscast of a good looking family no criminal record good looking
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:23.520]  man good looking woman they have their firstborn baby little sweetie cake she gets sick i i bet
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:26.880]  money when i get them on i want to get this family on chris the whole crew get them on
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:31.200]  um i bet money they took vaccines and the kid got real sick but the point is kid gets sick and they
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:35.760]  want to do surgery they want to they got them on antibiotics uh they're issues well that's you
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:39.600]  don't do antibiotics for the flu they're hurting the baby i mean i almost got killed in the hospital
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:44.400]  the one time i had surgery it was a nightmare from the anesthesiology a bunch i'm not gonna get the
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:49.360]  whole story it was as long but i barely made it and that's why i don't want to have surgery again
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:54.400]  and a lot of friends have died they're going for minor surgery flesh-eating bacteria kills them
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:59.040]  so she takes the baby out goes another hospital after the baby's out and fine the cops comes they
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.680]  didn't want it you know when it was sick cops come and say well they told us to take the baby
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:07.680]  we're not you're obviously a family next day they come slam the data against the wall take the baby
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:12.560]  the baby's gone and it's on the news let us have our baby folks there's no judge no jury no law
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:16.640]  they just say you're neglectful you don't take a vaccine you don't whatever your kid breaks their
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.400]  arm on a trampoline even at the neighbor's house with witnesses they well your kids shouldn't be
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:24.880]  on a trampoline all the stuff that happened to us we we would have been taken from our parents
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:30.240]  the state takes a million kids a year it's a systematic attack of them harvesting us and
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.800]  there's seven times used to be five seven times more likely to abuse children justice department
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.800]  own numbers and government care this this is the tyranny the new slavery and it hits me like us i
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.440]  mean i saw that story and watched that video got a sick feeling yesterday and then it was like
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.800]  and then it was like being punched in the stomach and it just makes me hate them so much because i
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:55.680]  hate innocence being abused i mean it's a normal instinct of a free human man if you don't have
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:59.920]  that instinct there's something wrong with you now we're going to anderson of american free press
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:04.320]  very honored to have him uh and then we'll just do this after he leaves us in overdrive because
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:09.040]  i've got to get to this boston bombers during shootout we didn't do it that's coming up in your
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:13.680]  calls and and we've got the audio we're going to clean it up for the nightly news there's some
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:17.600]  things we can do to take out the background noise but but we're working on that in fact we have that
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:21.200]  done yet because i know we had the earlier clip but it's it's kind of muddy have we had time to
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:26.640]  get the clean clip maybe we'll have that by the time we go into overdrive but i wanted to get
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:32.240]  mark anderson the editor of american free press on because i've gotten to know mark over the years
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:38.400]  seeing him at belderberg helping jim around who had really bad hips jim died at 78 last week i
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:42.720]  learned about it uh saturday morning he had just fallen a few days before that and then died at the
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:47.920]  hospital uh and people said well it must be a conspiracy no i've had a lot of family that you
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:52.240]  know falls you've had it uh and then they have a concussion and the family says there's no foul
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:58.480]  play you know you fall down you're 78 uh you go to the hospital and if the complications don't
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:05.200]  kill you the hospital will jim was a classic real guy grew up on a cotton plantation in a in a dirt
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:12.720]  shack dirt floor shack the way he described it uh and then rose to be an editor of major the full
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.680]  eulogy is up on americanfreepress.net and we posted it in fallwars.com but i wanted to have
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.880]  anderson talk about who this guy was some of what he did and he's really taken over for jim he really
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.600]  a few years ago it was pretty much anderson even then because jim is just would would fight to go
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:33.120]  to the i saw him just about 11 months ago at belderberg in virginia they're in shantilly and i
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:37.600]  saw him get out of the car on the side of the curb and just grind his teeth in pain with his hips
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:42.480]  smart guy i knew he probably wouldn't want to go through surgery to get over there and to report
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:47.840]  and and see what was going on and i quietly told rob jacobson and erin dykes who were there with
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:52.480]  me i said that's the last time we're going to see him uh i said he just you know he looked you know
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:56.880]  his brain was still there but you know packs of cigarettes you name it every day it'll get you
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:03.440]  but a real icon who who 35 years ago roughly began to expose belderberg when no one even knew the
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:07.440]  name and they said he's insane it doesn't exist you know the same thing as you today
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:11.920]  in the last decade it's finally in some u.s newspapers and thanks to drudgereport.com and
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:17.760]  worldnetdaily.com and info wars.com especially info wars.com really you know pushing it out there
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:22.080]  we now know in american free press pushing it out there but drudge and others magnifying it
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:26.320]  we now know about the global cabal and last week the rolling stone came out and said
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:31.920]  14 page article there is a global banking corporately that's taken over so mark anderson
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.640]  you now have got the football and i hope jim i know you told me you've gotten some of the sources
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:40.880]  um but but now uh you you know you're taking over where jim tucker of course you've been covering
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.920]  build a bird yourself for 20 years so uh mark anderson great to have you on with us uh thanks
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:51.120]  a lot ali it's great to be here um hope all is well yeah it's some big shoes to fill uh
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:57.680]  the the basic facts are that i helped jim with build a bird in 2010 spain 2011 switzerland
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:03.760]  and that's where i met your crew and then 2012 in chantilly virginia i helped him three years
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:09.120]  in a row i was aware of build a bird before that of course and wrote some minor pieces here and
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:14.720]  there prior to those years but i mentored with jim these last three years it was a somewhat
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.600]  rough year for him this last year but he still made it out to the side he still had his intel
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:26.000]  his intel as best he could and we we did everything we could like your crew did and others to amplify
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:31.280]  the american media coverage which until then had been a virtual blackout and of course as you know
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:35.520]  that's the central challenge the european media is a little more open a little more aggressive
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:40.320]  not so politically correct here in america we still have the task of getting the regular
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:44.960]  american media to at least acknowledge it and this rolling stone thing you mentioned that i
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.080]  had heard about is encouraging so we're making absolutely and they apologize to us i mean there
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:54.720]  gets to a point where you got to make the decision folks because we're going into pure evil here i
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:59.840]  mean you either admit we're indeed you know what or you commit to it and there's no future and
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:03.200]  people better look at their kids that's what i say to all the establishment people you know this is
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:07.360]  a crock of baloney out there and you know your paycheck isn't going to be worth anything soon
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:12.480]  now but before you get into builderberg 2013 americanfreepress.net and you know carrying
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:17.280]  the torch for jim talk about jim tucker himself and why even though he's been very secretive about
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:21.440]  his sources and everything obviously you know needing to be why he began to pass the torch to
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:30.160]  you about four years ago and uh and you know he actually called us on last monday uh and i never
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:35.520]  got back to him i was supposed to and i just got too busy he called me monday uh my assistant uh
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:39.440]  richard reeves talked to him at length about you know we were going to see it builderberg going
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:46.080]  to england uh you know you know you know you know how's uh you know you know alex and i are lucky
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:51.280]  that we're not good looking ha ha ha uh you know i'm gonna have a drink with alex you know the
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:56.880]  classic stuff because we sit back and drink a beer at night exchanging notes uh this is a classic old
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:02.640]  guy talk about some of his history and uh i mean who jim tucker was and again the example of the
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:09.440]  one man taking action how he could change so many things well yeah jim had that old school
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:15.120]  journalism grit he never totally embraced the digital age i haven't totally embraced the digital
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:21.200]  age um jim thought i was a good fit uh largely because i have one foot in the old school
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:26.320]  journalism and one foot in the new school like jim i came from mainstream media alex i used to
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:31.600]  be a conventional reporter and so he and i had that thing in common and we always resonated
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:39.120]  really well really well excuse me and so you know we were both students of and using the new the new
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:45.440]  uh technology for reporting media and you know the internet and everything but we both had that
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:51.680]  similar background we had that in common and he was just a great mentor to um you know to tell
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:58.320]  me to develop sources and and which sources and how to go about it and you know i kind of joined
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:03.040]  that with what i already knew and what i already had learned i've been in journalism 30 years now
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:09.360]  and uh so he and i just cross-pollinated if you will and we'd have a lot of fun after the
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.960]  serious work was done in the after hours you know and so he was a great friend as well as a great
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:21.200]  journalist he had been a sports writer i had dabbled in sports writing um uh you know we
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:27.440]  he'd also then later been a major news editor of major uh east coast newspapers uh talk about
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:32.080]  in the mid-70s when uh he first began to investigate bilderberg i mean for people that
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:37.680]  now know about bilderberg again thanks to to you guys and and drudge the last five years or so
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:41.680]  you know linking it right up there the media really hated that during during news blackouts
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:47.440]  i mean how big a deal it is to admit it i liken it to lacosa nostra in the early 50s i talk about
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:51.920]  this constantly people can pull up the clip online hoover got before congress and said there's no
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:57.200]  such thing as organized crime now you laugh at that today but people believed him then you know
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:02.400]  there's no such thing as organized crime and this is this is the real organized crime so they don't
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:07.920]  want this to be known and and this is a big deal what he did yeah this is the manicured mafia i
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:13.600]  like to call it the pampered plutocrats the these are the uh the upper crust mafia you know they
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:18.160]  don't they don't get their hands real dirty they pay for that stuff and they're a global planning
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:23.360]  commission and uh the existence of bilderberg is literally what converted jim from a conventional
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:30.560]  reporter into the alternative media reporter with the spotlight which preceded the american pre-press
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:36.000]  so bilderberg is the very thing that got jim out of the sports newsroom out of the conventional
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:43.920]  media mold into the alternative media mold that very group was jim's pivotal uh influence it's
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:47.520]  very interesting let's talk a little bit more about jim before we get into the meeting that's
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:51.280]  coming up in about a month reportedly outside london and of course obviously you're probably
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:55.680]  going to be there i'll ask you about that some personal stories about jim and people want to
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:59.520]  know i mean you know more of the because i could call his home number i could call his cell out of
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.520]  respect i haven't tried to get details from the family but what do we know about the fall what
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:10.400]  do we know about how he went his last words do we know him any of that unfortunately i don't happen
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:17.440]  to know that alex i know that he fell reportedly at home um i've been in touch with family but only
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:23.200]  to the extent that i know there's a viewing tomorrow in locust grove virginia and then the
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:28.960]  graveside funeral is the following day in locust grove in or near locust grove virginia
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:36.400]  i don't actually know the details of his passing but i had talked to him just two days before that
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:42.320]  and he literally worked on bilderberg till the very end um of course he didn't know the end was
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:48.320]  coming you know naturally and and but he was working on it and i i actually saved some of my
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:53.600]  phone messages from him a couple of days before his passing just for posterity you know he he was
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:58.320]  working on it helping oh i'd love to hear his voice you know what if you want to do a story
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:01.840]  on that email us those we'll put them on the nightly news or when you put them on american
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.240]  free press you should air those uh in fact i wish i would have called him back he wanted to quote
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:11.200]  compare notes and as he always did and find out and i was intending to call him back because i
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:14.560]  just you know when somebody's dead you're like wow i wish i would have talked to them one more time
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:21.120]  exactly so you know i unfortunately i don't have all the nitty-gritty information on his passing
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:26.320]  suffice to say he'll be sorely missed by me and his staff and by you and your staff and and many
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:33.680]  others uh because jim just had that sort of uh you know broad appeal uh everyone liked him when when
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:39.040]  we would go to spain and switzerland he he was the main beetle and i was just the backup beetle
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:44.800]  if we were characterizing ourselves as you know uh he he would he'd have the young girls flocking
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:49.280]  to him before they'd talk to me you know to say hey what do you know what whether they were
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:53.760]  journalists or whether they were of course jim likes that jim jim jim liked the ladies
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:56.960]  i mean not in a bad way but you know what i mean he was just a funny guy he would charm him and
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:01.920]  stuff a real character i you know i tell you exactly you know it's weird when you have that
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:04.800]  feeling and i just said i don't think jim's gonna be at builderberg next year and they said what do
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:08.800]  you mean i just said you you could see him like an old clock running down and we've lost the
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:14.640]  true warrior um and but you know what his work lives on forever i mean that is such a powerful
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:19.280]  thing right he had already told me that he couldn't do international travel anymore and
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:24.560]  that wasn't unexpected uh but you know naturally no one expected him to pass away although we all
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:30.320]  get there someday but oh so he wasn't gonna go to builderberg this year wow so i mean there you go
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:34.240]  i mean that's incredible it's like he did his mission he couldn't complete it anymore and god
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:39.600]  took him home yeah i mean he was gonna still write about it but my understanding was that
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:45.280]  international travel which isn't easy for anyone uh was probably not on the agenda uh you know it's
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:49.680]  it's physically draining for a healthy person to do a lot of international travel but his hips i
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:54.880]  mean i saw you helping him last year i mean it was like excruciating pain for him to even take
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:01.120]  a step on a curb yeah yeah it's it and and on top of it chantilly was as you know a difficult
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:07.840]  location that long curb uh the way the place was in growth engulfed in a thicket of trees it was
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.760]  difficult to drop people off difficult and 100 degrees they tried to do everything they could
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:16.880]  to stop the first amendment you know you had to park 200 yards away from the site uh it was
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:21.200]  difficult for even healthy people so for jim it was just a little extra difficult all right when
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:25.680]  you leave us soon what do you wish you would have said let's say it now well i mean any little
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:33.680]  stories about jim well i mean i i wish i would have thanked him more for mentoring me um in a way
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:38.800]  but i'm thanking him now and i'll carry it on forward everything i write will in some way shape
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:45.920]  or form be uh inspired by him uh having been mentored by him uh you know i i wish i would
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:53.840]  just thank him for uh so uh you know understandingly and so patiently working with me to get me to
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:57.200]  understand what this is all about absolutely mark anderson stay there

[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:30.400]  who i admire is people that trailblaze for good and you can attack them and say they're not
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:36.160]  perfect or this or that whatever the point is trailblazers that that you know that really
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:42.080]  enlighten people and and and underdogs that you can make a movie about jim going up against the
[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:47.600]  system for 20 something years with them saying it doesn't exist this man's insane being shot at in
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:53.200]  portugal that was in their news making fun of him in our news being you know arrested beat up but
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:57.200]  he was that old school top that would just play it down you know like world war ii guys would be
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:02.640]  shot and have their shoulder blown off they'd be like it's no big deal uh just uh you know classic
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:08.880]  classic type guy uh and and and to expose there's a shadowy group meeting with our government
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:16.160]  to rip us off i mean this is important this is big this is world changing jim tucker uh again
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:20.560]  mark anderson of americanfreepress.net obviously you're going to be covering it this year we've
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:26.800]  confirmed it is in england you've you've confirmed that yeah the grove hotel yeah the former home of
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:32.800]  the earls of clarendon it's a sufficiently stately and snobby place for these pampered
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:38.000]  plutocrats that's for sure it fits the it fits the mold it fits the image perfectly well
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:43.280]  anything else you want to add about jim i mean you've got the floor what do you think's most
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:50.720]  important well i i i liked jim's candor uh he i loved his humor you know his wit he'd always
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:56.800]  call them the bilderberg boys he he would say this is plain evil happening he never minced words
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:03.520]  um he took over where west brooke pegler the old time columnist left off of course he was the
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:09.280]  initial finder of bilderberg way back there didn't even know their name and oh by the way he wanted
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:17.040]  to outlive david rockefeller that's a big bummer yeah yeah that that's true uh but jim's wit and
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:25.040]  his candor and his grit and his uh his own kind of charm will be sorely missed it it connected what
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:32.400]  pegler did in the early days with the more modern times and jim is largely uh responsible for getting
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:37.840]  the european media to be more open so their reports on bilderberg weren't simply criticisms
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:43.920]  of the protesters and would actually look at the bilderberg group itself and then uh jim and later
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:49.840]  on myself helped among others of course to stir the pot in america especially last year in chantilly
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:54.560]  to get the american media to wake up and as you know for the first time that we know of the
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:59.600]  washington post whose top officials top uh publishers have actually participated in
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:04.240]  bilderberg secretive meetings and have actually helped bilderberg and have not written a word
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:09.280]  about it that's the solemn oath they have to take begrudgingly sent a photographer out there last
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:13.920]  year we know that was a breakthrough for them to acknowledge it and for them to actually report on
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:20.720]  it rather than just participate and cover it up so that's big and so jim you know over the years
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:26.080]  brought us to this level and it's up to all of us now myself of course filling big shoes but
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:31.520]  it's up to all of us in our own way to carry this forward and do it because that's what he'd want us
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:36.320]  to do that's right and now we've had wikileaks and other stuff come out and confirm and you've
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:40.320]  had the italian government come out and say bilderberg is helping stage terror attacks
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:44.240]  i mean this is the real top of the pyramid there are other secretive groups and interlocking
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.800]  directorates but this is the group that set up the eu this is the new world order and and
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:55.600]  their meetings are illegal under uh several different acts uh that congress has put in place
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:00.800]  and people say well that's not enforced it doesn't matter it's illegal it should be enforced and
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:06.800]  look how far we've come it's another example of big things having small beginnings american free

[03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:34.560]  info wars news.com or prison planet.tv gonna play this clip here in a moment boston bombers during
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:38.560]  shootout we didn't do it now they need to get this out to everybody up at info wars.com but
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:42.480]  mark anderson i have one more question on jim tucker i know in the last three four years he
[03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:48.480]  was transferring his sources his connections his methods to you i hope all that did get transferred
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:53.520]  over to you and i think his notes and things you should talk to the family about them approving it
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:59.440]  but i think you should put out a posthumous memoir uh you know with his notes and ideas
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:04.080]  you know to eulogize him so that he's not just forgotten because so many times great men are
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:09.360]  just overlooked if other people you know ronald reagan said you can do pretty much anything if
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:14.080]  you don't care who gets the credit and i read that quote last night i was reading a book about
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:20.640]  ronald reagan and it really is true and so i think we need to give jim credit and i think it's but
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:24.800]  just answer my one question that's an idea i tend to have diarrhea in the mouth and ideas
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:28.720]  but it's not really diarrhea it's good ideas uh what about the sources did you get all those
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:35.280]  transferred uh largely i i don't think there's going to be any problem there uh all this all
[03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:41.200]  of this is so fresh his passing is so recent just this past friday that i literally have to
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:46.720]  meet with his family that's he that hasn't even happened yet um but i don't anticipate any problem
[03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:54.720]  with the sources much if at all and yeah there'll be efforts going uh ongoing to um uh do some uh
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:59.840]  articles of course in this week's american free press and more stuff online likely at
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:05.840]  americanfreepress.net and everything we can do um in reporting and updating books and different
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:10.880]  things to make sure his legacy is not lost that is a guarantee and i don't see any problem with
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:16.000]  the sources either i just have yet to meet with the family because it's also fresh but uh we
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:21.040]  should be a-okay in all those areas all right mark we'll stay in touch with you as we build up towards
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.800]  builderberg 2013 thank you so much very good thanks alex you bet now now here's the article
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:31.600]  boston bombers during shootout we didn't do it and now i'm going to play the raw feed off of
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:39.200]  the local five channel news what wcvb i believe it is we're going to play this from the watertown
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:58.000]  shooting uh and then we're going to go to one where we eq'd it here's the raw clip
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:18.080]  all right let's stop right there that's chill out chill out chill out chill out we didn't do
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:22.080]  it we didn't do it we didn't do it nine seconds later hey officer now i'm listening to that over
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:29.280]  skype from texas to arkansas and i can hear it clearly that's the raw clip from the video i mean
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:33.840]  i watched it this morning there's no doubt that's what they're saying i mean these are patsy's being
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:39.440]  set up all the pieces say that now let's play the eq'd piece to clean out some of the background
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:04:04.960]  hiss uh here is the piece that we've eq'd here it is
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:11.840]  all right here's the problem here's the problem with being able to send cops to kill people
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:15.360]  when they burned up dorner and said we're going to burn him up get it we're going to burn him up
[03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:19.360]  and then they killed him i might sing dorner's a good guy they could have burned up your grandma
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:23.440]  in there who knows who even died it's like burning up john wilkes booth so you don't know
[03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:29.920]  and they could again they can tell cops now in most big departments go kill this guy and they'll
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:35.680]  go do it and that's the problem they can kill you they can kill me and then say we did it
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:39.280]  and even if we the media has a footage you're you're not bleeding out of the neck five minutes
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:42.960]  later you're gonna they're gonna cut your larynx out and then you're gonna confess with no no you
[03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:47.840]  know they'll just say oh he confesses that means there's not gonna be a real trial folks to come
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:52.240]  out and say he confessed even if he confessed they wouldn't show that to the trial they want
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:59.280]  this open and shut now this thing is patsy shitty obama is the head of al-qaeda worldwide they set
[03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:00.800]  up these two young kids
