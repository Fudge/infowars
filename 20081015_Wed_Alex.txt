[01:33.440 --> 01:39.600]  forgot yesterday I had a long about 30 minute conversation with Jesse Ventura I called up
[01:39.600 --> 01:45.680]  just double check in his plane tickets in hotel and he began to excitedly tell me about the
[01:45.680 --> 01:53.600]  shoots they've been doing for the first episode the first pilot episode that's a schedule to
[01:53.600 --> 02:00.000]  air in about six months or so or less on true TV the new court TV and I can't tell you the stuff
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.600]  he was telling me but it's investigative reports type stuff it's it's gonna be ultra riveting Jesse
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.760]  Ventura going around confronting people I'm just gonna leave it at that
[02:17.680 --> 02:26.400]  it's going to be extremely informative and extremely interesting so that is something
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.040]  that the next few weeks we may be able to tell you a little bit more about after he's done doing
[02:31.040 --> 02:39.680]  some more the confrontations that he is planning he is coming into town there'll be the 25th 26th

[02:47.920 --> 02:52.400]  to have a press conference about 9-11 other issues on the media like to talk to him I haven't
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.880]  figured out whether to publicly call one of those I haven't even I know I'm gonna be interviewing
[02:56.880 --> 03:01.680]  I don't know if I'm gonna do the Sunday show the day he's here because we're speaking around

[04:22.000 --> 04:28.400]  fronts so that's what they have unlimited so they can control the market so much of the capital we
[04:28.400 --> 04:34.880]  have goes to bandwidth and and just to do something free like that uh is um well it's not free somebody's

[08:23.040 --> 08:27.200]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen into the second segment again a discussion
[08:27.200 --> 08:33.520]  somewhat of a debate but a friendly discussion with a creator of zeitgeist peter joseph
[08:34.480 --> 08:44.320]  coming up for two hours today in the third and fourth hour okay here is the financial news
[08:44.320 --> 08:48.960]  running down through it the stock market's down 300 some points last time i checked
[08:48.960 --> 08:56.800]  banks dictate conditions of us financial bailout they control it completely they are becoming
[08:56.800 --> 09:01.520]  the government it isn't the government nationalizing them it's the banks becoming the government
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.760]  as we've been telling you but great article from global research on that
[09:05.760 --> 09:12.480]  boomberg americans embrace big government to help solve market crisis all part of this continual
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.000]  parroting by the mainstream controlled press but the public is for this we're all coming together
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.320]  we love socialism when this isn't even socialism this is corporate fascism takeover
[09:24.320 --> 09:31.920]  this is just literally an elite banking system seizing the economy and seizing the dollar
[09:31.920 --> 09:36.800]  while it still has value buying up real resources and infrastructure but again that headline is
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.600]  mirrored in hundreds of places every day i watched an hour of financial news this morning on the
[09:41.600 --> 09:46.960]  treadmill and it was all the same message over and over and over again americans embrace big
[09:46.960 --> 09:54.320]  government to help solve market crisis but americans are not embracing it the foreign
[09:54.320 --> 09:59.920]  international banks that have hijacked our country have engineered it and they're forcing us into it
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.680]  um on other financial news feds give hundreds of billions of banks but yet only non-voting
[10:07.680 --> 10:13.200]  shares in banks that's out of the george washington blog spot uh with uh links to mainstream news
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.400]  reporting that and that mirrors the report out of banks dictate conditions of u.s financial bailout
[10:19.520 --> 10:25.600]  global stocks retreat as risk aversion returns Reuters so that's some of the financial news
[10:26.240 --> 10:31.920]  that i want to go over there there's up there's two other top stories upon info wars dot com
[10:31.920 --> 10:37.760]  right now time for a global glass nost says gorbachev basically a global government run
[10:37.760 --> 10:46.080]  by the banks uh so he's out saying that uh there is a another report up on
[10:48.560 --> 10:56.000]  info wars dot com from the yorkshire post saying after the economic 911 we will face a new world
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.400]  order and you can link over there and read that full report and it's saying oh because of this
[11:02.400 --> 11:08.400]  crisis that happened by accident we've got to have a new world basically socialist order run by the
[11:08.400 --> 11:15.040]  banks that implemented all of this and you know it was an accident that they did it they just hate
[11:15.040 --> 11:23.040]  getting unlimited power they hate taking over everything but somebody's got to run everything
[11:23.040 --> 11:29.440]  an organized society and a planned economy so we'll be breaking down those reports
[11:29.440 --> 11:37.600]  there is a multi pronged attack really but more than 20 prongs that i can just think of on the top
[11:37.600 --> 11:44.000]  of my head but uh in subsections of each one of those attacks taxing the web restricting the web
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.440]  internet to making you get a subdomain no private individual websites but only subdomains on
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.560]  corporate or institutional sites uh restricting free speech a massive web filters uh ending that
[11:56.560 --> 12:02.800]  neutrality the list goes on and on but one of the big ones is that you're having quote free
[12:02.800 --> 12:08.240]  government wi-fi free government wireless internet of course it's not free you pay for it through
[12:08.240 --> 12:14.960]  taxes and it's a giant corporate welfare uh to a select uh two or three maximum private
[12:14.960 --> 12:20.240]  corporations uh that then have a government support and backing and a regulatory streamlining
[12:20.240 --> 12:26.880]  for them so that they get the monopoly of the new um you know powerful wireless internet
[12:28.160 --> 12:35.040]  so again uh advertises free not free but that's only one facet uh to it this is a story up on
[12:35.040 --> 12:42.400]  prisonplanet.com by paul joseph watson free nationwide wi-fi network to censor political
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.280]  websites blogs social networks alternative news to be filtered out and they say themselves
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.720]  under the FCC that uh there's only a few companies are going to allow to do this google and a few
[12:52.720 --> 13:02.320]  others and that uh it will be highly censored and regulated only a few thousand choices
[13:02.320 --> 13:08.000]  approved of ports and then of course when you jump on to the wireless free that you're paying
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.680]  for government internet uh again they're setting up monopolies this is not free market it'll be
[13:13.680 --> 13:20.320]  blamed as the free market later uh you will go to a government uh approved port that will then
[13:20.320 --> 13:28.800]  allow you to go to the uh anointed and selected places both competing parties m2z networks
[13:31.440 --> 13:38.800]  and the FCC are jockeying for the rights to roll out the network but both have already
[13:38.800 --> 13:45.040]  stated their intent to install filters to block out pornography and anything else deemed harmful
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.640]  and the FCC federal communications commission uh is uh talking about uh we're again rolling
[13:50.640 --> 13:56.960]  out a purely government system and then other systems like m2z according to the daily tech
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.000]  report both proposals stipulate that any free wireless offerings have mandatory content filters
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.320]  preventing users from viewing any material that would be harmful to teens and adolescents
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.160]  including pornography and anything uh contemporary community standards deemed to be obscene free
[14:12.160 --> 14:18.080]  speech advocates call this condition unconstitutional and it will again set the precedent for the
[14:18.080 --> 14:25.760]  quote free internet that we pay for nothing is free folks uh and uh they are bringing in massive
[14:25.760 --> 14:30.960]  controls through that as we have previously reported similar free wi-fi networks on smaller
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.680]  scales include mandatory content filters that screen out even mildly political websites
[14:35.680 --> 14:41.360]  info wars dot com principle dot com are screened out by the government uh hubs that are quote free
[14:41.360 --> 14:46.560]  in the city centers in england we've done previous articles on that so we are banned um even mildly
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.920]  political websites that are not part of the corporate establishment media london's saint uh
[14:53.120 --> 15:00.000]  pericas international uh free wi-fi network blocks a barrage alternative political websites
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.360]  as we found earlier this year when our own sites were inaccessible on the network
[15:03.360 --> 15:09.760]  and then then it's got abc news reporting uh on this and the fcc insists on trying to
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.800]  creation of a free nationwide broadband wireless network the government mandated censorship the
[15:14.800 --> 15:20.000]  constitutionality of the plan will surely be challenged in court and will be struck down reports
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.400]  the site also they're passing city rules and in some countries passing national rules where if
[15:26.400 --> 15:31.120]  you offer quote free internet in your coffee shop which it isn't really free is to get you to come
[15:31.120 --> 15:36.640]  into the coffee shop but it's a nice thing to offer um that you have to put filters on it to
[15:36.640 --> 15:42.320]  protect children in case children were driving by or in the street using your wireless network
[15:42.320 --> 15:47.600]  tapping into it no it's up to the parents it's up to their guardians to not let them have those
[15:47.600 --> 15:53.280]  devices or to surveil what they're doing that's what the parents job not the state uh and to put
[15:53.280 --> 16:02.000]  content filters they choose on their uh access devices so that's the bottom line of what's going
[16:02.000 --> 16:13.360]  on there instead the state will play mommy and daddy over the people and you will not be able
[16:13.360 --> 16:19.120]  to visit prisonplanet.com or info wars.com just like myspace won't let us send bulletins out on
[16:19.120 --> 16:24.080]  our page most of the time and they've openly admitted they do censor us and that's made the
[16:24.080 --> 16:29.680]  newspapers they said yes prisonplanet.com is not allowed and it is on the list of banned uh banned
[16:30.560 --> 16:34.240]  banned bulletins other people who try to send out bulletins from prisonplanet.com
[16:34.960 --> 16:41.680]  have been banned and so that has been in the news and that's just us here being censored
[16:42.800 --> 16:47.040]  and so as they create you know two or three as they always do with these oligopolies these
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.640]  cartels of nationwide free internet that the citizens pay for
[16:54.400 --> 17:01.040]  then you will not be able to access our sites and this is all part of trying to stop the viral
[17:01.040 --> 17:07.840]  spread of the information revolution uh that the alternative media is is is debating and
[17:07.840 --> 17:14.080]  codifying and moving forward with exponentially in this huge college of ideas the this huge
[17:14.080 --> 17:19.200]  great debate that we're having that's what the show is i mean we'll have a Rothschild on who i
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.520]  don't agree with people say how dare you have a Rothschild on that means you're in bed with them
[17:23.520 --> 17:29.280]  no i had him on to make him look like a fool and i did when he said that mars didn't have ice caps or
[17:29.280 --> 17:34.480]  that mars and jupiter and saturn and pluto are closer to the sun than earth that's why their
[17:34.480 --> 17:39.760]  ice caps were melting when the sun was going through its brightest cycle hottest cycle ever
[17:39.760 --> 17:43.600]  recorded now it's gone into the coldest ever seen in almost 300 years they've been recording
[17:43.600 --> 17:50.000]  this on that long one of the most studied things uh by science but uh you know how dare you have
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.320]  a Rothschild on well the point is we're having him on just like one time i had pat you cannon on
[17:54.320 --> 17:59.120]  and brought up bohemian grove and the weird sexual stuff that goes on there and at first he's like
[17:59.120 --> 18:03.920]  yeah i i go to bohemian grove uh i've been out you know i went there with nixon and i said oh
[18:03.920 --> 18:08.000]  really for the did you see any of the homosexual activity went oh i mean i didn't go to bohemian
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.520]  grove i was interviewed like five years ago you know and and and we have him on don't agree with
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.120]  everything pat me cannon says don't agree with everything he's done do agree with a lot of what
[18:17.120 --> 18:22.320]  he has to say the point is is that i i agree with a lot of what zeitgeist has to say but i don't
[18:22.320 --> 18:29.200]  agree with their attack on religion or the making fun of people that believe in it um you know it
[18:29.200 --> 18:34.640]  is religion that developed the ideas as michael disarray into yesterday that grew into the science
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.400]  we have today it was the mind reaching out and realizing there's something bigger and that
[18:40.400 --> 18:47.120]  we have a greater destiny what we can envision we are able to later build it may take many generations
[18:47.120 --> 18:52.880]  but we do it so we've got him coming on for two hours it is no endorsement of zeitgeist you know
[18:52.880 --> 19:00.320]  i i get to be attacked by people because my footage is in zeitgeist which they used you know up front
[19:00.320 --> 19:06.240]  without asking and then i also can personally get to be attacked when i disagree with zeitgeist
[19:06.240 --> 19:11.840]  well again we should be more open minded to have open discussions about all of this and that is

[20:31.520 --> 20:35.600]  the united states seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt
[20:35.600 --> 20:40.880]  but the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching

[23:43.120 --> 23:53.120]  so
[23:53.120 --> 24:22.120]  We're back live ladies and gentlemen, we were covering the story by Paul Watson.
[24:22.120 --> 24:27.120]  Free nationwide Wi-Fi network since their political websites.
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.120]  And that's how they're doing it.
[24:32.120 --> 24:37.120]  They just upgrade the web and the people having their own access to it,
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.120]  being able to have their own websites and true choice,
[24:40.120 --> 24:42.120]  so that's not going to be part of it.
[24:42.120 --> 24:45.120]  Just under this system.
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.120]  And then they're admitting they're going to design the computers only for receiving
[24:50.120 --> 24:54.120]  on these more powerful Wi-Fi connections.
[24:54.120 --> 24:56.120]  And of course that'll be where the real quality's at,
[24:56.120 --> 24:59.120]  so you'll want the new computer that only has that upgrade.
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.120]  They'll just leave the old web, which was the real web, the free web,
[25:03.120 --> 25:08.120]  the expansive ever growing web behind.
[25:08.120 --> 25:09.120]  They've got to do it.
[25:09.120 --> 25:12.120]  They want the internet to be the worldwide wiretap.
[25:12.120 --> 25:15.120]  That's what the NSA joked in the 80s and called it.
[25:15.120 --> 25:18.120]  Not what they told the public, the worldwide web.
[25:18.120 --> 25:21.120]  That was another inside joke, a web of control,
[25:21.120 --> 25:27.120]  instead of it being worldwide whoop-ass on the New World Order.
[25:27.120 --> 25:28.120]  Excuse me.
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.120]  I'm sorry.
[25:29.120 --> 25:30.120]  I'm out of control.
[25:30.120 --> 25:32.120]  I apologize for that.
[25:32.120 --> 25:33.120]  Oh, man.
[25:33.120 --> 25:35.120]  Look, the genie's out of the bottle.
[25:35.120 --> 25:36.120]  Pandora's box.
[25:36.120 --> 25:38.120]  The horse has already left the barn.
[25:38.120 --> 25:40.120]  You can try to put it back in the box.
[25:40.120 --> 25:42.120]  It's not going to happen.
[25:42.120 --> 25:45.120]  The people now know about the New World Order.
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.120]  They're going to be able to dominate and control the police state
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.120]  and with physical tyranny, the population.
[25:52.120 --> 25:55.120]  They've said they'll release biological weapons,
[25:55.120 --> 25:57.120]  race-specific weapons to control populations.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.120]  If all of us wake up and say no,
[25:59.120 --> 26:01.120]  they'll just release bioweapons and wipe most of us out,
[26:01.120 --> 26:04.120]  including their own cops and military.
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.120]  Or we try to seize control of major cities.
[26:07.120 --> 26:09.120]  March on Washington, March on London.
[26:09.120 --> 26:12.120]  Like the founders did.
[26:12.120 --> 26:13.120]  That's it.
[26:13.120 --> 26:15.120]  They'll just neutron bomb us.
[26:15.120 --> 26:17.120]  Now, I'm not trying to be negative and say,
[26:17.120 --> 26:18.120]  oh, God, there's no way out.
[26:18.120 --> 26:20.120]  I want you to realize what the Pentagon,
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.120]  what the British Ministry of Defense have said they're ready to do.
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.120]  This is stated.
[26:26.120 --> 26:28.120]  I mean, they've got all of parliament or surveillance,
[26:28.120 --> 26:30.120]  all of Congress under surveillance.
[26:30.120 --> 26:31.120]  It's come out and been admitted.
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.120]  Who has it?
[26:32.120 --> 26:34.120]  The criminal illegitimate government.
[26:34.120 --> 26:37.120]  The military industrial complex owned by the foreign private banks.
[26:37.120 --> 26:39.120]  And they tell Congress, hey, you do what we said,
[26:39.120 --> 26:41.120]  or we'll just abolish you.
[26:41.120 --> 26:42.120]  You understand?
[26:42.120 --> 26:45.120]  You got that straight?
[26:45.120 --> 26:48.120]  You know, if blackmail won't work and if payoffs won't work,
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.120]  we'll just destroy you in the media.
[26:49.120 --> 26:54.120]  And if your whole body stands up against us,
[26:54.120 --> 26:55.120]  we'll just throw you out.
[26:55.120 --> 26:58.120]  And you know what if the public doesn't like it and tries to march on us?
[26:58.120 --> 27:02.120]  North com will just blow you to bits.
[27:02.120 --> 27:05.120]  Now, they can't stop us with helicopters and conventional weapons
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.120]  and tanks and machine guns.
[27:07.120 --> 27:09.120]  We outnumber them a million to one.
[27:09.120 --> 27:13.120]  And most of the troops in the military are on our side now.
[27:13.120 --> 27:16.120]  That's why the enemy will use tricks.
[27:16.120 --> 27:17.120]  They will use deception.
[27:17.120 --> 27:21.120]  They will use sleight of hand.
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.120]  They will shut off the money supply so people riot and crime explodes
[27:26.120 --> 27:31.120]  so you beg for troops.
[27:31.120 --> 27:33.120]  They will release a biological weapon and say,
[27:33.120 --> 27:39.120]  LCIA did it, al-Qaeda did it, so you learn to love them and beg them for help.
[27:39.120 --> 27:41.120]  And they'll even have a cure for you.
[27:41.120 --> 27:43.120]  They'll even have the vaccine.
[27:43.120 --> 27:45.120]  You'll learn to worship them.
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.120]  Only by understanding, they've talked about all this and planned it all,
[27:48.120 --> 27:50.120]  and having a mass awakening and just saying,
[27:50.120 --> 27:51.120]  we don't go along with you anymore.
[27:51.120 --> 27:53.120]  We don't participate anymore.
[27:53.120 --> 27:56.120]  We turn our backs on all of you.
[27:56.120 --> 27:58.120]  This system is corrupt and bankrupt.
[27:58.120 --> 28:02.120]  And then taking cities over by city by city basis.
[28:02.120 --> 28:04.120]  With the leaders openly saying, don't launch a bio attack.
[28:04.120 --> 28:05.120]  Don't set off a nuke.
[28:05.120 --> 28:07.120]  We know you're a terrorist.
[28:07.120 --> 28:09.120]  And that sounds like it's impossible.
[28:09.120 --> 28:10.120]  Well, let me tell you something.
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.120]  They're going to continue to rape the economy.
[28:12.120 --> 28:13.120]  They're going to destroy the economy,
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.120]  bringing in that crisis to offer their solution.
[28:15.120 --> 28:19.120]  Socialism, controlled by the corporate fascists that sit above us,
[28:19.120 --> 28:22.120]  socializing our wealth, making it communal,
[28:22.120 --> 28:24.120]  so there's no middle class that can control us.
[28:24.120 --> 28:30.120]  So we're on the dole while they fascistically pipe the consolidated control
[28:30.120 --> 28:38.120]  into fewer and fewer levers of manipulation.
[28:38.120 --> 28:40.120]  So there is a way to defeat these people,
[28:40.120 --> 28:42.120]  and it's a mass total awakening,
[28:42.120 --> 28:46.120]  and it's a mass total awakening by their compartmentalized minions
[28:46.120 --> 28:48.120]  who sit in the different strata,
[28:48.120 --> 28:51.120]  the different control rooms of the societal,
[28:51.120 --> 28:54.120]  economic, psychological system,
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.120]  only by the preachers,
[28:57.120 --> 28:59.120]  waking up and speaking out,
[28:59.120 --> 29:01.120]  only by the mayors waking up and speaking out,
[29:01.120 --> 29:04.120]  only by the technicians and technologists
[29:04.120 --> 29:06.120]  and engineers waking up and speaking out,
[29:06.120 --> 29:10.120]  only by the people, the school teachers, the cops,
[29:10.120 --> 29:12.120]  the auto mechanics getting up and saying,
[29:12.120 --> 29:15.120]  no, can we turn this around?
[29:15.120 --> 29:18.120]  People throughout the system seeing how their compartmentalized,
[29:18.120 --> 29:21.120]  getting outside the box.
[29:21.120 --> 29:23.120]  We're on the march.

[29:39.120 --> 29:41.120]  but the symptoms are there.
[29:41.120 --> 29:43.120]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,

[31:34.120 --> 31:36.120]  has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[31:36.120 --> 31:38.120]  International bankers and power brokers
[31:38.120 --> 31:40.120]  have engineered the current crisis
[31:40.120 --> 31:42.120]  to create a new currency and a new World Bank
[31:42.120 --> 31:44.120]  to act as savior.
[31:44.120 --> 31:46.120]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[31:46.120 --> 31:48.120]  Their next engineered crisis
[31:48.120 --> 31:51.120]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.

[33:04.320 --> 33:12.480]  and discussing, here is a little clip from one of the futurists. He's an engineer who is one of
[33:12.480 --> 33:18.800]  the most prominent in the film, here it is. We're such an abominable, sick society that we won't
[33:18.800 --> 33:24.240]  make the history of it. Let's just say that large nations took land with smaller nations,
[33:24.240 --> 33:30.640]  used force and violence. You'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along
[33:30.640 --> 33:35.200]  until the beginning of the civilized world. That's when all the nations worked together.
[33:35.200 --> 33:44.960]  World unification, working toward common good for all human beings and without anyone being subservient
[33:44.960 --> 33:51.920]  to anyone else. Without social stratification, whether it be technical elitism or any other
[33:51.920 --> 33:59.200]  kind of elitism eradicated from the face of the earth. The state does nothing because there is no
[33:59.200 --> 34:05.440]  state. There is no state. We're all of the left of the old engineers and mechanics have
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.080]  paged ourselves to salvage the world. We have the airways, all is left of them. We have the seas
[34:10.640 --> 34:15.600]  and we have ideas in common. The brotherhood of efficiency, the free masonry of science.
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.240]  This is how I conceive our plan of operations. First to round up a brick,
[34:20.240 --> 34:27.840]  that last is more vestige of ancient predatory soldierry. The last would be conquerors. Then
[34:27.840 --> 34:36.720]  settle, organize, advance. This is the only then that. And at last, wings over the world. And the
[34:36.720 --> 34:43.760]  new world begins. Yeah, we've heard all this before. The withering away of the state.
[34:43.760 --> 34:52.800]  We'll be discussing that today. We'll be going over that later.
[34:56.080 --> 35:07.440]  All right. I want to now get into the economy. And I'm going to open the phones
[35:07.440 --> 35:17.760]  up at 1-800-259-9231. And all of you are welcome to call in on the show specifically about all
[35:17.760 --> 35:21.280]  the discussions of martial law. We've seen now breaking into the mainstream news,
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.160]  of the hyperinflation that is already here and is going to be intensifying in the next
[35:26.160 --> 35:34.000]  couple of years. With devastating effect, we will be discussing all of that today.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.800]  Before I get into the economy, I wanted to first talk about Glenn Beck.
[35:41.920 --> 35:47.760]  Glenn Beck engages in a lot of double-speak. Or I should say, not even double-speak,
[35:47.760 --> 35:53.920]  talking out of both sides of his mouth. One show, he says, basically use the military on
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.720]  people that disagree with the government, implies that the Ron Paul movement are terrorist,
[35:58.720 --> 36:04.160]  says that there has to be restrictions on the we are change and 9-11 truth groups
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.880]  confronting politicians. Basically, he goes along with the talking point we saw the last year
[36:08.880 --> 36:16.960]  from CNN to MSNBC to CNBC to Fox, saying taser 9-11 truthers, arrest 9-11 truthers,
[36:16.960 --> 36:23.600]  take us to prisons. And then what happened is Glenn Beck got throttled by his listeners.
[36:24.400 --> 36:28.000]  And now he talks about the New World Order, how they're setting up a global banking system,
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.560]  because now it's time for that to come out. Now the mainstream media from the Wall Street Journal
[36:32.560 --> 36:40.400]  to BBC to the Yorkshire Post, Mikhail Gorbachev, the left, the right, Donald Trump, they're all
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.760]  saying this is good, a government run by the banks for the good of the people, as the banks are
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.240]  given all the remaining liquidity and the public gets nothing so they can consolidate everything.
[36:50.960 --> 36:57.120]  We have nothing, they have everything. And they tell the foolish public that it's socialism.
[36:57.120 --> 36:58.960]  No, it's just crime.
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.160]  So Glenn Beck, if you will remember, back in November, mid-November 2007,
[37:09.120 --> 37:11.760]  when we wrote stories at infowars.com or prismplanet.com,
[37:13.440 --> 37:19.120]  he came out and did a 10-minute diatribe with Winston Churchill's grandson
[37:20.080 --> 37:24.480]  and all, you know, talking about how Americans were out of control and dangerous and threatening
[37:24.480 --> 37:31.200]  the government. And he had another neocon, ex-Marxist David Horowitz, smearing Ron Paul supporters,
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.200]  basically as terrorists, and saying we were in bed with Islamic fascist Ann Bin Laden. I mean,
[37:37.200 --> 37:43.440]  no, we're not the bushes with the Saudi Arabians and the Wahhabist. Just on and on and on. So I
[37:43.440 --> 37:51.600]  wanted to play this clip first and then get to Glenn Beck two nights ago, October 13th,
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.800]  talking about Plan B. First, he comes in with the Weimar Republic and a wheelbarrow of money to buy
[37:56.800 --> 38:03.760]  loaf of bread. And then acts like the banks, this is all happening by accident. And you know,
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.280]  do we need a global government to fix it? Is that coming? He's introducing, and then he says,
[38:07.280 --> 38:14.320]  Plan B, use the military to carry this out. And then he comes in and says it's kind of a bad thing
[38:14.320 --> 38:18.480]  to threaten Congress with the military. See how it's openly being introduced, because now we're
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.600]  coming up to the time for all this to happen. They have to emerge. They have to come from under
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.360]  the sea of ideas and information hidden from white papers and government documents to
[38:30.480 --> 38:36.800]  plain view, but putting their spin on it. So here is Glenn Beck, and the clip has a lot of
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.280]  horrible stuff. I can't play the whole 10 minute clip, but you can go watch the whole thing if
[38:41.280 --> 38:49.200]  you want, up on infowars.com. From last year, badmouthing the Ron Paul movement, talking about
[38:49.200 --> 38:53.520]  enemies who are domestic and needing to use the military. Here it is. You know, I was thinking
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.760]  this morning, when you enlist in the military, you have to take an oath that says you're going to
[38:57.760 --> 39:03.200]  support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[39:03.200 --> 39:08.240]  On this program, we talk a lot about the foreign threats. Maybe tonight we should spend some time
[39:08.240 --> 39:14.560]  on the growing domestic one. It's easy to sit back and watch television and complain that our
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.840]  politicians aren't listening to us, that they're lying to us about the border, about out of control,
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.600]  spending, or their apparent relentless quest to hand our country over to special interests.
[39:25.600 --> 39:32.320]  It feels, at least to me, like our leaders reflect in America that most of us don't even recognize.
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.400]  Well, here's the point tonight. While our foreign enemies are the obvious ones, the physical threat
[39:39.040 --> 39:45.360]  may be developing domestically as well. Here's how I got there. As I told you last week, Ron Paul
[39:45.360 --> 39:52.800]  raised over $4 million in one day. That's huge news. His supporters raised the cash on November
[39:52.800 --> 39:59.200]  the 5th to commemorate Guy Fox. This guy was a British terrorist who tried to overthrow the
[39:59.200 --> 40:04.080]  government by blowing up parliament and killing everybody in it. Paul's supporters called the
[40:04.080 --> 40:11.120]  donations, and I'm quoting, a money bomb. Fox was caught the very last minute, some say, with a
[40:11.120 --> 40:17.200]  hand on a torch about to light the gunpowder under parliament. Now, the vast majority of Paul's
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.960]  supporters take this little metaphor the way it's intended as a rallying cry to create a dramatic
[40:22.960 --> 40:30.560]  political shift. It's really not the way I would go tying my movement in with a historical terrorist
[40:30.560 --> 40:37.200]  attack, especially in post-911 America. But hey, I'm a libertarian in heart. I get it. You raise
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.960]  money however you want, as long as you're not blowing other people up. But America, here's what
[40:42.960 --> 40:49.280]  you need to know tonight. Ron Paul's supporters are tapping in to something that's very real.
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.920]  It's something that I've talked about on this program for a very long time, the rising tide of
[40:53.920 --> 40:58.960]  disenfranchisement in this country. And it's coming from all sides of the political spectrum.
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.120]  If that feeling of disenfranchisement leads to political discussion, then our system works
[41:05.120 --> 41:11.040]  perfectly. But if fringe elements take that disenfranchisement and turn it into violence,
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.560]  we endanger the freedoms we're supposedly all fighting for. David Horowitz is the author of
[41:16.560 --> 41:22.400]  Indoctrination U, The Left's War Against Academic Freedom, and Jonathan Sands. He is a writer and
[41:22.400 --> 41:29.840]  founder of Churchill's Britain. He is also the great grandson of Sir Winston Churchill. Jonathan,
[41:29.840 --> 41:32.880]  and David, it's good to have you here. Jonathan, let me have that. All right, that's enough. Let me
[41:32.880 --> 41:38.240]  start with you. And then it goes into our terrorist and his guest. You know, say Ron Paul, people
[41:38.240 --> 41:46.880]  are controlled by Al Qaeda, and then Lou Rockwell, who's really milk toast is with Al Qaeda. So that's
[41:46.880 --> 41:51.600]  the type of stuff he's been doing, the basic talking point and showing US troops on the streets
[41:51.600 --> 41:57.280]  to keep us safe from the Ron Paul money bombers. Hey, they go on to say Ron Paul had the idea of
[41:57.280 --> 42:01.840]  Guy Fox. Now, it wasn't even Guy Fox. It was the idea of the movie V for Vendetta,
[42:01.840 --> 42:08.800]  and that movie about the fight against tyranny. Okay, so it was even an expression of that,
[42:08.800 --> 42:14.320]  and it didn't come from Ron Paul. And the money bomb term, as I've talked to people that originally
[42:14.320 --> 42:19.040]  invented the idea, it came from the idea of the Info War, which I certainly didn't invent,
[42:19.040 --> 42:25.680]  but I popularized with infowars.com 12 years ago, how these are weapons and how my films are
[42:25.680 --> 42:35.120]  info bombs, and how we're out blasting holes in the facade of lies. Now, this is going back two
[42:35.120 --> 42:41.280]  nights ago, and there's many facets to this why this is so important. It's all over mainstream news
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.920]  now. Yeah, there may be martial law. Yeah, the troops may be needed. And then his guest, Mr.
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.800]  Schiff, who we've had on as well, says, well, you know, I think the people are going to want the
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.600]  troops. You know, we're going to have riots. Well, yeah, the establishment, the social engineers,
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.560]  the social planners, they know exactly what they're doing. So all of this will be presented in a way
[43:00.560 --> 43:07.600]  where it looks like it's needed. That's the key to these propaganda wars, their Info War,
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.600]  against us. So here's one back. Somebody, I talked to somebody at church yesterday,
[43:11.600 --> 43:14.720]  and he said, I was reading something about Peter. I want you to stick around for a second after
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.480]  the break. I want to talk to you about something else that has been on my mind. And apparently,
[43:18.480 --> 43:22.880]  at least according to one of my friends at church, you, it's on your mind as well. When people are
[43:22.880 --> 43:26.880]  frightened, they make different decisions than they would when they were feeling safe or secure.
[43:27.520 --> 43:33.520]  Sometimes when that fear is justified, I mean, it's common sense. But when that fear is manufactured,
[43:33.520 --> 43:39.360]  it feels an awful lot like coercion. For instance, when the US bailout bill was trying to be jammed
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.720]  through Congress, some members say there was an organized effort to scare them into signing.
[43:44.720 --> 43:51.600]  Here is the California Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman. Many of us were told in private
[43:51.600 --> 43:58.560]  conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall,
[43:59.200 --> 44:03.360]  the market would drop two or 3,000 points the first day, another couple of thousand the second day.
[44:03.920 --> 44:09.920]  And a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[44:09.920 --> 44:17.280]  That's what I call fear mongering. Okay. We've called this congressman's office. He's not speaking
[44:17.280 --> 44:23.200]  to the press. I wonder if there's more fear or intimidation going on. Martial law. Could it really
[44:23.200 --> 44:27.760]  have happened? Joining me once again is Euro PAC president and author of an author, Peter Schiff.
[44:28.480 --> 44:33.920]  Peter, let's talk a little bit about martial law. Why would that even be a consideration?
[44:33.920 --> 44:38.560]  Well, I don't think it was a threat if they had rejected the bailout bill. But I think it is a
[44:38.560 --> 44:43.440]  possibility a few years down the line. We just spoke a little bit about price controls and the
[44:43.440 --> 44:48.400]  effect that they're going to have. If we have shortages of food, if we have rolling blackouts
[44:48.400 --> 44:52.720]  and people are upset and they're hungry and they're cold, there could be civil unrest,
[44:52.720 --> 44:57.280]  there could be looting, rioting, and that might be the impetus for the government to declare
[44:57.280 --> 45:00.960]  martial law. You know, I don't think you're a couple of years away from something like that.
[45:00.960 --> 45:06.160]  I mean, honestly, Peter, I mean, look at what's happening. In a half hour, I've got a congressman
[45:06.160 --> 45:14.000]  on about the racism cries. I mean, there are people that are right now. It goes on and on.
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.720]  There's like five more minutes of it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. If you want to go
[45:19.360 --> 45:25.040]  read the story from infowars.net that Steve Watson wrote last night about this.
[45:26.560 --> 45:31.840]  Now, remember for cops and FBI and everybody else, but people especially in the system on
[45:31.840 --> 45:38.000]  the front lines of enforcing all this, I wrote books and made films saying exactly what would
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.600]  happen. I said the government would stage terror attacks and then use that to set up a police
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.240]  state that the police state was being set up so the public couldn't struggle or resist
[45:46.240 --> 45:52.640]  when we go into receivership. And then exactly what I said is now happening in much more fine
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.400]  detail, hundreds of hours of broadcast on it over and over again, beating the drum. Now,
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.840]  did I just magically pull this out of a hat? No, I gave you all the documents,
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.040]  the quotes, how the rulers of this global corporate state said they would do this.
[46:09.680 --> 46:15.280]  I watched them do it on a lower level in third world countries and second world nations and
[46:15.280 --> 46:23.280]  some first world nations. They're doing it in Iceland right now, Argentina. And so we know
[46:23.280 --> 46:30.720]  exactly how they do this. This is Anglo-Imperial rule. This is the Anglo-American establishment.
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.040]  We call them that because that's their name and their internal documents that they give themselves.
[46:36.240 --> 46:40.640]  And this is economic warfare. These are conquerors. That's why they run the planet.
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.120]  They're cold-blooded. They have their PR people with smiling faces telling you all day and info
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.720]  babes looking at you with sexual desire through the camera, giggling and laughing. And I was
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.800]  watching Fox today and they had some lady from England going, the government says Alcatraz is
[46:54.800 --> 46:58.080]  about to strike. Oh, we have to give Apollo rights. That's why there's even more cameras
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.480]  in security and checkpoints needed. Oh, thank God for the British government. They cut to the house
[47:02.480 --> 47:11.040]  of lords. And they're all there to tell you, we're your friends. We're here to help. Now,
[47:11.040 --> 47:16.320]  these are conquerors. They control the left. They control the right. They are literally going to
[47:16.320 --> 47:21.840]  tax the air we breathe in their own words, the carbon tax, regulate every facet of our lives,
[47:22.720 --> 47:26.240]  take the middle class private property. The poor will be worse off than ever.
[47:26.880 --> 47:30.560]  But the poor are going to be clamoring for this new global socialist system
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.680]  because they believe socialism for the people. They don't understand it was created by the Anglo-
[47:35.680 --> 47:42.400]  American establishment in England 170 years ago that the British crown financed
[47:42.400 --> 47:48.080]  Marx and Ingalls that they financed the Bolshevik overthrow of their cousins, the Czars.
[47:50.080 --> 47:57.920]  This is imperial operations. The Imperials are in control because they're slick. They're ruthless.
[47:57.920 --> 48:03.600]  They're smart. They have the top sociologist and psychologist. They have a scientific
[48:03.600 --> 48:08.080]  dictatorship. All these well-meaning mid-level leftists and progressives,
[48:08.080 --> 48:13.440]  like you see in Zeitgeist Addendum, they're like, we'll have a wonderful planned society and
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.720]  total freedom and machines empowering everyone and social engineering. It'll be beautiful.
[48:18.720 --> 48:23.920]  We could have a scientific culture. Why don't the governments plan scientifically?
[48:23.920 --> 48:27.200]  They're just a bunch of idiots who can't even wipe their noses.
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.040]  But they can take over nations and overthrow things and engage in perfect propaganda
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.960]  systematically and fool you that they're a bunch of buffoons.
[48:39.680 --> 48:43.680]  They can surveil all the parliaments and the congress and engage in every crime you can imagine
[48:43.680 --> 48:46.240]  and shoot cruise missiles 30 years ago down chimneys.
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.560]  And they got infrared face scanners. They're tracking everybody in real time, but they,
[48:53.520 --> 48:58.720]  we need social planning. We haven't had any. Oh, we've had total social planning.
[48:58.720 --> 49:04.880]  By its very nature, it centralizes and it's very dangerous and destructive.
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.480]  And by human nature, in a large society of billions of people, we're going to have planning
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.880]  and we're going to have some government. We've got the other side who believes that there'll
[49:14.880 --> 49:20.000]  be no government. Or they'll say, we'll have social planners and scientists run everything,
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.400]  but there'll be no government. We will have the earth run on the exact amount of load it can take.
[49:26.400 --> 49:31.680]  Who decides that? The engineers, the social planners, the scientists, and some of them
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.320]  will be wrong. Some of them will be evil. Some of them will have access to grind and egos and
[49:36.320 --> 49:43.200]  there will be lies and there will be tyranny. That's just human nature. But we always have
[49:43.200 --> 49:49.360]  the utopia people flattering around. Oh, it'll be a, we, why don't we have a scientific government?
[49:49.360 --> 49:59.600]  We do. We do. We do. They call it the scientific dictatorship and they sold their underlings 150
[49:59.600 --> 50:03.840]  years ago, 100 years ago, 80 years ago, 50 years ago, 20 years ago, a year ago, today,
[50:04.720 --> 50:10.400]  with lots of images of spaceships and escalators and air cars and glistening white buildings.
[50:10.400 --> 50:19.840]  Oh, a utopia. A utopia. And you see what they build. It's going to be wonderful.

[51:35.120 --> 51:40.640]  a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[51:41.200 --> 51:46.320]  But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to
[51:46.320 --> 51:51.280]  look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the
[51:51.280 --> 51:56.560]  terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe
[51:56.560 --> 52:03.280]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some
[52:03.280 --> 52:08.720]  Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to
[52:08.720 --> 52:13.760]  the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[52:13.760 --> 52:19.440]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com

[52:37.120 --> 52:41.280]  Poor quality gasoline in the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly

[53:49.040 --> 54:00.880]  Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John.
[54:02.560 --> 54:08.400]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home. He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[54:08.400 --> 54:14.320]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but he spoke it all. He just said hi to Big John.
[54:14.320 --> 54:22.800]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crash
[54:22.800 --> 54:31.120]  and blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land. Big John, Big John,
[54:31.120 --> 54:45.200]  Big John, Big Bad John, Big John. Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when a timber
[54:45.200 --> 54:51.120]  cracked and men started crying. Miners were praying and hearts beat fast. Everybody thought
[54:51.120 --> 54:58.560]  it did breathe the last sip, John. Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell off the
[54:58.560 --> 55:04.080]  giant of a man. The miners knew well, grabbed a second timber, gave out with a groan and like a
[55:04.080 --> 55:16.560]  giant of a tree, just stood there alone. Big John, Big John, Big Bad John. We're here Monday
[55:16.560 --> 55:23.840]  through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. With all the strength he gave a mighty shove, then a miner
[55:23.840 --> 55:29.520]  yelled out there's a light up above and 20 men scrambled from a would-be grave. Now there's
[55:29.520 --> 55:35.920]  only one left down there to save Big John. Now drops below 9,000 with jacks and timbers they
[55:35.920 --> 55:41.360]  started back down and keep that rumble weed down on the ground and the smoke and gas bell
[55:41.360 --> 55:47.680]  started that mine. Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John. Now drops below 9,000
[55:47.680 --> 55:54.560]  Big John banks skid down about 300 points, 292.31 right down.
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.560]  Let's play the end of this. Now they never reopened that worthless pit. They just placed
[56:02.560 --> 56:10.080]  a marble stand in front of it. These few words are written on that stand. At the bottom of this
[56:10.080 --> 56:25.600]  line lies a big, big man, Big John. Big John, Big John, Big Bad John. All right, we're going to start
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.800]  the second hour here in just a few minutes. We're about an hour and five minutes away from our little
[56:30.800 --> 56:36.720]  discussion with the creator of Zeitgeist Peter Joseph that should be very interesting. I mean,
[56:36.720 --> 56:42.080]  I hardly even talked about it. I said, I think it's an overall good film, great monetary information.
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.640]  The other film is great about 9-11. I don't agree with some kind of making fun of people that have
[56:46.640 --> 56:50.400]  any religious beliefs. There's a lot of stuff people don't know in this world, folks. We only
[56:50.400 --> 57:02.640]  pick up a very narrow band of the visible spectrum is very small compared to what science knows is
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.320]  in reality. A lot of genetic engineers, a lot of physicists who are atheists or agnostics,
[57:08.320 --> 57:14.080]  they get religion once they get into the higher levels of research and they see the craftsmanship,
[57:15.120 --> 57:23.600]  the order to the universe. It's easy to make fun of Christians and it's easy to make fun of people.
[57:23.600 --> 57:28.480]  I'm still nice about it. I'm like, well, that's your view. That's okay. Can I say that I don't
[57:28.480 --> 57:32.560]  really agree with you and that you had to change some stuff in your first edition because it was
[57:32.560 --> 57:37.440]  inaccurate about which God was what and claiming that Christ was the reincarnation of a sun God
[57:37.440 --> 57:47.280]  or that they were just repeating older legends. I got attacked pretty bad. I had committed sacrilege.
[57:47.280 --> 57:53.520]  I had heard a religion. Any inhumanism, atheism is someone of religion. I say that most of the film,
[57:53.520 --> 57:57.200]  the other 80%, is good. The new one, I just said, when I hear about global government,
[57:57.200 --> 58:05.040]  when I hear about eradicating classes, that really concerns me. Boy, it caused a big ruckus.
[58:05.040 --> 58:09.120]  So I said, well, we better just have this guy on. I don't know if I'm allowed to ask questions,
[58:09.120 --> 58:18.720]  but of the pope. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:18.720 --> 58:26.560]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.960]  9-Eleven was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from
[58:30.960 --> 58:35.600]  the New World Order? I'll do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage. It was engineered by
[58:35.600 --> 58:41.520]  you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF, and we sit down to shout out. The day that
[58:41.520 --> 58:47.280]  we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own
[58:47.280 --> 58:54.880]  door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside
[58:54.880 --> 59:03.360]  job? How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for
[59:03.360 --> 59:08.480]  treason yourself. Well, Helen is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told
[59:08.480 --> 59:13.920]  the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that. Please rise. Download
[59:13.920 --> 59:19.680]  the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com. It's now time to take the
[59:19.680 --> 59:29.440]  revolution at the next level. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[59:29.440 --> 59:45.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[59:45.680 --> 1:00:00.640]  on the GCM Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Well, Bernanke says the
[1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:06.960]  credit crisis is a major threat to the economy. Well, he should know the central banks have shot
[1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:12.240]  off liquidity to the entire real economy, not just individuals. And then they threaten the
[1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:16.080]  Congress and the Parliament of Europe, the Congress in the US and the Parliaments of Europe,
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:23.360]  into giving them tens of trillions of dollars, which will then devalue the currencies and have
[1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:29.520]  the central banks be in the only tenable position so they can have a global consolidation.
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:34.160]  By the way, I'm not the only one saying this. A year and a half ago, there were several big
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:39.520]  articles by top economists in the Financial Times of London, the true paper of record on the economy.
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:46.880]  That's what the elite reads. It's thinly veiled in there. Almost all of it is true. Big secret
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:51.760]  there I'll let you in on. I don't think a lot of people even understand that. It's not a secret.
[1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:55.440]  I'm being sarcastic, but most people don't know that. You still can't believe all of it,
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:01:01.840]  but it's amazingly accurate in there. Business Week came out two days ago. Got a big article here
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:09.280]  and admitted that the private fellow reserves, small group of banks, are actually consolidating
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:16.240]  power and that this is their takeover and this is wonderful for them. I mean, Business Week is
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:23.520]  telling the truth. So for anybody in the know, this is a fact. This is a fact. This is a fact.
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:32.320]  And I would say 90% of our guests, all these different financial experts,
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:37.040]  economists, Nobel Prize winners in economics and others that we've been having on the show
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:42.160]  over the last few years, they concur. This is an engineered operation.
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:49.520]  This is an engineered operation. Now, there's a variant in that 15, 20% that disagree with us.
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:54.400]  Most of them, like Bob Chapman, believe that they plan to implode things and have their own
[1:01:54.400 --> 1:02:00.240]  documents. I mean, he knows that, but that they've lost control. That is even more scary in a way
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:06.960]  because there is no telling what they will do if that's really true. Because I know the globalists
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:12.240]  in their own documents want a slow, gradual enslavement, serfdom, implosion of the middle
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:17.440]  class and an indentured servitude population who has to basically be on government welfare
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.920]  or government-funded jobs where it won't be called welfare for the old middle class,
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:25.600]  but the government will be funding the corporation you work for. It'll just be basically
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:30.240]  corporate welfare. The government will pay a select group. It'll be an oligopoly, a combine,
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:35.120]  a cartel, and then you'll work for the cartel. Or you'll work in prisons or surveillance or
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.560]  maintenance of hover drones or cameras or the expanded SWAT teams that they're just making
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:44.640]  huge SWAT teams everywhere to steal your kids when you fight back or take your house when you
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:52.400]  fight back. I mean, just classic tyranny. Classical tyranny. And they want a slow,
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:57.600]  you know, over the next five years, what they were saying two years ago. Well, it's definitely
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:02.880]  not slow now. So you can debate whether they're in control of it or not. The point is, they're
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:07.440]  certainly getting fat off of it. They're certainly getting bigger and batter and stronger. See,
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:13.360]  they're flush in capital when nobody else has got it. They were already flush in it. Now,
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:18.160]  they're gorging on trillions a month, and they're buying whatever they want. And the
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:24.240]  medial focus in on some AIG people, you know, in $2,000 an night hotel rooms and caviar,
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:28.240]  because they know that's something that kind of low level worker bees can identify with.
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:32.080]  You know, they can't think of trillions in leveraged debt, you know, per globalist at the top.
[1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:36.320]  They can't imagine people worth hundreds of billions in public money. You know, that
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:41.440]  Forbes 500 list or the hundred riches is nothing, folks, to the true assets that the whole thing
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:48.320]  about real wealth is hiding it. So they'll talk about, oh, this CEO got 500 million or 20 million
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:54.640]  or they had caviar and they have a yacht. They're just managers for the private families of the
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:00.800]  dominant and secret shareholders and institutional shareholders and law firm shareholders and
[1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:11.520]  shareholders and company shareholders and foundation shareholders. So while you're going, they don't deserve caviar.
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:17.120]  The real operations are going on. You got to get outside the box and get outside that box and get
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:22.080]  outside the next box and study history. It'll give you a lens of the future straight to your calls
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:31.680]  on the other side. Dow drops below 9,000 banks skid.

[1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:38.800]  long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemies
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:45.040]  start America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:49.920]  to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:54.880]  take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:59.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:06.400]  in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections
[1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:11.840]  to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence
[1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:16.880]  network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:59.120]  words, ozone do? Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:04.320]  operations. And have you ever heard of ozone therapy? Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on
[1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:09.760]  ozone therapy. Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level,
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:15.120]  which studies suggest boosts the immune system. You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic

[1:07:55.920 --> 1:08:04.880]  Satellite. Number one radio talk show every day of the week at Shoutcast. Number one talk radio
[1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:10.000]  show rated about number 18 of all radio on the internet, most of that being music.
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:18.080]  There's an example of how the truth is getting out there and that's only one small leg on the
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:24.080]  Info Wars family table. This table's got about 20 legs and we're growing new ones all the time.
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:30.480]  Diversify, diversify, expand into more media outlets. That is the key and that's what I advise
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:36.800]  other burgeoning talk show hosts, radio people, filmmakers to do and that is what they're doing
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:43.520]  and it's beautiful and whether you have 20 internet listeners or half a million every day
[1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:51.280]  doesn't matter. You are reaching out and every person you wake up is wonderful. I'll send an
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:57.920]  audio clip the other day and an article along with it. Somebody saying, Alex Jones is saying
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:02.640]  that individual listeners don't matter and people doing their own blogs and their own websites and
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:10.240]  their own audio feeds is worthless and they're nothing to him and I want those people to know
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:16.400]  something. That is not what I'm saying. If you're misunderstood, let me explain it. I'm saying,
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:22.480]  I'm not talking about it. It's incredible. I can talk about how Turner bad and people think I'm
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:32.960]  talking about them or I can talk about some other group or individual and then everything
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:38.080]  I say just in generalities about some group or some unsavory person is an attribute and everyone
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:42.400]  takes that to themselves and attributes themselves. A few a month ago or so and I was ranting and
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:46.880]  raving about crazy people with little radio networks and radio shows thinking I'm in their
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:53.040]  business. The whole point was I was saying I'm not in your business. I don't care about you,
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:58.240]  not in the sense of I don't want you to be run over by a truck on the street or not in the sense
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:04.720]  of what you're doing is important but in the sense of you have attacked me and lied and people are
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:10.160]  asking what I'm talking about. It's inside baseball. It doesn't matter. The only reason it matters is
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:15.520]  because I know some of these people and so I did nothing but help these people and it makes me mad
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:21.040]  when they make stuff up about me and then I say, hey, I don't care about you in the sense of I'm
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:28.560]  not in competition with you. I'm not threatened by you and I'm trying to get more people activated,
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:36.400]  more people taking action, more people involved and it irritates me to always have people inventing
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:46.640]  stuff. I mean, I'm a Scientologist. I'm a Catholic assassin. I'm a Zionist agent. I am hijacking
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:53.280]  and taking over this radio network or that. It's all made up crap to the point of I have to fire
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:58.240]  people that work for me just because they're somewhat involved with these groups so I can say
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:06.800]  out of my life, out, out, out, I want nothing to do with you because and this happens to anybody
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:11.360]  that gets famous and I don't like it. I don't enjoy it. I don't like having a target on my back. I
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:15.440]  like knowing that I've become very well known worldwide to anybody who's politically active,
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:20.800]  even mainline politics because it means I'm having a big effect but I don't like the fact that people
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:30.480]  invent almost schizophrenic lies about things I'm involved with and things I do. I don't like that
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:37.360]  and I don't like people come over my office and doing stuff to our cars and I have to be quiet
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:41.280]  about it because if I talk about them, it'll make the patriot movement look bad. I mean,
[1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:46.640]  that's the kind of crap I go through from some of these local people who are completely out to get
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:51.680]  me because they bought into Kool-Aid drinking and then the delusions and the lies and the craziness
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:58.160]  and the things I know, it's horrible just how fallen society is and because I have to wall
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:04.960]  myself off for my own protection and say, look, I don't want to be touching you in any way.
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:11.600]  I don't want to be because I can't allow to be grounded like an electrical field connected
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.480]  to any of these people. A lot of folks in the, quote, awakening movement period because any
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:21.200]  connection I have to them can then be misrepresented. They can say they're me. They can do things in
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.720]  my name. That's how it all starts. Then they can lie about you for the political capital it gets
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:33.040]  them to say, hey, I'm going to shoot out with Alex Jones and then they hate being ostracized so they
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:39.840]  just go into rages. They go crazy and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as they get
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:46.960]  ostracized. So that's the bottom line. Let me tell you whose life I'm involved with. Mine.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.520]  I'm like everybody else. I got to go out and buy Manila folders for the office and light bulbs
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:13:01.840]  and I screw light bulbs in and I carry the trash out and the air conditioner freezes up for three
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:07.280]  days and we're in here sweating and we call an air conditioner place just like everybody else does
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:16.560]  and I put a dress shirt on and I forget to put my belt on and I walk out my front door and it's
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:22.800]  raining and I fall on my butt. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, when I go to the bathroom it stinks.
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:30.480]  I hate to have to even go further there. I'm not God and I'm not all powerful and I'm barely
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:35.520]  able to keep my websites and my audio streams and make my films and do everything I do
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:41.680]  and it's attached to feed my children in the morning and give them showers, baths,
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:51.520]  put clothes on them, feed them, all of it and paying taxes in all of it because on the internet
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:56.720]  with people that love me and people that hate me, it's taken on some type of superhuman
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:03.360]  idea and the same thing with the government and the elite. People think they're superhuman.
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:07.280]  No, they're very well organized. They're very cold. They're very sinister. They understand basic
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:15.120]  human psychology. They are something to behold but they're not superhuman. They're not invincible
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:21.840]  and it's the same thing with Alex Jones. I'm way below those people in organizational skill and
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:27.440]  focus and also I play by the rules and have a big heart which they see as a weakness.
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:30.800]  So I'm going to go to your calls but just going off into a rant here because I was just thinking
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:37.360]  about it, reading an email somebody sent me. It is sad for me to have to ostracize people out of my
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:42.720]  life. You know, there might be a website. I'm linking to routinely promoting, building up because
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:47.280]  they have good material but then they go on a wild jagged line about me and then saying horrible
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:52.000]  things I've done to them and then my mother calls up and saying, is this true? Did you do this,
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:57.440]  this and that and it's the first I learned of the crimes I've committed? I say no, Mommy, I didn't.
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:04.960]  I'm sorry you heard that on the radio. No, I didn't know about it. I committed these crimes
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:10.960]  and then you have to ostracize those people and they're not looking at their actions,
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:16.400]  how they're being ostracized. It's all because of you. See, that's self-fulfilling. They come up,
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:21.040]  smack you in the face, lie about you, attack you, do horrible things to you.
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:26.720]  When I had one guy call up and say, look, I'm going to basically say a bunch of horrible
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:30.000]  stuff about you if you don't do what I say and I say, that's blackmail, go to hell, basically.
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:34.800]  It's like, I then, for the betterment of the movement, don't go on air and talk about all
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:38.480]  the incredible behind the scenes things because I have no enjoyment destroying someone
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:44.880]  because we destroy ourselves in the process. I don't know why I'm even talking about it. The
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:51.360]  point is that it is painful to know I'm genuine, to know I'm for real, to know I am salt of the
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:16:01.760]  earth. Got my problems, but I'm a good guy and I care about people and I'm here to build others
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:06.960]  up and empower others and it's just sad and I've seen it a million times and these people come
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:13.840]  and go. We've seen it with so many other people, hundreds and hundreds of talk show hosts and
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:20.400]  webmasters and people and their websites getting big, they're reaching out and then suddenly
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:24.400]  they start attacking everybody and first they get a big response from attacking and they think,
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:27.840]  oh, this is the way to go. This is really getting me a lot of attention, but that's negative and
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:32.720]  it's destroying them and then they fall off the face of the earth. So I'm done talking about that.
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:37.920]  I want to talk about the economy in detail here. Gold's of about 20 bucks in the last two days.
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:44.800]  It's up about $9 today so far and it's finally hitting mainstream news and a third of the media
[1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:52.800]  is going, wait a minute, gold everywhere selling for about $950 an ounce. Silver's $16 to $20. You
[1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:58.720]  can find it for $16 if you find it from private people selling it, if you look hard, but on average
[1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:03.920]  people are paying about $20 an ounce for, you know, silver dollars. That's a low price. They're
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:13.360]  like $30, $40 on eBay and they're going, wait a minute, silver's $11 an ounce or to be technical
[1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:18.480]  $10, $80 or something. How is that? But then I got to pay 20 bucks for it. Well, wait a minute,
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:24.240]  gold is $850 but I've got to pay $1,000 for it or I call the place and they don't have any gold.
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:31.760]  And so finally what Gata and others sued to expose is coming out. The paper market is one thing.
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:37.840]  That's all that is. The paper market in gold says it's $850. The real world says it's $1,000
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:43.760]  and the mints are sold out in the US, Canada, Germany, Russia, selling out in England
[1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:49.600]  because the mints have to buy what the paper amounts is. They say, okay, we need gold. It's
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:54.960]  $850. We need to buy more to make more American Eagles or more Buffaloes or more Maple Leafs or
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:18:01.680]  more Krugerans, South Africa's out. And the mint says to the state, sorry to the government,
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:05.920]  we can't sell you gold at $850 or $800 or $780 like it was a month ago.
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:12.400]  And so they say, okay, well, we have to follow under federal rules in all these nations. We
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:18.080]  have to only buy gold at spot to make it into coin. We can't pay premiums. So we're just not
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:26.400]  going to make coins anymore. See, that's not a free market. That is a engineered controlled
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:33.520]  kleptocracy from the top. But look, I said I'm going to go to your calls and I promise
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:41.680]  we're going to go to Mike, Aaron, Garrett, Matt, and Maugh Justice as soon as we come back from
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:48.000]  this quick break. I didn't mean to go into a 10 minute rant about other issues. It's just the
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:52.960]  morbidity and the elite, the morbidity in the culture. I mean, we're an evil culture on average.
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:57.360]  I mean, we kill 50 million babies in the US. We're corrupt. We warehouse our old folks to die
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:02.160]  of bed sores all over them. Well, we watch millions of simulated murders on TV.
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:07.680]  And so just because people out there have woken up the new world order doesn't mean they woken
[1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:14.880]  up to their own selves. And you know, just like the Don Henley song says, it's an inside job.
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:20.560]  Everything is. It's an inside job for us to fix ourselves and to be good people and to be honest
[1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:24.880]  with ourselves. And if you can't be honest with yourself, that's the first step in any fight
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:29.760]  in any fight for realization and consciousness. We have an unconscious population.
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:35.600]  Honey, have you seen the remote? Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:40.800]  I can't find my wallet. Sound familiar? Why not save time looking for lost things and lose

[1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:43.040]  investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA? That's right. Gold has been available to be
[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:50.000]  placed in IRAs since 1986. Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.920]  hard assets for your retirement. The truth be told, gold and silver is outperform paper investments
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:02.320]  like stocks, bonds and CDs. Yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want to
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:07.280]  maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at gold
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:14.480]  for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return
[1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:24.800]  on your paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:34.720]  That's 1-800-686-2237. Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:39.360]  destroying national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:43.280]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:48.160]  patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:52.400]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:40.480]  All right. Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Florida. Mike here on the air. Welcome.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.280]  Hi, Alex. I want to touch on a couple of things. Four main things here and I'll be quick. First,
[1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:52.800]  I wanted to bring up the Alaskan Independent Party, which Sarah Palin has ties to. Now,
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:59.280]  I originally saw this on the Rachel Maddrow show after Keith Oberman on MSNBC and I looked into it
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:03.600]  and it turned out to be true. She was a member, not a member of that party, but she definitely
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:07.280]  supports that party. Well, I'm not an expert on them, but I think they're a libertarian
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:12.160]  pro-second amendment anti-New World Order group. I think I've even had them on as a
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:18.240]  guest a couple times over the last decade plus. In my view, I'm not an expert on them as positive.
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:23.040]  Right. It's very positive and let me be clear everyone out there. I'm not supporting McCain
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:28.080]  by saying this. I don't like Obama either. I'm not for any of them, but there's video here of Palin
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:34.080]  supporting them, Alex, and it's on video and Dexter. Let me get the name right here.
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:44.720]  Sir, are you there? Yes. AIP's Vice Chairman Dexter Carter loves Governor Palin and his
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:50.880]  whole main point is for them to infiltrate the two-party system because she was an independent
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:54.320]  before she became a Republican. I didn't know any of this until I looked it up.
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:01.120]  He wants them to infiltrate into the Democrats and the Republicans so they can pull off their
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:06.240]  mission and that is to secede from the union because of the New World Order. That's the big
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:11.680]  reason because of the New World Order. There's also a Canadian secession movement that wants
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:18.000]  different parts to secede and they're big listeners in anti-New World Order. It's easy to demonize
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  those groups too because somebody can easily find globalist affiliations. That's because the
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:28.960]  globalists are always going to try to reverse, infiltrate those groups. You're going to have
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:32.400]  people from the top going into the bottom, people from the bottom going into the top.
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:39.200]  I think Palin is really just an opportunist and in Alaska, the Alaska Independence Party,
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:44.080]  I know, just from memory has gotten, I want to say, 20-plus percent of the vote. In some cases,
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:49.200]  they've elected people to a pretty high office in the state. It's less than a million people in
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:55.920]  the state. Of course, she had to pander to the patriot groups because they're very strong,
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:26:03.520]  probably the strongest of anywhere in Alaska because of such a small state. I really think
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:09.920]  that's Palin pandering into them. But it doesn't matter. The elite's going to put into office
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:16.160]  who they want. We know the electronic voting machines, even if they're central tabulated,
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:20.080]  are frauds. I don't have a right to vote in Travis County and that's been proven.
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:23.360]  It's been certified by the state. I caught them. Others caught them and the state said,
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:25.920]  oh, we're just allowed to do this. That's how it works.
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:30.960]  Another thing I wanted to bring up here real quick, order Chinese food the other night,
[1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:35.040]  open the fortune cookie, and this is what came out. It says, do not worry about holding
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:39.520]  a high position. Worry rather about playing your proper role.
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:48.800]  What do you think of that, Alex? That's more unbelievable. Also,
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:52.960]  the abolish the Federal Reserve Act petition. Go to Google. This is not my petition. It's just
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:56.800]  down here. Currently, it's 3,040 signatures. Type in abolish the Federal Reserve Act.
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:00.960]  Try to get as many people on this as possible. I'm going to let you go. I'm going to let you go.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.040]  So, I can get more callers in. Thank you, Mike. Eric in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:11.760]  Hey, Alex, it's been a long time since I talked to you. I would just like to preface this call
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:16.640]  by saying that I was not screened in any way. The only screening that took place before this call
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:23.120]  was... Who cares if people lie and say we screened and all the calls are fake? Let them all lie, man.
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:27.040]  I know, I know. There are huge sites where they... I mean, I don't even care. Look,
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:30.800]  everything's going to Hades in a handbasket and people want to make stuff up. Like I said,
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:36.400]  I've come to peace with it. You can't stop them. Yeah. Well, I mean, I would like to talk about
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:41.840]  how this financial stuff is affecting me and my family, but I would just like to say that,
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:47.520]  I have had doubts about you and others in the Patriot movement and I've looked
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:58.240]  into it and I just keep coming back to being at peace with you in my heart of hearts because
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:07.280]  the way you speak, your passion, what drives you and how you shun any kind of egomania or whatever
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:12.880]  just rings true to me like hitting a golf ball just right. If anybody's ever hit a golf ball
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:17.840]  just right, you know how it feels and it's just a feeling, man. Talking about hitting a sweet spot.
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:23.680]  Exactly. And I mean, just waiting for this to get on air with the way you're talking,
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:28.400]  it just so rings true with me. We just want to reach people because we care about people.
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:33.920]  Well, number one, I'm going to hold you over. Somebody who is New World Order isn't going to
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:38.160]  say we have power, we can affect change, get involved, good things are happening,
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:45.600]  they're good people. I mean, the New World Order is, it's ridiculous. And also,
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:50.240]  I've noticed this in, you know, just in life, getting things done. You'll look for an excuse
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:54.080]  before you go in and clean the garage. You'll find some excuse before you start the job.
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:58.400]  You'll procrastinate. And so a lot of people hear me put out this information. They know it's true,
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:03.520]  but they don't want to take action. So it's easier to sit around and kind of nitpick in the kingdom
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:08.960]  of alternative media and the kingdom of the patriot movement or the reality movement,
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:14.240]  the truth movement. And then I'm the king, though I don't want the kingship in the kingdom.
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:19.200]  And so they're, they're, people are going to talk about me. And then it only makes me bigger,
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:25.040]  actually, but it hurts the movement. Stay there. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:35.920]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:40.800]  Of course not. But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards
[1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:45.600]  in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing. I'm Wal Augustino. It's founder

[1:29:50.240 --> 1:29:54.720]  realize you already have one of these cards because they look physically just like the old card.
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:59.440]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card
[1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:04.640]  possible right through your wallet, purse or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.

[1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:05.600]  in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:10.800]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:15.120]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much,
[1:31:15.120 --> 1:31:22.000]  much more fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds

[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.480]  Eric, I was interrupted. Go ahead and finish up from California.
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:48.640]  Yeah, I don't want to waste any more time on your detractors and whatnot. Their hearts just
[1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:53.840]  aren't truly in it. And enough said on them, you know, the posters who just want a nitpick.
[1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:02.960]  Well, they're territorializing things and they just hate me because I'm successful. It is pure
[1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:09.120]  envy and most of it isn't even government. That's what's sad. They know how we act and how we behave
[1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:13.680]  and that holds us back. The sick thing is, like P.T. Barnum said, just get my name right. Spill my
[1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:19.360]  name right. That only makes this show and what we do bigger. People say, oh, I want to check into
[1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:23.600]  this. But the sad thing overall is a societal movement. It's a negative thing. Like, next hour
[1:33:23.600 --> 1:33:27.680]  when I have the zeitgeist going on, I'm going to try to not fight with him. I'm going to try to
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:31.200]  not argue with him. I'm going to try to talk about the good ideas they have from my perspective.
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:37.520]  And I'm doing this in a way to try to educate them from my perspective and maybe they can educate
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:43.120]  me. But go ahead. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And one thing that you could ask him, which is something
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:50.480]  I would like to ask a lot of truthers, is if they don't believe in higher power or God or Christ,
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:55.360]  like you and I believe, where do they put their faith and hope in? Well, that's the thing. They
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:34:00.400]  say we're going to make moral judgments and we're going to decide. But then the majority of the
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:04.640]  scientific community says, well, we have no souls or we're animals. So we have no value. But then
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:09.280]  the earth has all this value. But that's just so other men can take other resources from other
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:14.160]  people claiming it's for redistribution or for the earth. I mean, I just know all the arguments.
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:21.040]  I know how they work. Yeah, it's pretty pitiful. But you know, Alex, my wife was, grew up during
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:28.160]  martial law in Pinochet's Chile. My sister-in-law, who was a doctor, barely escaped Chile with her
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:36.160]  life. And the parallels that she sees now haunt her. I would actually like to have her on your
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:42.800]  show and kind of talk about her experiences. I thought about that when you had a news coating
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:49.120]  of a documentary coming out about Chile in the coup, which was launched on 9 11.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:57.680]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And, you know, because I've kind of redirected my focus towards people
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:05.440]  who I think will put up some kind of a fight, redirecting my efforts towards police and military
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:12.640]  people and exposing the fact that there are pensions, which they, you know, all these nasty
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:22.080]  things to our Constitution and fellow citizens, you know, for the excuse of, you know, well,
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:26.880]  I got a pension. I got a mortgage and whatnot. And you just blast that away. You just ruin
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.120]  the government's credibility. And you can kind of break through to people because...
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:36.160]  Well, that's it. Folks, folks need to realize that the system will destroy their future,
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:39.920]  not, yeah, the system's bad, but I've got to go along with it because if it falls,
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:45.200]  I've got nothing. No, the system is predatory and it's going to make all of our lives progressively
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:48.720]  worse if we don't rest control away from the global eugenicist.
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.120]  I know. I mean, you have put out so much information over the years.
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  Enough information, you know, to cover all of this. And if people don't get it, for the most
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:04.480]  part, they'll never get it. So we got to redirect our focus on those who somewhat get it and are
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:09.520]  just waiting for, you know, that rights. I hear you, Garrett. Send your wife's info and story
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:14.800]  to tradeinfowars.com. We might have her on. In fact, I thought about having people on from
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:18.880]  Russia and China and people who've been through tyranny because I talked to a lot of them and
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:22.400]  a lot of them are leaving the U.S. and they're saying, man, I've seen this before. But then they
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:27.040]  say, I know one German lady who lived with her for like 30 years and she just went back to Germany
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:32.480]  and she said, it's back there now. So now she's come back here. I mean, it's just everywhere.
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:40.080]  Let's talk to Garrett in Mississippi. You're on the air, Garrett. Good afternoon, Alex. How you
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:46.720]  doing? Good, sir. It's good to hear from you. I just wanted to say that I would appreciate it.
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:56.320]  If you got some folks on, Jim Ross comes to mind on next few weeks or days to let people know what
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:01.920]  they need to be doing to get ready. I've had people laugh at me. I've been working at this
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:06.080]  company for about three years. I've been working at it and they laughed at me and started, you
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:08.960]  know, when I started telling them about these things, now they're coming to my office and
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:14.560]  shutting the door and asking what they need to do. And it's not just the news they're seeing in
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:20.000]  their gut, in their spirit, which people laugh at us, but it's real. The sixth sense has been
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:27.600]  proven. Something there folks, people know in their gut, bad stuff is here and more is on the way.
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:32.000]  Well, I recently had a, you know, eight month, I've got to eight month old now and, you know,
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.160]  sort of changed the perspective of life and I live for him now and I want him to have a future.
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:44.560]  And what I've told people a long time, you know, for the past six months is, you know, there's plenty
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:53.840]  of chiefs in the Patriot movement or just named more Indians. And it breaks my heart to know that
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:56.800]  everything I've been taught, you know, I've been listening to you for about 10 years
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:02.560]  and that everything I was taught as a child about the American dream is just boomalarky.
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:10.480]  It's, it's, it's to keep you in the system. And I want people to wake up out there and to
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:16.240]  continue preparing. And if you aren't prepared, you need to be. And well, the first step in the
[1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:20.480]  battle is people realizing there's a problem. And you said people now, because you planted the
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:25.200]  seeds, because you are willing to get laughed at up there being pillory, but everybody's spitting
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:30.880]  and yelling and throwing psychological tomatoes at you and cabbages, because millions of people
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:37.200]  like you Garrett, we're willing for years to plant the seeds. Now the people are listening.
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:43.280]  And so how do we get prepared? It is a awakening or quote, political solution. But outside the
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:49.200]  classic political paradigm, we need to expose, okay, they're going to progressively make things
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:53.040]  so bad economically, there's going to be riots. They're going to stand down and let the riots
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:57.040]  spread. They're going to allow atrocities to be committed against police. Then they're going
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:02.160]  to crack down on everybody. We have to further educate now about what's coming. And then when
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:07.920]  that comes a few more steps of people seeing we're right, then we will absolutely have them
[1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:13.360]  awaken, you know, and then we can really turn things around. We have to go through the pain
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:19.280]  historically before people finally wake up. And if you don't warn people beforehand,
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:24.480]  you go through the corruption and then it wins and solidifies control. But if you expose it
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:29.840]  beforehand and then during, and a lot of us will be punished and imprisoned and tortured and killed
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:37.120]  for this Testament, for this message, but because people hurt us before, during, and then after,
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:42.480]  we will be able to then rest control of the new world order off the levers of global control
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:48.000]  and then have a revolution that ends in something good instead of something
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:53.680]  worse. And so there's no really stopping or turning around where this freight train is going
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:40:00.320]  and we can just strap in and get ready. I mean, physically, it's good to not live in a major
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.000]  city. Physically, if things completely break down, it's good to have family in another state
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.320]  who is willing to have you, if things completely break down, come stay with them. But you should
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:16.720]  have a year of food. You should have firearms. You should have something like gold and silver
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:21.840]  if you can afford it. But a lot of people are living right at assistance level, so they can't.
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:27.840]  And so, you know, what do you tell them? I'm sorry, this globalist economy was about destroying the
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:32.800]  family, making both people work two jobs, getting the children in the control of the state. And
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.440]  we're getting into such a martial law situation that as things break down, if people wait until
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:43.120]  it's too late to leave and get to a safe place, but then they leave early and then go there and
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:47.120]  people laugh at them. But if they wait until it's too late and try to go 100, 200, 300,
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:52.960]  1,000 miles to their place of refuge, then you're going to get stopped at checkpoints on the road.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:58.800]  They're going to be taking your guns. They're going to be commandeering food. And then there's
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:03.280]  people, the government isn't going to have to stage attacks on police and military. A lot of
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:07.040]  families are going to see the cops start reaching for their kids and they're going to be dead cops
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:13.440]  all over the highway. And the New Old Order plans that. They plan on cornering a grizzly bear that
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:18.960]  is the American people and they plan on sending in these foot tall, you know, figuratively little
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:25.600]  cops who have no preparation, no idea they're going to be torn to pieces. Then they're just
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:31.280]  going to lock things down in zones, let people start to death in mass and then later roll in
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:36.560]  with international forces. Now, now that is a distinct possibility. But we're definitely going
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:40.480]  to have a depression. It's definitely going to get bad and it's probably going to unfold into that.
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:46.400]  But I mean, there's a lot of people, I'm not calling for violence. I'm not shooting my mouth off,
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:51.760]  thumping my chest going, oh blast, oh shoot, I'm tough. I'm looking for a fight. No, I'm looking
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:56.080]  to get around the fight with the police at the globalist plan. I'm looking to not give them the
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:00.880]  war they want. But I know this, my kids aren't going to a FEMA camp and over my dead body will
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:06.000]  it happen. And once you start taking the gloves off folks with real people that don't shoot their
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.120]  mouths off, it's going to get serious. That's a guarantee. So that's as much as I can say,
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:17.120]  Garrett, anything else? No, you hit the nail on the head, but you got great sponsors out there
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:22.720]  that's got storage food. It's now it's the time about beans, bullets and band-aids, your bible
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:29.600]  and your bullion, the five bees that's going to get you through this. And I mean, I just appreciate
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:35.440]  you, Alex. I hadn't spoke to you in a while, but like I said, people need to do their research
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:41.040]  and they need to get their plans together now, not tomorrow, today. And I appreciate you taking
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:46.320]  my call. Absolutely. And that message about today, I am just now trying to get myself prepared.
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:49.680]  I mean, I've been prepared with water filters, food, things like that for a long time, but I'm
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:54.720]  no really gearing up. I mean, we're doing things like, you know, got an old plate out,
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:59.200]  lightning struck, broken well. Well, you pay the money to have that sucker redrilled.
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:04.560]  You know, don't, oh, well, I've only got two years of storage food. Well, you know what,
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:10.320]  I got two more for everybody in my family. And, but a lot of people can't even do that
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:14.960]  because they bought a lot of plasma screen TVs and things they didn't need. And
[1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:18.480]  a lot of people couldn't even afford that. Here's an example. We're buying
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:25.680]  some big plasma screen TVs for the new TV studio and for the radio studio with a big one behind
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:31.440]  me. So we can put images up on it. And a few months ago, I just could not bring myself to
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:37.280]  spend five, six, $7,000 for a big 60 something inch screen TV that needed for the studio. I just,
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:40.640]  I just said, we just won't have one in the studio, you know, it'll look good. I just
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:45.600]  aren't going to spend that money on it. I'm going to try to save that money. I'm somewhat frugal.
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:49.920]  And then we went and looked again and guess how much they've dropped in about four or five months.
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:57.920]  A $6,000 TV, the same model is $1,300. Folks, that's another example
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:03.120]  of the economy is, is, is just at a standstill. It is at a standstill.
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:11.600]  It is, it is, it is just plowing down to a halt and God help us. Okay, let's go to Matt in the
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:17.680]  UK. Matt, you're on the air. But let me on the show. Thank you for coming on. Thank you.
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:21.760]  I'd like to thank you. Yeah. Uh, as I mentioned, uh, first of all is, uh, I've been trying to
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:28.080]  just show on the shellcast streams in the UK and, uh, it's, you can't even hear it. It's like,
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.640]  this is repeating, repeating, repeating. It looks like the UK government is definitely, uh,
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:37.200]  centering, uh, info wars. What are you saying today? It's repeating, repeating, repeating.
[1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:41.440]  Yeah. It's repeating. It's like, like, you'll have the James Bond theme going on, obviously,
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:46.080]  uh, on, on the, on the ad bit. And it just keeps repeating itself. Yeah. Well, I've told my IT
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:50.400]  people about this and everybody's calling the network and everybody, everywhere else.
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:55.440]  It's going on all the time. We have different servers around the world and we need to assess
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:00.720]  the problem and we need to fix it. How often do you hear that happening? Quite a few times.
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:06.000]  Like I said, today, obviously, uh, uh, signing logged into the show, obviously on, on the internet.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:12.160]  Now that is not the government of the UK. That is us. We're having major server problems. I don't
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:15.520]  even know. I would thank God we're on AM and FM shortwave satellite because for all intents and
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:20.640]  purposes, our internet is really breaking down. Right. Uh, the, the question I want to mention
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.920]  is obviously about the martial law situation. Um, now, uh, you know, obviously with this,
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:30.800]  you, uh, Irish vote, obviously they're going to revoke on that. Now, uh, do you reckon that,
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:36.400]  that the, that the, uh, the new law office will, uh, bring in martial law if they, uh, refuse again?
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:42.080]  Well, sir, we're already in a degree of martial law. We're already at a level when they threaten
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:47.040]  Congress with do what we say or you're going to go into martial law. That is martial law.
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:50.880]  When the bankers have governmental power and can do whatever they want, that's financial
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:56.080]  dictatorship. And the mainstream news is calling it that. Right. Do you also believe on the martial
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:02.400]  law that, that they've got like spice outlights that are watching the public? Explain what
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:08.320]  you're saying to me, sir. Do you, do you agree? Like obviously we're under this martial law system
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:12.640]  obviously in the UK and obviously you guys in the US. Do you believe that the military are using
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:17.520]  like spice outlights to spy on the general public? Uh, they admit that. I remember eight years ago
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:22.240]  in Australia, they would arrest farmers and ranchers under environmental laws. You're not allowed
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:26.800]  anywhere in Australia to build a shack, a barn, anything bureaucrats come and harass you,
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:31.120]  boss you around, tax you to do it. The farms can barely stay open because of the economy.
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:36.000]  I mean, here's an example. Cattle prices have dropped by about 40% in the last year,
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.480]  but hamburger and beef prices are record highs. It's because now the packers were taken over
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:47.440]  by two central groups. It's all about monopolies. It's all about manipulating markets. And now
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:51.760]  they've announced that local police through Homeland Security being federalized in their cars
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:59.120]  in the UK, England, Europe, the United States, everywhere. We're going to be tracked by satellite
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:03.920]  in real time being watched by the defense satellites and they're going to use it for
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:09.520]  environmental reasons, law enforcement. The entire Northcom apparatus is against the people.
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:14.800]  Also, another one, you might like this one. I was looking back on your old streams of the
[1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:18.160]  Rothschild interview. I was wondering, are you ever going to get that guy on again?
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:22.720]  We have tried since then and they refuse. You know, how this works for other talk shows that
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:26.080]  don't know how to get guests and then think it's a conspiracy that we're able to get big guests.
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:31.600]  What you do is, I mean, I know little bitty blogs that get better guests than we do because they
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:37.200]  have, you know, the person acts as a good producer themselves. All you got to do is when they have
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:42.480]  a book out, their PR people wanted to do interviews. He put out a children's brainwashing book about
[1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:46.720]  how polar bears can't swim and then that, of course, they're the best swimmers of any land
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:52.640]  mammal swim 300 miles, 150 miles routinely. And then they hunt on ice floes for beluga and seals
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:57.280]  and other things. So he wrote a book about, you know, basically about global government and how
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:03.280]  wonderful it is. So we called up and we had him on and that's how they do it. That's how we get
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:07.840]  them on. And it did turn out off air. He didn't know who I was. It's like Chuck Norris. We called
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:13.200]  and wanted to have him on for his book people and they said, no, but then we emailed Chuck Norris
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:17.360]  himself and he goes, oh, I'm a fan of the show. I want to come on. So, you know, it's all about
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:24.240]  just trying to get these big guests on. But no, since we spanked him royally, he's refused and I
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:29.440]  won't be immoral. You know, I will call up and we tell him who we are and ask him to come on.
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:36.400]  We could lie and get Lord Rothschild back on. So I'll say also, it's amazing that you mentioned
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:40.400]  about these top stars that listen into the show now, like Bruce will listen to people like that.
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:45.440]  And it's amazing that these people are waking up to, you know, realizing what's actually going on,
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:51.280]  you know, the way this new world order is happening now. Yeah, I got a very exciting
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:58.640]  letter and phone number sent to me last week by a huge Hollywood icon. And you know what,
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:06.000]  I'm so busy. I haven't even called the number yet. And then I had the producer, the manager,
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:14.560]  for a huge music star who I will say is involved in Farmade. And you know what, I wrote the number
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:18.800]  down and then I forgot to call him. So I mean, and I'm not bragging. It's that I'm not even really
[1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:23.600]  that much into that. But these stars are important because it shows how this alternative information
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:28.720]  is going mainstream. But it won't be able to go mainstream if we can't keep our internet streams
[1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:33.280]  up. But again, that's a small part of what we did, but a growing part. And I'm just getting
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:37.680]  constant calls. How much do you hear the James Bond music? I mean, how long will it run?
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:43.440]  Quite a few times. And also another thing it'll do is it'll, you know, when you're speaking on
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:49.520]  live, it'll like jump, it'll jump in and repeat back to James Bond theme again. But I mean,
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:54.160]  how long will it play when the James Bond music does play? Oh, God, it'll just keep doing it and
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:58.880]  doing it and doing it. Yeah, for 10, 20 minutes? About 10, 20 minutes, yeah. Yeah. Well, we need
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:02.480]  to get past the denial here and get that fixed and get that taken care of.
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:08.000]  When is there a chance you're going to come to the UK or?
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:12.960]  You know, I'm so hunkered down just doing radio interviews, TV, making films, writing a book.
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:19.360]  I'm like a hermit that I don't know. I would love to do a world tour and we could pack places in
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:25.680]  Japan and Germany and Russia and all over. I'd love to come to the UK. I know we get thousands
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.560]  out to each event and I would love it, you know, see the world, but I have to sacrifice and not do it.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:36.880]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:41.520]  a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:46.800]  liberty. The whole country's on a bus, the crazy driver. If the passengers can't get hold of the
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:51.840]  wheel, we're all going to go over the cliff. GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the

[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:48.160]  Okay, coming up, I'm going to have my discussion with the creator of Zeitgeist. I want to bring
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:54:00.560]  Ted Anderson up. Ted, it is really becoming evident to the public the gold market is completely
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:04.320]  suppressed. I mean, that's been documented in court and been well known and been admitted,
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:11.920]  but now it's mainstream news that the price of gold in the paper markets is not the real price.
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:15.520]  But I mean, what are the mints going to do because they're not allowed under their federal rules
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:21.840]  to buy gold at above anything above spot, but none of the international dealers or
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:28.560]  mines will sell it for that because of the real market. I mean, it looks like this gold
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:33.520]  shortage and silver shortage is intensifying. What are they going to do when gold's going
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:43.120]  for 1,500 bucks an ounce, not 1,000 an ounce like it is now, $500, $600 above what the paper
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.480]  market says. I mean, this looks like the illusion is about to die. Yeah, it sure is, Alex. I can
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:52.640]  tell you right now, every time you turn around, there's manipulation just right now, the G7
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:58.800]  again, meeting, trying to shore up the World Bank, turn it into more what you describe as
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.320]  New World Order type banking system, getting away from the free market economy type model
[1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:11.200]  that it's in right now. Obviously, the whole thing's folding in and they're trying to catch
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:15.920]  as much as they can. I hope they fail. I hope Chapman's right up there. I hope that all blows
[1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:20.960]  apart on them and it all fails. Finally, we get back to something that's real, but yeah,
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:26.800]  there's so much manipulation going on in the paper market, pushing down the value of gold
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:31.760]  and silver prices because some bank decides, hey, we need to sell this in order to bring it down in
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:37.440]  price when you prop up the dollar and we need to inject money into the stock market and do all
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:42.640]  this manipulation. There's no free market left here and obviously, they can't keep the gold and
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:47.280]  silver prices low and the physical supply is drying up, it's gone. Just like you said, people are
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:52.960]  waking up. And by the way, they're only selectively injecting it into select banks as Business Week
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:58.080]  today admits that it is an inside job. I can't believe it's mainstream news. I've seen other
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:03.280]  publications as well. They're admitting that a small group of inner private banks are profiting
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:09.440]  from this. This is good for them. Oh, and I tell you, Alex, it's really something else. I hope
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:14.880]  they just lose their shirts. Every time they try to sell gold short into the marketplace and that
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:20.960]  thing goes up, they lose. They get margin calls. I hope they lose all of their wealth. It is. It's
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:28.880]  one big bad manipulated scheme that really, they should be arrested. If anybody individually tried
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:34.640]  to do this stuff, they would be arrested. I mean, they'd be charged with collusion. Take beef.
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:38.640]  I mean, it's down by about 40% in the last 10 months. Okay, that's the official number, about
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:47.920]  38, 40% for people actually selling their cattle. Now, but meanwhile, there's a 40% increase in
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:54.240]  almost every beef product, including hamburger. So see, it's just all scams. Everything is scams.
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:57:00.080]  And I could go into two hours about how two meatpacking groups took control from over 20
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:03.920]  in the last decade and how they're running that scam. That's a fact. I mean, it's amazing.
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:10.400]  It's completely, it's incredible what they're doing. I mean, it's sad, but it's incredible.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:14.800]  It's incredible that we'd have a $700 billion bailout and all the money's being dished over
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:19.600]  to these people in Wall Street to give them more ammunition, make as many bad investments as you
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:24.160]  need to because the government will take them. That's just absolutely crazy. Well, because they sell
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:28.160]  the bad investment. They make the bad investment, which is toxic, and then they sell it to the
[1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:32.880]  idiot public, and then they blame the idiot public for it, which I guess in a way is, is at fault.
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:35.440]  I want to hold you over a few minutes before this discussion. We're having with this big
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.280]  guest, but Ted, real fast, give people the gold offer for the day. Well, I tell you what I ran
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:44.560]  into today, Alex, that's just almost impossible to get right now. Silver eagles. I've got silver
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:51.440]  eagles right now and they're at $17.58 a piece. Silver eagles. I haven't been able to get those in,
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:55.840]  I don't know, maybe two, three months. And those are going for 25 bucks a piece or more on eBay.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:00.000]  And a lot of stores are, you know, independent and I don't blame them. They got overhead. A lot
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  of shops are selling it for 20, 25 bucks. You've got them for $17 and change. These are the full
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:15.760]  size, silver dollars, 800-686-2237. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:28.160]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:33.200]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:38.400]  bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:42.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:58:42.640 --> 1:58:47.440]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[1:58:47.440 --> 1:58:54.240]  Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:59.920]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:04.160]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:09.920]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:43.840]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:52.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:58.800 --> 2:00:06.240]  It is Wednesday. Time just flies by. We're already in to the third hour. Coming up in
[2:00:06.240 --> 2:00:11.280]  about five minutes, we're going to have Peter Joseph, the creator of Zeitgeist on for an
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:16.560]  hour and 50 minute discussion. But right now, let's go back to Ted Anderson. So Ted,
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:22.560]  tell me, as a 30-year gold and silver broker, one of the most trusted in the nation,
[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:27.520]  how hard it is. Because, again, most gold brokers, major men, are saying they're out of
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:32.720]  gold or out of silver. No one can get silver dollars. How hard is it for you to get high
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:37.680]  quality gold at reasonable prices and silver? Like I said, I mean, I just brought up Silver
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:41.920]  Eagles. Alex, I haven't been able to get those at least a couple of months. The U.S. men stopped
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:46.160]  minting them. What about June, I think it was, or July, right around in there? How many of those
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:52.640]  gorgeous silver dollars do you have? Small supply. It's about $300 is all I have. And maybe I can
[2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:59.040]  go up to $1,000. So if you want them, call them. Call Inform and get them because they'll be gone
[2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:10.960]  real fast. 800-686-2237-800-686-2237 or minusresources.com. Ted, gold, what do you have? Because I always
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:15.600]  beg you to get super good specials for my listeners. What do you have in gold? Well, again, we have
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:19.440]  gold up today. I'm still holding the price on those francs. And they're currently right now
[2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:25.440]  at $190. I have the British sovereign and they're available currently right now as well at a price
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:30.880]  of $234. Both of those prices have been held back, even though gold is going up. The thing about it
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:35.200]  is right now, if you want the 10 dollar liberties and 10 dollar Indians, I have those. That 10
[2:01:35.200 --> 2:01:40.080]  dollar Indian is just a gorgeous coin. And that 10 dollar Indian presently right now is trading at
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.560]  a price of, hang on a second, I just got to look it up here real quick. 10 dollar Indians right
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:51.280]  now are at $673. If you didn't mention the Alex Jones show that you're picking these up from,
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:56.000]  you'd pay $100 more coin for either the 10 dollar liberty or the 10 dollar. Let's explain, Ted,
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.680]  even though you have all the connections, you're fighting just to get gold and silver when most
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:04.240]  people can't. And so you're paying more for these now, but you're paying less than others. You're
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:09.600]  passing that savings on. You locked this price in three days ago. Gold's gone up about $30 since
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:14.320]  then. So that savings is also put into there. Yeah, that is, that's true. And right now,
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:18.240]  we have pandemonium. Like you said, the yuppies are waking up and they're starting to buy gold
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:21.440]  and silver. And there's just not enough supply to go. And it's already run out with them just
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:25.680]  trying to buy it for the last two weeks. I mean, being in this market 30 years, Ted,
[2:02:25.680 --> 2:02:30.320]  30 years this year and a few months, your third anniversary in this, I mean,
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:36.080]  it's already basically run out now. What's going to happen as they pile on? Well, that's the thing.
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:39.120]  I mean, what's going to happen is that there's not going to be supply. I mean, they're going to be
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:42.400]  going around and you can buy little bits here and little bits there. And that's all you're going to
[2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:46.160]  do. That's all there is as individuals cashing in. Yeah, that's right. I mean, there's little
[2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:50.720]  individuals cashing in and I've got some suppliers that have a thousand of this and 200 of that and
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:55.280]  500 of those. I mean, used to be that I'd get whatever I wanted. All I had to do is just call
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.680]  up an order and just wait for it to come in. It doesn't work that way anymore. There just isn't
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:04.560]  enough around. I mean, it's really a lot of hard work to find supply, fighting people that want
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:08.720]  to buy it. Piece of cake. Everybody wants it. I used to, I could call you anytime I wanted to.
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:14.320]  Now I call and you know, you can't talk. He's on the phone with international brokers. And again,
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:18.400]  most people can't even call those brokers now and get gold because even if a company's been around
[2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:22.720]  five, 10 years, you know, they go with whoever they've been with the longest and you've been out
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:26.880]  there a long time. So you're able to do stuff other people can't take advantage of this while you
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:33.920]  still can. Ladies and gentlemen, 1-800-686-2237. I know you're working on coronas. You get any
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:38.400]  coronas? I have a hundred of those out there and I'm just going to secure the position. I'll
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:42.480]  mention them next time I come on here. I just don't want to have them until, mention them until
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:47.120]  I know I've got them here in the house and ready to go. So all right. So you've got sovereigns,
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:53.360]  European francs. Those are Swiss and French and Austrian and you've got, so you've got
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:58.960]  francs. You've got British sovereigns. You've got the gorgeous Indians. The best deal out of them all
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:02.960]  is still the franc, isn't it? Yeah, the franc is the better of the whole bunch as far as the
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:07.200]  gold is concerned because you get that little tiny piece of gold. Plus also, if you try to buy a
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:11.360]  US seagull, you're going to pay almost $100 more than you would for the French. And by the way,
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:14.800]  you've got eagles if folks want them. They're just a giant premium because you're paying that.
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:19.200]  Yeah, I can't help it. The eagles have gone up so much in price. These silver eagles, that's a...
[2:04:19.200 --> 2:04:25.920]  Yeah, Ted's offering you, you know, what is the best deal? 800-686-2237. As this
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:29.520]  market manipulation continues, Ted, keep popping in with us. I sure will. Thank you.
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:40.720]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:46.800]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:04:47.360 --> 2:04:53.440]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:57.920]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:06.320]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:11.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda. Bilderberg is making great
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:14.960]  progress for the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:20.000]  all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit. Order in-game on DVD

[2:05:26.880 --> 2:05:32.880]  In-game blueprint for global and sleep. You have been warned. You know, as a father and a husband,
[2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:37.600]  one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children,
[2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:41.920]  checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs, but mostly providing for my
[2:05:41.920 --> 2:05:46.880]  family and knowing that they're secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[2:05:46.880 --> 2:05:51.360]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[2:05:51.360 --> 2:05:55.520]  I've always wanted to be a good provider and I'm not going to change that now just because the
[2:05:55.520 --> 2:06:00.480]  economy is in up-evil and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty and I hear about
[2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:05.840]  global famines and I see the escalating prices in gas and food and oil. Electricity is going to go
[2:06:05.840 --> 2:06:09.680]  way up until this winter. Hey, I'm not going to sweat it. I've done the right thing. I got rid of
[2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:13.920]  a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage. I converted that money into food. That food's out
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:17.440]  there. I've got a two or three-year supply of food in the garage. My family's secure. I don't
[2:06:17.440 --> 2:06:21.520]  got to worry, okay? I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security. Call

[2:08:04.480 --> 2:08:08.560]  outages that happen occasionally as we get more and more traffic and beef up our system.
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:13.360]  You will not hear those problems generally in the podcast. So subscribe to that to listen
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:17.920]  how you want, when you want, where you want. Now obviously with over 60 AM and FM affiliates,
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:21.760]  and we've just gotten three or four more in the last week, so it's actually growing. I need to
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:27.280]  revise the list. Probably over 70 stations now. That's where the lion's share of the audience is.
[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:32.720]  You could have hundreds of thousands per station with a station like News Radio 590KLBJ or 1330
[2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:38.960]  that covers half of Texas that's up in Taylor, or a KCAA that goes into San Diego and places
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:44.480]  there in California, or a KCXL. We've been on about nine years in Kansas City covering that
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:51.680]  entire city and surrounding areas out of Liberty, Missouri. But the shortwave is great as well as
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:56.080]  a world service we do for everybody. We have satellite systems people can listen over,
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:00.880]  several different satellite systems. It's all very important, but the internet is special
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:05.040]  because it puts us everywhere. You know, you can tell your friends, your family, your neighbors,
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:08.960]  even if you don't have a local AM or FM affiliate, or even if they don't, hey, you can listen at
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:14.400]  infowars.com, or you can listen at prisonplanet.com. And that's what's so great about the web. It is
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:19.120]  basically everywhere in the industrialized world, and now even in the third world and old world.
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:23.680]  And so that's why it's so important. And yes, we've had hundreds of calls about,
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:28.880]  you know, whenever our connection to our big servers goes down, James Bond Music will play
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:36.720]  for five, 10 minutes. That is our servers going down. The problem is, too, if we don't have it
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:45.440]  on the server farms and CDNs, when it goes down, then that basically knocks out our shout cast
[2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:48.560]  rating. And we like being number one on there because we get new listeners that way. But we're
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:52.160]  just going to have to give up our ranking because the number one thing is getting the message out
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:57.760]  and split the streams up into dozens of streams, not just five or six big streams. Also, there's
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:02.720]  other ways to listen. We have tens of thousands every show that listen on the Windows stream
[2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:08.560]  that comes out of another server system. And people are now using that a lot. And of course,
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:14.480]  that's an unrated stream. That's an internal stream. But you can go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:19.600]  and click on the Flash Player window to listen that way. If you hear outages on the Genesis
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:24.720]  streams because those get maxed out or on the Info War streams, we have that Windows stream
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:30.080]  there for you as well. Because the Internet is so important because it's a key place that we
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:35.120]  virally spread the message in YouTube videos, live leak videos. People make hundreds of videos
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:40.560]  with audio from the show. You cut it up. You condense it down. All of you out there doing a
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:47.440]  great job. So please keep that up. Okay. Without further ado, I'm really excited to get to introduce
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:53.760]  to you Peter Joseph. Peter Joseph, of course, made Zeitgeist, which I would say is the second
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:01.200]  most viewed video just from my analysis. In Internet history, I would still say that
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:06.080]  loose change is number one. But that's because it's been out longer. In the future, it remains
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:12.480]  to be seen. But the two films definitely are the most viewed in viral history on the Internet.
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:18.400]  And the maker, Peter Joseph, has now made a Zeitgeist Addendum, another two-hour film,
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:23.280]  very well done. He works in professional TV. And he did this on his own, though it's excellent.
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:27.120]  He went out and actually did a lot of interviews and things for it as well, not just Internet clips
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:32.720]  that he combined for the first Zeitgeist. And I agree with about 90% of what is in the film.
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:37.200]  I think that the interpretation, the subtle way it's put out, people are going to misinterpret
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:41.920]  a lot of it. That was my point criticizing some of it earlier in the week. I also think that it's
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:49.120]  another form of orthodoxy to make fun on a high horse of religious groups and people who are
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:55.120]  religious because the human mind, the human sight and smell only picks up a very narrow
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:12:00.320]  spectrum of reality that's been scientifically proven. There are a lot of quackery and superstition
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:04.880]  and kooky stuff going on out there, certainly. And that's why I get away from organizing religion
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:12.640]  myself. But I think that in a way it actually divides people that both films have decided
[2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:18.320]  attacks on religion, especially Christianity. And I'm allowed to have that view and say that
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:22.960]  I don't particularly agree with that. I don't hate Peter Joseph because of his views. I don't
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:29.600]  look down on him. I don't even judge him. Now, I just am allowed to have my view that I think
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:38.080]  that that is itself a little bit close-minded. That doesn't mean that I buy into every superstition
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:43.680]  out there. And conversely, people like to start fights between any big alternative media movement
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:49.120]  icons or films. I have a lot of Zeitgeist people that attack me and say horrible things about
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:53.840]  me. And they're not Zeitgeist people, but people that are followers of the film or use the name as
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:13:01.680]  a maxim or a logo, kind of like the shingle or the flag they fly. And then a lot of folks who call
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.240]  themselves Alex Jones listeners who viciously attack Zeitgeist because of its anti-Christian
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:10.720]  bent. And then that's probably why the Zeitgeist folks are attacking me and then my people are
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:17.360]  attacking them more. And then that kind of creates myself a subconscious disliking for it,
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:22.800]  because then I get attacked by a lot of extreme close-minded Christians and Muslims and religionists
[2:13:22.800 --> 2:13:28.800]  out there who get mad that my footage is in Zeitgeist. Well, I mean, he put it in there first
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:32.640]  and later he said, hey, can I use it? And I said, fine. And he has the rights to use the footage
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:36.960]  that he has in the first Zeitgeist now, because I'm actually full open discussion in things being
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:41.120]  out there. And a lot of people found my work because of Zeitgeist. So, you know, I believe that
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:48.640]  we can take good out of even things that I see as not, you know, effective or true in Zeitgeist
[2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:54.080]  itself. So what that said is my opening statement. I want to bring Peter Joseph up on the air and
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:58.880]  let him have an opening statement about himself, Zeitgeist and where all of this is going. Peter,
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:03.280]  great to have you here. Thank you, Alex. I appreciate you having me on. And I'm glad you
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:06.960]  pointed out what you did. I think a lot of people listening to this cast are gonna, you know, sit
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:12.800]  there waiting for some type of duke out between you and I. And debate, debate is really an infantile
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:17.920]  disposition. I think discussion and open discussion is what we need to engage in. We learn from each
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.560]  other. And that's what a society should really be thinking when we engage ideas that are conflicting
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:26.480]  from one belief system to another. You know, competition, things like this that we think
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:32.000]  are naturally bred into us, dispositions of winning, either things I would like to address today.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  I know you have different dispositions as you stated in, for example, in your October 8th
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  broadcast. And before I begin any of that, however, since you did bring up Christianity,
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:46.720]  first thing, I don't, I don't mind attacking Christians whatsoever. I think anybody who pays
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:50.560]  attention to what I've stated. As far as the first film, I go into the historical base
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:55.280]  sees a Christianity, and I linger into the philosophical dispositions and how it's very
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:15:01.360]  restrictive of the human mind. In the second film, I detail how essentially the belief system
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:06.160]  itself is based on a rejection of new information. And this is, this is very important and very
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:12.000]  difficult to deny when you get into faith-based ideologies. And the whole, the whole accomplishment,
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:17.360]  if that's a word, of the second film is to really try to pull people into a train of thought that's
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.320]  aligned with nature. And that's why I present the Venus Project. And that's why I present
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:27.040]  these seemingly spooky things that people have been conditioned to fear, such as centralization
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:31.840]  of power, but it's not centralization of power in the orthodox manner that many people think
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:36.800]  to be true or fearful of or what history has presented. Because the flaw of our society at
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:41.840]  its very core is that it has not addressed the root problems of what we're doing. And those root
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:48.160]  problems are sourced in human behavior, not secret societies or elites or even human instinct.
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:52.400]  We have to look at the environment and what the environment is producing. And then from there,
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:56.080]  we'll know the resolution. And that's what I'd like to talk about today with you.
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:01.440]  Well, Peter, out of the gates, global warming has become a religion. The environment is important,
[2:16:01.440 --> 2:16:06.400]  the load of the earth is important, but technologies, as you and the experts you interview have
[2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:10.880]  rightly assessed, we can transcend all those problems. And that is being suppressed by the
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:16.640]  elites who want to continue a cartel or an oligopoly. But, you know, you talk about the load
[2:16:16.640 --> 2:16:20.720]  of the earth and, you know, running things according to the load of the earth. Well, the, the, the
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:26.640]  controllers, they're already using that and saying we are going to, as a technocracy, as a
[2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:31.360]  scientific system, we are going to scientifically design society and we're saying carbon dioxide
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:36.560]  is bad when that's what plants breathe and one of the four major elements, light, water, carbon
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:41.920]  dioxide and oxygen, that make life possible here. So, see, out of the gates, there's that oversimplification.
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:47.760]  I think it's important to have the discussion. It's just the way it can be interpreted is,
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:52.400]  I mean, that's a religion too. I mean, I mean, there is a religious belief that carbon dioxide
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:56.800]  is bad and evil and a toxic waste. Yeah, there's also a religious belief that the free market
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:01.200]  system is the end all to our progress as a civilization. They're all religious beliefs
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:06.160]  in their own accord. If they're not addressed in a highly intellectual and scrutinizing manner,
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:10.480]  the best form of reference for that type of dispositional analysis, if you will,
[2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:14.560]  is what you referred to as a scientific method. Everything that we have, well, first of all,
[2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:19.360]  let me counter one thing. Essentially, what you're seeing with this ruling elite that you refer to
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:24.400]  that, of course, they will use technology against humanity, the microchip, surveillance. We're
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:28.800]  seeing this rampantly. Why? Because their social system is failing. They have to preserve the
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:33.040]  structure. At least that's my opinion and we can go into more detail for that. However,
[2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:38.240]  they are totally out of line with nature. So, what they're implying will never really work
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:42.720]  because it will just produce more instability that people will eventually rise up above it
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:47.760]  because the system is emergent and we're always learning new things and things that do not work
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:52.720]  as the emergence proceeds will be phased out. And this is where social stratification and
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:57.200]  all of these different elements come into play. You see, I'm not talking about, for example,
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:18:02.960]  in your October 8th interview, excuse me, your review of the piece, you implied to your audience
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:08.400]  that there would be this eradication of the social structure. Remember when you said that as
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:12.960]  though that someone's going to come around with a gun and shoot people that are involved in the
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:18.320]  wrong type of social stratification. That is not at all what this idea is about whatsoever.
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:24.560]  The eradication notion comes from the disposition that human awareness, human value systems will
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:31.040]  be altered as the society is culminated in more alignment with nature itself. Now, that's a very
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:37.920]  difficult thing to do. How do you gauge the alignment with nature and what scientists or
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:43.680]  group is going to be able to develop the gauge by which you set up that system?
[2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:47.920]  Well, you can look at it from here's a very oversimplified example, but it would get the
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:53.280]  point across very easily. If you have a plot of land and you want to do something with that land,
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:56.960]  say, grow something on it, build something on it, you're going to analyze the top soil of it.
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:03.360]  The parameters of that land become self-evident as to what you can do on it. Now, when you apply
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:07.440]  this to the planet, you begin to see that the resources that the society needs, which can be
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:12.800]  assessed through surveying what is necessary for the society, has a natural development
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:20.000]  and can occur naturally without opinion whatsoever, because you're basing it on tangible resource
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:24.480]  management of the planet. That's why in the film, I keep going back to the same point.
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:27.200]  Stay there. Stay there. We're going to skip this break right now. Here we go.
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:34.320]  Okay, continue, Peter. It's the intelligent management of the earth's resources that's
[2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:37.200]  needed. Now, people don't understand what that means. They don't know what that means, because
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:42.160]  they've been so conditioned into this completely artificial structure of money and labor for money,
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:49.440]  competition for labor, and money for resources. This is a completely fictional disposition.
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:54.960]  It's a false system, because there's nothing but resources. The ideology that will construct our
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:20:01.120]  new world, so to speak, is an ideology based on resource management, as denoted to the scientific
[2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:06.960]  method. That plot of land has the resources available. The only way you can have unification,
[2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:11.040]  intellectual unification, excuse me, back up, the only way you can have an abundance and an
[2:20:11.040 --> 2:20:16.160]  optimization of our world is if you understand what the planet has and you gauge all of its
[2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:21.680]  resources. This is why in intellectual unification that Jacques Fresco talks about, world unification,
[2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:26.480]  it's not world government at all. It's an entirely different ideological disposition
[2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:32.400]  based on what's available on the planet, what the society needs, and this is an extremely
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:36.800]  long-winded conversation. I wish we had more time. But who's going to decide what humanity needs?
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:42.320]  The question is, who's going to decide? How will the decisions be made? It's an ideological based
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:49.280]  assumption based on nature. There's an empirical order in working in nature forever. For example,
[2:20:49.280 --> 2:20:53.200]  anything you have in your studio right now, all the technology is derived from one
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:57.680]  process and that's called the scientific method. Our society needs to be completely in accord
[2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:01.600]  with this. The parameters are self-evident once you get this trend of thought going.
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:06.480]  But there aren't going to be people that, quote, want to be in accord and there's huge debates
[2:21:06.480 --> 2:21:12.160]  within the scientific method. And so how are you going to bring something completely into
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:18.960]  accord or eradicate that? Well, this is why human behavior has to be understood, which is
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:23.120]  another very important point that we need to make. Well, I mean, and I disagree with you that humans
[2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:27.760]  are fundamentally, you know, don't have competition in them. Caleb? I mean, that is, that is all over
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:32.720]  the animal kingdom. That is the name of the game. Sure. But why? Why does the animal kingdom have
[2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:39.760]  this? Because of resources. Exactly. But also because of the design in our development within
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:45.680]  that system of competition. It is to deny how we were developed and what we have been developed
[2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:51.680]  to do. Well, I would have to respectfully disagree with that because there's no basis for that.
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:56.400]  Everything that we have, that we think is derived naturally as far as human instinct,
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:00.640]  every form of human instinct that you see popularized by the modern day alchemists,
[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:04.480]  the geneticists that say, you know, they can find the genetic gene for smoking or the genetic
[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:10.080]  gene to be a Republican. This is completely ignoring basically everything that the environment
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:15.040]  has been teaching us. For example, if I took, if you were taken as a little baby, infant,
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:18.560]  brought over to the Middle East, dropped off into a family that was Muslim,
[2:22:18.560 --> 2:22:22.960]  you would be on the air right now speaking Arabic, praising Allah, and you'd have a show
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:27.680]  called Info Jihad. It's completely, it's completely arbitrary to extend. I mean,
[2:22:27.680 --> 2:22:31.600]  I'm not saying that there are kernels of elements in our lives that we want to live.
[2:22:31.600 --> 2:22:37.840]  Well, wait a minute. It's not kernels. Conservatively, more than half of our
[2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:45.360]  activities in motion is genetic and in nature. And then, and then, and then nurture is the
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:51.360]  variant that will change for the time and place and culture, how your genetic information manifest.
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:58.000]  Everything that we understand has been taught to us in some capacity, especially our operations.
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:03.040]  Every word I'm saying has been taught to me. Every concept has been relayed in some capacity
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:08.160]  for me. And through my mental operations, which is a form of conditioning, I have arrived at novel
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:14.720]  conclusions. My originality is simply because of the, the, the environmental influences that are
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:19.360]  completely and utterly conditioned to me as opposed to everyone else. Everyone is different
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:23.520]  because they come from different conditioning. In other words, this is extremely powerful and
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:29.280]  it's not 50-50. It's probably 90-10. Our conditioning is everything. And when we realize
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:36.000]  that the monetary system, hold on, we're going back to the full audience. Here we go.
[2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:46.000]  Talking to the creator of Zeitgeist 1 and now Zeitgeist 2, addendum.
[2:23:47.040 --> 2:23:54.160]  Peter Joseph. Peter, I fundamentally, and we were just discussing this for the internet
[2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:58.400]  audience. I only skipped that break. We're back to the full audience now. I disagree with you
[2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:07.360]  fundamentally that humans are trained and conditioned to be competitive. All higher
[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:14.000]  species, mammals particularly, are competitive. It is, at its base, a genetic competitiveness
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:22.960]  to pass on the traits that made the species excel in its environment in our development.
[2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:27.440]  And then all the elite does is knows how to manipulate and punch those buttons and condition
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.320]  those and hone those and bring up certain instincts that have manifested through societal
[2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:39.360]  developments and to overexpress others and to suppress others that they don't like.
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:44.160]  I mean, that's just, I fundamentally disagree with you on that point.
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:48.880]  Well, I want to make a comment then that it's for the audience to decide, of course, that I
[2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:54.480]  think what people fail to realize, the geneticists fail to realize, what your worldview isn't taken
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:25:00.720]  into account are the millions, it's not billions of years of evolution based on scarcity.
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:04.800]  All the animal kingdom has lived within scarcity. You have to have social hierarchy of a pack of
[2:25:04.800 --> 2:25:09.840]  lion. You have to have fighting because there's not enough to go around. And you have to have
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:13.520]  fighting today because there's always going to be corrupt people. But some of the zeitgeist
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.400]  followers say, I can't even say what evil is, because that's my Christian construct. No, it's
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:23.920]  not evil is destroying the planet. Evil is killing life. Evil is hurting the weak and the meek and
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:29.120]  the small. These are basic rules, you know, that what is anti-life, what is destructive of the
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:35.200]  tribe, we call evil. Well, what is evil? Define it for me. What causes evil? What causes someone
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:39.120]  to behave in an evil manner? Well, I'm asking you, do you believe evil exists? Absolutely not,
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:43.120]  because based on the definition of evil, it's basically a religious connotation. It can't,
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:46.080]  it doesn't mean anything. It's an empty distinction. If I was to redefine it,
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:50.080]  the evil would be aberrant behavior. And if I was to define aberrant behavior, I would say
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:54.880]  almost conclusively that aberrant behavior is caused by the necessities of the environment.
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:26:00.000]  But is it aberrant to have elites through their breeding, through their culture,
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:05.040]  who are hyper-aggressive and hyper-dominant and sadistic? I call Satanists kidnapping a child
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:08.960]  and raping them for a month and cutting their heart out. Evil, because that is evil according
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:15.520]  to the human code and evil according to us having safe, happy tribes who can go on being
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:21.920]  scientists and creating, which is the main drive and goal of this species. Sure. Nevertheless,
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:25.600]  however, it's always a product of conditioning. The people in the secret society that you talk
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:31.120]  about that have grown up with their elitism, they are molded and shaped. Henry Kissinger,
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:35.840]  George Bush, these men brought up an elite system. They behave in elite ways. That's right. They sent
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:41.760]  Prince Charles to boarding schools to be beat up, to be treated bad, to make him a nasty person.
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:46.000]  Well, there you have it. And this is exactly my point. So, in order to fully change society,
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:50.320]  in order to really understand what's going on, you can't use these out-noted words. At least,
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:53.440]  in my opinion, I don't like evil because it has a generally religious notion. If you note,
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:27:01.600]  here's what I'm saying to you. I've read the social workers 150 years ago. I've read the social
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:06.560]  engineers and the transhumanists and the posthumanists, and they all say very close to what you're
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:11.360]  saying about this utopia of the machines, getting rid of our competitiveness, but then they bring
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:15.760]  in our hyper-competitiveness to dominate us. When the social workers kidnap people's kids for no
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:22.800]  reason for the state to reeducate them, it makes nightmares. I mean, I've heard all this and people
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:27.920]  showing me fancy roads and models of spaceships and saying, we're going to create a utopia and we're
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:32.880]  not going to have money anymore. And then what is money versus this monetary system you talk about
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:39.120]  with banker and fractional reserve manipulation? Well, first of all, first of all, there's no
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:45.040]  utopia. I want to get this out of the way. That's a loaded term, just like evil. It has no basis.
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:49.920]  Secondly, the difference between the systems that I'm advocating, the system that I'm advocating
[2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:54.960]  versus the fractional reserve monetary system, is multifaceted. First of all, the monetary system,
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:59.680]  I went into specific detail to talk about how the fractional reserve system enslaves humanity
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:05.600]  distinctly with absolute acuteness because there's not enough money in the money supply to go around.
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:09.360]  That's assumed that there was money. Yeah, but you're saying it's a system failing. They designed
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:13.920]  it to consolidate power. It is succeeding according to their aims. You're saying, and your experts
[2:28:13.920 --> 2:28:19.600]  are saying society's going to fail so we'll have a new better system or a shot at it. But to them,
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:25.280]  the drug war, any of it, it's not failing. It is succeeding and they want to create a collapse to
[2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:31.200]  bring in more social engineering and their utopia. Okay, well, you changed the topic a little bit
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:36.560]  from what I was talking about. So let me address that. Basically, the collapse is not entirely,
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:43.200]  100% rigged. What it is is a pyramid scheme that is tipping that they've been expecting for a long
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:47.840]  time. And of course, they're going to capitalize on it. The fractional reserve system has to fail,
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:51.760]  and that's what we're talking about. The monetary system has to fail because it's based
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:55.920]  on competition and self-interest and power monopolies, just like in the second part of
[2:28:55.920 --> 2:28:59.280]  Zeitgeist Addendum where I talk about world monopoly. Well, I'm going to stop here right
[2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:02.640]  there. I'm going to stop here right there. So you can't even say you're wrong there.
[2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:09.280]  They fundamentally designed these in endless Ponzi schemes that always sieve out, like a guy
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:14.080]  panning for gold in a river, the wealth. I mean, they admitted it's in all their documents.
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:18.080]  Here we go. We're going to skip this break, too. We're going to skip it right now. I mean,
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:23.120]  go ahead and counter that. Go ahead and explain to me how it's not engineered by them.
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:31.360]  I'm not saying it's not engineered per se. You make these leaps that I can't see how you can
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:36.400]  honestly stand behind them with 100% confidence. The fractional reserve system, which has been
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:42.000]  put in place, they knew what would happen to it, but it created such a great level of differential
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  advantage for their control, for the corporate structure and everything else. I don't think
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.680]  they wanted it to fail. This is why the boom and bust cycle is what it is. It's completely
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:54.400]  contrived. I will admit that to you, but they have a very delicate balance right now, because the
[2:29:54.400 --> 2:29:59.440]  people, especially in the West, if the system fails the way it should, the way it mathematically
[2:29:59.440 --> 2:30:04.000]  should, just like every bust should be about 10 times worse than it really is, but it's not,
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.960]  because that's why the Federal Reserve was created, the lender of last resort. They always
[2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:12.240]  create a new bubble. Of course they do, and this is the way it has to work, though. It's a natural
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:16.960]  phenomenon. It's not as rigged as you think it is, because the money has to go somewhere,
[2:30:16.960 --> 2:30:21.840]  but they do protect it. Right now we're seeing the top of this pyramid scheme collapse. I think
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:26.240]  the elite, even though they have their power consolidation, they know that they have to walk
[2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:30.720]  a very delicate line, because the public is going to lose it. They're going to lose control of the
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:36.400]  public if they allow another depression. Actually, sir, hold on. Hold on. Let's go back to what
[2:30:36.400 --> 2:30:42.880]  you just said there. The central banks are cutting off liquidity to the real market and the population
[2:30:42.880 --> 2:30:47.840]  of the world. They are then, while telling the public the money's going to them, conduiting all
[2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:52.560]  of the fiat currency to themselves while it still has some value, while they consolidate real assets,
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:30:57.680]  and Business Week and the Financial Times of London properly say that this is actually good
[2:30:57.680 --> 2:31:02.640]  for that small intergroup of banks to consolidate. I'm not saying it isn't, Alex. I don't know where
[2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:06.240]  you're getting that. Well, I mean, I've got audio clips from the film. It's where I got that.
[2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:10.800]  Well, if you listen to the first zygote, I make it extremely clear about the interest of the
[2:31:10.800 --> 2:31:15.120]  international bankers. Look, I overall think your film is healthy and good and thought-provoking
[2:31:15.120 --> 2:31:20.560]  and great. It's just that I've always told my listeners, don't make what I'm saying a religion
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:27.280]  where I'm infallible and, you know, question me, and I'm saying, you know, that and obviously
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:31.200]  no work can be complete. None of it can be perfect. I'm hoping here, and I'm sure you've got things
[2:31:31.200 --> 2:31:36.640]  you can teach me, to open up avenues of discussion and refinement, not in your overall idea, but in
[2:31:36.640 --> 2:31:40.960]  how people are interpreting it, because certainly you know about the socialists and the Thabian
[2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:46.480]  socialists and the engineers and H.G. Wells and Bertrand Russell and all them saying about 90%
[2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:52.080]  of what you're saying at the end of Zeitgeist Addendum, but overlaying it with government
[2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:57.760]  central control to be able to construct it. Well, I couldn't disagree more. I'm based on the fact
[2:31:57.760 --> 2:32:02.960]  that what has been presented might sound like socialism. It might sound like Marxism because
[2:32:02.960 --> 2:32:08.240]  of those kernels of element of having a system that's designed for society as opposed to everyone
[2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:13.600]  fighting each other in order to survive in this monetary system-based competition illusion
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:18.880]  that's been created. The difference is the entire foundation of this is that it's related to science
[2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:22.800]  purely. And the thing about all the early Thabian socialists and all these guys, whatever their
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:26.800]  intent was, negative or positive, they had no concept of what technology is and neither does
[2:32:26.800 --> 2:32:33.920]  half the people on this planet. Stay there. Stay there. Full audience right now. Here we go.
[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:37.120]  Hey, let's keep this rolling underneath our guest. I'm going to try to control myself,
[2:32:37.120 --> 2:32:41.040]  but just sit here and write notes. I'm going to shut up for 10 minutes. Peter Joseph,
[2:32:41.040 --> 2:32:47.200]  creator of Zeitgeist, and you just run with what you're really saying overall, trying to
[2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:54.880]  encapsulate it all, and then I'll come in with some of my primitive musings here. My feeble mind
[2:32:54.880 --> 2:33:00.560]  will try to grasp it. But again, I want to say overall, I think your film's healthy and thought
[2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:05.840]  provoking. I think these discussions are important and people shouldn't allow institutionalized
[2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:12.640]  religion or anything to shudder their intellect from trying to grasp the whole width, breadth,
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:19.120]  and depth of this multifaceted, multivariate universe that we swim in. So creator of Zeitgeist,
[2:33:19.120 --> 2:33:23.760]  you go ahead. You got the floor. All right. Well, the first thing we need to discuss is the monetary
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:30.080]  system itself and the system that is underlying or the belief system that is perpetuated by this
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:35.120]  structure. The greatest failure of our society for thousands and thousands of years is to not
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:40.400]  address the root causes of human behavior. And the monetary system has created one of the worst
[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:46.160]  behavioral complexes that society has ever seen. It is compounding age-old instincts which have
[2:33:46.160 --> 2:33:51.200]  very little relevance to progress at all, including things like competition. If I was ever
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:33:55.360]  to call it an instinct, I'd say it's a natural culmination due to environment. If you're put
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:59.120]  it into an environment of scarcity where there's no work, no jobs, you're going to be forced to
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:04.160]  steal, your aberrant behavior is a creation. It's not inbred whatsoever. And I can defend
[2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:08.800]  that on multiple levels. But I'm going to move on, talk about the system itself, the monetary system.
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:12.400]  It doesn't matter if it's free enterprise. It doesn't matter if it's
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:19.520]  communistic or capitalistic or socialist. These are loaded terms based on basically
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:24.960]  outmoded ideologies that are no longer relevant. What we have is a system of competition that's
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:31.440]  inherently based on the assumption that human beings must fight with each other in order to
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:38.800]  survive. That's one. The second point is that human beings have to have incentive in order
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:45.280]  to be motivated to do something. And these are two extremely dangerous and ill-gotten perceptions
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:52.720]  of human behavior. The first mode to the effect that human beings need to have incentive,
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:58.800]  I'll go to that one first, is human beings' motivation can come from many different places.
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:03.840]  When you're a child, you have all sorts of interests that you pursue. You have all sorts of
[2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:08.560]  creativities that you find fascinating. You don't know what money is. You don't need incentive
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:13.680]  to do something. Einstein and Galileo, all of these great men that contributed, they didn't
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:18.640]  need money as incentive to do something. This is something they did on their own accord.
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:23.280]  Unfortunately, the brainwashing of society has forced people into a disposition where they
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.160]  want to be rewarded for what they do. And that means they want monetary compensation.
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:32.960]  No one will do anything in society without reward. And that includes solving social problems.
[2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:38.320]  If you can't make money off of solving a social problem in the system, it won't be done.
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:44.800]  And that is a very, very sad state of affairs. The first part, the first mention that I made
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:50.720]  where humans have to fight to compete for labor and income, the scarcity that exists in the system,
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:54.560]  this is created by the monetary system, not only to the fractional reserve system,
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:36:00.160]  but in the very structure itself. You can't have a society and expect progress in civil
[2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:04.720]  arrangements, ethics, decency, whatever you want to call it, morality in a system where everyone
[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:10.560]  is gaining off of everyone else through differential advantage. This can't work, it doesn't work,
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:16.000]  and it's never going to work. This is the why the world is what it is today, almost exclusively
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:21.280]  based on this competitive notion that is compounded and perpetuated by the monetary system.
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:25.120]  And this is the greatest failure that people don't understand. This is why I argue against it.
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:28.720]  I'm not saying that the Venus Project, and they're the first to admit this as well,
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:34.320]  is the end all. There's no utopia. But they recognize this core element that is corrupting
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:38.560]  human behavior, so we have to move out of this system. One of the things that people don't
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:42.960]  realize about the monetary system, which is very important, and I think you should think about this
[2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:48.400]  too, at least in this fabled free enterprise system specifically, is that it always leads
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:52.400]  to corruption. We say that the free enterprise system is, you know, it could be great, it could
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:57.360]  be pure. You could have a perfect free enterprise system and it would work. Well, there's no such
[2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:02.240]  thing as that because it automatically leads to corruption. It automatically leads to oligopoly,
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:06.320]  monopoly. It automatically leads to aberrant behavior, power consolidation, because that's the
[2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:10.800]  basis of it. That is the guiding principle, differential advantage. In order for society
[2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:14.640]  to progress, you have to eliminate this differential advantage in all the social
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:20.240]  stratification that occurs because of it, all the materialism. We have an advertising system
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:24.480]  that sits there and tells us that our value is based on what we own and how an artistic
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:30.240]  representation is. Our creativity is what we own, who we are, our identities are what we own.
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:34.080]  And this is a colossal and tremendous distortion that needs to be overcome.
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:40.800]  So, the basis of this argument is that we have to have a new system that gets rid of these
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:46.400]  tendencies. This thing called the New World Order that people talk about all the time,
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:50.080]  and I actually would like you to come back on the air and answer a question for me.
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:54.720]  And that is, what is the New World Order as you define it, Alex?
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:37:58.400]  What is the New World Order as I define it?
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.480]  I want, well, what is it, just in a concise definition, tell me what, if you were to explain
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:06.400]  this to someone who never even heard of such a thing, in a real concise manner, what is the
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:16.720]  New World Order? It is a hereditary clan that rules through the fraudulent fractional reserve
[2:38:16.720 --> 2:38:26.480]  monetary banking scam that operates through intelligence systems and shadow governments.
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:37.040]  And their goal is what? Their goal is hyper dominance and to control the past, the present,
[2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:43.840]  and the future to set up a worldwide police state by manipulating people's primitive fears with
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:49.920]  manufactured terror threats, biological threats, chemical threats. Their end game is to exterminate,
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:55.520]  well, most of them now say 99% of the population, the public documents say 80%,
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:02.000]  and to create then a machine utopia where the elite and their progeny go to the stars.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:10.160]  It is a worldwide eugenics cult that is in control of most of the resources on the planet
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:16.480]  and is eradicating the family and the free market and then, of course, demonizing the free market
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:22.080]  by claiming this corrupt system they have is a free market and are now in the final phases of
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:28.080]  their worldwide consolidation, their victory, which people are causing, calling a collapse or failure.
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:32.960]  And what is the path you think everyone should take to stop this New World Order?
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:38.720]  The path is multifaceted. We have to take control of our local political units first. We have to
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:43.280]  stop the electronic voting machine fraud system. To do that, we have to discredit the system,
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:48.080]  discredit the corrupt government that all the parties have been bought and paid for. We've
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:54.560]  entered a very deep, you know, a sector of the corruption on the graph, one of the deepest
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:59.760]  points in the trough. What about the people, though? What about these people that are the
[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:03.440]  ones that are perpetuating this? What is your solution for these people? What do we do with
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:07.360]  these people, so to speak? Well, I don't like bloody French-type revolutions,
[2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:11.280]  which then turn into something almost even worse. I think they need to be identified,
[2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:16.880]  exposed, and then they need to be tried by juries of their peers. They need to be given fair trials
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:23.440]  and sent to prison. And then their assets need to be nationalized to pay off all the fiat debts
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:29.200]  they have created. We need to have a population where we don't restrict Madison Avenue telling
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:33.920]  us we're inadequate so they can sell us products. We need to become conscious of these motivations
[2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:41.360]  and decide with the discernment what is a good advertisement, what is a bad advertisement.
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:48.080]  You know, in your film you talk about or some of your experts talk about how we can't, you know,
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:53.360]  basically in a free market or in a system of selling a vase or selling a car or selling a house or,
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:57.680]  you know, getting our kidney taken out, we can't trust anyone. Well, no, we need to learn to
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:02.880]  investigate and go to references. And, you know, that's why we, in the past, we had brand names,
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:06.960]  you know, a sewing machine that was known to last longer and be better. That way,
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:12.240]  if this is not free market, slave goods coming in from China that fall apart in five minutes.
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:15.840]  And so I disagree with that fundamentally. There's just so much I disagree. Let me stop you.
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:19.520]  I disagree so much fundamentally, you know, with saying we just can't trust the free market and
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:24.480]  products and goods because people have a reason to lie to you to sell you crap because somebody
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:29.120]  might have something better and then that stops people from progressing when it is the limited
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:33.920]  free market, though invaded and corrupted monopolies through government help, you know,
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:38.560]  that have been set up that we do have societal development and technological development because
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:44.960]  people do want gain by their inventions. They do want the prestige and it has been our competitive
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:49.920]  Renaissance free market, the yeoman farmer becoming a tanker, becoming an engineer,
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:55.360]  turning loose the native intelligence of the commoners that has created all the amazing
[2:41:55.360 --> 2:42:00.240]  things we see around us. But that's the byproduct of making us decadent and selfish in Madison
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:05.360]  Avenue through brainwashing to secure the elite as they try to come in with a counterrevolution
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:10.320]  to take over the Renaissance that has taken place. And so they have damaged and programmed
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:15.360]  the majority of the public. And so we need to, at a cellular level, those of us that are aware,
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:19.680]  try to wake up our friends, family, neighbors, communities, and at a cellular level, one cell
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:23.840]  at a time, heal the system with an exponential growth curve towards doing that.
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:30.160]  Okay, let's step back to my original question, which was about the New World Order. I told you what
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:34.960]  they are. They are hereditary kings who learned how to go underground. I'm commenting on this.
[2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:38.960]  This is why I wanted to ask the question. I thought you were posing it again. You said
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:42.240]  I go back to my original question. I just want to go back and address it because you've gone
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:46.400]  on a nice tangent, which I appreciate, but you moved away from what my original response was
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:50.400]  going to be. Well, it's a complex world. It takes complex solutions. I'm giving you actually
[2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:55.680]  analyzed information, things that have been thought out. Of course. Well, that's not general,
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:01.200]  general ideas. Let me comment, if you don't mind. Basically, your assumption then on the
[2:43:01.200 --> 2:43:04.960]  New World Order is that you have to have the public to wake up to this elite group that are
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:09.760]  trying to dominate things. And then you have to prosecute them and put them in jail and take them
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.880]  out. And that will be the resolution as you base... That will not be the total resolution, but yes,
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:20.640]  we have a... Just like the Nazis, they had to be taken out. Or finally, the Communist Chinese said,
[2:43:20.640 --> 2:43:24.160]  Mao and his wife are nuts, killing everybody because they made a deal with these eugenicists
[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:29.280]  in Europe. We got to arrest them. We got to arrest his wife. Okay. Well, here's a difference. I know
[2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:31.920]  you're going to disagree with it, but I think it's good for your audience to ponder this.
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:38.000]  The genetic basis, the heredity basis that you assume, is very much unsupported because, as I
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:44.160]  said, these secret societies are secret societies. They culminate who they bring in and everyone
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:49.120]  is conditioned into a particular worldview. But the secret societies are also conditioned in and
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:53.920]  of themselves. Their conditioning comes from somewhere. And my point to you and your audience
[2:43:53.920 --> 2:44:00.160]  is that the New World Order is not some elite sect of people. If you took out every single
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:04.640]  person at the top of the so-called... The system is still there and more people would step into
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:10.480]  those places like shark teeth. That's not what I said. I said, take the consolidated
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:15.040]  because that's how they've been conditioned. That's how the system's been set up. And they are
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:20.160]  coming from that same mindset. They want that power. It's the environment. It's the environment,
[2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:24.400]  isn't it, Alex? It's the environment. Well, I never said the environment wasn't part of all this.
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:30.160]  I know you did. But I'm saying we as a people are competitive and you have malfunctioning
[2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:34.720]  hyper... I mean, here's an example. I try not to be that competitive and lift people up and bring
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:39.200]  them in. And then I find out as soon as they think they're a big shot, they turn around and attack
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:44.160]  primitively thinking in competition, if they knock me the king monkey off in this movement,
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:48.400]  that somehow that will make them the king monkey. But that isn't the case because in the reality,
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:54.400]  I'm not even the king monkey in all of this. So I'm saying competitiveness is a good thing
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:59.760]  overall. It just has to be... We have to be conscious of it and we have to have rules
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:05.520]  and parameters in it and then have a playbook basically that societally we agree on and that
[2:45:05.520 --> 2:45:10.080]  we're constantly changing. So I mean, this whole thing of trying to say that we and Aitley aren't
[2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:15.280]  aggressive and that we are... I mean, no matter what culture it is, little girls in Aitley
[2:45:15.920 --> 2:45:20.560]  start going and building a camp and start breaking up wood and practicing making dinner and
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:25.920]  you can take a girl... I try with my girls, have them play with toy guns and army men
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:30.560]  and soccer and football. I want tomboy's. And you know what? They don't like that. They go
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:36.320]  directly for the pink Barbie and it isn't culture because they're not allowed to watch TV. Well,
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:42.240]  I think I would have to see those instances and conditions. I mean, I really have to...
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:49.200]  I can't relate it enough. This is ridiculous. Why does a sperm whale go south in the winter?
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:54.720]  I mean, it is genetic. I mean, why do geese know how to fly according to magnetic poles?
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:59.760]  You are saying... Why do birds build a nest? Exactly. You're saying instinct has nothing
[2:45:59.760 --> 2:46:03.600]  to do with it. This is... It's imprinting. It's imprinting. The bird builds a nest because it's
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:10.000]  born in a nest. You took a bird immediately out of the nest. Oh my God. How does a garden spider
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:17.920]  know how to spin a web? I mean, what are you... Let me tell you, bro, you got some major issues
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:23.680]  that are wrong and I'm telling you, you're influential. You're influential and that's a
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:27.680]  good thing because the alternative needs to become the majority and I'm all for this,
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:32.000]  but I'm telling you and I'm not even looking to argue with you here today. I'm just telling you.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:37.360]  I'm telling you, man, you did... Does the mommy spider teach the spider how to do that?
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:43.600]  Are elephants do elephant bulls fight with each other for dominance for the best mate
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:47.520]  because they saw their daddy elephant fight? No, because they live in scarcity and that's
[2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:51.040]  what their instincts... That's what their instincts of survival have to culminate in
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:53.920]  order to survive in this environment. Look, you can't take the spider out of the spider.
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:59.200]  You can't take the man out of the man. Look, humans are very different from other
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:04.320]  organisms on this planet. We have the ability to think and create. Our instincts can be changed,
[2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:09.040]  whatever that means. There are no actual human instincts and I have tons of science to back
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:14.160]  this up, especially the human being who is so malleable, so easy for influence. You don't
[2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:18.000]  believe that. Don't look at the news and help people. You're missing it. I agree with you.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:22.240]  I believe that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom and they say the competition
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.800]  and agreement... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Makes us innately different is that we can
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:32.720]  transcend and rapidly change and we are not completely frozen into instinct like animals.
[2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:38.960]  I'm just saying that there are those two parts. There are, but one is very much overshadowed
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:43.680]  the other and that is the conditioning. That is the environment. We have to change the environment
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:47.600]  if we expect a world to change. Ladies and gentlemen, you're not going to get anywhere
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:51.120]  by building more prisons, getting more police, and making more laws. These are...
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:55.360]  I agree with that one. Ah, stop, stop. The social engineers want to put people in prisons
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:59.760]  because they own them and they want to have slavery, so this is the way to legalize slavery
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:03.600]  and say if we catch you with this compound that's addictive that we ship in, then we're
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:08.960]  going to put you in our slave pit. You're acting, you and your... because I've been watching your
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:12.960]  film and watching other people that support what you're saying and it's the view that the elite are
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:17.200]  dumb and stupid and they don't know what they're doing and their idiots and more cops and more
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:22.720]  prisons aren't going to work. Of course, it's working. More people in prison, more slavery,
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:28.080]  more control. It's working beautifully. Sure, that's one angle to look at. Nevertheless,
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:32.560]  the public is conditioned to think these institutions are actually true in real institutions
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:37.600]  and not all of... not every stratified element of the prison system are a bunch of elites in
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:41.920]  their... No, no, the low-level morons that have lost all their other factory jobs and want to work
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:46.000]  as prison guards in there. You're absolutely right. They've been forced through engineering
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:51.440]  into that evil economy, that corrupt, that bad, that anti-human, that suppressing, grabbing some
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:55.280]  black kid because he was caught with cocaine the government shipped him when he's 14 years old
[2:48:55.280 --> 2:49:00.080]  because the MTV tells him it's cool with the blame culture and throwing him in a tiny cell
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:05.840]  to now be trained how to be a hardcore criminal. That is evil against the human code of nurturing
[2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:11.680]  and growing and training and building and reaching for the stars. There is evil and I will declare
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:17.600]  abortion evil. I will declare us special. I will declare us a divine species in the image of God
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:22.480]  and I will not let the technocrats or anybody else tell me that because I know we're going to the
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:28.240]  stars and I know our destiny is great and I know a little black kid having pesticide tested on until
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:34.480]  they die is evil. Sure, but that evil has a source and that's what you fail to realize and that
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:38.960]  source can be addressed through the environment and conditioned out of and until you realize that
[2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:42.320]  your irrational tirades are not going to help anything you're going to be. It's not irrational.
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:48.720]  It's not irrational. It is my instinct with the intellectual overlaid into the animal, the animal
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:55.920]  propulsion system to drive the species and to rally my fellow humans to come out of their cocoons
[2:49:55.920 --> 2:50:01.040]  and resist the tyranny. Yeah, the us against them, of course, the us against them. There is an us
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:05.440]  against them. There's always going to be Jeffrey Dahmers. There's always going to be Ted Turner's.
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:10.080]  There's always going to be Albert Pike's. You're always going to need weapons because enemies
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:15.600]  are always going to come against you. There is going to be no utopia, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:21.840]  We must stop being so trusting. It was talk of utopia that killed 200 million people in the
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:30.640]  last century. We're going to skip this break. Yeah. All right, go ahead. You got the floor.
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:36.000]  I'm glad we have a discussion as opposed to debate, Alex.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:44.720]  It is a discussion. Well, sure. You've been engaging in low-level monkey behavior.
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:51.600]  You've been debating. Don't say, I'm the only primitive. No, I'm not debating. I'm trying
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:55.600]  to present ideas, but you keep cutting me off and projecting what you think is true.
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:51:02.160]  I'm projecting what you know. You know what is true. Alex, let's be mature here. Hold on. You're
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:07.040]  saying what you're saying is a fact and I'm projecting what I know to be true. I'm suggesting
[2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:11.840]  that it's been proven by evidence continuously. You have absolutely no proof that there's going
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:17.840]  to always... That's a lawyer statement. I'll give you proof all day. Proof of what? What proof do
[2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:22.160]  you seek? You base your assumption on the fact that we've always lived in scarcity, yet you don't
[2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:27.840]  recognize that. You don't realize that the human... Without that drive of scarcity, our key propulsion
[2:51:27.840 --> 2:51:34.320]  system is lost to go to the stars. No, that's ridiculous. What are you talking about? Our prime
[2:51:34.320 --> 2:51:42.320]  drive is to build and that comes out of scarcity in our development needing to have a drive,
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:47.360]  needing to be restless, needing to build a better mousetrap, a better throwing spear,
[2:51:47.360 --> 2:51:51.120]  so that the tribe could survive. I don't think that's fundamentally evil.
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:58.560]  I think there are subgroups of humans who are preditating, engaging in predator activity
[2:51:58.560 --> 2:52:05.040]  against their fellow humans like we are a subspecies that deserves to be fed on. I'm
[2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:10.560]  saying that's sin. I'm saying that's crime. I'm saying we need communities of purpose and agree
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:15.840]  with a lot of what you're talking about. Yes, but you fail continuously to see the
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:21.280]  fundamental point. What is the fundamental point? It's human conditioning and not genetics that
[2:52:21.280 --> 2:52:25.680]  has the relevant issue here. If you want to maintain this society, say for example you want
[2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:31.840]  to continue this thing you call the free market, which is probably the most monetary system of
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:37.600]  all accord. Communism, socialism, fashion, it doesn't matter. Those are all scams. Listen,
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:43.040]  stop interrupting me. I'm not finished. This is the type of thing that people need to understand
[2:52:43.040 --> 2:52:47.680]  about the environment. As long as we have a monetary system that is based on people getting
[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:52.560]  advantage of each other, you know those $29.95 DVD conspiracy combo packs you sell, you know,
[2:52:52.560 --> 2:52:57.120]  while you have a little $29.95, it's to manipulate your audience and to buy it because they don't
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:02.000]  think it's $30. This is the type of nonsense manipulation that goes on every day that we
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:06.880]  think is commonplace and it's a distortion. It's anti-human. You engage in it. I am forced to
[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:12.400]  engage in a certain kind of job. If you were to get a job anywhere, you are participating in a
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:16.320]  corrupt behavior because you have to take that work away from somebody else. No, you're part of a
[2:53:16.320 --> 2:53:19.840]  tribe. You're part of a team. It's just the elites don't treat the subgroups like that.
[2:53:19.840 --> 2:53:23.440]  Hey, we're coming back to the full audience and I want to address what you just said in
[2:53:23.440 --> 2:53:28.720]  this whole discussion about money, okay? Here we go right now. Let's now.
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:42.240]  Is it getting better?
[2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:53.760]  Or do you feel the same? Is it easier on you now? Will it make it easier on you now?
[2:53:53.760 --> 2:53:59.680]  She's got someone to blame. Our guest is the creator of Zeitgeist and
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:11.680]  he says he's not debating but he, A, just engaged in just amazing hypocrisy and I'm
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:14.880]  going to finish this and let you counter with people listening on the internet.
[2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:26.160]  You know, saying the incredible, those little DVD compacts you sell, it's 29.95 is manipulative
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:33.040]  and it's bad and then you're going to say that what I am forced to sell, exactly you sell
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:37.280]  your films. You have the money for the computers. Let me finish. The money for the cameras, the
[2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:42.880]  money to fly places, to interview people, to make an even better film, to pay for your apartment
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:47.600]  in New York or wherever it is you're at, to do all of this and I'm not saying that the
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:52.720]  monetary system isn't a total fraud of fractional reserve banking and fiat currency running a
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:58.320]  scam or an image but if farmers want to create their local county or city money that they agree
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:03.840]  upon on exchanging, that greases the skids. Upcommerce makes it easier for them to exchange
[2:55:03.840 --> 2:55:08.960]  goods. That's something that's needed and I have done whole shows on marketing and saying,
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:16.960]  why don't I sell a video for $20? Why do I say $19.95? Because psychologically the $19.95
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:22.880]  sounds like it's somehow less and plus it's what we're used to in the parameters of bigger
[2:55:22.880 --> 2:55:28.800]  advertisement so it triggers those neural pathways that make people buy. Now, I really resent the
[2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:34.240]  fact that I pioneered, I pioneered 12 years ago putting my videos on the web for free
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:40.160]  and then even paying with my own bandwidth, not just for free, paying to, paying to give it to
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:45.840]  people, paying to be a slave and then I pioneered viral videos on the web, I pioneered going up
[2:55:45.840 --> 2:55:50.160]  and bullhorning politicians, I pioneered going and taking over press conferences and, and, and
[2:55:50.160 --> 2:55:53.600]  literally, thank, I had no idea I was doing it at the time, I just seemed most effective,
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:56.560]  I've done all this, I've given, I've given, I've given, I've given, I've given, I've given, I've
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:56:02.160]  given and then you could say that I'm evenly manipulating people, selling things and how I'm
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:09.280]  selling it, but then in the next breath admit you are selling stuff, that is, and I always love it,
[2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:15.760]  you know, the, the, the futurist and the engineer you interview on your film, you know, Jacques,
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:20.720]  his house is up for sale right now, his 28-acre compound I saw online, I mean, you know, he's
[2:56:20.720 --> 2:56:27.040]  selling stuff, oh my, but see, when you do it, it's loving, when I do it, it's bad, explain that to
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:31.440]  me. It's getting really annoying to me, so why don't you step back a second and listen to what
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:38.880]  I actually said, I said, when you put something online and you say it's $29.95 alone, I don't
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:42.960]  give a damn about what you're doing as far as, well, this and that, it's irrelevant to the point
[2:56:42.960 --> 2:56:47.680]  that I was making, my point is that you are engaging in a manipulative practice, you want
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:53.280]  to sell them for $20, put it up for $20, don't make it $19.95, the entire system is based on
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:58.080]  differential advantage or manipulation. I did in the past and I told people, you are there to preserve
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:02.480]  your... I put it up there, I know, I'm evil, I mean, I'm not evil, we've heard it, no, no, it's true,
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:07.120]  I'm bad, I'm selling things, it's true, I've been caught. Selling things, Alex, nothing to do with
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  selling things is illegal about it. Look, you're going to, you can sit there and project all day,
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:14.720]  it's not going to help anything. I'm sitting here trying to explain to you that the financial
[2:57:14.720 --> 2:57:18.400]  system creates aberrant behavior and until you and your audience realize this, nothing's going to
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:23.200]  change. The financial system, not in a way it's constructed, but the actual underpinning mechanism
[2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:28.320]  that guides human behavior in the economic structure that relates to business and everything else
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:33.120]  will lead only to corruption... Hey, what a bird's... Self-preservation, you have your own
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:38.560]  self-preservation. Why do birds get shiny objects and put them in their nest? Why do birds get shiny
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:43.120]  objects and put them in their nest? I don't know, tell me. Well, it's not because they're greedy and
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:51.520]  evil and Madison Avenue told them, they like the shiny thing. So to say that humans wanting
[2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:56.080]  things or wanting a house on a hill because they can see a beautiful vista, to claim that people
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:58:02.240]  wanting things is inherently bad, it's just that it's lower on the hierarchy of needs and if you
[2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:07.920]  will do immoral things, four things, that's bad. But wanting things... I'm putting words in my mouth.
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:14.240]  I'm not putting words in your mouth. Let me talk to him. We'll stay on there for a minute.
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:17.360]  Hey, we're going to have a one minute break and we'll come right back to you for the
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:21.600]  for the second hour, okay? All right, Alex. And we're going to play some Clips of Zeitgeist
[2:58:22.160 --> 2:58:25.840]  Addendum here and get your response to those. You know, I really appreciate if you actually
[2:58:25.840 --> 2:58:29.840]  let me respond because I have a very simple train of thought. I'm luring you. Let me look.
[2:58:29.840 --> 2:58:33.040]  You're jumping off on Cliffs, man. I don't appreciate it. Hey, Peter, it sounds to me you're
[2:58:33.040 --> 2:58:39.280]  another one of these intellectuals who will say vicious, aggressive things and then piss their
[2:58:39.280 --> 2:58:44.160]  pants. If anybody else... Hold on a minute. Piss their pants. If anybody else says anything,
[2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:49.280]  half as mean, back to them. Okay? And now I'm really going to do a critique of you and now
[2:58:49.280 --> 2:58:53.600]  I'm getting out the fine tooth comb. So get ready. You realize that I said nothing negative. Oh,
[2:58:53.600 --> 2:58:56.960]  yeah. Hey, hey, listen, here we go. What have I said negative? Hey, what you don't realize,
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:59:02.000]  I've said a hundred times on air that 29.95 is manipulative and I point out on air it is. So
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:07.280]  again... Well, I'm just making the example. Okay. Hey, here we go. Here we go. Back to the full
[2:59:07.280 --> 2:59:11.600]  audience in 20 seconds. You need to effectively wake up your fellow man and fight the new world
[2:59:11.600 --> 2:59:18.480]  order is available right now at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.tv. Join the info war today.
[2:59:22.240 --> 2:59:27.440]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:59:35.520 --> 2:59:36.400]  This all started
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:42.000]  a couple of weeks ago when I watched Zeitgeist Addendum
[2:59:42.800 --> 2:59:45.920]  and I came on air and I said, look, all I know is I'm hearing the same buzz words.
[2:59:46.960 --> 2:59:51.360]  Government withering away, eradication of the classes and we're going to play those clips.
[2:59:52.800 --> 2:59:55.840]  And I said, I think these people all mean well and I think it's all interesting. It's just human
[2:59:55.840 --> 3:00:00.560]  nature. And look, human nature, you got two men on the air and look, he's getting fiery,
[3:00:00.560 --> 3:00:05.520]  he's getting upset. That's the passion that's not evil or even something competitive.
[3:00:05.520 --> 3:00:12.720]  That is the tectonic volcanic fury, you know, spewing out of, you know, Vulcan's
[3:00:14.480 --> 3:00:20.400]  blacksmith shop. That's humanity. And so listen, I tried to give you 10 minutes earlier just to
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:24.160]  run. You say I keep interrupting, but you keep making statements at me. So I'm going to make
[3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:28.960]  counter. So I'm going to just go run, run with it. You got the floor. Well, first of all,
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:33.440]  I thought the passion for me to get irritated and express that irritation is the condition
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:37.200]  that you set up because apparently the only way to communicate with you is through this kind of
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:41.360]  WWF aggression that you seem to perpetuate. Exactly. You've got to sit up there with a big
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:46.160]  bubble alien head like a Star Trek and I'm the dumb captain Kurt down here. You're like,
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:51.760]  I am the watcher. You are the little, you always push yourself. Oh, I'm up here.
[3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:57.120]  I'm figuring it out. If you listen to anything that was ever presented to my film, I don't,
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:02.960]  I know, listen, go man, you got the floor. Well, actually, my whole point was to actually discuss
[3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:05.760]  things with you, Alex. And I'm going to say a bunch of things and you come back on and you're
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:10.720]  going to project a bunch of other things. So what I will say is essentially what I've said before,
[3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:14.000]  because your audience is the most important thing here and that's who I really would like to speak
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:19.280]  with. Ladies and gentlemen, people, we have to start thinking about root causes of behavior. We
[3:01:19.280 --> 3:01:24.800]  can't have these superstitious notions of reality. Religion wants us to believe that there's a good
[3:01:24.800 --> 3:01:30.240]  and an evil. This is easy to understand. It's easy to think that some people are just naturally good
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:36.640]  and naturally bad. This is a sad, sad worldview of humanity. It's perpetuated and consolidated in
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:43.440]  our mind because the system that's been created continues this bad human tendency. It continues
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:47.520]  this need for self-perpetuation, self-preservation. Well, wait, wait, how can you say there's even
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:53.840]  a bad? I thought there's no, I mean, bad, evil, same thing. I never said that evil didn't exist
[3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:58.560]  in the sense I'm redefining the terms, Alex. It's not bad or good. I'm giving it a quantitative
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:03.120]  nation to make it relevant. It is bad for people to beat each other up, as far as I'm concerned.
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:07.120]  There is a quality distinction, but it's not evil. There's reasons behind it. When you say
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:12.560]  evil, you are implying a religious connotation that rejects the behavioral conditioning of that
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:16.720]  person and every single human being is born. There's no difference between a Gandhi baby
[3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:20.880]  and a Hitler baby. I hate to break it to you. It's all a matter of conditioning. Until you
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:25.520]  address this, nothing's going to change. The New World Order will continue. People at the top will
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:28.720]  be arrested. We'll have more false flight terrorist attacks society will break down. We'll have
[3:02:28.720 --> 3:02:33.120]  power consolidation. Even the rich elite will eventually suffer because they are completely
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:38.320]  out of line with nature, and that's the entire point. You cannot have a system based on differential
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:43.520]  advantage in society and expect progress. And back to your other point, progress is not money.
[3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:48.400]  It's human creativity in science and technology. Everything you have, you owe to science and
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:52.480]  technology. Everything in your studio right now, the chair you're sitting on. How that's the human
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:57.280]  mind. Of course it is, and that's the beauty of the human being. We have the ability to create
[3:02:57.280 --> 3:03:01.760]  something that the animal kingdom does not have, not the extent that we... Well, B.F. Skinner said
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:05.600]  beyond good and evil, and then once you're beyond good and evil, then they say it's okay for them
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:12.400]  to do whatever they want. But you're not saying that. Say that again. Skinner and people talked
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:19.200]  about beyond good and evil. Beyond good and evil. Yes, so by any time we try to make a moral judgment,
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:25.600]  people say that's just religious. Well, hold on. I mean, I know Brahma cattle. Brahma cattle are
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:29.200]  very aggressive genetically. They're some of the most dangerous type of cows to have,
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:35.840]  and that is genetic. That's not trained into the Brahma cows. I mean, we know.
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:42.560]  Well, they've done all sorts of genetic studies. A lot of aggression is genetic,
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:48.560]  and then it can be taken down or it can be jacked up. Sure, but I think you'll tend to find, though,
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:53.520]  there's a lot of a lot of discontinuous information, a lot of bad research that's gone into geneticist
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:56.880]  ideologies. For example, the reason that these cattle might be violent has nothing to do with
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:01.440]  their genetics. The fact that they're born into this violent herd and they condition those responses.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:05.920]  This is the nature with all dogs is the nature. You know, there's a cliche of rottweilers being
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:09.760]  mean. This isn't true. It just happens to be that the people that get these rottweilers do so with
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:14.640]  a specific intent and the statistics support that they're conditioned aberrantly. Well, I think
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:19.440]  that has, well, I think that's a big part of it, but a lot of people have nice, sweet pit bulls
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:25.600]  and rottweilers, and one day it bites their child's face off. So I don't understand that.
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:26.640]  We're going to skip this break, too.
[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:34.400]  Look, in the limited time we have here, I really don't want to make this a fight.
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:39.120]  You're not acting like you, man. I really offended that you're yelling at me because
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:46.080]  I'm just presenting ideas. No, I was yelling excitedly here on air, and I want to try to
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:50.400]  go through some other areas of the film. I want to try to go through some other facets,
[3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:55.280]  because I agree with you about how the monetary system is working, but are you saying that's
[3:04:55.280 --> 3:05:00.240]  basically any system that uses symbols to try to grease the skids of commerce?
[3:05:00.240 --> 3:05:05.040]  No, what I'm saying is that you're using a system of exchange that's based on scarcity,
[3:05:05.040 --> 3:05:10.320]  and you can't expand based on differential advantage. Money is inherently a corrupt behavior
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:14.720]  producing element. It can't be in the other way because it's scarce, just like everything
[3:05:14.720 --> 3:05:18.880]  in nature. This is why animals behave the way they do in nature for food and what have you.
[3:05:18.880 --> 3:05:23.600]  You can't have a system of inherent scarcity in ever, ever. Expect people to behave in any
[3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:27.680]  what's so-called ethical... So what do you propose to replace money? How is this metamorphosis?
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:32.080]  This is exactly what we were talking about with the resource-based economy. Money doesn't exist.
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:37.120]  Money is not real. It never has been. Labor... 90% of the jobs people have today. I'm talking about
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:40.800]  employment labor. I'm not talking about human interest in working. There's a big distinction
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:44.320]  there. I think you got that wrong and you're out. So how does this start? Where do we get the land?
[3:05:44.320 --> 3:05:48.560]  Who gives it to you? Do you take somebody's land to give it to another group? Of course I do.
[3:05:48.560 --> 3:05:52.320]  Of course I do. You're jumping way ahead. You have to get the ideology down first,
[3:05:52.320 --> 3:05:56.720]  and then the communication will begin on a vast level. But don't I need to know that if an ideology
[3:05:56.720 --> 3:06:02.080]  is going to work good, if I'm going to sign onto it, I need to wargame it out historically and try to
[3:06:02.080 --> 3:06:08.080]  look at it? Or I just accept the ideology first and then hope it works? No, you don't accept the
[3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:13.120]  ideology first and hope it works. That's a faith-based ideology. What you have is an intellectual
[3:06:13.120 --> 3:06:18.080]  analysis of the environmental conditions of the planet itself, and you begin to restructure society
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:23.120]  based on what we understand today. How do we restructure society? That isn't going to have a
[3:06:23.120 --> 3:06:29.120]  central turn. First of all, the first thing that I think the natural progression would be to build
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:34.880]  the first city. As I said earlier, this is a technological development. We have to recognize
[3:06:34.880 --> 3:06:39.920]  that everything we have is out of the technology. It's out of human creativity. So we can create
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:44.560]  things that relieve us of human labor. I point out this tendency, this clash we have with the labor
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:50.480]  system and human employment, excuse me, labor system and automation. And this is extremely
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:55.200]  prevalent. We used to have all factory jobs. Now we have a service industry and a service
[3:06:55.200 --> 3:06:59.920]  industry slowly being phased out as well. This isn't some plot of the new world order. This is a
[3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:05.680]  natural element of technology replacing human labor. So rather than be fearful of this,
[3:07:05.680 --> 3:07:09.840]  we have to harness it and we have to utilize technology for what its real gift is, and that's
[3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:14.960]  extensions of us to relieve us of different things that we do not want to do or don't need to do or
[3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:19.840]  are dangerous to do. And that is a central philosophical point in this arrangement. To
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:25.520]  build the first city would rely entirely on pure renewable energies, transportation that's
[3:07:25.520 --> 3:07:29.280]  completely clean. You know, it would cost more money. Hold on, here we go, back to the full
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:30.640]  audience, explain it to people. Here we go.
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:37.600]  Probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:07:37.600 --> 3:07:42.640]  We're talking with Peter Joseph, the creator of Zeitgeist, and then he's now made a dendym.
[3:07:42.640 --> 3:07:48.160]  I would hope that some of the Zeitgeist viewers would check out my documentary films
[3:07:48.160 --> 3:07:54.400]  because I know the society is engineered, it's stated, it is called the Scientific Dictatorship,
[3:07:54.400 --> 3:08:01.200]  my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslaviment. The tale is just a small part with specifics of
[3:08:01.200 --> 3:08:07.200]  what they're doing, how they understand human progression, how they want to face humans out of
[3:08:08.640 --> 3:08:12.400]  involvement with the machines, with the systems, whereas this could be an empowering
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:15.600]  thing as Zeitgeist is talking about, and I actually agree with that in a lot of the film.
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:22.400]  They are using it as a way to say they don't need humans and that we're overpopulated and we're
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:28.400]  a scourge and we've got to just be gotten rid of, and that's been widely discussed and is being
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:34.720]  pushed by the leading transhumans, not the whole movement, and the eugenicist, the crypto eugenicist,
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:40.160]  and others. And I was asking the fellow we're talking to with his ideas and the Venus Project
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:48.720]  ideas how we would start, and I actually agree, it would be a model system, a town, a city, an area
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:56.400]  to be a demonstration of the future and what we could move into, but then I would ask him the
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:03.360]  question, how do you stop the establishment from trying to move in and block its development
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:10.640]  because they're trying to block anything that decentralizes power? Yes, a very good question
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:14.640]  and that is not a simple answer. Essentially, establishment would do everything it could
[3:09:14.640 --> 3:09:20.240]  to stop any type of system that was self-preserving in its own way, self-sustaining, excuse me,
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:25.280]  because you can't get profit off of efficiency, sustainability, or abundance. That's why our
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:30.400]  system right now, the free market as we call it, or monetary system, monetary isn't as I coined,
[3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:35.520]  will never ever work because you can never have a world without war or poverty on a system that's
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:40.480]  based on differential advantage and scarcity. The profit is made off of scarcity. The limited
[3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:44.640]  number of things available makes it more profitable. The old companies have been raping people all
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:50.160]  past few years or continuously since the 1970s with this general tactic, and it's pervasive
[3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.640]  throughout the entire system. So naturally, the establishment will reject this, and I'm very
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:09:59.600]  aware of that. That is why at the end of Zeitgeist, then I have a series of boycotts. When the public
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:05.760]  begins to wake up to the reality of what's possible as a human species, away from all these
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:10.960]  ridiculous institutions that have no relevance to anything, then that's when the true awakening
[3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:14.800]  will occur. People will try to distort the system. They will try to bomb it, do whatever,
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:18.400]  anything could happen, but it doesn't matter because the system will prevail because it's
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:23.680]  based on something true, not money, not competition, but resources and creativity.
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:27.920]  But that's what the great leap forward in the cultural evolution said they were going to do in China.
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:32.720]  Well, obviously it didn't work, and there's probably many good reasons for that because
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:38.240]  China is a monetary system too. Look, that's why the world system has to change. That's why the
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:42.800]  human value system has to begin to understand what's going on. I'm not saying this is an easy
[3:10:42.800 --> 3:10:47.520]  thing to do. What I'm saying is that this is the next step. You have to have world unification
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:50.960]  intellectually to understand the planetary resources and what's capable on it.
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:55.600]  But see then, people won't unify, so what do you do about them? They're going to hold it back.
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:01.360]  Well, then they make that decision, and they sit in their world. You can have it. Sadly enough,
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:04.560]  you know, there's no perfect scenario here. Oh, there's no us against them?
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:09.200]  No, there's no us against them. If someone wants to do something else, they do it. No one's
[3:11:09.200 --> 3:11:13.440]  eradicated as you belligerently put in your October 8th. This is a silly, silly notion.
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:18.400]  I was repeating, he was on that class as everything would be eradicated.
[3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:23.200]  The human value system, adjusting and growing and adapting. That's what he's talking about.
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:29.120]  Well, hold on. Let's play that clip. Let me play that clip. That's the clip we were playing
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:35.360]  last week, John, which sounds very similar to the HD Wells stuff, but not the HD Wells clip.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:41.440]  It was the clip number 10s, what it's called. Go ahead and play that.
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:47.440]  We're such an abominable, sick society that we won't make the history of it.
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:53.200]  Let's just say that large nations took land from smaller nations, used force and violence.
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:58.880]  You'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along until the beginning
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:04.560]  of the civilized world. That's when all the nations worked together. World unification,
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:12.400]  working toward common good for all human beings, and without anyone being subservient
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:19.360]  to anyone else, without social stratification, whether it be technical elitism or any other
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:26.640]  kind of elitism eradicated from the face of the earth. The state does nothing because there is no
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:34.960]  state. There is no state. Okay. I don't think I'm, I was saying, I heard similar things
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:39.600]  from the communist and the Fabian socialist. If you go back to your YouTube clip, you
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:45.040]  specifically project out to your audience that it's an eradication by guns to the head. And if
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:49.120]  you don't, don't even try to deny it, Alex. No, no, what I'm saying is, no, no, no, what I said
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:54.080]  is that, no, that's what I said. I said over and over again in society, we, you know, we hear all
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:12:57.840]  these ideas, similar things. I'm not saying it's the same. And I'm not saying there's
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:02.720]  a lot of value in what you're saying. I'm saying what happens in the process of getting there
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:10.160]  generally turns out pretty bad. Okay. Well, that's, that's an assumption that you assume it
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:13.200]  has absolutely no relevance to what he's talking about. At the very end of the section, he's
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:18.000]  speaking idealistically. He's talking about the needs and the broad scheme. We are an incredibly
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  sick society. Our value system is sick like evil, like evil. No, sick because we're misinformed.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:28.560]  We have the turbulent value systems. We have distortions like religion. We have distortions
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:33.680]  like fashion, like distortions like greed and competition that are pervasive and completely
[3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:37.120]  parallel. Let me ask you a question. Truly are. You're listening. That is what he's talking about.
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:40.560]  Stop. Let me finish my point. I need to ask you a question. Let me finish. Go ahead. Go ahead.
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:45.520]  The point is, is that he's speaking idealistically, rule unification without a state. What does that
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:49.680]  mean? No one can even think about something like that. It means that the state does not serve the
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:56.160]  function of any type of state we've ever known. It's not a state of control. Humans are based in a
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:03.040]  condition of humans are deriving their products from a system that is self-generating and self-
[3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:08.000]  sustaining and they contribute to society not because they want money in return or power or
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:12.400]  any of the nonsensical inventions that we've created. They contribute to society because they
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:17.920]  understand that the more you give, the more you get. Well, here's the problem. Here's the problem.
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:25.120]  Every time people try to have anarchy in groups of bigger than three or four people, always somebody
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:31.280]  becomes what we would call corrupt or sick as you would call them and starts dominating the others.
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:35.440]  And so what I'm saying is, is you're a good guy. I believe you're a nice guy who means well.
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:40.640]  Other people working with you are, and you know, the experts you talk to, I know, you know, both
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:46.480]  of them are good guys mean well and are very intelligent. I'm saying that there is an oversimplification.
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:51.840]  Are you feeding in all the factors that you talk about? Yes, of course we are. We're not, no one's
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:55.760]  ignorant to the current state of things. And by the way, you know, you're sitting there telling me
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:00.080]  I'm a good guy, right? And off the air, you come on, you tell me that I'm one of these intellectual
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:04.320]  elites that pisses his pants his exact... No, that was on air. That was on air, bro. Well, great.
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:09.360]  We've been on air the whole time. What is wrong again? That was on air. That we were yelling at
[3:15:09.360 --> 3:15:13.200]  each other and you just said that I was... Stop, stop, stop. I'm trying to talk... Put him on
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:17.200]  hold for just a minute. Look, I gotta tell you something, man. You come on here and you say,
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:22.880]  like with some vitriol that I'm back as a 29.95 and then I'm selling things and then you admit
[3:15:22.880 --> 3:15:28.720]  I'm forced to, you know, yourself. Buddy, you're playing sad and spooky music on your stuff. That
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:33.760]  could be seen as a form of deception much greater than saying 29.95. I mean, if you want to take
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:39.680]  the gloves off, I can take them way off here. Okay, I am trying to be nice here and I understand
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:44.080]  you're in this view that you're so intellectual and so sweet and loving that you're just this
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:49.440]  higher podhead alien and I'm this lower Neanderthal down here. I understand all that. You know,
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:55.760]  us Texans, I'm crappin' in an outhouse out here every five minutes. My point is with you is that,
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:16:01.360]  is that I haven't, you know, been here trying to shoot you down or attack you and I said on air
[3:16:01.920 --> 3:16:07.120]  about the pissing in the pants. Okay, so go ahead. Well, sure. Fine. Wrong again. You're,
[3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:12.240]  you're being, you're being extremely irrational with this because I haven't said anything to
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:16.880]  him. No, I just said I think you're a nice guy and a smart guy and you came back with an aggressive
[3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:21.280]  thing. You came back with a debate point. I think you're a little bit, a little bit too faced on
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:24.560]  this and I want to make sure that's apparent that you understand. No, it was on air, pal. Don't
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:29.520]  try to say it wasn't. No, I'm not telling the people on air. There's no too face about it, buddy.
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:34.160]  It's all straight up here. Okay, well good. I'm glad to hear that. Hey, let me ask you a question.
[3:16:34.160 --> 3:16:38.400]  Earlier in your film, I'm gonna play the clip, you, you're talking to Stainfully about religion
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:44.960]  and money and fashion in the family and he shows a family. What about those? Tell me about them.
[3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:49.360]  Tell you about what? Would you please clarify? Well, I mean, you're mentioning all these,
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:54.080]  you know, I mean, clearly in the context, all these, all these terrible outmoded things and
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:58.000]  I'll read all the social worker books, how the families are diseased and all this. I'm asking,
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  was a, is the family a good thing or is it gonna go bye-bye to? Of course the family's a good thing.
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:09.280]  Family is a natural institution. Family is where people will return to in this type of situation,
[3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:13.520]  but there'll be a different association because the family will become the community in many ways.
[3:17:13.520 --> 3:17:18.320]  The extensionality that we feel, this thing we call love, is not restricted to your little group
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:22.480]  or your family. But love is religious. It doesn't exist either, just like evil doesn't exist.
[3:17:23.280 --> 3:17:28.320]  Because if evil doesn't exist, good doesn't exist. I never said evil doesn't exist. At the
[3:17:28.320 --> 3:17:33.040]  different terminology, you use it in a religious context very frequently. I am not. Well, fine,
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:37.360]  if you want to use the word evil, I'll just use the word bad as a synonym. There is an element of
[3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:41.200]  alignment. There are certain things that we consider to be socially offensive to the structure
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:45.280]  and that's where crime and things come in. So you call them bad, naturally. However, a person
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:49.600]  engaged in that crime is a victim of their culture. Therefore, they're doing what they have to survive,
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:53.920]  so it's good for them. Therefore, it's all a matter of degree. Coming back to the family,
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:58.240]  family is whatever the family wants to be. There's no restrictions. There's no CPS in
[3:17:58.240 --> 3:18:03.200]  any type of society. These are all amalgams of the corruption that we see of this human
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:08.560]  loss, this intellectual distance. Well, here's the deal with six and a half
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:13.360]  billion people. Let's say you got your society. You're saying it's just you're going to be so good
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:21.120]  that nobody does these bad things or these sick things anymore. Where does the word eradication
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:25.280]  come in then? How does that happen? Because the value system changes and the tendency is no
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:28.640]  longer there. They used to feed Christians to lions in Rome. You think they'd get away with
[3:18:28.640 --> 3:18:32.320]  that today? No. Well, they're getting back to it. They're getting back to their gladiators.
[3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:35.920]  Value systems are changing. They have been through time. The more sophisticated we become,
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:40.800]  the more we access them. The more scarcity is reduced, the less aberrant behavior will happen.
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:45.360]  I agree. I mean, if the economy goes down, crime goes up. I totally agree with you. I agree with
[3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:49.040]  about 90% of what you guys are saying. Well, then we have to take it further then. Once we
[3:18:49.040 --> 3:18:52.640]  realize we can create a society, for example, in this society, let's say you wanted to go to the
[3:18:52.640 --> 3:18:58.560]  grocery store. Well, guess what? You go in, you get what you need, and you leave. That's it. Why?
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:02.160]  Why would no one steal? Because there's no reason. They can't sell it because there's no money.
[3:19:02.160 --> 3:19:07.120]  There's no reason for differential advantage in a position where you can't actually engage in
[3:19:07.120 --> 3:19:13.360]  gaining something through abuse in society. This is a core point in why money is such a
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:18.080]  horrible invention for control. Money is the ultimate divide and conquer, Alex. You're
[3:19:18.080 --> 3:19:22.720]  someone supposed to be privy to manipulation techniques. The free enterprise system, all the
[3:19:22.720 --> 3:19:28.800]  monetary systems are purified. I am privy to music. Here we go. Hold on. Let me explain how this is
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:35.920]  working here for you. The Internet audience is on PrismPlanet.tv right now. It is huge, hundreds
[3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:39.920]  of thousands listening on the web, and then millions over time on the web. So we're skipping
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:44.720]  AM and FM breaks, shortwave breaks, satellite breaks. And so the audience is probably 10%
[3:19:44.720 --> 3:19:50.400]  of what it was, but it is on the air. It is in the view of everyone. All of this is, unless we
[3:19:50.400 --> 3:19:55.840]  just completely, unless you just... I stood on to appreciate your insult. Well, I wasn't implying
[3:19:55.840 --> 3:20:01.760]  or apologizing for what I said. I mean, I'm not... I was explaining, we're on air all the time.
[3:20:02.400 --> 3:20:09.040]  I was just separately... I was separately... Are you even aware you use debate techniques
[3:20:09.040 --> 3:20:13.920]  and lawyer tactics, which are extremely dishonest, just like your music, just like your sad music
[3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:18.960]  at certain points? Why are you doing that with this corporate Madison Avenue manipulative music
[3:20:18.960 --> 3:20:25.600]  like in a drug commercial for Halcyon? Why are you doing that like I am saying $29.95? Why? Why?
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:30.400]  Why? Why have you done that? There's a very big difference, because one is art and one is pure
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:35.040]  marketing. And of course, you can say there's a matter of degree between the two. But I exchange
[3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:40.560]  things and I want to make things interesting for people to relate to. They can use their own minds
[3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:45.920]  in, you know, this is the nature of reality. But when you put something on $29.95, it's just a
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:50.960]  general expression. It's a very simple notion. It's a marketing tactic. My use of music is music
[3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:57.200]  that I like to use. Well, I like $29.95. Well, fine. You want to have an argument
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:00.640]  fine, but you're sitting there along with all the other people on Madison Avenue with the same
[3:21:00.640 --> 3:21:05.200]  thing. My music is completely individual. No, let me explain. We use with truthful
[3:21:05.200 --> 3:21:10.720]  information and truthful, good products of information. We use Madison Avenue tactics
[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:16.160]  right back against them. Fine, fine. I mean, so do you, man. I mean, hold on, hold on. Let's talk
[3:21:16.160 --> 3:21:20.960]  about you. I mean, don't you work in the whole culture of media? I mean, aren't you, don't you
[3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:25.600]  work in TV? Yeah, I'm a whore just like everyone else in the system, because I have to be to survive.
[3:21:25.600 --> 3:21:29.600]  Yes. Oh, good. Well, I just wanted to make sure. But I don't really think of it as,
[3:21:29.600 --> 3:21:36.880]  uh, no, actually, for the first six, seven years, my shopping cart, we would say $20.
[3:21:36.880 --> 3:21:41.920]  And then I went ahead and just on air said, I'm now to show you what Madison Avenue is doing.
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:45.840]  I actually have been into that, you know, have made the point a lot. And a lot of times, even
[3:21:45.840 --> 3:21:48.560]  when I plug, well, I don't even really plug the videos anymore. I never even really spend much
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:53.760]  time plugging them. But I'm not in some guilt. Hold on. I'm not in some guilt about painting,
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:21:58.560]  oil painting, I'm wanting to sell it, not because I worship a fancy car, because I want a car that
[3:21:58.560 --> 3:22:03.360]  drives well and has a good titanium cage. And if I am going to wreck my children, won't be killed.
[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:09.680]  I do like, well, actually, I don't really like nice clothes. I literally have like 50 blue and
[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:14.480]  black t-shirts and blue jeans with holes in them because I like them. But the point is,
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:22.800]  I'm not into bobbles, trinkets, things like that. But I'm not hating materialism. It's just lower
[3:22:22.800 --> 3:22:28.000]  on my hierarchy. I don't also go to the extreme of just saying basically anything materialistic
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:32.400]  is inherently bad. I mean, I need to be able to own my own house. I don't want a bunch of,
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:35.600]  you know, people in sandals, they're already here stealing farms and ranches everywhere,
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:39.600]  the phony environmentalists, just, and then they build giant skyrises on it and are all
[3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:44.320]  filthy rich with armed guards. Yeah, you know, I mean, I also see the whole left thing of,
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:49.040]  oh, it belongs to everyone. I just see that as very dangerous. Another form of tyranny.
[3:22:50.320 --> 3:22:54.880]  Well, I can see why you see that based on what you've said. And I can understand that angle. But
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:23:00.000]  I think we should look beyond these points. You see, ownership itself is based on the restriction
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:04.720]  of others. I'm not saying that people shouldn't have a home where only they are allowed to go
[3:23:04.720 --> 3:23:09.760]  into it. But this protectionist element that comes into play with ownership, property,
[3:23:09.760 --> 3:23:13.840]  it has extremely negative influences. And this is one of the central points. You can't have a
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:18.800]  system where everything is hoarded by everyone else. But Peter, you know who I am when you
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:22.720]  called up saying, I officially want to sell this now. So I want to get rights to your film.
[3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:25.200]  You know, you know, other people called up threatening you. I knew what you were doing.
[3:23:25.200 --> 3:23:29.280]  I didn't call up and threaten because I actually am not very territorial about ideas. I want them
[3:23:29.280 --> 3:23:33.040]  out. Hey, man, I'm not saying that you are. I'm saying is I really want to have an intellectual
[3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:36.480]  debate with you. I respect you think you're very talented. We're back to the full audience right
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:51.280]  now. Okay, I got some other clips as I guys to dinner. I want to play a lot of you'll be checking
[3:23:51.280 --> 3:23:55.840]  it out. Most of you probably seen it. I would challenge folks from the zeitgeist crowd to
[3:23:55.840 --> 3:24:00.880]  which which I respect and enjoy and think are great. But I also like to argue with people
[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:04.320]  and I am competitive. I can't help it. I was conditioned that way. And I think a little bit
[3:24:04.320 --> 3:24:11.040]  of it's the genetics. But I mean, in the short segment, if you say whatever you basically other
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:14.560]  points you want to make, then I want to play some clips and go through those with you in the next
[3:24:14.560 --> 3:24:21.600]  segment, sir. Okay, well, I can only continue to reiterate my central point, which I don't think
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:27.280]  has been fully absorbed. And I think everyone listening should seriously consider the reality
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:32.640]  that human conditioning is the central point. Now, I will jump to the fact that this society
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:40.240]  that we're talking about can work if people begin to understand what the central elements of it are
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:45.600]  and how universal these elements are based on the carrying capacity of the earth. This is not
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:50.160]  some fantastic notion. It's not something that's not some utopia that someone's inventing. It's
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:56.240]  not subjective. We want to remove subjectivity and opinion from society to the extent where
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:25:01.200]  everything is created systematically. Every system that works in society is derived from a
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:05.120]  concrete foundation based on the available knowledge, the highest form of available
[3:25:05.120 --> 3:25:09.360]  knowledge and technology that we have today. This will never occur in a profit system ever
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:14.160]  because it's based on scarcity and reduction and inefficiency, planned obsolescence.
[3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:18.240]  We are totally paralyzed. People have no idea how free we could actually be if we allow the
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:22.800]  fruits of technology to flourish. And then the human value system will undergo incredible change.
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:27.840]  Will it eradicate all types of aberrant behavior? No, probably not. At least not in any kind of
[3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:32.960]  quick time frame whatsoever. However, the pattern and the path is extremely clear.
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:38.560]  Prisons, police, we buy. These are horrific. We think these are true institutions. We want
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:41.760]  to, if someone does something, they want to throw them in prison. This is the wrong thing. We want
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:45.680]  to figure out why they did what they did and address the social conditions that create that
[3:25:45.680 --> 3:25:50.880]  environment. Our entire society is completely backwards. We can't function this way and that
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:56.400]  is the central core of my thesis and what I want people to think about. Human behavior is
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:02.080]  influenced to a very, very large extent. And this human behavior is the source of the problem.
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:07.520]  The new world order will not change until you address the people that are at the very bottom
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:11.200]  and why they believe what they do. Oh, I agree. I say every day, a lot of the problems are, you
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:15.440]  know, it's all of us individually. Look in the mirror if you want to know the bottom line problem
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:21.280]  and the bottom line solution. Absolutely. The battle is with yourself. I mean, Alex,
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:26.400]  your whole website is called info wars. And I have to say, you know, I understand where you're
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:30.960]  coming from because there is a battle going on. And it's important that people stand up for themselves.
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:35.600]  But this is not an end disposition. There's a reason why peace protesters are met with guys
[3:26:35.600 --> 3:26:39.840]  and riot gear and automatic weapons because they're waiting for something. They want to perpetuate
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:43.440]  the war system. They want the us against them mentality to flourish because that's how they
[3:26:43.440 --> 3:26:47.360]  main control. Yeah, the teams, they use the sports teams and all those images to always
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:52.000]  balkanize us and divide us. Where do you stand on the second amendment? There's always going to be
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:56.320]  bad people that want to hurt good people. Don't aren't I allowed to have guns? It is not a matter
[3:26:56.320 --> 3:26:59.680]  of allowed to have guns. Is it necessary? And that's the thing. I disagree with you. But who's
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:04.960]  going to decide if it's necessary because I assure you if there's a need to manufacture a gun, it
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:11.440]  could happen. However, you're missing the point. You're trying to achieve a system that doesn't
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:16.960]  have stratification and control. We live in such a stratified control mechanism. There's a lead
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:23.280]  in every... Who is going to enforce no one having guns, man? There's no enforcement. It's based on
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:28.720]  the understanding and education of what this planet is, who you actually are. This is why I go after
[3:27:28.720 --> 3:27:35.680]  religion because religion is the biggest, most offensive, stagnating element, systematic institution
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:41.200]  that there is. You cannot have a whole group of people believing in something that stops their
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:45.040]  intellectual growth. Does that mean they need to be eradicated? Of course not. They need to be
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:49.840]  educated. Education in our society is completely irrelevant. The idiotic, you get an A if you're
[3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:54.400]  smart, so to speak, an F if you fail, that imposes immediate stratification, immediate
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:59.840]  competition. The fact is, educational system is a complete joke because they don't take into account
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:06.160]  the nature of each individual person. True thought is true education is critical thought
[3:28:06.160 --> 3:28:10.720]  processes, not retaining information. Well, I agree. Learning how to think and learning the
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:14.080]  joys of it, but wait a minute. We've heard all of this stuff about getting rid of test scores,
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:18.080]  getting rid of that, and it's actually had disastrous effects where it's been tried.
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:21.760]  I mean... Sure. That's because people aren't prepared for it. They're not ready for it,
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:24.960]  and this is something that I want to reiterate again. No one's ready for this. If you took
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:30.800]  somebody right now and froze them in ice, and you had them re-thought out and rejuvenated
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:36.560]  a thousand years from now in, say, a resource-based economy, they would be completely obsolete.
[3:28:36.560 --> 3:28:40.720]  They would not know what to do. Their value systems would be... Their conditioning would be
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:45.360]  absolutely obtuse. Most likely, they wouldn't work. In other words, they'd probably kill
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:48.720]  themselves, or they'd do something extremely defensive, and then something would have to
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:53.760]  happen. This is a value system issue. What would have to happen? Something would have to happen
[3:28:53.760 --> 3:28:57.440]  where the person would be reconditioned in some way. That's just the point. Re-educated?
[3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:03.520]  The point is, the value systems are too... I've heard all this before. That's the problem,
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:07.600]  Peter, Joseph. Peter, I've heard all this before. What do you mean you've heard it all before?
[3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:10.320]  I mean, I've heard all this stuff you're saying before, and let me tell you,
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:16.960]  it isn't pretty. I mean, re-educated, reconditioned. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Look out. We're going to skip
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:22.720]  this break, too, on the Internet. Peter, again...
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:23.920]  How is that a context? You know it.
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:29.040]  I mean, are you for gun control right now? Are you for me not being able to own guns
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:32.880]  right now? Is that perpetual? I don't have an opinion on gun control because it's such a
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:37.600]  base disposition. It's based on the assumption that you always have to fight and defend yourself,
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:41.200]  and that is what has to be elevated. Well, I'm still dealing in the world I'm in. I'm trying
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:46.240]  to be able to think. I want people to identify the system and learn the system and learn how
[3:29:46.240 --> 3:29:51.440]  they're being manipulated, and then they can, in a true free society, make decisions through
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:55.920]  that and then better ideas, better systems, will come to the fore and then become dominant if we
[3:29:55.920 --> 3:30:01.040]  didn't have this overarching crime syndicate, and we were able to educate the public not to reform it.
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:07.360]  Sure. Yes. In the interim, yes. You have to have protection element. This is a system based on
[3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:10.720]  differential advantage. You have to protect yourself. That's what the system...
[3:30:10.720 --> 3:30:14.560]  And the government has more power. The global corrupt corporations are arming themselves
[3:30:14.560 --> 3:30:18.720]  against us. So in this paradigm, I'm in. I need to be able to defend myself.
[3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:23.200]  I never said that you didn't have to. I didn't say you did. I was saying what I thought.
[3:30:23.760 --> 3:30:29.680]  Yes, of course. Absolutely. This is the distortion that we currently live in. This system will
[3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:34.400]  continue to perpetuate itself until root causes are addressed. Things like tasers. You're sitting
[3:30:34.400 --> 3:30:38.240]  there battling these tiny little things, which is good. I think it's great that you go after and
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:42.720]  you report and you expose all these little things. We'll cover it all though. They're never, ever
[3:30:42.720 --> 3:30:49.120]  going to stop until we adjust the society itself and the environment. Well, actually, we've called
[3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:53.200]  in Austin and San Antonio and Dallas to ban them, and now they're restricting them all over the
[3:30:53.200 --> 3:30:57.120]  country and restricting them. The San Antonio police chief just said they're going to take
[3:30:57.120 --> 3:31:00.800]  a lot of them away and restrict their use, and so they're being curtailed. Well, that's good.
[3:31:00.800 --> 3:31:03.840]  But I mean, in general, there's always going to be new things that are going to come out.
[3:31:03.840 --> 3:31:06.800]  There's always going to be... Well, here's an example. Bush said we couldn't protest
[3:31:06.800 --> 3:31:10.640]  eight years ago, seven years ago. They lost a bunch of lawsuits. We fought it. Now they're
[3:31:10.640 --> 3:31:15.280]  backing off the free speech zones in a lot of areas. Yes, sure. So, as I said... But I'm not
[3:31:15.280 --> 3:31:20.080]  battling little things. I mean, this is four-hour radio show. We're covering it all. We bring a
[3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:24.800]  lot of... Yes, I'm saying that it's the larger scheme elements that we have to be concerned with.
[3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:29.280]  We can continue to deal with this and resolve certain things, exposing 9-11. I'm for all of
[3:31:29.280 --> 3:31:33.280]  this. You're not going to have the material for any type of society you're talking about,
[3:31:33.280 --> 3:31:38.880]  and I agree with a lot of it, without having a generally enlightened public and the mainstream
[3:31:38.880 --> 3:31:46.640]  media's not doing that. So, I'm trying in my own little way. Of course. And I'm agreeing with you,
[3:31:46.640 --> 3:31:51.600]  Alex. The mainstream media is conditioning people to support the establishment. Everyone's been
[3:31:51.600 --> 3:31:56.560]  brainwashed in this system from top to bottom to support the establishment, and that's what
[3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:01.360]  has to change. The change has to begin initially inside, and then we have to adjust the environment
[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:05.840]  to support that change. And until that happens, my point is that it's just going to keep happening.
[3:32:05.840 --> 3:32:08.960]  There's going to be something else to replace it. There's going to be another free speech tone.
[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:13.200]  Well, I have some little two and three minutes. Well, I agree. The evil, the corrupt system,
[3:32:13.200 --> 3:32:19.840]  continues to generate always more and more of the bad things we're talking about. We're going back
[3:32:19.840 --> 3:32:24.080]  live right now. We've only got about 27 minutes left, and I've got some two and three minute
[3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:28.320]  clips I want to play and then have you comment on them. I think there's four of them when we
[3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:32.560]  come back. So, let's try to play those. Then tell folks about your website and how they can buy a
[3:32:32.560 --> 3:32:37.360]  video. Here we go.
[3:32:49.600 --> 3:32:53.360]  This song is about being self-sufficient, living on your own property.
[3:32:55.680 --> 3:33:00.960]  I believe decentralization is the key. We need more Americans to move to the countryside
[3:33:00.960 --> 3:33:06.960]  to become organic farmers, to create communities where they trade and barter together.
[3:33:09.280 --> 3:33:15.040]  You know, not big, huge, expansive thoughts that I think are important, but also the little
[3:33:15.040 --> 3:33:19.760]  thoughts, the little things that lead in a journey to something better.
[3:33:26.880 --> 3:33:30.000]  But now you can't because they're shutting down the farms and ranches under the falling
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:37.680]  environmental rules. There are too many things these old boys can't do.
[3:33:39.040 --> 3:33:46.000]  All right, we are back live with the creator of Zeitgeist, very talented TV editor and producer,
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:52.880]  Peter Joseph. And working in the corrupt new world order system as we all work in it in some way
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:57.120]  or another, he decided to go out and put it out free on the internet. Zeitgeist, but I do think
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:34:01.200]  he should be supported. All alternative films should be. I think you should, while we're still in
[3:34:01.200 --> 3:34:12.560]  this system, buy his DVD. Unless I'm committing a sin here, how do we buy your DVD, Zeitgeist and
[3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:18.000]  Zeitgeist Addendum? No, there's no sin committed. You can get five bucks from zeitgeistmovie.com.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:23.680]  I'm going to have the full disc downloadable in a torrent and high resolution, full resolution
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:28.320]  within a day or two, so you can get the whole thing downloaded and burn itself. Okay, fantastic.
[3:34:28.320 --> 3:34:31.920]  Let me start getting into these clips or we'll run out of time. And I want to have you back again
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:37.760]  if you'd grace us to take phone calls in the next month or so. And overall, this will be positive
[3:34:37.760 --> 3:34:42.080]  because it's been an enlightening discussion. And I said mean things. I didn't mean to be
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:48.880]  taken mainly. I'm just aggressive, conditioned, warmock. Let's go ahead and I'm a good guy.
[3:34:48.880 --> 3:34:52.800]  That's good that I'm warlike fighting the evil, isn't it? Because we were all passive. We'd be
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:57.840]  defeated. But I guess again, that's my condition. I thought it was my genetics, but I think it's
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:01.840]  both. Let's play a clip from near the first of Zeitgeist Addendum. That's Zeitgeist too,
[3:35:01.840 --> 3:35:09.200]  I guess for lack of a better word. And this is on money and some other issues like the family. Here it is.
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:19.040]  In a world where 1% of the population owns 40% of the planet's wealth, in a world where 34,000
[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:26.000]  children die every single day from poverty and preventable diseases, and where 50% of the world's
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:33.440]  population lives on less than $2 a day, one thing is clear. Something is very wrong.
[3:35:34.640 --> 3:35:39.520]  And whether we are aware of it or not, the lifeblood of all of our established institutions
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:46.640]  and thus society itself is money. Therefore, understanding this institution of monetary
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:53.600]  policy is critical to understanding why our lives are the way they are. Unfortunately, economics
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:35:58.960]  is often viewed with confusion and boredom. Endless streams of financial jargon coupled with
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:04.720]  intimidating mathematics quickly deters people from attempts at understanding it. However,
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:11.520]  the fact is, the complexity associated with the financial system is a mere mask designed to conceal
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:16.800]  one of the most socially paralyzing structures humanity has ever endured.
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:23.920]  A number of years ago, the Central Bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve,
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:30.640]  produced a document entitled Modern Money Mechanics. This publication detailed the institutionalized
[3:36:30.640 --> 3:36:33.840]  practice of monetary creation. Okay, that's enough. I mean, that's invaluable information,
[3:36:33.840 --> 3:36:39.920]  and he goes through the facts. But just say that these private cartels that sit above the
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:46.800]  entire world economy, that this fraud is free market. Free market is, I raise a bunch of pigs
[3:36:46.800 --> 3:36:51.760]  and go and trade them for a bunch of corn to feed more of my pigs, or I'm a gunsmith and I fix
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:57.840]  somebody's rifle for them, and they give me a little gold piece or a silver piece. So I just
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:03.040]  think that compared to all the other systems man's tried to create, I don't think it's fair to call
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:08.800]  this a free market. What we have is private central banking families coming in, getting control of
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:14.800]  government, and then using that as an engine to expand their control through empire, and it's a
[3:37:14.800 --> 3:37:19.200]  totally unfair system. So I mean, they are the only ones that can create the symbols that are
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:24.400]  seen as wealth, and it's just a complete fraud. But I mean, what's wrong with having a government
[3:37:24.400 --> 3:37:28.880]  issued currency that is controlled, and that can be expanded or contracted, but having public
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:34.640]  education debate about it, so that we can grease the skids of interaction, commerce.
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:40.480]  Well, sure. I would say that the corruption, of course, is extremely prevalent, but the difference
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:43.920]  between what I would argue and what you would argue is probably the fact that the corruption
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:50.000]  you're seeing now is in fact created by the system itself. It's simply a matter of time,
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:56.080]  because the entire monetary system is based on differential advantage. See, maybe in the early,
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:01.120]  early, early days, where you actually bartered for something else, there's less likely to be
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:06.640]  corruption. Now, insider trading, you know, the general manipulation, planned obsolescence,
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:12.000]  this is a different world with strategies for profit that do not give a sh... a damn about
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:18.880]  humans at all. The human value is second to monetary gain, rampantly. You can see this
[3:38:18.880 --> 3:38:22.480]  everywhere. But how do we even get the public to recognize the Federal Reserve's private
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:26.800]  and is a fraud? Well, through great films like yours and the Money Masters that we have available,
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:32.320]  by the way, at infoworks.com. Three-hour film on the subject to really get deep into it. I mean,
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:36.640]  I mean, you know, of course, that's why I have it in there. My point, though, is that you have to
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:40.640]  look at the psychological ramifications of the monetary system. You can't, you can't have the
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:44.480]  system. It's not going to work. The corruption you see, like, for example, Ed Griffin put out this
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:49.360]  extremely projected review of my film, and he states outright that the free enterprise system
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:52.960]  is great if it was allowed to work. Well, there's no such thing as the free enterprise system. It
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:57.440]  never, it never existed. It's never going to exist. We have different stratifications. But when we
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:03.840]  see, when we see it partially existing or in its pure form, it does create the greatest amount of
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:09.040]  goods and services and homes and food and medicine for the citizenry. Actually, no. No, actually,
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:12.960]  resource management and technology creates these things along with human ingenuity. Oh, really?
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:19.280]  Cuba's had resource management? Cuba, is that what you said? Yeah, Cuba's gone, gone, more of
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:23.200]  any Soviet or communist thing? Yeah, they still have money. They still have the same type of
[3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:28.560]  labor system the rest of the world has. This corruption is just, is just, the cartels, everything
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:33.200]  is a matter of time. Monopoly is a matter of time in this system. This is age old, it's been talked
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:37.280]  about forever and ever. People don't think about it much anymore, but it's just a matter of time
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:41.920]  before what I want to do as the world government is world monopoly. You're going to have things,
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:47.280]  I mean, Walmart is a natural culmination. So people think Walmart is some kind of, you know,
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:51.120]  infringing thing that goes into a small town and hurts all the locals. No, it's the more extreme
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:57.600]  expression of the parasite. But see, it's not free market. It's using slave goods in select
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:02.880]  government deals to come in and displace the free market. And so the public became decadent
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:08.720]  and corrupt and wanted the cheap goods. So they bought into the slavery. So really, Walmart is
[3:40:08.720 --> 3:40:15.280]  slavery, just like prisons are slavery. All labor systems are slavery. Just because any,
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:18.480]  how many American corporations do you think are free market? How many of them outsourced?
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:22.400]  They're not slavery. If people get shares in it, if people get stock,
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:25.360]  it's through the brand name, it's known that it can be trusted. Let's play clip two.
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:28.240]  Let's do a clip two. Here it is from Zeitgeist.
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:33.920]  And so if a man makes money selling a certain product, naturally he's going to fight
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:38.480]  the existence of another product that may threaten his institution.
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:47.200]  Therefore, people cannot be fair and people do not trust each other. A guy will come over to
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:52.480]  you and say, I got just the house you're looking for. He's a salesman. When a doctor says, I think
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:58.880]  your kidney has to come out, I don't know if he's trying to pay off a yacht or my kidney has to come
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:05.040]  out. It's hard in a monetary system to trust people. Stop there for a second. That's human
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:10.400]  corruption. That is people who only care about themselves. It's an inner thing and that's why
[3:41:10.400 --> 3:41:14.720]  because you can't trust that and never will be able to, you need to not be so lazy folks and go
[3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:21.440]  off references or reviews from reviewers you trust for a movie or for a car or for a website
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:26.480]  or for a film. You know, it takes not being intellectually, individually lazy and we've
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:32.400]  been seduced by Madison Avenue into this, but to then just say that, well, finish the clip
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:37.760]  and we'll go back and get our guest comment on it, the makers comments people. If you came into
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:42.800]  my store and I said, this lamp that I've got is pretty good, but the lamp of the next door is
[3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:48.800]  much better. I wouldn't be in business very long. It wouldn't work. If I were ethical, it wouldn't
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:56.720]  work. So when you say industry cares for people, that's not true. They can't afford to be ethical.
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:42:02.880]  So your system is not designed to serve the wellbeing of people. If you still don't understand
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:08.880]  that, there would be no outsourcing of jobs if they cared about people. Okay, let's stop there.
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:14.400]  We had the US government and the Chinese government 30 years ago make a deal to selectively allow them
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:20.800]  to have select cadres of corporations, make goods, sell poisonous food, do all of it. The public
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:25.520]  was brainwashed to basically accept it, but take Ted Anderson who owns minus resources that sells
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:31.040]  gold and silver. He told me the other day, he said, yeah, I called up. This is all fair stuff.
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:39.440]  We don't much be saying it and wanted to buy maple leaves from me and Ted said, listen, I didn't get
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:45.280]  a very good deal on these. You really ought to just buy some silver and I've got a guy that got
[3:42:45.280 --> 3:42:50.720]  some silver and he just gave the guy the number to call it and the guy was so happy that he got
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:56.400]  such a good deal. He called back and bought a bunch more gold of a different type. And then Ted,
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:01.600]  because he gives business to other brokers, he knows just being nice. Ted, then when nobody else
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:07.120]  can get gold and silver, these big brokers are selling to him because they, they, they, and that,
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:13.440]  that's not a good old boy network. That's guys, that's Ted wants a good name. Ted wants to be
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:18.240]  trusted and he is now. So he's doing very well. You see what I'm saying?
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:23.440]  Yeah, of course. Well, that's, that's of course going to occur. There's not every single instance
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:27.440]  is going to be people looking for the self preservation at that particular moment. However,
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:31.680]  if Ted was pushed into a corner with elaborate competition for another company that was very,
[3:43:31.680 --> 3:43:35.760]  very competitive against his pricing structure, you would see him behave very, very differently.
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:39.840]  If his livelihood is put in jeopardy, he is going to manipulate his environment to get what he
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:46.320]  knows. Ted almost went out of business five years ago and he still, you know, did it all the right
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:50.800]  way and came through it and did better than ever. And I think it's that acquiescence that we're just
[3:43:50.800 --> 3:43:54.320]  these, you know, you know, you know, these people programmed by society. I mean, that, that there
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:43:58.400]  are good businesses. There are good people. Sure. There are people you can trust.
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:05.600]  It's all based on manipulation advantage and it's based on humans taking advantage and chiseling
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:11.280]  off of one another. That's what humans do. Bad people do that. Good people have to fight them.
[3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:18.240]  That's what this system creates. That's what we are. Listen, humans made this system. This is what
[3:44:18.240 --> 3:44:24.960]  we do. Now, this is a product of evolution, the product of, we free market system had its
[3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:28.880]  corruption at the very beginning and it worked for certain degree. Now it's time to move forward.
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:32.880]  Well, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. We need to work on resource management,
[3:44:32.880 --> 3:44:37.440]  work with the resources, not the middle elements of money and labor. I agree with you on that.
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:41.760]  But before we run out of time, here's an example. You know, we only see a limited part of the light
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:46.960]  spectrum. The science has shown all these other dimensions. Who knows what lives on other planets?
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:52.160]  I mean, the point is we have very limited views. You know, what we know today is would be total
[3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:57.200]  magic 100 years ago or 1000 years ago. I mean, how can you just say, I mean, I'm certainly
[3:44:57.200 --> 3:45:01.920]  religions build a box around it and create priests and get power from it. But, but I mean, you know,
[3:45:01.920 --> 3:45:08.000]  other experiences, you know, the mind within the soul, you don't believe we have a soul.
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:13.360]  So based on a traditional definition, I mean, how do you know there isn't more? I mean, how do
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:17.760]  you know you can if you find a whole group of people dancing around the tree, they call the
[3:45:17.760 --> 3:45:22.080]  boo boo tree and they sit there and say that this tree has all the power that controls everything.
[3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:27.200]  I can't disprove that. I can't disprove it. However, I hold it as extremely
[3:45:27.200 --> 3:45:33.760]  important. I'm saying it's a human idea that is central to who we are. And and that and that
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:40.640]  religion alchemy is what developed the sciences and it's humans knowing there's more humans pushing
[3:45:40.640 --> 3:45:47.440]  the envelope reaching out into other dimensions. And then it manifests through ridiculous boo boo
[3:45:47.440 --> 3:45:54.000]  trees. And but but but I mean, just to disdainfully, I mean, there's all sorts of good things that come
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:58.560]  out of religion. You know, slavery, you could argue transatlantic was started by people misinterpreting
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:02.320]  the Bible. But then it was people interpreting the Bible, who then got slavery banned.
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:08.400]  Yes. So what I'm talking about religion as an institution, this is an arbitrary institution.
[3:46:08.400 --> 3:46:12.480]  It's pushed upon you, I guarantee you, but your million dollars, your parents were Christian.
[3:46:12.480 --> 3:46:16.800]  You know, this is an environmental distinction. If you were born again, you say religion is
[3:46:16.800 --> 3:46:20.080]  Christ and everything is very important to you. Well, guess what? You're born in the Middle East,
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:23.600]  you have a totally different value system, probably have no relationship to Christ.
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:27.280]  Well, at least it's about 25% Christian, actually. Well, you know what I'm saying,
[3:46:27.280 --> 3:46:32.240]  if you were born in Arabic family, dominant religion of the area, this is this is the reality.
[3:46:32.240 --> 3:46:37.840]  We are let me say this, that's actually a in a way, it's a healthy firewall, because there's new
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:42.720]  ideas, which are normally old as well, nothing going to the sun, repackage, which are damaging to
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:47.040]  the family. I think the Arabs saying we hate your television and your corruptness and your
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:51.360]  destruction. And obviously, they suppress women in their own way, and men as well. But you know,
[3:46:51.360 --> 3:46:55.200]  we don't want to turn our girls into little whores. We don't want to use your drugs.
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:47:00.080]  We see your TV and we call that the Great Satan. I mean, in a way that has allowed them to keep
[3:47:00.080 --> 3:47:05.840]  them cells from being dominated by the West. These cultural things we have, also have a
[3:47:05.840 --> 3:47:10.480]  defensive measure. I'm not saying it's overall positive. I'm saying it has that element. It's
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:15.680]  there in development. I totally agree. I happen to personally believe in many of the things that
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:20.640]  the Christ character has stated. But you know what? I mean, what kind of competition did Christ
[3:47:20.640 --> 3:47:25.520]  have? Do you think Christ had guns if he had the option? I mean, this is called by a sword.
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:28.640]  There's a true, yeah, exactly. But still, you know, if you really look at his teaching,
[3:47:28.640 --> 3:47:32.560]  this is a hybrid character. There's numerous nuances that are going on here that are in
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:36.080]  dichotomy. But this, what I'm talking about... Are you saying he didn't even exist, even though
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:40.000]  the Roman historians and the Jewish historians, you're saying... There are many more Roman
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:44.480]  historians that have no record of him than there are that say he actually did. There's maybe four,
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:47.280]  and they have one line. Well, there weren't even... We're not going to go into this debate. I've already
[3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:51.360]  gone through this a thousand times. It's on the website. Well, you did change some stuff in your
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:55.040]  first edition of your first one. I mean, you did get a few of those gods and things wrong. I mean,
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:48:00.240]  you're not infallible either. Of course not. I never said I was. I do my research as best as I
[3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:06.080]  can. I present what I learned. And this is how we grow as a society. And religion itself rejects
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:09.680]  this type of education. Well, here's the deal. Christians see this New World Order system
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:13.920]  attacking their religion. And let me tell you, whether you believe it or not, the New World Order,
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:18.400]  by and large, are Satanists. I mean, they worship death and destruction and me, me, me, me, me,
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:22.880]  which is the Madison Avenue God. I mean, certainly you're not ignorant. You know
[3:48:22.880 --> 3:48:27.280]  that there is an occult empire. I'm well aware of it, but I don't recognize it with any type of
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:30.560]  interest because it's no different than anything else. Of course, you're going to have these
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:34.160]  divisionary aspects. I know about the Bohemian Grove. I'm very familiar with all of this. I know
[3:48:34.160 --> 3:48:38.880]  about the occult orders that existed for a long time. They're just a bunch of little clubs jockeying
[3:48:38.880 --> 3:48:44.000]  for their own ideological and personal power, age-old type of thing. But they are all a product
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:47.360]  of their conditioning. I'm going to keep reiterating this. And I want everybody out there to go to
[3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:52.800]  thevenusproject.com, to go to the zeitgeistmovement.com, and to think about these ideas and to realize
[3:48:52.800 --> 3:48:56.560]  that out of all the things we talked about, Alex and I, the most important is to realize
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:49:01.280]  why people behave the way they do. And I argue that it is not genetics. It is behaviorism based
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:04.640]  on conditioning. And that is the most important element. Well, I think that's something that's
[3:49:04.640 --> 3:49:09.680]  definitely, that's definitely half of it. We're going to go to break here. Let's go and start
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:17.920]  playing clip number three. War, poverty, corruption, hunger, misery, human suffering will not change
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:23.840]  in a monetary system. That is, there'll be very little significant change. It's going to take
[3:49:23.840 --> 3:49:30.880]  the redesign of our culture, our values, and it has to be related to the carrying capacity of the
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:36.000]  earth, not some human opinion or some policy. Stop there. I'll play the rest after the break.
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:41.120]  Let me ask you this question. Who does the redesign and who decides the carrying capacity
[3:49:41.120 --> 3:49:44.160]  of the earth? Because the New World Order is going to use a false environmental carrying
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:48.720]  capacity to tax breathing everything. I mean, you're talking hardcore tyranny.
[3:49:49.440 --> 3:49:53.760]  Well, I'm not interested in the New World Order. They have no position in this type of structure.
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:56.880]  You can always say there's going to be people that try to mess things up. As I said before,
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:50:01.040]  the carrying capacity of the earth is just that, the carrying capacity of the earth. Oh, really?
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:04.880]  How do you assess that? How do you assess that? You look at everything that the planet has,
[3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:07.600]  you look at the systems that are in operation, just like you would a plot of land to figure out
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:11.520]  what's capable. Do you believe in global warming? Do you believe global warming is man-made and bad?
[3:50:12.160 --> 3:50:15.920]  I have no opinion on global warming. I've never seen evidence definitively in any of this type.
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:19.920]  It's total crap. They use it for their own advantage. I don't appreciate that.
[3:50:21.440 --> 3:50:25.600]  UN, it's a big joke with these guys. That's irrelevant to this conversation. What I'm talking
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:29.440]  about is the system has... We're skipping this break. Stay there. It's to start over. Go ahead.
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:31.200]  All right. We're now just on the web. Go ahead.
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:35.760]  Parameters of the system are self-evident, and this is something that people have to learn
[3:50:35.760 --> 3:50:39.520]  about through Jacques's research to understand what he's talking about, because it's extremely
[3:50:39.520 --> 3:50:44.320]  foreign to what most people tend to understand and be conditioned to believe. We have the ability
[3:50:44.320 --> 3:50:48.720]  to harness a structure that is universal and near-universal based on our understanding,
[3:50:48.720 --> 3:50:53.040]  and everything else will culminate because of this. We live in such a distorted society
[3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:58.160]  that these opinions and these biases and these religions and these ideologies are so pervasive
[3:50:58.160 --> 3:51:03.040]  that no one has any idea what to believe. The fact is, you break it all down. We need food.
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:06.640]  We need air. We need water. We need the resources of the planet. Simultaneously,
[3:51:06.640 --> 3:51:11.200]  we need to realize that technology is our savior and always has been. We just don't give it that
[3:51:11.200 --> 3:51:16.080]  name. We don't recognize it as such. As Carl Sagan used to say, we love the gifts of technology,
[3:51:16.080 --> 3:51:21.600]  but we reject its methods. And with time, we utilize the methods and have a world based on
[3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:26.800]  what we understand, not superstitions and projections and age old traditions that are no longer
[3:51:26.800 --> 3:51:32.320]  needed or outmoded and irrelevant. The decision-making process again, I can't go into the exact
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:37.440]  details because it's a bottom-up capacity type thing. You relate to it. You build upon it.
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:40.720]  The conditions become self-evident, and that's what you need to understand. If you've ever
[3:51:40.720 --> 3:51:45.920]  researched the scientific method, you'll see that when you build something, all the conditions become
[3:51:45.920 --> 3:51:50.560]  apparent as you work. And this is the most important point. It's an empirical understanding
[3:51:50.560 --> 3:51:53.600]  based on the natural carrying capacity of the earth.
[3:51:53.600 --> 3:51:59.920]  Yeah, it's just humans want to differentiate. Humans want to be individual. And that's not an
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:07.600]  evil thing. Well, I mean, can you imagine saying that you're going to build this world when humans
[3:52:07.600 --> 3:52:12.080]  do the same thing over and over again instead of acknowledging that we do have faults and do have
[3:52:12.080 --> 3:52:19.600]  problems and trying to teach people to stand up for themselves and go after corrupt systems?
[3:52:19.600 --> 3:52:25.200]  I'm just trying to have us survive and do that first. And then I always hear the establishment
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:31.440]  talking about pie in the sky. I mean, so much of what you said we heard from the New World Order
[3:52:31.440 --> 3:52:37.040]  engineers, and they've built a top-down scientific society. They've used the scientific method.
[3:52:37.040 --> 3:52:41.120]  You and your guest in the film, your presenters, I mean, they keep saying over and over again,
[3:52:41.120 --> 3:52:46.400]  the elite know nothing. They understand nothing. They don't see it. No, there's a bunch of clips
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:50.880]  where, where are you saying in the film, it's not said that these politicians can't have solutions
[3:52:50.880 --> 3:52:54.400]  because they don't understand the system. And you know, these are what we're speaking about
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:58.960]  politicians themselves, you know, the elite, look, they call it a scientific dictatorship.
[3:52:58.960 --> 3:53:04.160]  They say we're cold bloodedly, scientifically setting up a hyper dominant system over the
[3:53:04.160 --> 3:53:11.120]  population of the planet. I mean, they are saying that they are I know I'm saying that your information
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:15.120]  is going to go out and it's going to be latched on to this happens to me as well. I'm just saying,
[3:53:15.120 --> 3:53:21.600]  and then spun off into a hard hybrid. No, well, this is one of those things that you have to
[3:53:21.600 --> 3:53:25.920]  to defend against to a certain extent when you're dealing with misinformation and ideologies that
[3:53:25.920 --> 3:53:30.720]  are misinterpreted. This is, you know, to talk about this is really futile. It's good to recognize
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:37.040]  it, but this system has a universal implication. It's a natural progression. The final, final
[3:53:37.040 --> 3:53:44.800]  segment. Here we go. Final segment. You're saying it's a natural progression for this system to
[3:53:44.800 --> 3:53:50.320]  fall apart, to destroy and then to be rebuilt. And then you're saying the system you're talking
[3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:56.400]  about, are you saying that's a natural progression to move into this resource based system?
[3:53:57.040 --> 3:54:02.160]  Yes, absolutely. Because we've finally realized with our technological understanding that resources
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:06.800]  can be utilized in a way that does not require scarcity. We can have a world of abundance.
[3:54:06.800 --> 3:54:10.640]  I mean, an abundance. I don't have time to break it down right now, obviously,
[3:54:10.640 --> 3:54:15.680]  but you used to realize the multiplicity of things. No, I understand it. The New World Order knows
[3:54:15.680 --> 3:54:20.400]  we can have that and they're doing and they're setting up a world. They say it. They're setting
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:27.040]  up a world tyranny to block us from developing that. I'm not talking about fighting the New World
[3:54:27.040 --> 3:54:30.960]  Order. I'm talking about true. Are you saying that they don't know because over and over again,
[3:54:30.960 --> 3:54:34.880]  the film, it said that they don't understand. They don't know. No, they do know that this is
[3:54:34.880 --> 3:54:40.400]  possible and their New World Order will take on many of the things you're saying, but only to get
[3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:44.960]  their dominance in to block things that empower the individual in the community.
[3:54:45.520 --> 3:54:49.680]  Oh, fine. But nevertheless, their tool is money. If you want to see the New World Order stop,
[3:54:49.680 --> 3:54:52.960]  you've got to get rid of money. They're not going to have anything else at that point.
[3:54:52.960 --> 3:54:58.560]  They're such a small elite. They can't even compare to the power of a group identification
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:02.080]  with the new social system. They have nothing. The next thing that we have to go after are the
[3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:05.520]  military and the police and get them converted because without them, the New World Order can't
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:10.960]  do anything. Have you seen the H.C. Wells film? Have you seen the H.C. Wells film? Thanks to come.
[3:55:10.960 --> 3:55:14.880]  Not many years. Well, I mean, it's a lot of what you're saying. Let's go ahead and play a clip from
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:22.400]  that. Big sigh there. I mean, let's play that H.C. Wells clip. Thanks to come, John. Do you have it?
[3:55:22.400 --> 3:55:26.160]  Who are all of the left of the old engineers and mechanics have paged ourselves to salvage the
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:31.040]  world. We have the airways, all that's left of them. We have the seas, and we have ideas and
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:36.960]  common, the brotherhood of efficiency, the freemasonry of science. This is how I conceive
[3:55:36.960 --> 3:55:42.640]  our plan of operations. First, to round up a brigade at last dismal vestige of ancient
[3:55:42.640 --> 3:55:51.360]  predatory soldiers. The last would be conquerors, then settle, organize, advance. This zone,
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:58.880]  then that. And at last, wings over the world. And the New World begins. And then the film goes on.
[3:55:58.880 --> 3:56:02.720]  They go and round up all the evil capitalists. But you're saying that's not what you're saying.
[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:08.400]  Obviously not, Alex. That says no relevance to anything that I've said. And if you look at
[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:12.880]  the research that we've done, that the Venus Project is about, there's no relevance to that
[3:56:12.880 --> 3:56:18.160]  whatsoever. There's absolutely no opposition to anything. There is a train of thought that is
[3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:21.600]  given in education to people and they can take it or leave it. And I'm of the mind,
[3:56:21.600 --> 3:56:25.520]  I think once people recognize this direction, the New World Order, the elitist, the globalist,
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:30.080]  would not only not have a chance, they will falter and join. And they won't do so because
[3:56:30.080 --> 3:56:35.600]  of their own, you know, their own need to try to corrupt the system. People are people. People
[3:56:35.600 --> 3:56:39.280]  are part of the conditioning and they want to see themselves live in a capacity which is
[3:56:39.280 --> 3:56:43.600]  beneficial to them at their very core. If they've been conditioned into pure corruption,
[3:56:43.600 --> 3:56:45.840]  then that's their conditioning. They will perpetuate that as long as-
[3:56:45.840 --> 3:56:50.240]  Well, I agree to that. I mean, I agree with you on a great extent with what you're saying about
[3:56:50.240 --> 3:56:54.160]  that. And then if we build it, they will come. You know, that if people see an alternative
[3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:58.080]  throughout the system, they will join it. I'm just saying, you're going to find human nature,
[3:56:58.720 --> 3:57:03.680]  whatever its cause is, always there. And anybody that tries to override that,
[3:57:03.680 --> 3:57:07.520]  that will just create a new tyranny, try to stop it. But overall, I think what you're doing
[3:57:07.520 --> 3:57:14.160]  gets people thinking. And that's an important thing. So Peter Joseph, fire out your websites again.
[3:57:15.280 --> 3:57:20.480]  There's zeitgeistmovie.com. That's the central site for Zeitgeist Project. There's
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:25.040]  the zeitgeistmovement.com, which we have about 30,000 people joining in about four days,
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:28.720]  which has been very present. And you're going to have the Z movement too, Z-Day.
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:32.000]  Absolutely. And then there's the Venus Project. The Z-Force is here.
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:39.280]  We are here to save you. We are here. We are here to free you. We are here to re-educate you.
[3:57:40.640 --> 3:57:43.840]  We'll see what happens with it. Hey, I know you mean well and you're a great guy.
[3:57:43.840 --> 3:57:49.440]  We appreciate you coming on, Peter. Please don't come get me on Z-Day. Please. Please,
