[00:00.000 --> 00:08.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live original Tuesday,
[00:08.560 --> 00:16.840]  November 22, 2022, Global Transmission, Owen Shroyer, and other great hosts and guests
[00:16.840 --> 00:21.040]  are going to be coming up live today like Drew Hernandez and more.
[00:21.040 --> 00:26.720]  I'm your host Alex Jones, about to file several key reports here on air in the hand of baton
[00:26.720 --> 00:27.720]  to Owen.
[00:27.720 --> 00:34.440]  Well, the good news is the Associated Press has fired the reporter that regurgitated Zelensky's
[00:34.440 --> 00:39.680]  lies a week ago that almost started World War III, quote, confirming that Russia had
[00:39.680 --> 00:47.680]  fired missiles into Polish territory, and then Zelensky attempted to bring NATO officially
[00:47.680 --> 00:49.680]  into war with Russia.
[00:49.680 --> 00:57.480]  This story has completely blown up in the deep state's face, and the entire political
[00:57.480 --> 01:04.320]  system is reeling right now because the loss of confidence is palpable, and there's a
[01:04.320 --> 01:08.520]  lot of indicators, not just chairman around the world, that the population is turning
[01:08.520 --> 01:11.880]  against this war and turning against the globalist attempts to escalate it.
[01:11.880 --> 01:13.880]  So that's coming up.
[01:13.880 --> 01:18.800]  We also have a lot of other really, really important news dealing with what's happening
[01:18.800 --> 01:26.800]  in Maricopa County with clear evidence of fraud going on, and massive voter suppression.
[01:26.800 --> 01:32.480]  Again, Owen's going to have some special guests on covering that a little bit later.
[01:32.480 --> 01:37.520]  But the first big story that needs to be hit ties them with Elon Musk, and the real reason
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.160]  he's come out against me in an attempt to basically have his cake and eat it too, claim
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.760]  he's against censorship while actually promoting some of the worst forms of it.
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.120]  And as I segue into that, I want to hit the big news, and that is Albert Borla last week
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.920]  got an award from a censorship kingpins, the ADL.
[01:58.920 --> 02:03.640]  He's the CEO of Pfizer that helped quarterback the lockdowns, the forced injections, the
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.360]  experimental shots, and the cover-up of the mass deaths and illnesses that have been caused
[02:08.360 --> 02:10.840]  that's now collapsing.
[02:10.840 --> 02:15.320]  Borla is working with the World Economic Forum and the UN and others to create a global
[02:15.320 --> 02:18.720]  UN-controlled body that will enforce censorship.
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.960]  And if you think the UN is a powerful, the consortium that basically controls it is, they
[02:23.960 --> 02:30.240]  set it up in the last few years where the UN actually directs the policies to big tech
[02:30.240 --> 02:37.200]  and others that then implement the censorship that is then basically watchdogged and enforced
[02:37.200 --> 02:39.040]  by the ADL.
[02:39.040 --> 02:45.360]  So Borla, in a speech that I'll play excerpts of next segment, came out two nights ago and
[02:45.360 --> 02:52.640]  said that Alex Jones is an agent of evil, he singled me out by name, the only person
[02:52.640 --> 02:58.680]  he singled out by name, he then misrepresented everything I've said, everything I've done,
[02:58.680 --> 03:04.400]  and he talked about the power I have to create fear in the public when they're the ones that
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.880]  use the virus they released, and then the insane fear over that virus to terrorize the
[03:09.880 --> 03:17.040]  public into taking the deadly, experimental, mutagenic, gene therapy, Franken-shot, clot-shot
[03:17.040 --> 03:18.040]  injections.
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.160]  But before we go to break and come back and cover this, I just want to say that I'm extremely
[03:23.160 --> 03:30.680]  honored, extremely blessed that God has put me in a position to be what the enemy sees
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.160]  as their number one threat.
[03:33.160 --> 03:36.840]  This is exactly where I want to be, it's exactly why I've done this, but I just want
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.480]  listeners to let it sink in that now, even more than Trump, I am the globalist number
[03:42.480 --> 03:43.480]  one enemy.
[03:43.480 --> 03:45.680]  We've got to ask ourselves, why is that the case?
[03:45.680 --> 03:51.520]  So obviously I'm in danger, obviously in fours these we prayed for, obviously we are at the
[03:51.520 --> 03:57.400]  highest levels of the conflict with these people, and all of this is in God's hands.
[03:57.400 --> 04:01.280]  But God works through individuals, God works through you and I, so I just wanted to thank
[04:01.280 --> 04:04.920]  you all for your prayers and your support, everything you've done, and I want you to
[04:04.920 --> 04:08.440]  just realize that a lot of times when you're close to greatness, and I'm talking about
[04:08.440 --> 04:15.040]  you, not me, but us together are great, working together, a lot of common people like myself
[04:15.040 --> 04:18.000]  don't recognize just how important we are.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.080]  But I've had a lot of major leaders, and I'll just leave it at that, a lot of household
[04:21.080 --> 04:27.760]  names reach out to me just the last month, including today, this morning, and just say
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.960]  that they recognize this and understand this, and that they've now shifted their paradigm
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.480]  to understand that the globalists are a world government, are a corporate fashion system,
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.120]  and are attempting to set up a total control grid for a forced depopulation.
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.120]  So the good news is humanity's waking up, the bad news is the globalists are totally
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.160]  committed and aren't giving up, so it's the immovable object that comes into the unstoppable
[04:49.160 --> 04:53.000]  force, and you know what happens when that takes place, but the good news is we're on
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.640]  the trajectory to win, but the worst is you have to come until we come through the clouds
[04:57.640 --> 04:59.240]  into the open blue sky.
[04:59.240 --> 05:06.080]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here, we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[05:06.080 --> 05:11.840]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[05:11.840 --> 05:16.480]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out, we
[05:16.480 --> 05:18.480]  won't get more for months and months and months.
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.320]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.320]  the year.
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.880]  We're going to be sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotru Selenium and our Wake Up America award
[05:27.880 --> 05:34.080]  winning coffee, and now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[05:34.080 --> 05:38.800]  so many other great products like Ultimate Crill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats,
[05:38.800 --> 05:44.400]  Secret 12, they are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[05:44.400 --> 05:48.520]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be
[05:48.520 --> 05:54.960]  sold out at infowarsstore.com, promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off, the
[05:54.960 --> 06:24.560]  starting giant savings at infowarsstore.com, thank you so much for your support, God bless.
[06:24.560 --> 06:30.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you very much for joining us here today on this live
[06:30.680 --> 06:36.040]  Tuesday, November 22nd, 2022 edition.
[06:36.040 --> 06:45.240]  We stand at the precipice at the crossroads of the future of humanity, powerful multinational
[06:45.240 --> 06:51.840]  corporations, one control over our bodies, over our very bodily autonomy, and out of
[06:51.840 --> 06:56.740]  the gates, they are hitting us, the very poisonous toxic substance that colonizes our
[06:56.740 --> 07:03.320]  bodies with prion, self-folding, replicating proteins that attack every organ and tissue
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.820]  in the body.
[07:04.820 --> 07:09.080]  This is been done knowingly so that they can get the general public to buy into it, and
[07:09.080 --> 07:13.560]  then once it's clear that it's causing mass death, they believe that the general practitioners
[07:13.560 --> 07:18.240]  and the nurses and the doctors and the lawyers and the culture will not want to admit that
[07:18.240 --> 07:27.080]  they were wrong and will go under mass Stockholm syndrome and will actively work to suppress
[07:27.080 --> 07:30.440]  those of us that are resisting this and speaking out.
[07:30.440 --> 07:36.680]  This is a classical, historic form of corrupting a nation, corrupting a planet under the authority
[07:36.680 --> 07:42.040]  of the private corporations and the WF that control the UN.
[07:42.040 --> 07:45.840]  So it is with great honor today that I talk about the fact that one of the worst people
[07:45.840 --> 07:50.840]  on the planet, Albert Borla, who helped the Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab quarterback this
[07:50.840 --> 07:56.760]  medical biomedical raping of the population, was given an award by the sinister ADL last
[07:56.760 --> 07:57.760]  week.
[07:57.760 --> 08:03.720]  He gave a speech while accepting the award two nights ago and said that I am an agent
[08:03.720 --> 08:09.760]  of evil, that Alex Jones is basically the worst person on earth.
[08:09.760 --> 08:14.840]  Not all the war criminals, not the rapists, not anybody out there.
[08:14.840 --> 08:20.520]  It is Alex Jones that is the big enemy, Alex Jones that is the big threat.
[08:20.520 --> 08:29.080]  He then talks about misinformation and disinformation and he talks about how the UN and the big corporations
[08:29.080 --> 08:37.320]  are outgunned by the sinister forces led by Alex Jones to lie about the shots and to
[08:37.320 --> 08:40.160]  tell you that they don't work.
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.560]  Borla came out two plus years ago and said they were 100% effective and they said 91%
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.760]  effective and they said 86% effective until not effective, you are actually more likely
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.280]  to get sick, get hospitalized and or die.
[08:55.280 --> 09:03.160]  Africa on average is 6% inoculated and Africa has the lowest level of COVID deaths or illnesses
[09:03.160 --> 09:07.240]  in the world and we now know that it is people that have been given the injections are much
[09:07.240 --> 09:12.200]  more likely to quote have COVID symptoms because the vaccine creates the very same spike protein
[09:12.200 --> 09:16.680]  that is in the replicating virus and the lies go on and on and on.
[09:16.680 --> 09:23.760]  So please bear with me and listen to the irony of someone that said the shots are 100% effective
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.840]  in South African trials, 100% effective in American trials and they slowly walked that
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.440]  back when now the different heads of federal agencies involved admitted they always knew
[09:33.440 --> 09:36.680]  it didn't work, the head of the CDC, all of them.
[09:36.680 --> 09:40.920]  So they're the ones involved in this information, they're the ones that have been caught lying
[09:40.920 --> 09:48.000]  on a massive, massive historic scale and they have the nerve to turn around and say that
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.760]  it's I, Alex Jones that is the real threat.
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.160]  If they're so powerful and telling the truth, why are they so worried about our broadcast
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.280]  because they're worried about what you represent the listeners and viewers, not just populace
[10:00.280 --> 10:05.760]  in America but populace across the world because the truth is rising and people are
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.120]  waking up more every day and it's only just the beginning.
[10:11.120 --> 10:16.600]  The truth is we're dealing with desperate, desperate criminals that know their backs
[10:16.600 --> 10:18.600]  are against the wall.
[10:18.600 --> 10:22.600]  So yes I expect to be attacked, I expect to be demonized because we're the type of sphere.
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.840]  That means all of us, this audience, this operation, we are an organization that they
[10:26.840 --> 10:33.160]  see as their awake populace resistance and so literally if you're watching or listening
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.200]  to this broadcast, you are the resistance, now here's Albert Borla spewing his disinformation
[10:38.200 --> 10:42.080]  and his fraud and his lies and we'll come back with more analysis and some other big
[10:42.080 --> 10:44.600]  news on the other side.
[10:44.600 --> 10:53.240]  In thinking about the words of this award, courage against hate, I found myself reflecting
[10:53.240 --> 11:02.400]  on the causes and consequences of hate and I was struck by the central role of disinformation
[11:02.400 --> 11:12.840]  Now I'm not talking about misinformation which is false information regardless of the intent
[11:12.840 --> 11:15.520]  to mislead.
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.880]  Misinformation is damaging but it can be innocent.
[11:20.880 --> 11:30.320]  Disinformation on the other hand is false information knowingly and intentionally spread.
[11:30.320 --> 11:38.960]  It is always malicious, it is never benign and it is never acceptable.
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.320]  We need only look to the battle against COVID-19 to see the impact.
[11:45.320 --> 11:50.920]  Malevolent disinformation about the virus and vaccines and the gross politicization
[11:50.920 --> 11:59.640]  of COVID had to let the unnecessary and preventable suffering and death.
[11:59.640 --> 12:07.280]  As close as I am to that situation, you need not take it from me.
[12:07.280 --> 12:14.920]  Highly regarded scientific and medical experts have said the same thing.
[12:14.920 --> 12:22.360]  No less an authority than former NIH Director Francis Collins lamented the tidal wave of
[12:22.360 --> 12:26.360]  disinformation we have seen during the pandemic.
[12:26.360 --> 12:36.800]  In a recent interview he said, we were basically outgunned dramatically by lies and conspiracies
[12:36.800 --> 12:39.160]  in social media.
[12:39.160 --> 12:46.640]  We should have had our own version of flooding the system with truth.
[12:46.640 --> 12:54.000]  When people use this information to create fear, they become agents of evil and not only
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.800]  against Jews.
[12:56.800 --> 13:05.760]  Whether it is disinformation about the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, when we were encouraged
[13:05.760 --> 13:14.400]  to fear certain people instead of the disease, or the January 6th attack in the United States
[13:14.400 --> 13:21.520]  Capitol, when lies and conspiracy theories threatened the peaceful transfer of power
[13:21.520 --> 13:28.680]  and resulted in the death of five police officers, we know that intentional spreading
[13:28.680 --> 13:37.280]  of false information leads to fear, which in turn leads to tragic outcomes.
[13:37.280 --> 13:43.000]  Historians strive with illustrations of the high cost of disinformation, of the harm that
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.080]  can be inflicted when people in positions of power knowingly lie.
[13:49.080 --> 13:55.400]  Now, there are bright spots amid this darkness.
[13:55.400 --> 14:03.040]  Just last month, a jury in this country awarded close to a billion dollars to families of
[14:03.040 --> 14:08.880]  those who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook massacre.
[14:08.880 --> 14:22.880]  Because one man with a microphone spoke disgusting and disgraceful lies.
[14:22.880 --> 14:30.360]  The jury flat out rejected his lies and made an unambiguous statement that such evil is
[14:30.360 --> 14:33.680]  not acceptable.
[14:33.680 --> 14:40.120]  And as a business leader, I was encouraged recently to seek companies and organizations
[14:40.120 --> 14:46.440]  quickly sever ties with celebrities and athletes who sprue hate.
[14:46.440 --> 14:55.640]  Even though these decisions could result in lost revenues or lost games, this is as straightforward
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.320]  as it gets.
[14:58.320 --> 15:01.720]  Something is true or it isn't.
[15:01.720 --> 15:08.160]  Truth is not a state of great, and we have an obligation to do our part.
[15:08.160 --> 15:15.840]  When the history of our era is written, what will be said of us?
[15:15.840 --> 15:23.000]  Will it be said that when challenged, we covered, gave into fear, and allowed the forces of
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.800]  evil to spread viscous, hateful, malicious lies that advanced a dark, deadly agenda robbed
[15:30.800 --> 15:35.760]  us from our freedom, and in many cases, our very lives?
[15:35.760 --> 16:00.320]  Or will it be said that we were resolute in our insistence of the truth?
[16:00.320 --> 16:07.120]  Till about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and
[16:07.120 --> 16:11.680]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[16:11.680 --> 16:16.120]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.960]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.560]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[16:24.560 --> 16:31.200]  You see the sun, via your skin, helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not
[16:31.200 --> 16:36.320]  getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3, and then it's very easy for viruses and
[16:36.320 --> 16:39.280]  other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.240]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.920]  D3, and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[17:00.200 --> 17:05.200]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has
[17:05.200 --> 17:10.640]  truly earned the title of Top G, but there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has
[17:10.640 --> 17:12.240]  enraged the globalist.
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.840]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years, and that's
[17:17.840 --> 17:22.520]  because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[17:22.520 --> 17:29.640]  But now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[17:58.720 --> 18:02.440]  who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[18:02.440 --> 18:05.000]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.760]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.000]  There's a solution.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  The wellness company.
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.280]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief scientific officer.
[18:14.280 --> 18:20.320]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[18:20.320 --> 18:26.120]  doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in home,
[18:26.120 --> 18:32.800]  in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products
[18:32.800 --> 18:39.560]  can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and
[18:39.560 --> 18:45.680]  post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.280]  to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[18:50.280 --> 18:57.040]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[18:57.040 --> 19:25.440]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.040]  Alex Jones, including myself, I've been given so many opportunities because of this man
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.640]  and because of this platform and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[19:34.640 --> 19:35.640]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[19:35.640 --> 19:40.440]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the
[19:40.440 --> 19:41.440]  super Tim Cass IRL.
[19:41.440 --> 19:47.520]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because
[19:47.520 --> 19:49.840]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[19:49.840 --> 19:54.560]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[19:54.560 --> 20:01.800]  InfoWars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're gone.
[20:01.800 --> 20:12.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:12.600 --> 20:26.320]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this Tuesday edition.
[20:26.320 --> 20:27.320]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[20:27.320 --> 20:31.680]  I want to get into a few other big stories before Owen Schroyer and his other guests
[20:31.680 --> 20:40.120]  take over, but right now I want to drill back into Pfizer, which again took its directives
[20:40.120 --> 20:46.760]  from Bill Gates, from the W.E.F., and from the National Institutes of Health, and Dr.
[20:46.760 --> 20:48.920]  Fauci on record.
[20:48.920 --> 20:52.480]  So when he quotes them saying that we're all full of disinformation because they're the
[20:52.480 --> 20:57.120]  fact checkers, remember that when you actually go to the facts, everything they told us about
[20:57.120 --> 21:02.720]  the shots, about the virus's origin, every single bit of it is a lie, and it's come out
[21:02.720 --> 21:09.760]  the last two months that Fauci and the NIH and CDC have been funding weaponized COVID
[21:09.760 --> 21:14.560]  that kills 80% of humans, not 1.5% or less.
[21:14.560 --> 21:20.560]  So these people are truly a clear and present danger to all of civilization, and now I'm
[21:20.560 --> 21:26.280]  the chosen whipping boy that they can point at and say, there's the bad guy.
[21:26.280 --> 21:31.880]  Well, I'll tell you who the bad guys are, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:31.880 --> 21:37.800]  It's the ones that are engaged in the type of behavior that's on the front page of infowars.com.
[21:37.800 --> 21:39.880]  This is such a critical report.
[21:39.880 --> 21:44.760]  I hope everybody gets this out to everyone you know and saves lives.
[21:44.760 --> 21:52.840]  Disturbed and ashamed, disturbed and alarmed, 66 doctors, clinicians, and scientists call
[21:52.840 --> 21:59.360]  for stop to COVID vaccination of pregnant women over serious safety concerns, again,
[21:59.360 --> 22:00.360]  disturbed and alarmed.
[22:00.360 --> 22:04.560]  And it goes to the studies and the links and what they're actually seeing.
[22:04.560 --> 22:10.360]  There's the New England Medical Journal that came out a year ago finding an 82% rate, non-increase
[22:10.360 --> 22:18.560]  rate, 82% of women in the first two trimesters have stillbirths or miscarriages when they
[22:18.560 --> 22:20.920]  take the shots.
[22:20.920 --> 22:26.520]  And people sit back and they see the boldness of this and they say, how could this be possible?
[22:26.520 --> 22:27.520]  This is so crazy.
[22:27.520 --> 22:33.240]  I mean, this is such a lie that this is good for you or protects you when it destroys your
[22:33.240 --> 22:39.760]  immune system and creates prion disease and blood clots and heart swelling and heart attacks
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.760]  and strokes and everything else.
[22:41.760 --> 22:42.760]  Why are they doing it?
[22:42.760 --> 22:44.920]  Well, they got to do it at some point.
[22:44.920 --> 22:46.840]  They say they want to depopulate us.
[22:46.840 --> 22:48.520]  They say they want death panels.
[22:48.520 --> 22:51.640]  They say they want to euthanize perfectly healthy people.
[22:51.640 --> 22:54.920]  They're doing it in Canada and Europe and starting it here.
[22:54.920 --> 22:56.600]  This is a death cult.
[22:56.600 --> 23:00.840]  That's why the biggest banks, the biggest insurance companies, the biggest oil companies,
[23:00.840 --> 23:06.360]  the biggest tech companies, the biggest big pharma companies fund extinction rebellion
[23:06.360 --> 23:14.960]  and all these anti-industrial civilization groups because they want control over everything.
[23:14.960 --> 23:19.480]  And they want control over resources to turn them off just as they did during the two years
[23:19.480 --> 23:24.720]  of lockdowns that took place in Africa, Latin America and other poor areas of the world
[23:24.720 --> 23:30.880]  where more, now there's 60 million extra people starved to death in the last two and a half
[23:30.880 --> 23:31.880]  years.
[23:31.880 --> 23:34.360]  They are taking a wrecking ball to civilization.
[23:34.360 --> 23:38.680]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush was in in 21 signed on to in Rio de Janeiro in
[23:38.680 --> 23:42.240]  1992 was Agenda 21.
[23:42.240 --> 23:47.800]  Then by the year 2000, they officially went into Agenda 2030 and by then you own nothing,
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.520]  you have nothing and they've already begun the depopulation of the planet.
[23:52.520 --> 23:56.880]  So they believe there's too many of us, they believe we should just roll over and die and
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.640]  they're targeting pregnant women with a shot that makes their baby have an autoimmune response
[24:01.640 --> 24:07.600]  and the body have an autoimmune response and then the body ticks out the baby because
[24:07.600 --> 24:15.760]  the baby is producing toxic nanoparticles that are self-replicating and the body doesn't
[24:15.760 --> 24:19.640]  know what to do and the baby doesn't know what to do.
[24:19.640 --> 24:23.040]  And to call these people monsters is an understatement.
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.600]  So when you're sitting there watching an ADL summit or a Southern Poverty Laws summit
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.920]  or a WEF summit and they're talking about the number one threat is this information,
[24:31.920 --> 24:36.640]  yes, it's the number one threat to them being able to carry out their operations.
[24:36.640 --> 24:41.280]  So I know you as an audience of activists know this, but I want to burn into your brains
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.920]  and into your bones and into your soul that you are the only hope of these children, you're
[24:45.920 --> 24:49.080]  the only hope of these pregnant women, you're our only hope.
[24:49.080 --> 24:54.640]  We are each other's only hope collectively coming together and realizing what we're up
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.160]  against and what's happening and look, just a week ago it looked like NATO was about to
[24:59.160 --> 25:04.800]  attack Russia all based on the lies that Russia fired missiles into Ukraine or missiles at
[25:04.800 --> 25:11.200]  Ukraine that went into Poland and of course now it turns out none of that was true and
[25:11.200 --> 25:16.440]  they fired the AP reporter and others that put out the lie at the behest of Zelensky
[25:16.440 --> 25:21.920]  who is a true madman, a very dangerous man, but what about Zelensky?
[25:21.920 --> 25:28.000]  If the AP reporter and others that are putting these lies out are disgraced, what does it
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.280]  mean about the true agents of disinformation and misinformation and outright lies that
[25:35.280 --> 25:37.320]  are people like Zelensky?
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.400]  I'm not for Russia going into Ukraine, I'm not for the war, but I'm also not for lies
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.440]  that escalate the war and bring us into a nuclear war and so all of us should be very
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.880]  threatened and very upset by this and the good news is more and more people across the political
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.560]  spectrum realize this isn't even political now, this is about survival.
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.280]  This is about common sense and this is about realizing how much danger our planet's in.
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.120]  If you go research, even mainline patents and mainline press releases, there are hundreds
[26:08.120 --> 26:13.520]  of biotech and big pharma nanotech companies, they're all basically the same, they're all
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.840]  merging together and have cross disciplines, they're now putting mRNA into goats and sheep
[26:20.840 --> 26:28.360]  and cows and horses and chickens and all these different plants and animals and just infecting
[26:28.360 --> 26:35.280]  our whole civilization with synthetic genetics and out of the gates they're bringing us poisons
[26:35.280 --> 26:38.600]  and toxins to undermine civilization.
[26:38.600 --> 26:42.480]  If they were really smart they'd roll this stuff out and it has a lot of good benefits
[26:42.480 --> 26:47.120]  with some side effects, some deadly, when it's done right, but instead they're rolling
[26:47.120 --> 26:52.240]  it out deadly to begin with to test the cover up and see what they can get away with next.
[26:52.240 --> 26:58.840]  So the escalation curve in their takeover is so incredibly dramatic that we have to know
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.640]  that they've decided they're losing, they've decided humanity's waking up and so they're
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.640]  trying to accelerate the collapse of civilization, depopulation in an attempt to stop us from
[27:08.640 --> 27:13.280]  peacefully having a renaissance of awakening and taking back civilization through better
[27:13.280 --> 27:18.720]  culture and better ideas and of course, most importantly, a rediscovery of God, country
[27:18.720 --> 27:22.520]  and family and rugged self-individualism.
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.400]  So again, to all the viewers and all the listeners and all the activists of this broadcast, you
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.360]  are the reason the enemy is so upset, it is your word of mouth, it is your prayer, it
[27:30.360 --> 27:36.360]  is your financial support that is bringing their juggernaut of evil to a standstill.
[27:36.360 --> 27:40.640]  We are beginning to turn the corner because of you and your actions.
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.400]  So I ask you again, share the word about the broadcast, share the articles, share the links,
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.320]  keep doing what you're doing, but intensify your efforts.

[27:53.160 --> 27:54.360]  of this thing.

[29:56.400 --> 29:59.400]  the air while empowering your body, infowarstore.com.
[29:59.400 --> 30:06.600]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen day by day counting
[30:06.600 --> 30:13.440]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[30:13.440 --> 30:20.080]  when we just, it's election month Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem.
[30:20.080 --> 30:26.640]  And everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.720]  ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[30:31.720 --> 30:36.240]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[30:36.240 --> 30:40.800]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[30:40.800 --> 30:46.520]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[30:46.520 --> 30:52.600]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[30:52.600 --> 30:56.200]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[30:56.200 --> 31:00.520]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[31:00.520 --> 31:04.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November
[31:04.760 --> 31:11.360]  through Christmas but this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[31:11.360 --> 31:19.160]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776 but on top of it double-patriot points and

[31:21.760 --> 31:26.920]  Every order will get a free gift no matter how small or how big and it's all randomly

[31:56.520 --> 32:00.000]  Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:00.000 --> 32:05.480]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[32:05.480 --> 32:12.360]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[32:12.360 --> 32:17.920]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[32:17.920 --> 32:27.000]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[32:27.000 --> 32:35.360]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[32:35.360 --> 32:41.000]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.800]  care.
[32:42.800 --> 32:49.760]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[32:49.760 --> 32:57.840]  advice, come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to
[32:57.840 --> 33:00.960]  the Wellness Company.
[33:00.960 --> 33:26.760]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.760 --> 33:31.400]  Globalists in their minions are never going to stop until we stop submitting to them.
[33:31.400 --> 33:35.920]  And a great parallel or example of this is Ice Cube, one of the most successful rappers
[33:35.920 --> 33:39.520]  and black actors and filmmakers of our lifetime.
[33:39.520 --> 33:45.280]  And Ice Cube late last year already had a contract from a major movie, $9 million, he
[33:45.280 --> 33:50.040]  was being paid and they kicked him off the film and took his money because he wouldn't
[33:50.040 --> 33:51.760]  take the shot.
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.640]  Think of the rape that that is, think of the invasion of somebody's body, think of the
[33:56.640 --> 34:05.400]  Joseph Mengele level of an experimental deadly shot trying to fire somebody and take their
[34:05.400 --> 34:09.160]  money, which they did, because you don't submit to them.
[34:09.160 --> 34:15.840]  I'm about to play a clip of this expletive, laden analysis of what he's saying is dead
[34:15.840 --> 34:18.440]  on, but here's the one problem with Ice Cube.
[34:18.440 --> 34:20.960]  Ice Cube, you're instinct not to take the shots right.
[34:20.960 --> 34:25.200]  Your co-host talks about on the podcast how it's a pandemic, absolutely, but don't just
[34:25.200 --> 34:27.440]  sit there and say no.
[34:27.440 --> 34:31.360]  Take legal action for them trying to violate your bodily autonomy and trying to take control
[34:31.360 --> 34:32.360]  of your medical life.
[34:32.360 --> 34:38.320]  There's major laws in HIPAA and so much more that we're talking about here and get on the
[34:38.320 --> 34:44.200]  bandwagon to save the men, women and children and firefighters and police and medical workers
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.620]  that have been forced or lost their jobs, they don't have hundreds of millions of dollars
[34:48.620 --> 34:49.620]  like you.
[34:49.620 --> 34:54.400]  They were getting $50,000, $60,000 a year, these firefighters and police and medical workers
[34:54.400 --> 34:59.920]  and they lost their jobs because they took the same heroic stand you took, Ice Cube.
[34:59.920 --> 35:02.920]  So don't just be somebody that's a rebel and stands up for what's right and protects
[35:02.920 --> 35:04.080]  your own body.
[35:04.080 --> 35:09.760]  Now go to the next level, Ice Cube, and fight back against the people that tried to do this
[35:09.760 --> 35:10.760]  to you and others.
[35:10.760 --> 35:14.320]  And I know you're a champion of the black community, stand up for your community because
[35:14.320 --> 35:16.280]  they're being particularly targeted.
[35:16.280 --> 35:19.840]  I know you have stood up for your community, I commend you, but they have been particularly
[35:19.840 --> 35:24.160]  targeted with all this medical tyranny, going back to Tuskegee and the syphilis and all
[35:24.160 --> 35:25.160]  the rest of it.
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.320]  So it's so important that we all be like Ice Cube and say no, but then take it the rest
[35:29.320 --> 35:32.840]  of the way and make them fighters to expose this medical tyranny.
[35:32.840 --> 35:36.320]  Here's the clip of Ice Cube and then I'll show you what it takes over.
[35:36.320 --> 35:39.720]  I turned down a movie because I didn't want to get the motherf***ing jab, you know, turned
[35:39.720 --> 35:46.440]  down 9 million because I didn't want to get that jab and f*** y'all for trying to make
[35:46.440 --> 35:48.000]  me get it.
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.640]  So you know, I don't know how Hollywood feel about me right now, you know what I'm saying?
[35:54.640 --> 35:55.640]  But you know what?
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.840]  It ain't just Hollywood, no more though, you can go through the streaming.
[35:59.840 --> 36:00.840]  Streaming ain't got nothing to do with it.
[36:00.840 --> 36:01.840]  That's Hollywood, bro.
[36:01.840 --> 36:02.840]  Is it really?
[36:02.840 --> 36:03.840]  You think so?
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.840]  It is.
[36:04.840 --> 36:05.840]  It is.
[36:05.840 --> 36:06.840]  They don't want some s***, but you know what I mean?
[36:06.840 --> 36:07.840]  Me too.
[36:07.840 --> 36:08.840]  I want some s*** too.
[36:08.840 --> 36:09.840]  Cute vision.
[36:09.840 --> 36:10.840]  No, that s*** indie, man.
[36:10.840 --> 36:11.840]  Man, I'm working on it.
[36:11.840 --> 36:12.840]  I'm hustling.
[36:12.840 --> 36:13.840]  I got a few dollars.
[36:13.840 --> 36:15.640]  Let's put something together like the weather, man.
[36:15.640 --> 36:16.640]  You did.
[36:16.640 --> 36:17.640]  I'm worried about nothing.
[36:17.640 --> 36:18.640]  It's going to happen.
[36:18.640 --> 36:19.640]  Yeah.
[36:19.640 --> 36:22.080]  Got a lot of few, a lot of things up my sleeve.
[36:22.080 --> 36:23.080]  Yes.
[36:23.080 --> 36:24.080]  Yeah.
[36:24.080 --> 36:25.080]  Fresh up.
[36:25.080 --> 36:26.080]  Man.
[36:26.080 --> 36:27.080]  They turned out 9 million.
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.760]  I didn't turn it down and motherf***ers didn't give it to me because I wouldn't get the
[36:30.760 --> 36:31.760]  shot.
[36:31.760 --> 36:32.760]  Exactly.
[36:32.760 --> 36:33.760]  I didn't turn it down.
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.760]  Oh, okay.
[36:34.760 --> 36:36.000]  They just didn't give it to me.
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.760]  Oh, because you wouldn't get the COVID shot.
[36:37.760 --> 36:38.760]  Yeah, the COVID shot.
[36:38.760 --> 36:39.760]  Uh-oh.
[36:39.760 --> 36:40.760]  The jab.
[36:40.760 --> 36:41.760]  The jab.
[36:41.760 --> 36:42.760]  The jab.
[36:42.760 --> 36:43.760]  Yeah.
[36:43.760 --> 36:44.760]  During the planned in.
[36:44.760 --> 36:45.760]  During the planned in.
[36:45.760 --> 36:46.760]  At all.
[36:46.760 --> 36:47.760]  Me.
[36:47.760 --> 36:48.760]  Nothing.
[36:48.760 --> 36:49.760]  F*** them.
[36:49.760 --> 36:50.760]  I didn't catch it at all.
[36:50.760 --> 36:51.760]  Yeah.
[36:51.760 --> 36:52.760]  I didn't need that sh**.
[36:52.760 --> 36:53.760]  But he caught it about four or five times.
[36:53.760 --> 36:54.760]  Yeah.
[36:54.760 --> 36:55.760]  Well, you know.
[36:55.760 --> 36:56.760]  Circumstances.
[36:56.760 --> 36:57.760]  I got lucky.
[36:57.760 --> 36:58.760]  Yeah.
[36:58.760 --> 36:59.760]  Me too.
[36:59.760 --> 37:00.760]  Ain't going to take no sh** out on me.
[37:00.760 --> 37:01.760]  Yeah.
[37:01.760 --> 37:02.760]  I'll tell you.
[37:02.760 --> 37:08.760]  You know, it's really amazing.
[37:08.760 --> 37:16.720]  Isn't it the chasm between those that live in reality and the American left?
[37:16.720 --> 37:19.440]  And we've reached this strange point.
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.800]  The vaccine is one kind of demarcation line.
[37:22.800 --> 37:28.160]  It might be a little more nuanced, might be a little more open for interpretation.
[37:28.160 --> 37:35.240]  But you would think on an issue of sexualizing kids, well, this is open and shut, right?
[37:35.240 --> 37:36.240]  Wrong.
[37:36.240 --> 37:46.440]  But you see, it's amazing watching that clip of Ice Cube and he's sitting down at
[37:46.440 --> 37:54.520]  a folding table, a $20 folding table with like maybe a couple thousand dollars worth
[37:54.520 --> 37:58.080]  of equipment, maybe.
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.640]  And he's out there just chopping it up, telling the truth.
[38:01.640 --> 38:04.960]  And that's the essence of the new media.
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.400]  And this is the essence of the awakening.
[38:08.400 --> 38:14.480]  And it hasn't really had its moment of coalescence yet.
[38:14.480 --> 38:21.440]  But I think that's coming in the near future where we realize we have more in common than
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.840]  we have more in common with each other than we have differences.
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.400]  And it's just time to sit down and, matter of fact, just lay it out like it is.
[38:31.400 --> 38:33.120]  It was a pandemic.
[38:33.120 --> 38:35.960]  It was made and released out of a lab in China.
[38:35.960 --> 38:45.640]  And then they brought to you with a fake emergency use authorization, a completely unnecessary
[38:45.640 --> 38:53.920]  vaccine that was neither safe nor effective and has actually been deadly and a disaster.
[38:53.920 --> 38:55.040]  And so here you are.
[38:55.040 --> 38:56.040]  That's the reality.
[38:56.040 --> 38:57.040]  You know it.
[38:57.040 --> 38:58.680]  Ice Cube knows it.
[38:58.680 --> 39:00.040]  Anybody living in reality knows it.
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.720]  It's not a complete liar or completely brainwashed knows it.
[39:04.720 --> 39:12.160]  And then Anthony Fauci and absolutely, I mean, I don't even have the words in the dictionary
[39:12.160 --> 39:20.320]  to explain how evil this man is, this little man, this evil gremlin, this evil goblin, this
[39:20.320 --> 39:22.760]  little Satan's minion here.
[39:22.760 --> 39:28.320]  And he goes out in his final speech today after being the highest paid member of the
[39:28.320 --> 39:31.520]  US government for the last 40 years.
[39:31.520 --> 39:37.000]  And that's not even the shadow money that he won't tell us about when he's brought
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.200]  in for questioning during hearings.
[39:39.200 --> 39:43.080]  And they ask, how much money did you make from these special deals?
[39:43.080 --> 39:44.680]  And he says, I don't have to disclose that.
[39:44.680 --> 39:45.880]  It's hundreds of millions, folks.
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.120]  He's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[39:50.120 --> 39:52.840]  And it will probably all come out with Rand Paul.
[39:52.840 --> 39:56.240]  And that's why he's stepping down now, because it's about to be exposed.
[39:56.240 --> 40:06.320]  First out, corrupt Anthony Fauci is, was, and the corruption and greed he brought to
[40:06.320 --> 40:14.960]  the government's healthcare medical wing from the AIDS disaster, where his protocols killed
[40:14.960 --> 40:20.440]  tens of thousands to the COVID disaster, where his protocols killed hundreds of thousands.
[40:20.440 --> 40:24.580]  That will be the true legacy of Anthony Fauci.
[40:24.580 --> 40:29.440]  And he goes up there in his final speech and says, I just have to say on my way out, everybody
[40:29.440 --> 40:33.440]  get your COVID-19 shot.
[40:33.440 --> 40:38.840]  The devil on his way back to hell telling you to sin.
[40:38.840 --> 40:51.360]  The devil on his way back to Hades telling you to commit all the sins.
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.440]  But that's what's so incredible is we, we know the COVID jab not only is not safe and
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.080]  effective, but deadly.
[40:58.080 --> 41:02.760]  You know that everybody knows that and Fauci somehow has the unmitigated nerve to go up
[41:02.760 --> 41:10.800]  there and lie to you one last time ahead of his retirement.
[41:10.800 --> 41:16.800]  And then you have mainstream news like MSNBC and others.
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.920]  I don't even know how to quantify it.
[41:20.920 --> 41:24.920]  We're used to liberals blaming Republicans for everything that they've caused.
[41:24.920 --> 41:29.960]  We're used to liberals blaming conservatives for every time there's a violent gun crime
[41:29.960 --> 41:31.240]  that they want to cover.
[41:31.240 --> 41:36.200]  Not the violent gun crime that happens in Democrat-run cities every night.
[41:36.200 --> 41:39.000]  Every night with dozens being killed, they don't cover that.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.040]  They cover it when it's at a club and they can blame gun owners or Republicans or they,
[41:44.040 --> 41:49.320]  it happens at a school and they blame Republicans or conservatives.
[41:49.320 --> 41:57.680]  And then they make the whole issue about how you, a Christian conservative, don't like
[41:57.680 --> 42:03.920]  men dressed up like women sexualizing children.
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.680]  And they say, this shooting is your fault because you don't like men dressing up as
[42:08.680 --> 42:11.320]  women sexualizing children.
[42:11.320 --> 42:14.520]  And it's just, it's so ridiculous.
[42:14.520 --> 42:15.520]  It's so stunning.
[42:15.520 --> 42:18.360]  How do you even respond to it?
[42:18.360 --> 42:22.880]  How do you even, how do we even move on together?
[42:22.880 --> 42:23.880]  And that's what it is.
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.760]  I forget who said this the other day on the radio, I think, maybe it was, maybe it was
[42:27.760 --> 42:34.960]  Paul Ryan in one of his anti-Trump rants saying, you know, we need to compromise.
[42:34.960 --> 42:36.560]  You know, I'm all for compromise.
[42:36.560 --> 42:39.600]  I agree we need to compromise, but let me explain something.
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.100]  There is no compromise with somebody that wants to destroy your country.
[42:43.100 --> 42:49.120]  There is no compromise with somebody that wants to force you to take a experimental injection
[42:49.120 --> 42:50.120]  that's deadly.
[42:50.120 --> 42:57.720]  There is no compromise for a group of sexual deviants that want to groom children, right?
[42:57.720 --> 42:59.720]  Or do we compromise with that?
[42:59.720 --> 43:02.040]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[43:02.040 --> 43:05.000]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.760]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.040]  The bad news is, by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[43:15.040 --> 43:17.360]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.240]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[43:21.240 --> 43:22.240]  the year.
[43:22.240 --> 43:27.000]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.240]  coffee and now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other
[43:33.240 --> 43:39.040]  great products like Ultimate Crill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12, they are
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.920]  all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[43:42.920 --> 43:45.720]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.680]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarsstore.com, ChromoCoach
[43:50.680 --> 43:56.720]  1776, and you get an additional 10% off, the already giant savings at infowarsstore.com.
[43:56.720 --> 44:01.600]  Thank you so much for your support and God bless.
[44:01.600 --> 44:06.480]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globals.
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.640]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[44:12.640 --> 44:13.640]  world.
[44:13.640 --> 44:18.520]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range in the Information War, but I don't
[44:18.520 --> 44:19.520]  deserve the credit.
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.480]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Info Wars are the real
[44:24.480 --> 44:27.040]  reason you've had the success.
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.440]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new award you've ever
[44:31.440 --> 44:32.440]  had.
[44:32.440 --> 44:39.120]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.120]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[44:43.120 --> 44:45.960]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify it.
[44:45.960 --> 44:46.960]  God bless you all.
[44:46.960 --> 44:47.960]  I salute you.
[44:47.960 --> 44:48.960]  I thank you.
[44:48.960 --> 44:53.960]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[44:53.960 --> 44:54.960]  dream is happening.
[44:54.960 --> 44:55.960]  The fight is my fight.
[44:55.960 --> 44:56.960]  It's your fight.
[44:56.960 --> 44:57.960]  It's our fight.
[44:57.960 --> 45:25.640]  God bless you all.

[46:10.440 --> 46:12.000]  enraged the globalist.

[46:17.640 --> 46:22.440]  because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.

[47:25.400 --> 47:47.720]  You know, I want to be jovial and positive here as it is Thanksgiving week, but we're
[47:47.720 --> 47:53.960]  just at this point now where we're in the world that InfoWars has been warning about
[47:53.960 --> 47:56.360]  for so long, and we're not fully into it yet.
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.720]  They haven't fully gotten the technotronic control grid set up yet, but you can see it
[48:00.720 --> 48:01.720]  being formed.
[48:01.720 --> 48:02.720]  You can see it being built.
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.400]  You can see it being promoted.
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.760]  But when it comes to the government corruption, the mainstream media lies, the false flags.
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.480]  I mean, it's all so obvious.
[48:16.480 --> 48:23.720]  And so you kind of just sit back and you say, okay, well, we're here now.
[48:23.720 --> 48:25.720]  What are the people going to do?
[48:25.720 --> 48:29.440]  Oh, it looks like people made the decision.
[48:29.440 --> 48:31.480]  They're going to try to vote their way out of this.
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.120]  Well, how'd that go in Maricopa County?
[48:36.120 --> 48:40.360]  How'd that go in Harris County?
[48:40.360 --> 48:42.120]  How'd that go in Georgia?
[48:42.120 --> 48:46.280]  How'd that go in Pennsylvania?
[48:46.280 --> 48:54.920]  So you're just sitting here with stories like this all day long, doctors baffled after 16
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.480]  year old football player and wrestler suffers stroke and blood clot in his brain.
[48:59.480 --> 49:01.240]  They're baffled.
[49:01.240 --> 49:02.240]  We don't know.
[49:02.240 --> 49:03.720]  We don't know what's going on.
[49:03.720 --> 49:11.760]  We don't know how we went from.001% of young athletes having blood clots and strokes to
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.960] .001% of young athletes having blood clots and strokes now.
[49:16.960 --> 49:18.600]  We just have no idea.
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.920]  Sure it was post vaccine and they've all got the vaccine, but we don't know anything.
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.320]  It can't be that Anthony Fauci told me it was good.
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.560]  He wouldn't lie to me.
[49:27.560 --> 49:28.800]  Not Anthony Fauci.
[49:28.800 --> 49:31.520]  He's won awards.
[49:31.520 --> 49:33.280]  He's been working for the government for years.
[49:33.280 --> 49:34.700]  He's the good guy.
[49:34.700 --> 49:39.880]  He wouldn't lie to me.
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.280]  That might have been the average American's response, but not anymore.
[49:44.280 --> 49:48.000]  Now they realize, wow, he would lie to me.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.720]  He did lie to me.
[49:51.720 --> 49:55.120]  Reporter collapses live on air at United Nations climate change conference.
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.040]  Yeah, you got reporters just collapsing live on TV, including the ones that are there to
[50:00.040 --> 50:01.960]  promote the vaccine.
[50:01.960 --> 50:07.960]  They get the vaccine and they say how great it is and then they collapse.
[50:07.960 --> 50:09.080]  Truly evil sick stuff.
[50:09.080 --> 50:10.240]  What about what they're doing to the kids?
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.920]  So let me just pause right there and kind of hit the reset button.
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.880]  We've got Drew Hernandez coming up in the next hour at 12.30.
[50:20.880 --> 50:26.240]  We've got Michael Schaefer and what we talk about the grooming of kids that Drew Hernandez
[50:26.240 --> 50:29.640]  is protesting, not to mention the border that Majorca says is secure.
[50:29.640 --> 50:31.000]  Drew Hernandez has been down there.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.440]  We'll ask him if that's the truth.
[50:32.440 --> 50:35.400]  Of course, we know it's a lie, but we'll go through the motions.
[50:35.400 --> 50:43.800]  And then Michael Schaefer, who is analyzing the data coming in from Maricopa County on
[50:43.800 --> 50:49.040]  the votes and some of the machine errors.
[50:49.040 --> 50:51.840]  And so he'll be joining us at one to discuss that.
[50:51.840 --> 50:59.000]  Now I also would like to take calls all day, but I'll be hosting the war room too.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.520]  So we'll have plenty of time for calls.
[51:00.520 --> 51:04.720]  So let me just try to get the news off the desk, but here's the clip.
[51:04.720 --> 51:06.520]  It's just, it's just unbelievable.
[51:06.520 --> 51:13.720]  I mean, I don't know, does this make you, if you, if you can't stand up for children
[51:13.720 --> 51:19.800]  being sexually abused, if you can't stand up against child abuse, if you can't stand
[51:19.800 --> 51:24.280]  up against sexual grooming of children, it is all hope lost.
[51:24.280 --> 51:27.000]  Again, I don't want to be pessimistic today.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.240]  I want to be hopeful.
[51:28.240 --> 51:30.680]  I want to be positive.
[51:30.680 --> 51:38.160]  But this is just ridiculous that they can get away with this on NBC news with Ben Collins.
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.160]  So they just love it folks.
[51:39.160 --> 51:42.240]  They love drag queen story time for kids.
[51:42.240 --> 51:44.160]  They love sexualizing kids.
[51:44.160 --> 51:47.040]  They love dildo ring toss for kids.
[51:47.040 --> 51:48.040]  That's a real thing.
[51:48.040 --> 51:50.040]  They love the rainbow dildo butt monkey for kids.
[51:50.040 --> 51:51.840]  That's a real thing too.
[51:51.840 --> 51:58.240]  They love showing kids pornographic books, books in the classroom.
[51:58.240 --> 52:01.600]  And then you say, Ron DeSantis says, okay, we're banning pornographic material from
[52:01.600 --> 52:02.600]  the classroom.
[52:02.600 --> 52:04.920]  And they say, oh, you're burning books.
[52:04.920 --> 52:10.680]  You're burning books.
[52:10.680 --> 52:24.120]  So here it is, case you didn't know, NBC news goes full pro drag queen time for kids.
[52:24.120 --> 52:27.120]  How significant are those two dates?
[52:27.120 --> 52:28.120]  Yeah.
[52:28.120 --> 52:34.080]  And also hours before what they called an all ages drag brunch, which is probably the
[52:34.080 --> 52:40.240]  number one target of these anti LGBTQ events recently.
[52:40.240 --> 52:41.240]  Okay.
[52:41.240 --> 52:43.040]  Now pause right here.
[52:43.040 --> 52:44.040]  Pause right here.
[52:44.040 --> 52:45.040]  Okay.
[52:45.040 --> 52:46.040]  Okay.
[52:46.040 --> 52:49.680]  Drag queen story time for kids is the number one target.
[52:49.680 --> 52:53.200]  Now there have been no violence at the drag queen story time for kids events.
[52:53.200 --> 52:57.600]  Journalists showing up and filming the sexual abuse, the child abuse.
[52:57.600 --> 53:01.840]  But okay, see guys, what do we do here?
[53:01.840 --> 53:06.440]  Let's take logic, let's take liberal logic and apply it universally.
[53:06.440 --> 53:09.400]  You quickly find out it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[53:09.400 --> 53:10.520]  Okay.
[53:10.520 --> 53:17.480]  So you believe the number one target is drag queen time for kids.
[53:17.480 --> 53:20.360]  And so what do you do?
[53:20.360 --> 53:25.000]  You show up at drag queen time for kids with guns.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.500]  Remember that?
[53:26.500 --> 53:35.280]  So you see, they don't want the schools to be protected by guns, but then they'll show
[53:35.280 --> 53:39.520]  up at drag queen story time for kids that they say is the number one target of conservatives
[53:39.520 --> 53:47.440]  with guns to protect the drag queens and the kids being sexualized.
[53:47.440 --> 53:53.480]  So if guns are good for protecting the drag queens and the kids they're being exposed to
[53:53.480 --> 53:59.000]  at the drag queen time for kids, why wouldn't that be good and proper protection for the
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.960]  school?
[54:01.960 --> 54:06.480]  Because it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[54:06.480 --> 54:11.720]  They want to run their propaganda and tell you conservatives want to attack drag queen
[54:11.720 --> 54:16.920]  time for kids, they don't, they just want to film it and expose it.
[54:16.920 --> 54:23.060]  Then they say, so they want to attack it so we have to be armed and we have to have armed
[54:23.060 --> 54:28.520]  guards out there to protect the kids and the drag queens, then a school shooting happens
[54:28.520 --> 54:33.120]  and they say we need to stop guns, we need to get rid of the guns, we need to protect
[54:33.120 --> 54:37.680]  the children by getting rid of the guns.
[54:37.680 --> 54:40.680]  So you see, it's all propaganda.
[54:40.680 --> 54:47.680]  Use the school shooting to take the guns, use the threat of violence at drag queen story
[54:47.680 --> 54:53.800]  time to say conservatives are violent, which is propaganda and then you protect them with
[54:53.800 --> 54:59.520]  kids, you protect those kids with guns because you say there's threats of violence.
[54:59.520 --> 55:02.040]  See how that works?
[55:02.040 --> 55:05.600]  It's not logic if it can't be applied universally, it's propaganda.
[55:05.600 --> 55:10.920]  Let's go back to Ben Collins, a big advocate of drag queen time for kids.
[55:10.920 --> 55:17.200]  When protests, any drag brunch, any drag story hour, anything that a child might go
[55:17.200 --> 55:23.120]  to meet a drag queen, just to show them that they're human beings and people, they go there
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.680]  and they read Dr. Seuss there, they read regular books but it's read by a drag queen
[55:28.680 --> 55:34.320]  and they have breakfast, it is not some hyper sexual event but that's what it's viewed as
[55:34.320 --> 55:37.600]  on the far right and these spaces have-
[55:37.600 --> 55:46.840]  Yeah, pause it, pause it, okay let's play this game now guys, let's play this game.
[55:46.840 --> 55:56.520]  This is not a bag of cough drops, okay, this is not a bag of cough drops, just because
[55:56.520 --> 56:01.640]  you say it's a bag of cough drops, just because it is a bag of cough drops doesn't mean it's
[56:01.640 --> 56:09.360]  a bag of cough drops and I can play this game all day.
[56:09.360 --> 56:15.200]  Guys put on a classic, search on YouTube a classic Thanksgiving football day game and
[56:15.200 --> 56:20.400]  we'll put it on the screen and I'm going to explain to you that this is not a Dallas Cowboys
[56:20.400 --> 56:24.360]  Thanksgiving football game, okay.
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.120]  Drag queen dance stripper time for kids where it says it's not going to lick itself and
[56:29.120 --> 56:34.000]  they go to strip clubs and they go to gay bars and they hand them dollar bills and they teach
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.400]  them how to shake their butts and they play dildo rainbow, rainbow dildo ring toss, that's
[56:41.400 --> 56:47.040]  not a sexualized event and this is not the Dallas Cowboys versus the Minnesota Vikings
[56:47.040 --> 56:54.920]  on Thanksgiving, this is not NFL football on the screen here, the Minnesota Vikings do
[56:54.920 --> 57:03.040]  not wear purple uniforms and hats with white pants, okay and the Dallas Cowboys don't
[57:03.040 --> 57:10.720]  play football on Thanksgiving, the Dallas Cowboys don't wear white uniforms with silver
[57:10.720 --> 57:18.280]  pants and have a star on their hats and that is not a Dallas Cowboys touchdown reception,
[57:18.280 --> 57:23.480]  you see, so let's play this game guys when we'll come back, let's play some of the footage
[57:23.480 --> 57:28.960]  from drag queen story time events and let's play the Ben Collins game guys, let's show
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.680]  the footage from drag queen time events for kids and let's explain how this is not sexual
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.080]  with their signs that say it's not going to lick itself, with their rainbow dildo ring
[57:39.080 --> 57:45.040]  toss, with their handing over dollar bills to half naked men dancing in front of children,
[57:45.040 --> 57:50.320]  it's not sexual guys and that's not a gaggle of turkeys behind me either.
[57:50.320 --> 57:57.440]  About 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died
[57:57.440 --> 58:03.800]  in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors, they associated these poisonous
[58:03.800 --> 58:09.360]  vapors with cold weather, of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that
[58:09.360 --> 58:16.400]  killed people, what was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3, you see the sun via
[58:16.400 --> 58:22.320]  your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting enough sun you
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.720]  will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to
[58:26.720 --> 58:29.240]  start replicating and taking your body over.
[58:29.240 --> 58:33.200]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[58:33.200 --> 58:37.880]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[58:50.520 --> 58:53.080]  It's a post COVID world now.

[59:51.960 --> 01:00:21.240]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:28.920]  This isn't sexualizing kids, this isn't hyper sexualization, this isn't sexual events with
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.120]  kids involved, come on.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:39.080]  I'm Ben Collins, NBC News, listen to me, now I gotta tell ya, that's good, that's good,
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.920]  the crew, that's pretty funny there guys, because you know I'm sitting here and I'm
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:53.920]  like, how much time do I spend on the liberal left denying what they're up to?
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.200]  Because then it becomes the issue of, well why are they covering it up, why are they
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.360]  denying it, are they really that evil, are they really that sick, do they really want
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.600]  access to children that badly?
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.240]  And this is leading a lot of people to the conclusion of, is this the main streaming
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.360]  of pedophilia?
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.160]  Is this the main streaming of minor attracted persons as they like to be called now?
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.200]  Is that what we're dealing with here?
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:25.160]  Is that why the denial, is that why the cover up, are they finally coming out to play?
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.920]  And they just want you to accept it?
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.080]  And I sit here and I say, how long do I have to show you all the clips of the hyper sexualization
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.000]  of children with Ben Collins from NBC News in the background saying, this is not hyper
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.040]  sexualization of children?
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.680]  That's why I do the joke, I say, this is not a gaggle of turkeys on the screen behind
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.520]  me, this is not a video clip of the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving football game, because
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.200]  it obviously is, I mean that's ridiculous, but that's the world we live in.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.440]  They want us to live in a ridiculous fantasy land world that doesn't exist.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:04.120]  Men can have babies, trans kids, the borders secure, I mean I've got clips of Joe Biden
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.000]  sniffing children at the turkey pardoning.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  So let's go ahead.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  So here's Ben Collins again, telling you there is no sexualization of children happening
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.320]  at drag story time events.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.800]  Just to show them that they're human beings and people, they go there and they read Dr.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.640]  Seuss there, they read regular books, but it's read by a drag queen and they have breakfast.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.360]  It is not some hyper sexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:40.560]  And these spaces have become dangerous places of real life information warfare.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.760]  There's Proud Boys showing up on one side, sometimes people like local Antifa members
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.680]  show up on the other side as a way to, it becomes a place where kids aren't safe.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.640]  Antifa exists now.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.840]  But because of this culture war that's been propped up on top of it.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840]  Oh, kids aren't safe.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.840]  All right, all right, there you go.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.840]  That's good.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.840]  Oh, kids aren't safe.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.080]  But guys, cue back up to the clip, maybe we got past it.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.320]  Cue back up to the clip where he says, these are not hyper sexualization events.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.640]  I think we may have skipped past that.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:13.320]  Oh, we just want to protect the kids.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:24.160]  And then a half naked dude in a bikini shows up with his genitals bulging dancing for children.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.160]  And he says, this is to protect the kids.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:33.280]  I mean, how much longer do we have to deal with this?
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]  I mean, seriously.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.920]  I mean, it just becomes the point where you just say, okay, you know, this is not going
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.720]  to go on forever.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.560]  Do we just get out of the way to see here's the problem.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:51.760]  This is the ultimate logical conclusion that you reach here.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.920]  Eventually you put your hands up and you just say, okay.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.000]  Do we just let this thing play out until it's done?
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.520]  However that works itself out.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.520]  I mean, you're not going to be able to engage in this child abuse and this sexual abuse
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.520]  forever.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.840]  I mean, I don't know where you think this goes from here.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.240]  But it obviously has a finite timeline.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.560]  It obviously has a conclusion eventually.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.280]  But see, when you say, okay, do we just let this play itself out?
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.000]  Do we just get out of the way and let this conclude itself?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Here's the problem.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.920]  Those children are innocent.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.480]  Those children are innocent and they don't deserve any of this.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.560]  They don't deserve this.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.800]  They don't deserve the, where they say, oh, it's gender affirming surgery and it's the
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800]  exact opposite.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.000]  I mean, this is total Luciferianism.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.760]  This is total Satanism.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.040]  And they go on mainstream news and they say this is not the sexualization of children
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.680]  and it's literally the sexualization of children.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.240]  So how much longer do we have to live in this clown world with these people?
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.640]  Because the children is where we draw the line.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.800]  We'll let you guys live out your little weird timelines, but leave the kids alone.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.720]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.800]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.520]  supply chain breakdowns.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.840]  It'll be months and months until these great products come back in.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:28.000]  These three sold out, our great American coffee blend has sold out, Biotrycellinium
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  has sold out.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.480]  But what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:42.400]  Formula, Whole Food Multivitamin, Rain Force Ultra, Super Mill Vitality and so much more.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.120]  So you've only got a few weeks to get these products at the lowest price you're ever going
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.120]  to find them.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]  Don't fight the crowds.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.120]  Don't fight the traffic.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.760]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.920]  Do it now.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920]  Get it all over with.

[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:02.960]  Keep Info Wars on the air while I'm powering your body, infowarstore.com.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:08.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:13.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.480]  I need to move on and I'll come back to this subject with Drew Hernandez who's protested
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.080]  these child abuse events.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.360]  Oh, don't call us child abuse.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:31.400]  See, and this is the big trap is they go out and engage in the sexualization of children.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.560]  You say, stop doing that.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.120]  Someone goes out and engages in violence and they say, this is your fault.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120]  It's a trap.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.000]  They've said a trap for us.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:51.280]  And the only way out of this is logic, reasoning, common sense, but those things are pretty
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.320]  scarce these days in case you haven't noticed.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.320]  But here it is.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.960]  Here's, so let's play Ben Collins from NBC News and I'll move on and cover other news.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.360]  But let's play this clip, guys, and then just roll the B roll of everything you were showing
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.640]  in the last segment.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:12.000]  So here's Ben Collins telling you this is not the sexualization of children and then
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.640]  we'll show you the footage of what he's not is what he's saying.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.760]  He's denying is a sexualization of children.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.680]  This is the total clown world.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.360]  This is the total upside down world.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:27.200]  And so I don't know if Ben Collins doesn't know what's going on or he's just a complete
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.560]  outright liar.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.440]  But here you go.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:35.520]  They go there and they, they read Dr. Seuss there or they read regular books, but it's
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.080]  read by a drag queen and they, you know, they have breakfast.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.760]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.360]  And these spaces, yeah, in fact, let's do this guys, just put them on a loop.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.760]  Can we just put that on a loop with all the, yeah, yeah, that's perfect.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.400]  These spaces have become, they talk, they go there and they, they read Dr. Seuss there
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.080]  or they read regular books, but it's read by a drag queen and they, you know, they have
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.080]  breakfast.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:07.120]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.320]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.680]  And these spaces, it is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.840]  far right list.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:23.400]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far one.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.580]  They, you know, they have breakfast.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:31.240]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far right at breakfast.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:36.420]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.320]  And these spaces have become dangerous places in New York.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:46.320]  They have breakfast, it is not some hyper-sexual event, but that's what it is viewed as on
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.400]  the far right.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.560]  It's read by a drag queen, and they have breakfast.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.840]  It is not some hyper-sexual event, but that's what it is viewed as on the far right.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.560]  It's read by a drag queen and they have breakfast.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:02.860]  It is not some hyper-sexual event, but that's what it is viewed as on the far right.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.920]  And they have breakfast.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.680]  It is not some hypersexual event, but that's what it's-
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.840]  So I mean, should I just do this all day?
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.440]  I mean, you know, that's what it's like.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.600]  Do I just play this for three, four hours?
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.440]  I mean, what do we do?
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.360]  How do we defeat this nonsense?
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.240]  How do we defeat this propaganda?
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.140]  How do we defeat these lies?
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.580]  That's what's so frustrating is you realize
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.620]  that genuinely speaking, the American left
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.040]  has no interest in living in reality.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.840]  They've completely abandoned all truth and reasoning
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.080]  and they just do not care
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.920]  and they've weaponized it all against you.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.760]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.400]  I can sit here and play Ben Collins on a loop saying,
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.480]  oh, they just read books.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.520]  They just have breakfast.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.840]  It's not sexualization.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.040]  And then just play hours and hours and hours
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.560]  and hours of the sexualization that he says isn't happening.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:52.980]  But it's the same thing.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.160]  It doesn't matter whether I'm talking about
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.320]  drag queen story time
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.600]  or whether I'm talking about the vaccines.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.400]  I can sit here all day long
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.040]  and I can show you thousands of stories of vaccine injuries,
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.680]  thousands of stories of vaccines deaths.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.520]  I can show you the VAERS reports
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.520]  with the tens of thousands of vaccine deaths
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.240]  all from the COVID-19 vaccine
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.280]  and they will sit up there like Anthony Fauci
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.520]  and say it's safe and effective.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.720]  So what do you do?
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.640]  What do you do?
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.120]  What do you do?
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.520]  When an entire group of people
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.600]  either consciously want to lie to you
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.760]  or just refuse to live in reality?
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760]  What do you do?
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.720]  What do we do as humans in this situation?
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.960]  How do we properly address this?
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.880]  Because I gotta be honest with you.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.600]  I get to this point and I meditate on this
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.560]  and I don't like dehumanizing people.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.400]  I really don't.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.000]  Even our political opposition, I don't like to dehumanize.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.960]  But you almost wonder if these people are even human.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.640]  This is not any human behavior that I can recognize.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.960]  This is not any human behavior that I'm familiar with.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.400]  This is not any human behavior that has ever crossed my mind.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.440]  I don't recognize this.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.800]  I don't recognize men dressing as women,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.640]  sexualizing children.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.440]  That's not human behavior.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.040]  And then,
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.200]  supposed to be a human behavior,
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.040]  I don't recognize this.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.000]  I don't recognize men dressing as women,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.800]  supposed reporters going on TV,
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.520]  defending it, saying this isn't sexualizing children.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.360]  That's not human behavior.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.880]  That's alien.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.480]  That's demonic.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.480]  Lying to you about a virus, lying to you about a vaccine
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.200]  and then still doing it two years later.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.920]  That's not human.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920]  I don't recognize that.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.080]  That's not human to me.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:52.720]  That's demonic.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720]  That's alien.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.720]  That's what really just makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.600]  It really just makes you wonder.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.400]  Who are these people?
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.600]  What are these people?
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.560]  What is inside of them?
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560]  What motivates them?
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.800]  What drives them?
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.440]  Why are they like this?
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.520]  And that's why I try to talk about the psychology of the left
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.960]  so that you understand what goes on in their mind.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.680]  You have to understand that this is ritualistic abuse.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.360]  You have to understand that this is ritualistic torture.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.720]  You do have to go into the mind of these freaks
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.440]  to know why they operate this way.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.800]  If a pedophile wanted access to your kids,
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.560]  how do you think they would do it?
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.760]  Oh, drag queen story time for kids?
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.520]  Sounds wonderful.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.400]  Sure, I'll get dressed up like a fairy tale princess
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.480]  and dance in front of the children.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.240]  Yeah, they can bounce on my lap too.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.600]  Yeah, rub my belly.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.240]  Yeah, rub my butt.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.680]  Yeah, I've got a scratch, little Johnny, right there.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.000]  You think you could help me out?
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.720]  Yeah.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.360]  This is not human, folks.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.560]  This is alien.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.080]  This is demonic.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.920]  And the children deserve defense here.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.960]  And that's why we can't just let this go on.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.120]  It's one thing with the vaccines at this point.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.360]  Look, you want to inject yourself with this poison.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.560]  Fine.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.080]  Just leave the kids out of it.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.080]  But they won't.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.880]  They always go after that innocent.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:48.800]  I mean, for the love of God, it's Joe Biden again in the White
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.960]  House sniffing and grabbing children.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.960]  And you watch this and you say, you know,
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.680]  if Joe Biden did that to a woman,
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.680]  the common response would be this is sexual assault.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.400]  The Me Too response would be this is a white man showing you
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.000]  his white privilege, sexually assaulting a woman
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:11.920]  and getting away with it.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.320]  But he goes up to a strange child and sniffs him.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.440]  I mean, it just and the parent sits there and lets it happen.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.440]  I mean, where is the basic instinct?
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.120]  Where is the basic instinct to recognize a predator
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.080]  and to feel a predator's presence?
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.160]  Unbelievable stuff.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.760]  I'm just at a loss at this point.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.040]  But we know what it is.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.640]  Satan is real.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.640]  Demons are real.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.920]  Demon possession is real.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.120]  Satanic agendas are real.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.120]  I don't know how else to describe any of this.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600]  I just don't get it.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.920]  So I've got all this news and I just I just I can't get it.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.920]  I can't even cover it and this is huge political news.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.920]  So I need to come back and cover this head of Drew Hernandez
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.920]  coming up.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.920]  What the Democrats are doing?
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.920]  It's like we've got the political corruption and that's one thing
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.920]  I can see here and cover it.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.920]  But if I don't even sit here and make a fuss about them
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.920]  sexualizing and grooming and abusing children,
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.920]  then what good is cleaning the political system up?
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.920]  If we're just feeding children into this monster beast liberal
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.920]  world order under the guise of LGBTQ rights,
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:36.920]  and we just normalize child abuse now.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.920]  But I'm going to come back and I'm going to cover all this
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.920]  important political news.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.920]  It's just sick stuff to start countries in a really sick corrupt
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]  place.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.920]  Oh boy, I'm trying to be positive today too.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.920]  But when you have to stare at this all day long,
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.920]  it makes it a little tough.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.920]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.920]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.920]  Now the good news, I'm going to extend this sale up to 60%
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920]  off right through Christmas.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.920]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.920]  store will be sold out.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.920]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.920]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.920]  and get the biggest sales of the year.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.920]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotrusillinium
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.920]  and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.920]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion,
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.920]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.920]  So many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil,
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.920]  Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.920]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920]  or in the next month.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.920]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.920]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.920]  at infowarstore.com.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.920]  Chromo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.920]  the already giant savings at infowarstore.com.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.920]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.920]  And Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen,
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.920]  slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.920]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.920]  seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920]  It's not election day.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.920]  And that's the problem.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.920]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.920]  They illegally changed state elections,
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.920]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone,
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.920]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.920]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.920]  We're in a serious country when we have elections
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.920]  that can be stolen like this.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.920]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.920]  in 2020, and I have no problem saying that.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.920]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.920]  to attack us that question our election integrity
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.920]  and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.920]  the way they are.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.920]  We're not election deniers.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.920]  We're election realists.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.920]  of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.920]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.920]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776,
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.920]  but on top of it, double patriot points
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.920]  and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.920]  Every order will get a free gift.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.920]  No matter how small or how big,
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.920]  and it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.920]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.920]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $495
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.920]  and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.920]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs,
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.920]  some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks,
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.920]  some of them are books, films, Info Wars flags, American flags.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.920]  There are hundreds of different items.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.920]  It's all random. InfoWarsStore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.920]  Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.920]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough,
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.920]  and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company,
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.920]  an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.920]  where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.920]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.920]  providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:30.920]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.920]  specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes,
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.920]  and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.920]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store,
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.920]  media and health advice.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.920]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:20.920]  as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.920]  All right, let me focus on some of this political corruption.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.920]  And we'll get back into the issue of the child groomers with Drew Hernandez
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  and Kevin McCarthy hinting that they're going to try to impeach Mayorkas.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.920]  Well, this is a joke. He lied under oath. He said the border is secure.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.920]  I ain't okay.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.920]  Yeah, the border is secure. All right.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:45.920]  Thank you, Mayorkas, for your openness and honesty here.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.920]  Thank you so much.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:58.920]  I just, oh boy, oh boy.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.920]  Biden Department of Justice once reduced sentence for leftist lawyers
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.920]  who used Molotov cocktails to target police van during protests.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.920]  Now, this was the headline from June.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.920]  So just to give you a little context here.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:21.920]  You had two liberal Democrat lawyers, Democrat fundraisers, funders, activists, you name it,
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:26.920]  driving around during the George Floyd riots with Molotov cocktails,
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:32.920]  throwing them into buildings and whatnot, and they threw one into a police car.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.920]  Now, the police car happened to be empty, but imagine if it wasn't.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.920]  They didn't know if it was or not.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.920]  They might have actually thought a police officer was in there
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.920]  and they threw the Molotov cocktail in it and burned it.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.920]  Could have been attempted murder.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.920]  Pretty serious stuff, right?
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:53.920]  Well, the Biden administration, knowing they were loyal Democrats, stepped in.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.920]  Female Molotov cocktail lawyer sentenced to only 15 months in jail.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.920]  Former lawyer who threw a Molotov cocktail at a New York police vehicle
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:09.920]  during police brutality protest has been sentenced to 15 months in prison.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:17.920]  Seven federal accounts, use of explosives, arson, explosive to commit a felony, arson conspiracy,
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:26.920]  use of a destructive device, possessing and making a destructive device, pled guilty.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:34.920]  And the Biden Department of Justice stepped in and said she will only get 15 months.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:41.920]  Left-wing lawyer Firebomber gets light sentence after intervention of Biden Department of Justice.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:50.920]  Now, folks, you think it's bad enough that another Democrat leftist terrorist, violent terrorist
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.920]  that was supposed to get 45 years in jail instead gets 15 months thanks to Biden.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.920]  You think that's bad enough?
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.920]  This is the exact same Department of Justice that has had nonviolent
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.920]  offender from January 6th in jail for more than a year.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:16.920]  The exact same Department of Justice that has nonviolent offenders from January 6th in a jail
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:23.920]  for more than a year just stepped in to make sure that an actual terrorist,
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:36.920]  somebody that actually tried to harm people only gets 15 months.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:42.920]  It's so criminal. It's so corrupt. It's heartbreaking.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:47.920]  It's devastating. It's evil.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.920]  There's no other way to put it.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:53.920]  It's liberal Democrat supremacy. They're better than you. They're above the law.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:24:00.920]  And if you haven't figured out that they are exhibiting that belief every day,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.920]  you still don't get it.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:12.920]  You walked into...they just sentenced a girl who walked into the Capitol on January 6th,
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:17.920]  didn't harm anybody, didn't steal anything, but filmed video,
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.920]  and they just gave her like 46 months.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.920]  Again, didn't hurt anybody, didn't bring any weapons.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.920]  Just shot a video in Nancy Pelosi's office, and she just got like 45 months.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.920]  This person throws Molotov cocktails all around the city of New York,
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:41.920]  including in police vehicles, she gets 15 months.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.920]  How much longer do we have to put up with this?
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.920]  Because that's the thing too.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.920]  I shouldn't even say this, but you can't help but wonder.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.920]  Is it done? Is this it? Is America over?
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.920]  Is it done? Is it time to give up? Is it time to get out?
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.920]  Is there some other country we can go to? Does any country on Earth care about freedom or justice?
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.920]  Is there any country on Earth not run by corrupt psychopaths?
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.920]  Is there anywhere for me to go? Is there anywhere I can go and not be afraid of my government?
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.920]  Is there anywhere I can go and actually have justice?
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.920]  Is there anywhere I can go and actually have free speech,
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.920]  or have the Democrats officially ruined it forever?
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:24.920]  Is there any chance of saving America when right in front of the entire nation,
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.920]  the exact same Department of Justice,
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:35.920]  steps in to take an actual violent terrorist Democrat sentence from 45 years to 15 months,
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:42.920]  and that same Department of Justice has nonviolent criminals that never heard of fly sitting in jail
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.920]  without trial for more than a year?
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:54.920]  Is it time to be realistic and just say, we're done, we're cooked, it's over?
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.920]  Or is there a chance we can still save this country?
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.920]  Is there a chance we can still stop this corruption?
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:06.920]  Is there a chance that we can still get back to common sense and truth and justice?
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:12.920]  It gets worse.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.920]  Trump Special Counsel Jack Smith's connection to Michelle Obama explained,
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:21.920]  oh yeah, you know that new prosecutor that they just appointed to investigate Donald Trump again?
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.920]  Yeah, he's a total died in the wall Democrat.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.920]  Mary Garland appoints Special Counsel for Trump Investigations.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.920]  Newly appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith is married to a documentary filmmaker
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.920]  who worked on a 2020 film about First Lady Michelle Obama
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.920]  and donated to President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:47.920]  I'm sure that'll be a completely fair and non-bias investigation, though,
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:53.920]  because we all know all these Democrat investigations into Trump are totally legit.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.920]  That's what's so frustrating is you sit here and you deal with the hard core.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.920]  Democrats are hard core.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920]  In case you haven't realized it yet,
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.920]  that's the one thing I envy about the Democrats is they're actually hard core.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.920]  They're actually burning buildings to the ground.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.920]  They're actually murdering police officers.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.920]  They're actually sexually grooming children.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.920]  They're actually locking up their political opposition.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.920]  They're actually forcing you to take a medical procedure.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  Democrats are hard core.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.920]  They love it.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.920]  And I have to sit here and deal with Kevin McCarthy,
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:38.920]  who's like, maybe we'll impeach Mayor Kess.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.920]  Attorney General Merrick Garland's son-in-law revealed as prolific Democrat donor
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.920]  funds Super PAC behind the squad.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.920]  They are hard core.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:53.920]  And then Mitch McConnell takes money from FTX and gives it to Lisa Murkowski
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:00.920]  so that they can keep the Trump-endorsed Chewbacca out of office.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.920]  Manhattan District Attorney probing Trump's role in hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.920]  Oh, let's bring that one back up.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.920]  Yeah!
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.920]  Let's bring Stormy Daniels back up.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:19.920]  Meanwhile, FBI paid out $42 million a year to confidential human sources,
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.920]  including thugs who set up Trump, Whitmer kidnapping hoaxers, and others.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:31.920]  Your tax dollars stolen from you, given to Democrats to set you up and put you in jail.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.920]  And they did it.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.920]  And they're going to do it again.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:41.920]  Because they are hard core.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:47.920]  Oh, oh, oh, by the way, did you know that Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi Biden
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.920]  had her wedding at the White House over the weekend, first time ever,
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.920]  and Joe Biden was wandering around sniffing people the whole time?
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.920]  Did you hear about that one?
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.920]  Yeah.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:04.920]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.920]  and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.920]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.920]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.920]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:28.920]  You see, the sun, via your skin, helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.920]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3,
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.920]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.920]  and taking your body over.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:41.920]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.920]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body

[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.920]  But what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, vitamin mineral fusion,

[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.920]  brain force ultra, supermail volatility and so much more.

[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.920]  infowarstore.com
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.920]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process,
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:05.920]  the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible,
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.920]  the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible,
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.920]  the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:19.920]  and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.920]  made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.920]  despite the massive lawfare being waged against Info Wars,
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.920]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against Info Wars,
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:38.920]  the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:41.920]  and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:47.920]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:51.920]  So continue to do it. Go to places like infowarstore.com.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.920]  Go to places like Save Info Wars. Continue to keep Info Wars alive
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.920]  because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:06.920]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:12.920]  Info Wars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:19.920]  This Info Wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rosehips should be your next purchase from the Info Wars store.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:26.920]  The rosehips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:31.920]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.920]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:42.920]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:46.920]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:52.920]  It's been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:59.920]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our rosehips don't lie.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:17.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:29.920]  Live from the Info Wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:39.920]  The crew makes a joke in the break. You're like, you know, that might be interpreted as you calling for violence.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.920]  And I'm like, I don't remember calling for violence that segment.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:47.920]  Well, you said you were jealous of the left getting to burn buildings and attack Trump supporters.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.920]  And I didn't even realize that that's the way it might have been interpreted, but it is pretty ironic, though.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.920]  Drew Hernandez joining me now. Drew, it is kind of ironic.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:03.920]  And I kind of like this form of reverse culture jamming where you promote leftist liberal Democrat values
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.920]  and then you force them to tell you how bad they are.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:11.920]  So yeah, I mean, I should come on here and say, we should take over Austin's capital and call it the chop.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.920]  We should throw Molotov cocktails into police vehicles.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.920]  You know, I mean, like I could promote all the activities the left does.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.920]  And then they'd call me violent, even though I'm just doing exactly what the left does.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.920]  But that's the irony, Drew Hernandez. Where do you want to go?
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.920]  I wanted to cover the sexualization of kids. Ben Collins saying, no, it doesn't happen.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.920]  Majorca says the border is secure. Obviously, it's not. You've been down there.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.920]  I mean, where should we start today?
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.920]  Let me piggyback off of what you just said. Thanks for having me on.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.920]  It's always an honor to be here with you.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:49.920]  You know, dude, like it's kind of like a like a reality confirmation when you do something like that, you know, because
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.920]  at this point we have to jiu-jitsu these people and we're not really calling for violence,
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.920]  but it just kind of proves the point. Like when you say something like that,
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.920]  they turn around and pretty much admit that they're the violent ones.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:03.920]  I mean, you can go to Twitter right now. They're calling for the death of Shia Reicheck,
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.920]  the owner and creator of Libs of TikTok. They're trying to pin on her the Colorado shooting.
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.920]  And while they're doing it, they're going on Twitter and showing their true colors
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.920]  and taking the mask off of their face, literally calling for her to be drone-striked.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.920]  These are quotes. They're calling for her to be drone-striked, to be fire-bombed,
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.920]  and to be killed for a change.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.920]  Now, I think it's pretty clear. We know that these are the Antifa, the BLM, Radical Domestic Terrorists.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:30.920]  But to go to your point, yes, when you say something like that in public and they turn around
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.920]  and try and pin it on you, it just kind of confirms the reality that they're
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.920]  actually the real violent ones. And they're too stupid to even realize it, to be honest.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.920]  But at the same time, they are the masters of propaganda and they'll just use it against you
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920]  and me and it. It'll never end. It'll never end.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:48.920]  Well, and here's the problem. It'd be one thing if we still had sanity
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:51.920]  or just any semblance of justice in this country.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.920]  But seemingly, we don't. When a Democrat lawyer can throw Molotov cocktails at people
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.920]  in buildings and police cars and the DOJ steps in to give her 15 months,
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.920]  but a lady, a young lady who walks into the Capitol on January 6th doesn't harm a fly,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:11.920]  gets 46 months. And there's no justice there.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:17.920]  I mean, you have to kind of like determine who's defining all of this because in their terms
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:21.920]  and their commie language, that's justice to them because they're liars.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.920]  Exactly. That's what's so dangerous. Exactly.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.920]  They define everything. They redefine everything.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.920]  And then they have the masses believing this garbage because they get to set the terms.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.920]  I actually think the mega Republicans thing is sticking with them in their base,
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.920]  obviously not with us and the viewers.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.920]  But there are still millions of like mindless people out there that hear the term mega Republicans
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.920]  and they're kind of low IQ, they're low information voters.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:49.920]  They really don't research anything. They just kind of open up social media and whatever is the main talking point.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.920]  I guess CNN is saying or Nancy Pelosi is saying, I guess that's what is to be believed.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.920]  There are still a lot of people like that out there.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920]  And I think the mega Republicans thing is sticking.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.920]  The right are the domestic terrorists are sticking.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.920]  So I mean, these people, they operate through phobia.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.920]  That's why everything's a phobia. Everything's a fear.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.920]  And they emotionally manipulate a lot of people in order to control them.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:17.920]  They've done it through COVID, they've done it through xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, everything's a damn phobia.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.920]  But it's effective because that messaging effectively controls the people that you're trying to communicate to that.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.920]  That's what we are up against when we talk about an info war.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.920]  That's exactly what we are up against.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:33.920]  It's this social emotional engineering that has people manipulated on a daily basis.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.920]  They don't operate through facts. They don't operate through a good civil argument.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:41.920]  They only operate through emotion. And every now and then, you'll get a good red pill in.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.920]  But unfortunately, there's still people in this country that are just totally mindless
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:49.920]  and think that Klaus Schwab and the New World Order is still a conspiracy theory
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.920]  when you could literally go Google and listen to their own words right now in 2022.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.920]  It's pretty insane. What time to be alive.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.920]  I'm thankful we're here to push back on this stuff.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.920]  No, it's totally insane.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.920]  Well, and you mentioned Klaus Schwab.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.920]  It's like they'll run around saying, Trump Nazi, Republican Nazi, you're Nazi.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.920]  Eugene Schwab is Klaus Schwab's father was a literal Nazi.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.920]  There's pictures of him in his Nazi... I mean, it's a joke.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.920]  But see, here's the problem. You think about it. It is a mental jujitsu move.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.920]  And here's a perfect example. Guys, if you can, pull back up the footage
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:28.920]  of all those people smashing the police cars that you had on a second ago.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:34.920]  Here's the mental jujitsu that the globalists have pulled on the anti-establishment left
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.920]  that they just haven't figured out yet.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.920]  Most of the human consciousness, I think, has realized in some way, shape, or form
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.920]  that you are still a slave to the government or you are oppressed by the government.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.920]  I mean, there's some form of an understanding there just inherently
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.920]  when you know you're not free, you know you're getting taxed,
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920]  you know the wars are fake, all of this stuff.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:01.920]  And so the jujitsu that they pull is, okay, so they go out and they smash police cars
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.920]  and they go out and they vandalize police cars and government buildings
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.920]  because they feel, oh, this is the government.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.920]  This is me going up against the oppressive government.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920]  This is me going up against the corrupt government.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.920]  No, no, you're missing the picture.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.920]  You're going after local law enforcement that is just maybe like a bottom wing
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.920]  of the corruption that you may have had to face.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.920]  No, the real corruption is in DC.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.920]  No, the real corruption is all these funding groups that run the media
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.920]  and run the politicians. That's who you're up against.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.920]  But they've just done the jujitsu and they think, oh, no, the cops are my enemy.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.920]  Yeah, but oh, and they take it a step further because it's a cult.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:43.920]  When you're in a cult, you just ride with the wave any way the cult decides to go.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.920]  Whatever the doctrine is for the moment, that's what they go for.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.920]  Whatever they're told to believe is what needs to be believed for the moment.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]  That's what they go for.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:55.920]  That's why the same people you just described are all the same people
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.920]  post January 6th that are praising the FBI and tagging the FBI all over Twitter.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.920]  All of a sudden, they love the FBI.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.920]  They love the deep state. They love law enforcement.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.920]  They love tyranny all of a sudden.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.920]  They love war.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  And they love war.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.920]  They love Ukraine and giving all of our money to start a nuclear war.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.920]  But at the same time, climate change, it's ridiculous.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:17.920]  It's a cult, dude. It is a cult.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.920]  That's why they don't even know.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.920]  Some of them might know they're in a cult, especially the top leaders,
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.920]  the globalists that know what they're doing and manipulating,
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.920]  pulling the strings with the puppets.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.920]  But the activists and all these SJWs on the street,
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.920]  these people are robot NPCs.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.920]  I know we've said that for years to kind of like, you know,
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.920]  really joke around and like make these people look retarded.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.920]  But I mean, they are controlled.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.920]  These people are literally controlled because they have no idea
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.920]  that there are powers at B that are using them as the useful idiots on the ground
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:46.920]  to do their bidding.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.920]  That's exactly what the 2020 race riots were.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.920]  Well, and that's why earlier I played the clip.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.920]  I don't know if you have you heard the clip of Ben Collins on NBC saying,
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.920]  oh, they don't sexualize kids at these events.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.920]  And we can play the clip for you in the next segment,
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:01.920]  or maybe they can queue it up.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.920]  But I play the clip where he says,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.920]  they're not sexualizing kids at these events.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:09.920]  And then I have the video rolling over it of all the sexualization
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.920]  of the kids at the events, the strippers, the dildos.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.920]  It's not going to lick itself.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.920]  And that's what I'm saying is like, I don't want to dehumanize
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.920]  because you get into a real dark place when you start to dehumanize.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.920]  But how is that even human?
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.920]  How has Ben Collins a human going on television
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.920]  saying they don't sexualize kids at these events
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.920]  when everybody knows that's exactly what they're doing?
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.920]  What are two things, right?
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.920]  And the first one is benefit of the doubt.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.920]  Maybe this guy is so disconnected from reality
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.920]  and what's actually taking place, you know,
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.920]  because he has an elitist mindset or an elitist lifestyle
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920]  doesn't really know what's going on.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:51.920]  Or, and I'm kind of more on the side of believing the second one be,
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920]  it's sinister.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920]  He knows exactly what's taking place,
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.920]  but he's willing to cover it up for the sake of politics, power, control,
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.920]  and he hates children.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.920]  He's probably on the side of women aborting all their babies
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.920]  and killing them even outside of the womb.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.920]  I would probably be willing to bet it's the latter
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.920]  because the majority of these people just hate children.
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.920]  They hate humanity.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920]  That is why they are going to fall for the Antichrist
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.920]  and worship the devil and human flesh
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.920]  because they want a new world order.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.920]  And you got to attack the children in order to have that
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.920]  because if you don't attack the children and control them,
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.920]  you will not have a population to control in the future
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920]  and into the future for decades to come.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.920]  That's why they are targeting the children so harshly
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920]  and they're slaughtering humanity,
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.920]  even having kids slaughtering their genitals.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.920]  It's just, it's so psychotic,
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.920]  but at the end of the day, like you always say,
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.920]  oh, and Alex always says, this is an agenda.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.920]  This is an agenda from the top down.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.920]  I want to play this clip for Drew Hernandez on the other side
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.920]  because he's been to these events.
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.920]  And maybe we should invite Ben Collins to one of these events
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.920]  and we can find out for sure how he feels about it
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:43:20.920]  if you know what I mean.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:28.920]  It's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.920]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:34.920]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $495
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.920]  and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.920]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs,
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.920]  some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks,
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.920]  some of them are books, films,
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.920]  Info Wars flags, American flags.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  There are hundreds of different items.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.920]  It's all random. InfoWarsStore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.920]  Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.920]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones,
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.920]  needs to support InfoWars and band.video.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.920]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.920]  I'm going to do that right now.
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.920]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.920]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.920]  like Savannah Hernandez,
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.920]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.920]  because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.920]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.920]  and because of this platform.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.920]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:35.920]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.920]  and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.920]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.920]  and band.video for granted
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.920]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.920]  You have to support free speech systems right now.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:51.920]  So go check out the store, go support their store,
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.920]  go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:23.920]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.920]  You ever get the big secret?
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.920]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.920]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:40.920]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.920]  Look it up.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.920]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.920]  fish oil is incredible.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.920]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.920]  is take good fish oil or krill oil
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.920]  just like our information is dynamite,
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:57.920]  so are our products in 4store.com.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.920]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.920]  American citizens should be allowed
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.920]  to basically question that event
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.920]  in any way that they deem fit.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.920]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.920]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.920]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.920]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.920]  Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.920]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920]  And they were planning all of this.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.920]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.920]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.920]  And now because we've been so successful
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.920]  warning the population of the planet,
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.920]  not just America, we're public enemy number one
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.920]  when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.920]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.920]  how successful InfoWars has been
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.920]  because of your past support.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.920]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.920]  And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.920]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com

[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.920]  And I thank you all for your support.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.920]  of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.920]  They go there and they read Dr. Seuss there.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.920]  They read regular books.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.920]  But it's read by a drag queen.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.920]  And they have breakfast.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.920]  It is not some hypersexual event.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.920]  But that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.920]  They go there.
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.920]  And they read Dr. Seuss there.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.920]  They read regular books.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.920]  But it's read by a drag queen.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.920]  And they, you know, they have breakfast.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.920]  It is not some hypersexual event.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.920]  But that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.920]  They go there, and they read Dr. Seuss there.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:38.920]  They read regular books.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.920]  But it's read by a drag queen.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.920]  And they, you know they have breakfast.
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.920]  It is not some hypersexual event.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.920]  But that's what it's viewed as on the far right.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:53.540]  Okay, so that's Ben Collins on NBC News, just either completely lying to you or completely
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:54.540]  inaccurate.
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.780]  But I think we have the solution here, Drew.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:48:02.020]  I think maybe the next time you or I go out to film a drag queen story time event, maybe
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.180]  we should invite Ben Collins out.
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:08.180]  And we should say, here Ben, here's the events where you say they're reading books and eating
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.180]  breakfast.
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:13.660]  I don't see crumpets in literature anywhere, but hey, look, there's a stripper, Ben.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:15.260]  Oh, and a kid handing him a buck.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.900]  What do you think about that, Ben?
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:20.500]  I mean, maybe that's what we should do, because you're right, either they know that this is
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:25.660]  going on and are lying about it, meaning they like it, or they have no clue this is going
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:29.860]  on and they go on air and talk about something that they haven't even looked into for themselves.
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:30.860]  Absolutely.
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:36.220]  I mean, there are countless videos, there's countless documentation of these all age
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.220]  drag shows.
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:39.620]  I mean, so many of them have gone viral.
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:42.340]  I would be shocked if this dude hasn't seen anything like that.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.340]  But we know, right?
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.700]  What do we know, Owen?
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:49.700]  We know that the left, deep state, the rhino types, all these people, the elites in power,
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.100]  they love children.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:52.860]  They love to sexualize children.
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.620]  They love pedophilia.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:57.380]  They love to see children with their clothes off.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:59.260]  I mean, this is out in the open.
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:00.260]  Everybody knows this.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:05.660]  So it's no surprise to me, you have some elite hack on TV just trying to tell the public,
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.220]  oh, none of this is going on.
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:08.220]  It's not going on at all.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:13.140]  And I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this, Owen, if you do go to one of these things,
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:15.860]  you have to go undercover, you want to know why?
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:20.060]  Because if you go there just out in the open and you pull out your phone and you start
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:23.420]  documenting what's happening, they freak the hell out.
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:25.300]  They start to scream at you.
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:29.620]  They start swatting at your phone and telling you you can't film because they're afraid
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:31.180]  of what's going to be revealed.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:35.180]  These books that they're reading to these kids are filled with pornography.
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:36.700]  They're sexualized themes.
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:42.220]  They're teaching the kids about homosexuality, transgenderism, like little kids.
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.620]  We documented this, so I would be willing to say this.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:50.380]  This guy probably knows exactly what's going on, but he probably has his own skeletons
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.220]  in his own closet and I'd be curious to see what those are.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.260]  I'll just say that.
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:58.440]  So and here's the trap that they've set.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.580]  They hold these events that are clearly hypersexualizing children.
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:06.060]  Then they go on TV and they say, oh, it's not happening.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:10.980]  But then, oh, by the way, you out there who are filming this, you're the ones that caused
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:12.740]  the shooting in Colorado.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:14.300]  So it's like this.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:19.220]  It's the circular logic trap that they have where they say, no, this isn't happening.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:23.620]  But by the way, you filming this and showing it happening is what's leading to the shooters
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:24.900]  like in Colorado.
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:28.500]  And then they blame Trump and they blame Lauren Boebert and they blame the media for reporting
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.500]  on it.
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.700]  And of course, what's the real origin story?
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.340]  We don't like children being abused.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:36.660]  We don't like children being sexualized.
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:40.420]  We don't want children being exposed to pornographic material in the classroom.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.740]  That's our problem.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:46.740]  And then somehow you're to blame because you don't want children being abused.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:51.220]  You're to blame in some psychotic who was already known to the FBI, already known to
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:54.300]  the FBI goes and shoots up a nightclub.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:57.180]  Well, I mean, take a look at this, right?
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:01.340]  Oh, and some of the most classic depictions of the devil, Baphomet, right?
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:05.420]  The half beast man, woman, naked body, all that.
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:11.620]  Some of the most classic depictions of that are drawings with Baphomet, with children
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:16.180]  to the side, little children looking up at Baphomet just fully with breasts hanging out
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:19.300]  in a male body and a half human.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.540]  That's exactly what you're seeing.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.060]  You could take one of those images.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:24.820]  I don't know if the crew could find one if there's tons of them on Google.
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:29.020]  You could take one of those depictions, put it right up against what's happening with
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.340]  these all age drag queen story hours.
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:33.980]  It is the exact same thing.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.940]  This agenda is satanic.
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.180]  It's demonic.
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:42.260]  It's been around for thousands of years, by the way, the exploitation of children and
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:47.420]  taking children and making pedophilia normalized in society has happened and it's gone through
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.140]  cycles through the Romans, the Corinthians.
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:55.140]  This has been going on for thousands of years and here we are in 2022 in the United States
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:58.340]  of America where we are the most powerful we've ever been, in my opinion.
[01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:00.340]  I think we continue to move forward.
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:04.700]  Things might look bad right now, but we should be able to be in a place where we are at the
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.020]  most advanced we've ever been, at least that's what they claim, right?
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:09.780]  But here we are going backward.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:13.700]  We're morally going backwards where we're sexually exploiting our children, where they
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:16.500]  think we're going forwards as civilization.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:20.100]  Just because we move forward technologically doesn't mean that we're moving forward civilly
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.460]  or morally or socially on a societal level because you could take that temperature.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:29.700]  You could determine where we are as a civilization by how we treat our children.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:34.220]  We're slaughtering our children, we're chopping their genitals off, chopping their penises,
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:38.180]  their breasts off, trying to call it normal like it's the same or the equivalent to going
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:42.740]  and getting a tattoo or getting a haircut, okay, aborting millions of babies for decades
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:44.660]  and here we are out in the open.
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:48.900]  There are Americans trying to normalize minor attracted persons and trying to say that what's
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:53.060]  taking place at the all age drag shows is not really happening.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:56.700]  That is where we are right now in America and it is quite literally total depravity.
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:01.260]  When the Bible talks about this stuff, all we can continue saying is that Jesus was right
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:02.420]  and that God was right.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.820]  He's always right because it always ends up being the case.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.460]  Well, that's what that's because I reached the same logical conclusion and it's just
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:11.780]  like, okay, I mean, God do your work here.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.980]  Like I can call it out.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:17.420]  I can say it's evil, but Lord, you're going to have to go to work here.
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:21.020]  But then you realize, wait a second, there's innocent children that are in the crosshairs.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.140]  There's innocent children that are being victimized by this.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:25.940]  I can't sit on the sideline and let this play out.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:28.820]  We have to do something to protect these children.
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:32.820]  But when you see this stuff, you can't help but think the worst of people.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.660]  You can't help but think the worst of these groups of people that would do this to kids
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:37.140]  and then lie about it.
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:41.980]  And I do believe this ties into the open border because now you're thinking, okay, the same
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:45.060]  people that push for the open border are the same people that are out here pushing for
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:48.940]  children to be sexualized in libraries and schools.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:55.180]  And you realize, wow, half a million unaccompanied minors have come across the border since
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:57.420]  Biden has been in the White House.
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:59.140]  Where do they all come from?
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:00.660]  Where do they all go?
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:06.020]  They have to realize there's obviously human trafficking, sex trafficking going on and yet
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:07.700]  no interest in stopping it.
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:11.420]  And then Mayorkas comes out and says, oh no, the border is secure.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:15.700]  So I'm sorry, you're lying to me about the border.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:18.820]  You're lying to me about sexualizing kids.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:21.380]  What is really behind all of this?
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:25.500]  It's like people don't even want to look behind that curtain and I don't blame them.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:29.420]  But I mean, we're talking about industrial levels of human trafficking at the southern
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:31.020]  border that they allow.
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:37.180]  We're talking about openly hypersexualizing children that they promote and allow.
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:40.740]  And we're just supposed to sit here and accept it.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.620]  Well, really think about it.
[01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:47.340]  You know, I mean, all roads, I've been saying this on my show over and over and over and
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:51.900]  over again is that all roads lead to the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, New World Order,
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:52.900]  right?
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.300]  Klaus Schwab is on record.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:57.380]  Anyone could just, with a simple Google search, okay?
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:00.340]  They don't even try and hide this on Google and you know this, right?
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:05.220]  With a simple Google search, you can Google, Klaus Schwab talks about revamping countries,
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:10.420]  not just the United States, revamping the social and economic structures of countries
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:12.220]  that's including the United States of America.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:18.940]  So as you watch systematically, all of our social fabrics be inverted and overturned,
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:23.500]  where once we valued the innocence of children as we should, according to God, right?
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.420]  But now we've turned it backwards and we sexualized children.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:31.220]  We murdered children in and outside of the womb and we botched and mutilated their genitals.
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:35.340]  Everything you've ever known about America is being turned upside down, law enforcement,
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:40.500]  the border, law and order, patriotism, nationalism as an American.
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:44.540]  Everything you've ever known is being turned upside down because there is an agenda out
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:46.700]  there to do just that.
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:51.660]  They use nonprofit organizations, they use non-government organizations, they use organizations
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:57.660]  like BLM, they use all these SJW organizations on the ground to cause this social change.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:02.140]  They even infiltrate Disney, they infiltrate corporations, they infiltrate the NBA, they
[01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:08.100]  infiltrate everything to change the social fabric so it becomes normalized in the mainstream
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:12.460]  where people begin to believe that this stuff is somehow, I guess, the norm.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:15.540]  I guess this is the norm now in the United States of America.
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.820]  Some popular podcasters on YouTube are coming out and saying, this is just normal now.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:23.700]  Why are right wingers having an issue with these drag shows with kids and stuff like
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:24.700]  that?
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:25.700]  I mean, it's 2022.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.700]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.980]  They're all used to bring this social change in the United States of America, which is
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:36.660]  pushing us toward pedophilia, which is pushing us toward murder, which is pushing us towards
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:37.660]  open borders.
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.840]  And by the way, people can go.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.300]  You could check the UN documents.
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:43.060]  Alex has covered this for years.
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:47.580]  You could Google World Economic Forum, how immigration has changed the world for the
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:48.580]  better.
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:54.940]  2016, they put this out and they clearly talk about that because of having a problem with
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.460]  repopulating countries, that is why we need mass migration.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:03.900]  And it causes more money and more revenue for these countries and the trillions of dollars.
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:05.860]  All of this is by design.
[01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:06.860]  It's not a conspiracy.
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:11.380]  So when you see the open borders, when you see the pedophilia, when you see the mass
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:16.540]  destabilization of our social fabrics of this society and the economy, know that it's coming
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:20.220]  from an entity, the World Economic Forum, the NWO.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:24.100]  And at the heart of that is Lucifer himself.
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.620]  That is Drew Hernandez.
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:29.340]  Drew, do one more segment with me on the other side, a five minute short segment.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:36.060]  And I want to ask you really the ultimate question that I'm just faced with myself today,
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:40.620]  sharing it all of this, dealing with all of it, trying to awaken the people to all of
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.620]  it.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:44.700]  I'm going to ask Drew Hernandez the ultimate question that I think we're all asking ourselves
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:49.180]  on the other side of this break.
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:55.940]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:58:00.500]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:04.940]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:09.780]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:13.380]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:19.540]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:23.540]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:28.060]  very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:32.020]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:36.820]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into

[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:47.820]  Don't wait, support the info war and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:55.420]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day counting
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:57.580]  these mail-in ballots.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:04.140]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.180]  election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:08.900]  And that's the problem.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:15.460]  And everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:20.460]  ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:25.060]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:27.060]  that can be stolen like this.
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:31.620]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:37.460]  problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:43.980]  question our election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:44.980]  way they are.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:48.980]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[01:59:48.980 --> 02:00:17.220]  Now, I'm in a position a lot like Drew Hernandez, where it's part of our work to have to stare
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:23.740]  at this crap all day long, deal with the propaganda, the child abuse, the lies from our government,
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:27.020]  and it's just on and on and on, and it does wear at you.
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:33.540]  But that's not what I'm here to discuss, it's to explain how we've reached, I'll speak
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:38.380]  for myself, how I've kind of reached this blockade, this wall, this logical conclusion
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:41.260]  of the question I asked Drew Hernandez now.
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:45.220]  Drew, how much more of this do our people have to take?
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:47.940]  How much more of this do our people have to take?
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:54.820]  The lies from the government, the sexual abuse of the children, the lies to get us into war,
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:01:01.300]  the two tiered justice system, the liberal supremacy, the just over the top blatant evil.
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:05.700]  How much more must our people take, Drew Hernandez?
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:09.900]  I think when you take a look at history, I think the answer to that question is clear.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:14.300]  I think whenever there's real tyranny taking place, you're going to see an uprising in
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:20.860]  humanity because the spirit of freedom, it transcends culture, it transcends language,
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:26.340]  it transcends race, it transcends throughout humanity because the spirit of freedom was
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:31.300]  given to us by God, that is why the Founding Fathers clearly made it clear that these are
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.740]  inalienable God-given rights.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:38.420]  When you see that become violated and where some serious tyranny is taking place in societies,
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:40.940]  you see an uprising in humanity.
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:44.500]  I think right now, when it comes to the pedophilia and when it comes to what's taking place
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:48.780]  with all these agendas unfolding with the open borders and everything taking place with
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:53.980]  the World Economic Forum, literally imposing this on our country through policy, that's
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:58.980]  why people like Chuck Schumer are coming out and saying they want to legalize 11 million
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:03.060]  plus while saying that it's a repopulation problem.
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:05.660]  That is World Economic Forum talking point.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:10.260]  What I want to see, number one, is our so-called elected leaders.
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:14.100]  Anyone that's America first, I've been saying this for the past year, anyone that's America
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:17.620]  first or that claims to be a patriot or that claims to care about the United States of
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:22.860]  America or its well-being or our children, if they're not calling out the World Economic
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:27.900]  Forum, if the name Klaus Schwab is not in their mouth, if they're not calling out these
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:35.860]  people that are clearly off-shores in foreign lands, making decisions for the future of
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:41.300]  the United States of America, if our so-called leaders are not calling this stuff out and
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.620]  working proactively against it through legislation, through laws pushing back on these foreign
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:49.140]  entities, I don't trust them.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:50.140]  I don't trust them at all.
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:53.500]  I don't care how many times you say America first, I don't care how many times you say
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:55.660]  you love the United States of America.
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:59.980]  If you are not calling out, in my opinion, the most dangerous threat to this country
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:04.900]  right now, China's up there as well, but the World Economic Forum and this globalist agenda,
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:06.740]  I take huge issue with you.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:12.500]  I think anybody, whether they're in office, in media, in some kind of position of power
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:17.540]  or influence in our culture right now in America that is not calling this out and actively
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:21.220]  working against it, in my opinion, is a threat and a part of the problem.
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:23.380]  I think that's a start.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:29.780]  You know, and that kind of brings us to the inevitable situation with Trump and the primaries
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:33.220]  and again, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, Ron DeSantis hasn't announced he's running
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:37.500]  so we don't know if he's going to run or not, but the other day, Ron DeSantis said, anything
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:41.180]  World Economic Forum will be dead on arrival in Florida.
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:44.260]  That's the messaging right there.
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:49.700]  I totally agree and I'm not quite too sure what's going on between Trump and DeSantis.
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:56.020]  All I know is that Christ said this and made it very clear, a house divided amongst itself
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:57.380]  shall not stand.
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:00.220]  That is a guaranteed statement from Christ.
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:03.220]  So, I mean, I'm all for a good primary, right?
[02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:06.820]  I mean, people that are new to politics might see this as like, oh my gosh, they're going
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:07.820]  to have a primary.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:13.100]  I'm okay with a primary, but I think the base within the base and you know what I'm talking
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:14.100]  about, right?
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:18.460]  No one, we have the Republican Party, we have the right, but then we have America first.
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:20.620]  We have make America great again.
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:24.820]  We have the kind of departure of the establishment which came from Donald Trump.
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:29.300]  I think splitting that right now is going to cause some serious issues for us moving
[02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:31.620]  forward and I think that's by design as well.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:35.580]  So I think we need to stay unified as much as possible, but at the same time, we need
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:39.460]  to call out anyone that is a part of the establishment and get them out because they're
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:41.420]  going to become a bigger problem in the future.
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:42.660]  Drew Hernan is great stuff.
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:44.700]  Tell everybody where they can follow you in 10 seconds.
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:47.540]  You guys can follow me on Twitter at DrewHLive.
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:49.700]  Check the link in the bio to my show and all that good stuff.
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:50.700]  Thank you all.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:51.700]  Great stuff as always from Drew Hernan.
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:55.660]  All right, folks, big news out of Maricopa County on the other side.
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:05:03.660]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here, we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:09.700]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.980]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:16.340]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:20.220]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:21.220]  the year.
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:25.460]  We're going to be sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:30.340]  award-winning coffee and now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Real Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:35.700]  Formula, so many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:41.900]  Beats, Secret 12, they are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:46.340]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:53.020]  sold out at infowarstore.com, promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:55.020]  giant savings at infowarstore.com.
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:06:24.980]  Thank you so much for your support and God Bless.
[01:49:37.960 --> 02:06:36.180]  Michael Schaper has been looking into some of the anomalies leading up to
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:46.300]  and during the election in Arizona, specifically Maricopa County and he joins us now to discuss
[02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:52.140]  what it is he's found and I do believe, like I had been saying, there will be a little
[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:57.500]  bit of a fight in Arizona, definitely Kerry Lake's campaign pushing back, but other investigative
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:02.460]  journalists, analysts are finding some odd stuff too and that's why right now, they've
[02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:07.620]  even said there were so many problems, they're going to pause certification, so Michael Schaper
[02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:08.620]  joins me now.
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:13.220]  I mean, Michael, all the anomalies, the voting machine shutting down, the people being turned
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:18.380]  away, I mean, what is the biggest story right now from your perspective out of Maricopa
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:19.380]  County?
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:25.820]  I think the biggest stories I want to thank you for having me are ones that can lead to
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:33.460]  the nullification of the elections, not only in Arizona, but as many as 34 other states
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:37.620]  that support the Help America Vote Act, known as the Hava Act.
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:42.660]  I think the solutions, the path there is the most important thing we can be talking and
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:43.940]  hear about.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:48.620]  So talk about that because that's not something that I really hear much about.
[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:49.620]  Like that.
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:56.900]  So I happen to own a laboratory which is accredited to the ISO standards, the same standards that
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:01.100]  the test labs receive an accreditation to.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:07.060]  They have another accreditation that pertains to the Hava Act and the EAC, the Election
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:09.220]  Assistance Commission.
[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:18.500]  And if we go back in time, 2018, their accreditation had expired when the voting machines
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.940]  were certified.
[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:26.500]  So if you're not accredited, you can't certify if your accreditation has expired or you
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:27.740]  don't have an accreditation.
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:31.260]  It's just like if you and your girlfriend go to your neighbor and say, we have married
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:35.700]  us, and he's not an ordained pastor or chaplain, you're not married.
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.820]  If you tend to be married, you may think you're married, but you're not.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.340]  So it's like an expired driver's license kind of?
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:48.380]  Yes, you can't drive if you're a police badge is withdrawn, you can't go do police work.
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:51.860]  It's like anything that realtors, if you lose your license, you can't sell real estate
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.180]  on and on and on.
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:55.100]  We understand that very well.
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:09:02.860]  And so these labs had expired accreditations and they, I'm not sure how they represented
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:06.500]  themselves and I'm not sure why our secretary of state didn't figure this out, but-
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:09.300]  You're about Katie Hobbs, Secretary of State?
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:10.300]  Yes.
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.300]  Oh, how convenient.
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:12.300]  That's Secretary of State.
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:13.300]  Yeah, I don't know how she didn't figure it out either.
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:14.300]  Oh.
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:19.980]  Well, going back to 2018, she ran against a man by the name of Steve Gaynor, who also
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:23.100]  recently was in the primaries for a governor's seat.
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:25.860]  So the two of them ran this race.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:28.380]  Those machines were not certified.
[02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:33.980]  They cast the boats through the machines and Steve Gaynor won the election, the night
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:34.980]  of the election.
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:42.180]  Ducey, the governor, congratulated him according to the story they'd heard, and he woke up
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:46.260]  the next day to find out that something very unusual had happened during the course of
[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:47.260]  the evening.
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:52.500]  Ballots came from somewhere and changed the election from Steve Gaynor to Katie Hobbs.
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:57.740]  That shows she won her first election and became Secretary of State.
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:05.980]  So fast forward into 2020, the labs had not updated their accreditations, but what had
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:11.700]  happened and we have a team of great people that have been keeping eyes on this over the
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:18.980]  years, these published accreditations, interestingly, had changed information.
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:22.420]  So they went from a two-year to a three-year accreditation.
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:26.620]  The problem with that is the law and the rules under the VSTL manual in accordance with
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:31.780]  NIST are two years, so you can't have a three-year accreditation.
[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:36.860]  Over further time, if you look at and investigate this, there were signatures that were signed
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:43.460]  the accreditations that, according to the manual, were not allowed to sign those accreditations.
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:48.740]  And so the facts have changed over the period of time to try to go back in time and make
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:53.420]  what was right, or sorry, what was wrong right, and you can't go back in time, according
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:58.660]  to the Maxons of Law, change something in the future and make it apply backwards and
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:04.900]  make something that happened that was unlawful in the past become right.
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:14.660]  So if you just connect the dots, so machines are not accredited because the accreditation
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:18.700]  labs were not accredited at that time, so they're technically not certified.
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:23.860]  So if you have an uncertified machine and you put a ballot through it, is there some
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:27.700]  way an uncertified machine can create a certified vote on the other end?
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:29.180]  You cannot.
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:34.060]  And so if these are uncertified ballots, you cannot certify an election.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:38.700]  People may go through the motions, they may play an act, but lawfully it's an uncertified
[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:43.180]  election and this is serious business, not only in the state of Arizona, but with every
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:49.140]  state across the United States that has adopted the Hava Act, this same problem applies because
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:52.380]  it's the same voting machines and it's the same test labs.
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:56.260]  There are only two test labs that do this, so it's the same two test labs that travel
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:12:00.900]  around the United States to certify voting machines and if both were expired, then the
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:07.420]  vote permeates across the United States and this is something that I believe can change
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:12.380]  not only our election but other states' elections, but people have to take a look at the laws
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:23.940]  and in the case of Arizona, it's Arizona Revised Statute 16-442, B is a Bravo, 16-442, B is
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:30.860]  a Bravo says that the voting machines must, not shall must be certified, they must be
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:31.860]  certified.
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:32.860]  Well, by who?
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:38.620]  By an accredited test lab, an accredited test lab, not an expired accreditation but
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:43.980]  accredited and these labs were not and this can turn into, I think, a great blessing for
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:49.260]  our country and we pray that this information gets out, people come to understand it and
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:52.180]  we'll do something about it and the people need to stand up.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:56.580]  It can't be just five guys on the front lines, the people have to stand up about this fact
[02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:57.580]  and bring it.
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:01.420]  Yeah, absolutely and I think that there's certainly some fight in Arizona, I don't know
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:05.380]  anywhere else right now, but Arizona, it looks like there's definitely going to be at least
[02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:09.700]  a little bit of a fight there but I don't want to rehash the past, it's just I listen
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:15.140]  to you say all this stuff and it just reminds me, this is essentially without the exact
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:19.860]  details but overall, it's essentially the exact same thing that happened in 2020 where
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:25.260]  all these different states basically illegally changed, unconstitutively changed the way
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:29.340]  that they can accept and take ballots from the mail-in ballots to the drop boxes, all
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:33.740]  unconstitutional but they just said under color of law and COVID that we're going to
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:38.900]  be taking these ballots and that's why President Trump said now, wait a second, these are unconstitutional
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:42.820]  votes, they shouldn't be counted and this is what they wanted to investigate on January
[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:46.540]  6th, of course we know the rest of the story there but I just can't help hearing everything
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:51.180]  you're saying, it echoes the same story from then but let's bring it to today, this is
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:52.540]  the relevant story.
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:58.140]  How much interest is there from your analysis here, how much interest is there from the
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:04.220]  Attorney General in Arizona or rather even the entire nation, Attorney's General, how
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:07.100]  much interest is there to actually look at this?
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:13.060]  So the team that I work alongside, this team has given this information to the Attorney
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:18.740]  General's office one or multiple times, I've spoken to Jennifer Wright at the Attorney
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:25.300]  General's office about it, we've had it in front of the Senator Fan, the head of the
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:31.620]  House or Senate rather, we've had it in front of Rusty Bauer, the head of our House here
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:36.700]  in Arizona, it's been read on the floor of the House in Arizona, it's been submitted
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:44.380]  into the documentation of both the Senate and the House in Arizona, we've taken it
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:50.700]  to and approached the sheriffs who we asked to on the basis of this, investigated and
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:56.100]  if you need to seize the voting machines, they have not been willing to seize the voting
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:00.600]  machines which are tools and instruments of a stolen election.
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:09.300]  So we have gone up and down, we think the gamut, it's gone in front of the courts for
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:15.260]  six times, Daniel Woods was a candidate that has brought the suit multiple times along
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:20.420]  with some other team members, the suit's been rejected from the courts, the judges
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:28.540]  do not want to hear it and to your point before is that if the government is not doing their
[02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:35.340]  job, they work for the people, they are our servants and constitutionally, we the people
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:40.500]  need to decide that they need to be removed and have an opportunity to reform a government
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:46.500]  at every level and I think that this is where the scale is going for the people who have
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.900]  to stand up to make these changes.
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:52.100]  Let me ask you after this break, we'll be right back, four minute break, let me ask
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:57.700]  you how you think this might apply or apply it to nationwide with the voting systems.
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:02.660]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:08.140]  truly earned the title of Top G, but there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has
[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:14.260]  enraged the globalist, he is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:20.220]  two years and that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:27.100]  Now Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:54.540]  Men grow up to be like me, you're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:59.780]  record dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:04.620]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:09.500]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job and I heard
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.500]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:16.100]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good and
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:20.020]  then shortly thereafter you came out with that, you know with a deep burn source, you
[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:24.100]  know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:29.780]  brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know I could think again,
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:34.700]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:39.380]  my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:40.380]  amazing supplements.
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:44.700]  The one I like recently is knockout, literally like if you want to sleep just take it, it's
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:45.700]  amazing, it works.
[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:49.740]  But anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:53.740]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:54.740]  own hands.
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:58.260]  Beautifully said brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:02.100]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:03.340]  Why is this taking so long?
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:07.500]  In France they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day, why can't we do
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:08.500]  this here?
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:12.380]  The answer is fraud and corruption, if we don't fix the system.
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:16.740]  It doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis.
[02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:20.620]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:27.380]  to deny us Arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:32.940]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:37.020]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:40.860]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else, communications are the
[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:42.540]  reason why we didn't well.
[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:47.740]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important, that's why they're so desperate to take you
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:49.580]  off the air Alex.
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:51.700]  You don't need to get behind infowars.
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:56.900]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:59.660]  We need more of these communications, not less.
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:05.140]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:12.060]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:17.580]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:26.740]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,

[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:40.660]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:42.500]  care.
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:50.700]  Then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health advice.
[02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:59.940]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:26.940]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:36.220]  Michael Shaver is with us, breaking down why the Arizona elections need to be contested.
[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:42.740]  These are basic, we're not even talking about conspiracy theories here or shenanigans on
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:49.460]  election days, but just straight up law where the lack of certification of these machines.
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:54.100]  This isn't a conspiracy theory, I don't know how you would try to explain this to people.
[02:20:54.100 --> 02:21:00.260]  This is just basic law and they don't even use it, but you're also talking about how
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:03.420]  this could apply to other states as well.
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:08.940]  Just recap how this is just basic law not being followed, not conspiracy theory, not
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:13.180]  voter problems during the election day or any of that stuff, but just basic law not
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:17.580]  being followed and then get into how this might apply to other states that may be doing
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:18.580]  the same thing.
[02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:25.940]  Yes, this is just a simple element of law, if I drive too fast, I break the law, I have
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:27.340]  a penalty to pay.
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:32.860]  In this case, a law was broken, the voting machines must be certified by an accredited
[02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:34.260]  test lab, they weren't.
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:35.260]  Simple as that.
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:40.780]  We have the evidence to show that, so the votes can't be certified, they're uncertifiable
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:46.460]  and like it or not, it's a nullified election, then it's a revoke and it's a hand count.
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:54.380]  It's a very simple solution, nullify, revote and hand count of paper ballots.
[02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:55.380]  Simple as that.
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:59.260]  They've been doing it for hundreds of years, no reason we can't restart that.
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:03.620]  The machines steal the elections in many different ways.
[02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:09.340]  The Help America Vote Act has been adopted across the United States and it's my belief
[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:12.260]  that it could be as many as 34 states.
[02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:21.300]  People look up in your revised statutes to see if your state has adopted the Hava Act
[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:27.340]  and if so, this law likely applies to you and it's the same test labs testing all across
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:34.740]  the country, it would apply to you and you could assert this as well in your states.
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:38.980]  So I encourage you all to investigate the Hava Act, whether or not your state has it
[02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:41.620]  and if it does, then what we're doing, you can do.
[02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:46.460]  This is happening down in Cochise where the Secretary of State's office says, don't worry,
[02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:50.700]  it's all certified, don't worry about it, well, Cochise said, well, time out.
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:54.820]  Bring us the evidence, bring us the evidence and so we're looking forward to seeing what
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:59.300]  evidence is brought at that point in time about these voting machines.
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:08.300]  So tune in to Cochise County, Arizona, a meeting on Monday, 10 a.m. Arizona time, also available
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:14.300]  on Zoom, if you search the Cochise County meetings, you can find that on the web and
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:18.540]  just determine what Zoom meeting, if you want to participate, you can come in and see what's
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:20.500]  happening there.
[02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:33.500]  You can also contact us, email 2020isnullified at PM.me, at PM, Papa Mike.me, Mike Echo.
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:39.780]  We have a website, 2020isnullified.com, you can check in there and we'll try to keep everybody
[02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:41.980]  informed as to what's happening here.
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:47.820]  There are boots on the ground here trying to assimilate, pull this all together to support
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:54.500]  and we intend this to bring us into the courts again and we just prayerfully ask that these
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:24:00.740]  judges do their jobs and listen to what's happened here in Arizona and make decisions
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:05.340]  for the people, otherwise they're in violation of our constitution, they're in violation
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:10.300]  of the oath of their office and their duties and responsibilities and we have a right as
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:16.460]  a people to overthrow such government that's not doing their job.
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:22.060]  So we appreciate your time and attention today, we hope you've taken some notes, we hope that
[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:28.780]  we can help you in some way and we are convinced that this can change the outcome of the elections
[02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:33.460]  across the United States and potentially even go backwards to earlier elections that were
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:38.780]  similarly approved when they were in fact nullified.
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:45.180]  Well thank you for laying all that out and folks, that last 60 to 120 seconds that he
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:46.740]  just laid out is so important.
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:51.500]  Take that information that he just gave you, how to reach out, how to get involved and
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:56.860]  share that far and wide so that we can at least get some more eyes and more ears and
[02:24:56.860 --> 02:25:01.240]  more attention on this and the right decision can be made here.
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.940]  And so what I like to do though is whenever I'm kind of trying to ballpark these things
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:12.180]  and get my foresight, I'll ask myself, if I'm a gambling man what do I think will happen?
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:16.780]  Because you tend to forget your biases when you're talking about putting skin in the game.
[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:21.020]  Michael if you're a gambling man, how do you think this goes?
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:26.820]  Well it's been an uphill battle and I'll tell you why, what's missing not only all the legislators
[02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:31.260]  the sheriffs, the judges, what's missing is the people.
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:38.020]  When we go to the Board of Supervisors as I did last week and worked with a great guy
[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:43.220]  Matt who interviewed me and he's got dreadlocks and I've got a suit and it's two people like
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:44.460]  that working together.
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:49.780]  We need to work together as a people, stick back what did our founders do?
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:54.900]  They came together folks, we have to come together, the churches, you all pastors have
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:26:00.660]  got to inform and educate your church, your people, our people have got to come to these
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:01.660]  things.
[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:05.100]  If we have a Trump rally in town there's 50,000 people, if we're going to nullify the
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:07.580]  election there's 15, 20 of us.
[02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:12.700]  We have got to stand up people, this is your country, this is our country and if we don't
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:17.100]  do something about it now, there's nothing that's changing in these future elections.
[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:22.460]  We've got to fix this election, we have to nullify it and we have to refute, it's been
[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:27.740]  done many times in the history of the country, revotes, you can look up revote elections
[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:34.700]  and find cases where this has occurred, you can't contact our legislators, they're not
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:38.340]  doing anything, the sheriffs are not doing anything, the judges are not doing anything
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:44.100]  and we just pray that they handle God's on us as we come together in His name to affect
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:50.340]  things here in our country, to save our country like our founders did from the British.
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:54.780]  Well, we'll be praying for you and we'll be praying that you get the people support you
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:27:01.140]  need to hopefully right this terrible wrong and then use that as a precedent and a case
[02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:04.820]  example of how it wasn't just limited to Arizona.
[02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:06.740]  Michael, thank you so much for joining me today.
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.620]  Yeah, God bless you all, thank you.
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:09.620]  Thank you.
[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:14.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, wow, okay, huge information just laid out here and what's
[02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:21.820]  unfortunate is that that is not going to get enough coverage.
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:26.020]  Michael Schaefer and his call to action that he just made is not going to get near enough
[02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:33.060]  coverage and it's good that InfoWars is still here on air to bring you this information
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:37.740]  and hopefully get the peaceful political activism.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:42.500]  But this is why they have a censored, folks, this is why they try to kick Alex Jones off
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:47.460]  of the internet and keep these shows off the internet because of stuff like that, that
[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:53.180]  if we could unite around and rally around, we could actually have some true grassroots
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:58.580]  activism successes more so than we've seen in the past, absolutely.
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:04.220]  But that's why they censor this transmission, folks, and you just don't get it like this
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:05.740]  anywhere else.
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:12.060]  Now, as part of Thanksgiving, you see the turkeys behind me, it is the Thanksgiving
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:17.060]  season and so we are giving thanks to you and the audience for all your support, keeping

[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:15.660]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products have already sold out and because
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:19.100]  of supply chain breakdowns, it will be months and months until these great products come
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:20.100]  back in.
[02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:27.100]  X3 sold out, our great American coffee blend has sold out, Biotrystallinium has sold out,
[02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:33.620]  but what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric

[02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:58.580]  on the air while empowering your body, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:04.460]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:09.820]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:13.700]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:14.700]  to speak freely.
[02:30:14.700 --> 02:30:40.020]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:58.540]  they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:02.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year, starting in mid-November
[02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:03.740]  through Christmas.
[02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:09.460]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:17.260]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776, but on top of it, double Patriot points and
[02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:19.860]  what makes this the most special sale ever.
[02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:25.020]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big, and it's all randomly
[02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:28.540]  selected by the shopping cart computer.
[02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:33.540]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5, you might order the blowout t-shirt sale for
[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:39.620]  $4.95 and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800.
[02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:43.660]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs, some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks,
[02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:47.940]  some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.700]  There are hundreds of different items.
[02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:54.660]  It's all random, infowarsstore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:59.580]  Free gifts for every order at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:04.460]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:10.660]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:11.660]  world.
[02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:16.540]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:17.540]  deserve the credit.
[02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:22.460]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support infowars are the real
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:25.020]  reason you've had the success.
[02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:29.820]  You're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order you've
[02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:30.820]  ever had.
[02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:36.820]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:40.820]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:43.980]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:44.980]  God bless you all.
[02:32:44.980 --> 02:32:45.980]  I salute you.
[02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:46.980]  I thank you.
[02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:52.300]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history
[02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:53.300]  is happening.
[02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:59.300]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:10.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:25.220]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:44.500]  your host, Owen Troyer, and we're now joined by one Robert Barnes, famously known in a famous
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:49.340]  court case as Bobby, Bobby Barnes, Bobby Barnes, we had some fun with that.
[02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:50.740]  He joins me now.
[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:54.860]  I mean, look, there's so much clown world behavior going on, and I want to play this
[02:33:54.860 --> 02:34:02.140]  Korean Jean Pierre clip, but I mean, how, how clown world is it that Anthony Fauci in,
[02:34:02.140 --> 02:34:07.700]  I guess what it will be considered his retirement speech, I suppose today, in his final words,
[02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:13.020]  just shilling for Big Pharma, just letting you know who he really is, a big pharmaceutical
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:14.020]  shill.
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:20.740]  In my final words, I just want to remind everybody to take your COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:24.300]  Thank you, Anthony Fauci, for telling us who you truly are in your final words.
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:26.660]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:33.500]  Well, as ridiculous as probably his whole career and tenure, and reflective and representative
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:36.900]  of who and what he always was throughout his tenure.
[02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:42.740]  This is someone who is about promoting the concentration of medical power in the hands
[02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:48.460]  of the federal government and big corporations, including especially Big Pharma.
[02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:54.060]  He's someone who not only managed to go decades without successfully resolving many of the
[02:34:54.060 --> 02:34:59.620]  public health crises that he said he would solve and resolve, whether that was, and in
[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:03.860]  fact, along the way, almost always, caused more harm than good.
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:09.580]  He will go down, I think, as one of the worst public health officials in world history,
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:14.660]  not just American history, someone who inflicted far more harm, you know, the rule, you know,
[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:17.340]  the first rule of doctors first do no harm.
[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:23.460]  This is someone who caused more harm than he resolved or solved or helped cure or prevent
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:24.980]  or protect against.
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:30.020]  He was someone who enriched himself, enriched his family, empowered himself, empowered other
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:35.060]  bureaucrats within the government at the expense of the interest of not only the public, but
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:37.140]  the interest of public health.
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:38.140]  That's reflective.
[02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:39.220]  There's no better example.
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:45.940]  He couldn't better sum up his career than his exiting on promoting the most dangerous
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:51.260]  drug disguised and relabeled as a vaccine in American history.
[02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:59.060]  A so-called vaccine that has done more damage than all the vaccines before it combined in
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:06.460]  American history, according to the government's own vaccine adverse event report system.
[02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:09.340]  And so it's kind of emblematic.
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:14.420]  This is a guy who is trying to help use public career started by telling people they could
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:21.420]  get HIV in their kitchen, and it finishes with telling people to take a drug disguised
[02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:27.220]  as a vaccine that inoculates against nothing, and that is neither safe nor effective, that
[02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:33.740]  is more likely to cause the average person harm than it is to cause them benefit.
[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:37.720]  So nothing better sums up his career than the COVID-19 vaccine and the disaster and
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:44.260]  debacle of Anthony Fauci is representative of the disaster and debacle that our public
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:48.700]  health authorities at Big Pharma have been for the last half century.
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:54.740]  And perhaps this final moment with Karine Jean-Pierre is just the perfect representation
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:58.380]  of the complete debacle that she is as well with Fauci.
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:37:25.380]  Here's a clip from earlier today.
[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:33.500]  I hear the question, but we're not doing this the way you want it.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:34.500]  This is a disrespectful.
[02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:35.500]  It is.
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:36.500]  I'm done.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:38.500]  Simon, I'm done.
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:39.500]  I'm Simon, I'm done.
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:40.500]  Yeah, you're done.
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:41.500]  I'm done with you right now.
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:42.500]  You were done before you got started.
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:45.500]  So this is incredible.
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:53.180]  So I mean, I'm almost enthused about this from the press gaggle in there actually wanting
[02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:56.580]  a question asked and answered.
[02:37:56.580 --> 02:37:58.900]  What has gotten it's like, what has gotten into the water?
[02:37:58.900 --> 02:38:01.100]  Are they pumping pure oxygen into the press room now?
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:02.540]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:07.140]  The media is actually demanding real answers to real questions and they're standing up
[02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:09.180]  for one another when they don't get it.
[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:13.180]  But just so people understand, they were asking about the origins of COVID-19 to Fauci.
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:14.900]  Who lied about that?
[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:16.020]  We know it came out of a lab.
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:17.020]  We knew it the whole time.
[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:20.380]  Fauci lied, lied again, lied again after that and then Karine Jean-Pierre and the Biden
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:22.820]  White House continued to lie about it.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:27.740]  I mean, so what do you make of this where it's reaching this point now where it's just
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:32.740]  too obvious that they lied to us, not just about the vaccines, but the origins of COVID
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:33.900]  and all of it.
[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:37.500]  And then you see the White House press secretary saying, we're not answering these questions.
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:39.180]  We're doing this our way.
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:40.180]  Oh, really?
[02:38:40.180 --> 02:38:42.380]  That sounds like authoritarianism to me.
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:48.340]  Well, remember when Trump merely had people take a mic from someone who was trying to
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:53.940]  hog it and give it to someone else, they called him all kinds of authoritarian dictator, etc.
[02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:58.860]  The Biden administration does this on the regular and very little is said about it in
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:00.020]  the press.
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:04.580]  But the entire aspect is representative, it's sort of a parallel.
[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:10.820]  The history of the origin of COVID and its cover-up by Anthony Fauci, who helped orchestrate
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:16.820]  it while he was running our public health policy in America, is emblematic of the other
[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:21.940]  aspect of both AIDS and vaccine, which is if you look at the book The River, a French
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:29.460]  journalist had gone into great detail to research and review the origin of AIDS and HIV.
[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:35.540]  And what they found as the most plausible explanation was that it was a vaccine experiment
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:43.420]  gone AWOL, a polio vaccine experiment gone AWOL in West Africa and in the Belgian Congo.
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:49.060]  And in fact, there was extraordinary ties they were able to build in the actual geography
[02:39:49.060 --> 02:39:54.260]  of the origin of AIDS as it didn't come from apes or monkeys as was talked about.
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:59.180]  The most logical explanation was instead, this was a rushed vaccine that led to one
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:02.780]  of the great public health disasters in the last century.
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:08.780]  In the same capacity here, we have COVID likely being created as part of the bio weapons
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:13.060]  research that's not supposed to happen, the gain of function research that's not supposed
[02:40:13.060 --> 02:40:19.420]  to happen, that the Obama administration promised the US was no longer involved with it in 2014.
[02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:24.180]  And instead what Fauci did is he outsourced it in the deep state outsourced it and it
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:33.540]  led to US people officials being involved in creating COVID potentially in Chinese labs,
[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:39.380]  Chinese labs that were receiving money directly or indirectly from Anthony Fauci himself.
[02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:43.820]  And when there was public discussion about this as it arose, which people right away
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:49.020]  in the medical community were saying this does not look like a natural occurring virus.
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:52.100]  This looks like a man made virus.
[02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:57.060]  And Fauci went to great lengths to cover that up, got the press to suppress it and censor
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:02.140]  it, got Twitter to censor it, got YouTube to censor it, got Facebook to censor it,
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:08.660]  the big social media magnets all conspired to hide this truth from the American people.
[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:13.140]  And who knows what the public response to COVID would have been had people known it
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:18.780]  was a deliberate bio weapon that was created with the help of Anthony Fauci and the Chinese
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:25.660]  government that conspired to cover up its origins and its original sourcing as being
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:31.620]  part of what Francis Bacon, others have warned about, Francis Boyle have warned about, which
[02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:34.420]  is that this is what happens with bio weapons research.
[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:37.500]  You do bio weapons research, you get these kinds of outcomes.
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:42.780]  And they just did the mass medical experimentation on the whole world in response to it to see
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:47.540]  whether they could get social and political and individual compliance, elevate public
[02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:52.700]  health authorities at the expense of democratically elected officials, get people to not to arrest
[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:58.260]  themselves and arrest their own family members in their own home, to have mass house arrest,
[02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:02.460]  strip people of their businesses, deny them their property, deprive them of their freedom,
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:06.500]  not allow them to sing in church because somehow that would be dangerous, not even allow them
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:12.340]  to go to church because somehow that was more problematic than going to a bar or going to
[02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:17.260]  other places that in many contexts, the gyms, yoga places, some of those were left open
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.260]  but churches closed.
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:24.140]  It was a mass social experiment that Anthony Fauci is the principal culprit for propagating
[02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:29.020]  and that will always be his legacy and nothing he says and no answers they dodge will ever
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:30.940]  evade that truth.
[02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:37.020]  I would say if there's two bookends that are the true story of Anthony Fauci.
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:42.740]  It's the AIDS epidemic where his protocols killed so many people that they made a movie
[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:47.220]  about it called the Dallas Buyers Club to now the promotion of the vaccine with his
[02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:52.380]  final breaths as the highest paid government employee promoting a big pharmaceutical product
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:58.780]  that has killed tens of thousands of people on record so far.
[02:42:58.780 --> 02:43:05.540]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:10.100]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:14.540]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:19.380]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:22.980]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:43:22.980 --> 02:43:29.780]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:34.860]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:37.700]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[02:43:37.700 --> 02:43:41.620]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:46.340]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:29.740]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:30.740]  had.
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:37.460]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:41.420]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:44.260]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:49.940]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:53.820]  now because we are over the target and this grief is happening.
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:58.980]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:01.540]  It's a post COVID world now.
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:05.300]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:06.540]  There's a solution.
[02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:07.540]  The wellness company.
[02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:12.180]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief scientific officer and I can tell you firsthand
[02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:18.820]  that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand, prescriptions

[02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:39.460]  general medical care but also COVID-19, acute and post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:45.900]  and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new world that we're
[02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:46.900]  living in.
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:53.580]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[02:45:53.580 --> 02:45:57.100]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:04.740]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stole day by day counting
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:11.580]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:16.500]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:20.820]  That's the problem and everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:27.700]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:29.740]  mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:32.100]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:37.020]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and I believe
[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:42.100]  that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying
[02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:47.500]  that and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our
[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:54.340]  election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:58.980]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:18.460]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:23.380]  Bob Barnes with us here on the Alex Jones show and of course, Bob, you've been involved
[02:47:23.380 --> 02:47:28.460]  with a lot of the litigation, the lawsuits pushing back against the vaccine mandates
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:30.260]  and everything else.
[02:47:30.260 --> 02:47:32.220]  Where does all that stand right now?
[02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:36.300]  What do the victims of vaccines have as far as the legal system is concerned?
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:37.740]  What leverage do they have?
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:39.340]  What traction do we have?
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:43.460]  And where are your lawsuits going right now?
[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:48.140]  So right now, one of them is the Children's Health Defense case against the Food and Drug
[02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:53.580]  Administration that is pending before the federal district court there in Waco, Texas,
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:59.620]  the western district of Texas, and the suit was brought to stop the FDA and the government
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:03.980]  from continuing to lie about these vaccines to kid.
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:08.340]  So in particular, what the government has gone out and done, the Administrative Procedures
[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:13.660]  Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity that allows you to sue the government when an agency
[02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:20.180]  takes an action that has a detrimental impact on you or your organization.
[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:25.420]  So here Children's Health Defense plus a number of parents brought suit because the agency
[02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:33.580]  action at issue was the FDA promoting a drug as a safe, effective vaccine to little kids,
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:37.300]  saying it was safe for kids, saying it was effective for kids, calling it even a vaccine
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:43.620]  for kids and claiming there was an emergency that kids faced from COVID-19 that allowed
[02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:46.580]  them to do and promote it the way they were.
[02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:51.980]  This included using Big Bird to promote the drug to kids.
[02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:56.820]  This included using Elmo to promote the drug to kids.
[02:48:56.820 --> 02:49:04.300]  This included having drug companies in collusion with the FDA actually run ads calling children,
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.860]  telling children, ads that target children.
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:12.300]  They can be a superhero today if they go and take this so-called vaccine.
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:18.020]  The problem of course is that the drug is not a vaccine, it's not a vaccine in the common
[02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:22.380]  understanding of the American people, which is the most relevant and pertinent and material
[02:49:22.380 --> 02:49:28.460]  legal test, but it is also not a vaccine by the FDA's own definition up until a year ago
[02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:29.460]  or so.
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:34.780]  The FDA went in and changed the definition of the word vaccine itself so they could
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:38.540]  mislabel and lie to people that this drug was a vaccine.
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:44.020]  The drug of course does not inoculate against disease, either it's either you infection
[02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:49.060]  or transmission, which is what people understood and historically is supposed to be the definition
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:50.620]  of the word vaccine.
[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:54.220]  But even worse, this drug is neither effective nor safe.
[02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:59.140]  We know that now without dispute and controversy from data and information around the world.
[02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:03.300]  Indeed, it is increasingly the vaccinated that are getting sick.
[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:07.540]  It is increasingly the COVID vaccinated that are getting hospitalized.
[02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:10.980]  It is increasingly the COVID vaccinated that are dying.
[02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:18.020]  Indeed, the excess mortality data from a wide range of states and countries around the world
[02:50:18.020 --> 02:50:25.140]  reveal that the biggest surge in excess deaths wasn't during COVID, but has been during the
[02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:28.620]  mass issuance of this so-called vaccine.
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:33.420]  And so it's not a safe drug, it's not an effective drug, it's not even a vaccine.
[02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:36.660]  There is no emergency facing children from COVID.
[02:50:36.660 --> 02:50:41.980]  These face a higher risk from the seasonal flu than they do from COVID.
[02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:48.380]  So these are big lies, four or five big lies, depending on how you define the agency action.
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:54.140]  So we brought suit to stop the lie, to say that the court should enjoin them and declare
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:57.420]  these statements are lies and not allow them to keep lying.
[02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:00.540]  Their response was to say that they were above the law.
[02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:04.740]  Their response was to say, we're the Food and Drug Administration, we're the Center
[02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:10.460]  for Disease Control, you ordinary people cannot sue us on this.
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:15.420]  And instead they claimed, and their excuse for this, first was a doctrine called standing.
[02:51:15.420 --> 02:51:19.900]  And that's just whether or not there's a case or controversy under the U.S. Constitution.
[02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:26.020]  Their second argument was even if there was standing to sue, then they are immune as
[02:51:26.020 --> 02:51:30.580]  sovereign immune because everything they did was an emergency power.
[02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:36.060]  And under their emergency powers law, they can't be sued under the APA according to
[02:51:36.060 --> 02:51:37.060]  them.
[02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:42.340]  So we had an oral argument just last Friday before the federal district court, in which
[02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:46.380]  we explained that in fact, all of these people have been injured, children's health defense
[02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:52.180]  has been injured because it has had to expend and divert and drain its resources extensively
[02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:58.860]  in order to try to rebut the vicious effect of these lies on families, parents and kids
[02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:00.540]  all around America.
[02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:03.980]  The parents have been injured because they've been lied to.
[02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:10.540]  And like any false advertising claim, and like life in general, lies have consequences.
[02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:14.260]  When you breach the trust of the American people, the American people now don't know
[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:15.980]  who to trust.
[02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:18.420]  They know they cannot trust the FDA.
[02:52:18.420 --> 02:52:21.060]  They know they cannot trust the CDC.
[02:52:21.060 --> 02:52:24.940]  They don't know which vaccines are good, which ones are not, which ones are effective
[02:52:24.940 --> 02:52:30.340]  and which ones ain't, or anything else the FDA or CDC or federal public health authority
[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:31.340]  said.
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:37.500]  That is its own constitutionally cognizable injury sufficient to confer constitutionally
[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:42.100]  cognizable case or controversy jurisdiction on the federal district court.
[02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:46.780]  On top of that, we responded to their sovereign immunity claim by pointing out that the government
[02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:51.420]  doesn't get to just say everything it does as an emergency power and thereby escape and
[02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:55.180]  evade judicial review and citizen action.
[02:52:55.180 --> 02:53:00.940]  Because indeed, none of what they did was a lawful exercise of any statutory authority,
[02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:02.820]  of any emergency power.
[02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:08.180]  There is no emergency power that lets the government lie about whether a drug is safe.
[02:53:08.180 --> 02:53:12.100]  There is no emergency power that allows the government to lie about whether a drug is
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:13.100]  effective.
[02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:16.980]  And there sure ain't no emergency power that allows the government to lie and call a drug
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:22.260]  a vaccine when it doesn't inoculate against infection or transmission and ain't a vaccine.
[02:53:22.260 --> 02:53:25.780]  So the, for our response was that these were not emergency powers.
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:32.100]  This was a misuse and abuse, usurpation of authority that they did not lawfully have.
[02:53:32.100 --> 02:53:36.380]  And consequently, we asked the court to let us get to the discovery stage of the case
[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:39.300]  and to get past this motion to dismiss.
[02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:43.980]  The court said it will be issuing a written ruling sometime in the next several weeks.
[02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:48.980]  The same time, the Brooke Jackson case, the biggest whistleblower case ever brought, arguably
[02:53:48.980 --> 02:53:49.980]  in American history.
[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:56.500]  She is the one who saw the horrible things going on in the Pfizer labs and clinical trials
[02:53:56.500 --> 02:54:01.940]  that show that there was no way that Pfizer could honestly and ethically and professionally
[02:54:01.940 --> 02:54:07.100]  and scientifically say that this drug was safe, say that this drug was effective, say
[02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:11.700]  that this drug was a vaccine, say that there was anything about this drug that we should
[02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:15.460]  be giving it to normal healthy people on a mass level.
[02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:16.940]  She brought her action.
[02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:20.820]  The Pfizer has moved to dismiss on the grounds that the government would have written the
[02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:22.140]  check anyway.
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:25.820]  This is what's called a false claims act claim or a key tam act claim.
[02:54:25.820 --> 02:54:29.180]  The legal authority for the court to resolve it goes all the way back to after the civil
[02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:33.500]  war when a lot of government contractors lied to ordinary Americans.
[02:54:33.500 --> 02:54:36.980]  And they said ordinary Americans should have a right to sue for the harm caused to the
[02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:37.980]  taxpayer.
[02:54:37.980 --> 02:54:43.100]  This, of course, would also unmask everything else connected to Pfizer and the COVID vaccine,
[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:46.860]  including what they knew when they knew it, what they hid and when they hid it, all of
[02:54:46.860 --> 02:54:47.860]  it.
[02:54:47.860 --> 02:54:53.060]  So it could, it is a billion dollar case that would have extraordinary impact on the American
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:58.220]  people and public health globally if the case is allowed to move forward to discovery.
[02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:02.780]  Here again, Pfizer, the big drug company like the FDA and the other case doesn't want discovery
[02:55:02.780 --> 02:55:03.780]  to happen.
[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:06.260]  The Biden administration doesn't want discovery to happen.
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:09.860]  They want the case to be dismissed and their grounds is, hey, the government would have
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:14.580]  written a check no matter how many lies we told that effectively it's an argument the
[02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:17.900]  government was in on it with them, at least the Biden administration.
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:24.180]  And consequently, they should be immune and outside of and unable to be sued even to the
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:26.140]  point of discovery.
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:31.380]  That case has been fully briefed and is now pending before the federal district court also
[02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:32.740]  in Texas.
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:37.660]  And those two cases, those twin cases will have extraordinary effect and impact on the
[02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:42.300]  public health of America, the protection of our children and the legal rights of ordinary
[02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:47.380]  people to stand up to both wayward and rogue governmental actions and wayward and rogue
[02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:49.300]  and corrupt big pharma.
[02:55:49.300 --> 02:55:54.740]  It's important to note Pfizer is the most criminally fine company in the history of America.
[02:55:54.740 --> 02:55:56.460]  That's who this company is.
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:00.260]  They've admitted now before European authorities they didn't even test for whether it could
[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:04.820]  be called a vaccine because they didn't even test for whether or not it could cause transmission.
[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:10.460]  So we were given a bill of goods based on lie after lie after lie.
[02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:16.540]  And as the vaccine adverse events reporting system concludes beyond any doubt, there have
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:18.460]  been more injuries reported.
[02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:23.500]  And let's remember the all the studies show that the what's called the VAERS system, the
[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:29.260]  vaccine adverse event reporting system under reports, the number of injuries and the number
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:34.980]  of deaths and the number of disabilities caused by a vaccine by a ratio as high as more than
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:37.060]  10 to one.
[02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:42.740]  If that ratio is applicable here, then this this so-called vaccine, this drug has injured
[02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:46.380]  more than 15 million Americans and it has more.
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:51.220]  It's killed more Americans than have died overseas in wars in the last 20 years to Bob
[02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:52.980]  quickly just in the last 50 seconds.
[02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:56.620]  So if Pfizer does end up kind of throwing the government Biden administration Fauci under
[02:56:56.620 --> 02:57:00.140]  the bus, what happens then?
[02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:01.540]  Then the case moves forward to discovery.
[02:57:01.540 --> 02:57:05.740]  If they would actually allow the case to proceed, we would find out what they knew when they
[02:57:05.740 --> 02:57:09.740]  knew it, what they had, and it might be the end of Big Pharma in America might be the
[02:57:09.740 --> 02:57:13.580]  end of Pfizer in American at a minimum would be the end of this COVID vaccine nonsense
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:17.300]  where they're trying to force it on children with adding it to the schools list, adding
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:18.900]  it to the kids list and all the rest.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:19.900]  It's so dangerous.
[02:57:19.900 --> 02:57:20.900]  It's a great.
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:23.940]  And for Fauci to go out there and promote that in his final words to show you what he's
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:24.940]  really all about.
[02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:29.900]  Bob Barnes, great stuff is always Godspeed and have a happy Thanksgiving.

[03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:11.340]  Good afternoon and welcome to this Tuesday 22nd of November broadcast of the Alex Jones
[03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:12.340]  show.
[03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:15.500]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee, hosting the fourth hour.
[03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:20.660]  I'm going to talk to you about the social experiment that is going on in Australia and
[03:00:20.660 --> 03:00:24.820]  Canada at the moment that is coming to every single country if we fail.
[03:00:24.820 --> 03:00:31.260]  We know we failed last time through our compliance and I'm bringing my good friend and guest
[03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:38.660]  on today in the next segment, Chris Skye, who I think is the number one advocate for
[03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:41.340]  ensuring that the world stops complying.
[03:00:41.340 --> 03:00:46.380]  The answer was always to just say no and it will always be to just say no, but just to
[03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:51.780]  cover a few of the headlines that are happening at the moment in Australia and Canada.
[03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:55.620]  We're being told that masks are coming back.
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:01:02.220]  They tested on us a little while ago with a cruise ship and there was an outbreak on
[03:01:02.220 --> 03:01:09.060]  a cruise ship right at the start of the pandemic and now they are saying that on cruise ships
[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:11.340]  in Australia, you have to have masks again.
[03:01:11.340 --> 03:01:16.260]  They're talking about it in health settings, hospitals, you have to be masked.
[03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:20.740]  Mask mandates returning to certain settings are the headlines that we are seeing.
[03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:25.900]  We're seeing a very similar thing in Canada, in Ontario and one of the counties there,
[03:01:25.900 --> 03:01:28.900]  mask mandates have returned.
[03:01:28.900 --> 03:01:34.180]  This really is a social experiment to see how people are going to go with the social
[03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:40.620]  credit system, making sure that you are complying with everything that daddy government tells
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:42.420]  you to do.
[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:47.180]  The BBC has also reported and I want to make mention of the documentary that was released
[03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:50.580]  yesterday died suddenly, if you haven't seen it, you need to see it.
[03:01:50.580 --> 03:01:55.980]  It's pretty much being blasted on every single platform right now, over two million views
[03:01:55.980 --> 03:01:57.540]  in just 24 hours.
[03:01:57.540 --> 03:01:58.540]  Everyone needs to see that.
[03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:05.020]  But the BBC posted an article about lab grown blood given to people in a world first clinical
[03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:06.020]  trial.
[03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:07.020]  Why is that happening?
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:08.020]  Well, that's happening.
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:14.340]  They actually said that they've discovered a new type of blood, which is ER blood.
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:19.060]  I wonder what that is, and that's happening because as you've seen on this broadcast with
[03:02:19.060 --> 03:02:25.580]  when Mike Adams came on, looked under the microscope, saw the structures growing inside
[03:02:25.580 --> 03:02:27.420]  of people, analysed them.
[03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:32.460]  There is also a follow-up report on that on the Health Ranger Report website, Natural
[03:02:32.460 --> 03:02:33.460]  News.
[03:02:33.460 --> 03:02:39.060]  It's unbelievable that we're finding tin and all sorts of other conductive metals inside
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:42.420]  of people, according to Mike Adams.
[03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:47.540]  There's no wonder that we have to have lab grown blood given to people in a world first
[03:02:47.540 --> 03:02:53.620]  clinical trial because the blood of the people who've been injected is contaminated.
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:03:00.180]  So we're dealing with these devastating deaths all around the world, people dying suddenly
[03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:02.140]  at every single turn.
[03:03:02.140 --> 03:03:05.980]  I mean, the headlines are more than daily now.
[03:03:05.980 --> 03:03:11.900]  Sometimes we're seeing multiple headlines a day of people dying suddenly.
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:15.940]  And these guys are telling us that now we need lab grown blood.
[03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:21.900]  Meanwhile, while all these people are suffering irreparable damage from these injections,
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:25.700]  dropping dead constantly, and it is devastating.
[03:03:25.700 --> 03:03:26.700]  It's devastating.
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:30.580]  I'm sorry to put it so bluntly for everyone because I know that a lot of us have loved
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:35.380]  ones who've been injected, but the reality is people are dropping dead.
[03:03:35.380 --> 03:03:37.220]  I wish that they listened.
[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:41.820]  I wish that they listened and I wish that they'll listen now when we're warning about
[03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:43.860]  all of the other things that are coming.
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:48.180]  For example, the social credit score system through digital IDs.
[03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:51.660]  And this is exactly what they're ramping up towards in Australia.
[03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:56.660]  And Canada, I mentioned last time I was on the show that we're launching a traffic light
[03:03:56.660 --> 03:04:02.060]  system in Queensland that's now being put forward in other states in Australia, literally
[03:04:02.060 --> 03:04:06.220]  like the China style social credit score system.
[03:04:06.220 --> 03:04:11.980]  So they're killing you off, these things are growing inside of you.
[03:04:11.980 --> 03:04:13.940]  And on top of that, they want to push for more.
[03:04:13.940 --> 03:04:15.300]  And why do they want to push for more?
[03:04:15.300 --> 03:04:21.100]  Well, as the World Health Organization, sorry, at B20, as the Indonesian Health Minister
[03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:25.820]  declared, they want to go ahead with the World Health Organization's Treaty.
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:30.300]  And again, I mentioned this interview so many times, but my very first interview, it's available
[03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:32.380]  on Zmedia.com with Karen Kingston.
[03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:36.220]  If you go to interviews, search Karen Kingston from the patents themselves.
[03:04:36.220 --> 03:04:43.740]  She shows us that every single injection approved by the WHO is a lifelong cycle of injections.
[03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:44.820]  This is never going to end.
[03:04:44.820 --> 03:04:48.060]  That's why your non-compliance is so crucial.
[03:04:48.060 --> 03:04:53.540]  We'll be back right after this short break and we'll have Chris Skyon in just a moment
[03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:56.460]  reporting to you from Canada.
[03:04:56.460 --> 03:05:01.020]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:05:01.020 --> 03:05:02.620]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:05:02.620 --> 03:05:05.740]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:05:05.740 --> 03:05:07.020]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:05:07.020 --> 03:05:09.540]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:05:09.540 --> 03:05:13.820]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[03:05:13.820 --> 03:05:15.620]  or Governor DeSaint Demonius.
[03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:19.500]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:26.260]  to deny us Arizona, and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[03:05:26.260 --> 03:05:31.820]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:35.860]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:05:35.860 --> 03:05:39.580]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:05:39.580 --> 03:05:41.420]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[03:05:41.420 --> 03:05:45.060]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:05:45.060 --> 03:05:48.460]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:05:48.460 --> 03:05:50.580]  People need to get behind info wars.
[03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:55.780]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[03:05:55.780 --> 03:06:03.780]  We need more of these communications.
[03:06:03.780 --> 03:06:04.780]  Welcome back.
[03:06:04.780 --> 03:06:05.780]  I want to discuss this article.
[03:06:05.780 --> 03:06:12.580]  I'm pretty sure I brought it up last time, but this is Windsor News, Windsor.ctvnews.ca.
[03:06:12.580 --> 03:06:16.740]  This is County of Essex making masks mandatory at indoor facilities.
[03:06:16.740 --> 03:06:19.180]  This is happening in Canada as we speak.
[03:06:19.180 --> 03:06:25.700]  County of Essex is once again requiring that masks be worn in county facilities.
[03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:27.460]  This is all facilities, really.
[03:06:27.460 --> 03:06:33.340]  It talks about the Civic Centre, county library branches, ambulance bases, road depots.
[03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:38.540]  It also includes a Sunpala home, but it is already governed by guidelines for long-term
[03:06:38.540 --> 03:06:39.540]  care homes.
[03:06:39.540 --> 03:06:42.180]  The same thing here in Australia.
[03:06:42.180 --> 03:06:48.580]  Why I keep harping on about this is because very similar tactics were used in Australia
[03:06:48.580 --> 03:06:53.820]  and Canada when we compare the Western societies that were attacked by their governments.
[03:06:53.820 --> 03:06:55.780]  Of course, we were all subject to lockdowns.
[03:06:55.780 --> 03:06:57.380]  We were all subject to mandates.
[03:06:57.380 --> 03:07:01.020]  All of this, it was a lockstep approach.
[03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:09.020]  But the violence of the government against their citizens, the explosion of camps, the
[03:07:09.020 --> 03:07:17.100]  explosion of legislation to write into legislation to be able to put people into quarantine camps
[03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:21.140]  and forcefully inject them, is so much more prevalent in Australia and Canada.
[03:07:21.140 --> 03:07:24.380]  The reason for that is very simple.
[03:07:24.380 --> 03:07:26.020]  We are very compliant people.
[03:07:26.020 --> 03:07:28.500]  Australia and Canada are very similar people.
[03:07:28.500 --> 03:07:32.980]  In Canada, you had horses, trampling innocent protesters.
[03:07:32.980 --> 03:07:37.540]  I was talking to a friend of mine, Rob Primo, in Canada at the time.
[03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:42.460]  He was saying that they were taking protesters, putting them into the back of vans.
[03:07:42.460 --> 03:07:48.660]  It was freezing outside, putting them into very, very hot police vans into the back of
[03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:53.900]  the paddy wagons, basically cooking them and then releasing them back out into the cold
[03:07:53.900 --> 03:07:55.860]  without even charging them.
[03:07:55.860 --> 03:08:01.140]  In Australia, in Melbourne, you had police shooting rubber bullets at protesters.
[03:08:01.140 --> 03:08:06.700]  I know we were all subject to tyranny, but two Western nations that went through a very
[03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:11.140]  similar thing are now going through a brand new social experiment.
[03:08:11.140 --> 03:08:16.220]  And again, I'm going to repeat, if they're successful this time, it will come everywhere
[03:08:16.220 --> 03:08:17.220]  else.
[03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:23.060]  They're just working out through their tactics how they're going to subdue the people once
[03:08:23.060 --> 03:08:24.940]  again.
[03:08:24.940 --> 03:08:32.300]  In Ottawa, Ottawa citizens reporting that the children's health crisis is happening with
[03:08:32.300 --> 03:08:35.740]  Ottawa school board to vote on mask mandate.
[03:08:35.740 --> 03:08:41.220]  Germany has been hammered again for not wearing a mask, meanwhile Trudeau doesn't wear one
[03:08:41.220 --> 03:08:42.220]  anywhere.
[03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:47.420]  Trudeau flies around on his private jet, emitting CO2 everywhere at every turn.
[03:08:47.420 --> 03:08:53.900]  400 private jets arrive at the climate conference to tell you about how you can't eat meat
[03:08:53.900 --> 03:08:57.260]  and you can't freely travel around.
[03:08:57.260 --> 03:09:03.860]  While they are laughing in our faces, when you look at even the health officials, they're
[03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:10.380]  extremely, many of them are obese, they look unwell.
[03:09:10.380 --> 03:09:18.140]  Rachel Levine is coming out there and trying to talk to us about children's health.
[03:09:18.140 --> 03:09:23.820]  I mean, these people are actually at the point where they're laughing in our faces.
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:29.300]  They don't even care anymore about trying to seem credible.
[03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:36.100]  They just don't care and the reality is that there was a point maybe at the start where
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:40.860]  we could have said maybe some public health officials are ignorant, maybe some of them
[03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:46.020]  don't know what's going on, but at this point, at this point when all of these people are
[03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:51.660]  dying and it cannot be denied that every single day we're seeing headline after headline of
[03:09:51.660 --> 03:09:58.260]  people dropping at young ages dying suddenly, suddenly diagnosed with cancer, dropped a
[03:09:58.260 --> 03:09:59.260]  month later.
[03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:00.260]  Are you serious?
[03:10:00.260 --> 03:10:04.300]  And the public health officials, instead of saying, right, we need to pause and investigate
[03:10:04.300 --> 03:10:08.900]  what's happening to people, no, they just keep hammering on the MSM, get vaccinated,
[03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:10.740]  get boosted.
[03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:17.460]  There is not a chance that those people are not aware or see if Chris is coming on right
[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:18.460]  now.
[03:10:18.460 --> 03:10:23.700]  He should be with us in just a moment and I will, there we go, Chris, welcome.
[03:10:23.700 --> 03:10:26.100]  How are you?
[03:10:26.100 --> 03:10:28.820]  It is good to see you, my friend, Chris is joining us from Canada.
[03:10:28.820 --> 03:10:32.020]  If you don't follow Chris Sky, you can find him on chrissky.com.
[03:10:32.020 --> 03:10:34.980]  He's also on Telegram under real Chris Sky.
[03:10:34.980 --> 03:10:37.980]  You would have seen, I've been talking about this social experiment right now that's happening
[03:10:37.980 --> 03:10:39.700]  between our countries, Chris.
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:45.420]  Yet again, you and I spoke a lot during the lockdowns, during the protests, and it seems
[03:10:45.420 --> 03:10:48.140]  like they're using very similar tactics on us again.
[03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:50.140]  Talk to us about what's happening in Canada.
[03:10:50.140 --> 03:10:54.540]  Well, first of all, everybody needs to remember where we were at this time last year.
[03:10:54.540 --> 03:10:58.660]  If you were in Canada or most of Australia, you couldn't leave your country if you weren't
[03:10:58.660 --> 03:10:59.660]  jabbed.
[03:10:59.660 --> 03:11:01.660]  You couldn't work in your country if you weren't jabbed.
[03:11:01.660 --> 03:11:06.060]  You couldn't go to the gym or go to a restaurant or go to school if you weren't jabbed and
[03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:07.780]  mass and all the rest of it.
[03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:11.940]  Then they were pushing to the point where they actually wanted to start taxing or arresting
[03:11:11.940 --> 03:11:13.340]  us.
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:16.060]  That's all because people comply.
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:20.660]  People listen to the government and it reached the fever point with our trucker convoy and
[03:11:20.660 --> 03:11:26.940]  that's part movements all around the world where people finally just said no and we achieved
[03:11:26.940 --> 03:11:29.700]  global, united, non-compliance.
[03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:34.900]  That's the only reason the mass, the mandates, the jabs all went away.
[03:11:34.900 --> 03:11:39.340]  Not because our government decided that COVID wasn't dangerous, not because our public health
[03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:40.900]  officials got any new data.
[03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:44.740]  No, it was because the people said enough is enough and we're not going to go along
[03:11:44.740 --> 03:11:45.740]  with this anymore.
[03:11:45.740 --> 03:11:48.660]  Then they gave us a bit of our freedom all summer.
[03:11:48.660 --> 03:11:53.900]  I ended up going on the tour all over the world and the one I want to talk about is England
[03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:57.420]  because when I was in England, it was the same weekend that they were burying the queen
[03:11:57.420 --> 03:12:02.380]  and that weekend over 500 world leaders, including Biden, including the leader of Australia,
[03:12:02.380 --> 03:12:06.140]  including Trudeau, were all there and that's when they were discussing their next phase
[03:12:06.140 --> 03:12:07.140]  of this plan.
[03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:11.540]  They still have the exact same great reset plan for us.
[03:12:11.540 --> 03:12:16.500]  They just realized they couldn't impose COVID mandates any longer without too much public
[03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:17.500]  pushback.
[03:12:17.500 --> 03:12:23.380]  So they decided they're going to try a global worldwide recession combined with climate
[03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:28.980]  change laws to try to impoverish us to the point where they can still get their universal
[03:12:28.980 --> 03:12:34.340]  basic income, their digital identity, their digital currency, band cash, and have their
[03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:36.300]  technocratic control grid.
[03:12:36.300 --> 03:12:41.660]  But at the same time, now that they know, people know about this, they are now trying
[03:12:41.660 --> 03:12:47.580]  to re-institute the COVID fear, the COVID division, because that fear and division were
[03:12:47.580 --> 03:12:54.300]  the most powerful weapons they had to subdue humanity and they're trying to do it again.
[03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:58.140]  They're trying to do it in Canada and Australia for one reason.
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:02.980]  We are seen as the nice countries and I just talked about this Saturday at the Worldwide
[03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:08.780]  Rally in Vancouver and when I said that Canadians are really nice, everybody cheered and I
[03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:12.420]  looked at them and I said, no, that's not a good thing.
[03:13:12.420 --> 03:13:17.860]  You don't want to be seen as nice because nice people are easily taken advantage of.
[03:13:17.860 --> 03:13:19.420]  Nice people are naive.
[03:13:19.420 --> 03:13:24.220]  Nice people won't fight back and that's what we need to get into everybody's head.
[03:13:24.220 --> 03:13:27.220]  Stop getting this idea that you want to be seen as nice.
[03:13:27.220 --> 03:13:32.300]  You want to be seen as good, good people, not nice people.
[03:13:32.300 --> 03:13:35.340]  Nice people will put on a mask because someone told them to.
[03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:39.500]  Nice people will take a job because somebody told them it's for the greater good.
[03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:44.660]  Nice people will do whatever they're told and they will not stand up to evil.
[03:13:44.660 --> 03:13:47.540]  Good people will stand up to evil.
[03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:52.340]  Good people will not put on a mask and rather go to jail to make a point and those are the
[03:13:52.340 --> 03:13:57.260]  kind of people we need to become in these countries because like you said, every single
[03:13:57.260 --> 03:14:01.140]  headline is showing the predictive programming of where they want this to go.
[03:14:01.140 --> 03:14:05.460]  Two weeks ago, it was, oh, mask mandates are out of the question, everybody.
[03:14:05.460 --> 03:14:09.980]  Now, every 20 minutes, there's a new headline of a new agency that they just made up or
[03:14:09.980 --> 03:14:15.900]  a new public health official or some new school board is all asking for mask mandates back.
[03:14:15.900 --> 03:14:21.060]  They even made fake polls saying that 75% of Canadians want mask mandates back.
[03:14:21.060 --> 03:14:25.180]  That is like you said, they can lie right to our face because they have such little
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:30.700]  respect for us that they can literally tell you, they're pissing on you and tell you it's
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:34.660]  raining and the average Canadian will say, yeah, you're right.
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:38.820]  That's all ridiculous is there's no way in hell the majority of Canadians or Australians
[03:14:38.820 --> 03:14:41.780]  or anyone around the world wants mandates of any kind.
[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:46.820]  Nobody is afraid of COVID anymore, but they're trying to make you afraid because they know
[03:14:46.820 --> 03:14:51.500]  they know that if Christmas time comes and I want everybody to pay attention to this,
[03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:54.140]  Christmas is very important in everybody's family.
[03:14:54.140 --> 03:14:58.180]  It's a time of year where family and friends come together all over the world.
[03:14:58.180 --> 03:15:03.940]  And the last two years were the biggest division in the world's countries.
[03:15:03.940 --> 03:15:08.140]  Nothing divided the people more than a Christmas where some people said, oh, you can't come
[03:15:08.140 --> 03:15:12.500]  to my house unless you're wearing a mask or you can't come to my house if you're not vaccinated.
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:17.380]  And they want that again because they know if you invite your family and friends over
[03:15:17.380 --> 03:15:21.140]  who last year you wouldn't allow because they weren't jabbed or they weren't masked.
[03:15:21.140 --> 03:15:24.940]  They come over, unjabbed, unmasked, healthy as shit.
[03:15:24.940 --> 03:15:28.820]  And you're all going to start making jokes of how stupid everyone was the last few years
[03:15:28.820 --> 03:15:32.060]  for taking five jabs, for wearing double masks.
[03:15:32.060 --> 03:15:33.060]  And guess what?
[03:15:33.060 --> 03:15:35.940]  Nobody's going to ever fall for this crap again.
[03:15:35.940 --> 03:15:38.620]  And they know if they lose it now, they lose it for good.
[03:15:38.620 --> 03:15:44.380]  So that's why they're ramping up this massive fear campaign because they want to create
[03:15:44.380 --> 03:15:49.500]  the division where a lot of people don't spend time with their family and friends.
[03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:50.500]  Stay with us.
[03:15:50.500 --> 03:15:51.500]  Stay with us.
[03:15:51.500 --> 03:15:52.500]  Crucial points right here.
[03:15:52.500 --> 03:15:53.500]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:54.500]  We'll be back right after this break.
[03:15:54.500 --> 03:15:57.420]  Let's get up into what you just said.

[03:16:02.660 --> 03:16:09.020]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[03:16:09.020 --> 03:16:15.440]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:16:15.440 --> 03:16:22.420]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:27.140]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[03:16:27.140 --> 03:16:28.140]  the market.
[03:16:28.140 --> 03:16:34.660]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[03:16:34.660 --> 03:16:41.580]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[03:16:41.580 --> 03:16:47.620]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.

[03:18:01.220 --> 03:18:02.220]  through Christmas.

[03:19:17.780 --> 03:19:18.780]  the year.

[03:19:52.860 --> 03:19:58.020]  Thank you so much for your support, God bless.
[03:19:58.020 --> 03:20:17.540]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, we're here with Chris Sky from Canada, the world's
[03:20:17.540 --> 03:20:20.460]  leading activist and a good friend of mine, Chris.
[03:20:20.460 --> 03:20:26.740]  You just, before this break, you just said something that was so crucial, which was,
[03:20:26.740 --> 03:20:31.620]  they were so successful in their division and what they want to do now is separate families
[03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:37.980]  again at Christmas because, God forbid, the uninjected come into contact now with the
[03:20:37.980 --> 03:20:44.900]  injected because we are at the stage where we can come together and not be arguing as
[03:20:44.900 --> 03:20:50.180]  we were at one stage, God forbid they come into the same room and all of the people who
[03:20:50.180 --> 03:20:57.180]  refuse the injections now have stronger immune systems, aren't getting sick with COVID or
[03:20:57.180 --> 03:21:04.780]  whatever it is, you know, have been able to still survive and thrive and get their jobs
[03:21:04.780 --> 03:21:09.660]  back and all this other stuff, so if they come into the same room with all those people
[03:21:09.660 --> 03:21:15.140]  whose immune systems are now destroyed, they've had COVID, I don't know, 29 times a month
[03:21:15.140 --> 03:21:21.340]  because they're boosted to the eyeballs, it is going to be so obvious so they really
[03:21:21.340 --> 03:21:26.820]  want to destroy, not only to break morale, but to destroy people coming together yet
[03:21:26.820 --> 03:21:35.860]  again because that is what has worked in the past when you look at the European nations
[03:21:35.860 --> 03:21:40.300]  during the communist times, they made sure that they shut down places where men gather
[03:21:40.300 --> 03:21:47.700]  because they can sit there and plan and plot to overthrow the dictators of the day and
[03:21:47.700 --> 03:21:51.780]  I'm not, you know, talking about overthrowing governments here but I am talking about people
[03:21:51.780 --> 03:21:55.420]  gathering and saying, right, we can't comply with this anymore, what are we going to do
[03:21:55.420 --> 03:21:56.420]  about this?
[03:21:56.420 --> 03:22:04.380]  Well, that's exactly right, the easiest thing everybody's got to do is simply not comply
[03:22:04.380 --> 03:22:10.260]  and in this case it's even easier than not putting a mask on and not taking a jab at
[03:22:10.260 --> 03:22:11.700]  having been threatened with your job.
[03:22:11.700 --> 03:22:15.500]  In this case, all they're going to be able to do is tell you, don't invite those family
[03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:18.980]  and friends over that won't wear a mask or won't take the booster because they're bad
[03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:22.460]  people and they're going to make you sick and at this point that's not going to work
[03:22:22.460 --> 03:22:27.020]  on the vast, vast majority of people and I believe that the people now have the knowledge,
[03:22:27.020 --> 03:22:32.940]  the people now have the courage and the lack of fear to actually disobey the government
[03:22:32.940 --> 03:22:37.580]  and I believe that we've actually trained everybody, all of us, all of us that have been
[03:22:37.580 --> 03:22:43.340]  speaking out all around the world have literally trained everybody and elevated their consciousness
[03:22:43.340 --> 03:22:47.420]  to the point where the vast majority of people realize that the world's governments are
[03:22:47.420 --> 03:22:52.140]  not their friends but are in fact their enemies that are trying to impose this control grid
[03:22:52.140 --> 03:22:57.540]  upon them and they are not, they're using this as a secondary distraction because at
[03:22:57.540 --> 03:23:02.420]  the same time for all of those that don't believe that they're trying to force a universal
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:07.540]  basic income, a digital identity, a digital currency and then eliminate cash, the best
[03:23:07.540 --> 03:23:13.980]  way for them to do that at this point is to simply make everything you need to survive
[03:23:13.980 --> 03:23:19.140]  that you buy every single month more expensive every month and that's exactly what's going
[03:23:19.140 --> 03:23:20.140]  to happen.
[03:23:20.140 --> 03:23:22.900]  So for any of the naysayers, all the people that have been complying, all the people that
[03:23:22.900 --> 03:23:26.820]  trust the government, all the people that are jab, mask, watching the TV every day and
[03:23:26.820 --> 03:23:31.120]  doing everything they were told, I want you all to take a copy of what your gas bill,
[03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:35.700]  your grocery bill, your electricity bill, your natural gas bill and all the other fixed
[03:23:35.700 --> 03:23:36.700]  costs you have.
[03:23:36.700 --> 03:23:40.900]  So keep a copy of them today, then revisit them in six months time.
[03:23:40.900 --> 03:23:45.460]  The governments around the world, especially under the Klaus Schwab dictatorships, understand
[03:23:45.460 --> 03:23:49.260]  that the vast majority of you are on a fixed budget income.
[03:23:49.260 --> 03:23:55.060]  So if your expenses go up 30, 40%, how much percent of the population will simply not
[03:23:55.060 --> 03:23:58.220]  be able to make ends meet without government assistance?
[03:23:58.220 --> 03:24:03.820]  And then when they're in tandem with this, raising interest rates in countries like Canada
[03:24:03.820 --> 03:24:08.260]  and Australia where the average person is spending way too much in debt on their house
[03:24:08.260 --> 03:24:12.100]  with really high mortgage payments they can barely pay, when those mortgage payments get
[03:24:12.100 --> 03:24:15.980]  too high because they raise your rates a couple percent and you can't make your ends meet
[03:24:15.980 --> 03:24:20.020]  without the government assistance, how many of you would rather than sell your house and
[03:24:20.020 --> 03:24:25.380]  downgrade your family, simply download a digital identity app, upload your iris, your fingerprint,
[03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:29.580]  your voice, your facial recognition, just so you can get that extra money per month.
[03:24:29.580 --> 03:24:32.820]  For the lower end of the spectrum, just so you could survive and for the so-called middle
[03:24:32.820 --> 03:24:37.060]  class, so you won't have to downgrade your lifestyle, that's what the government's counting
[03:24:37.060 --> 03:24:38.060]  on right now.
[03:24:38.060 --> 03:24:43.020]  They're counting on causing as much destruction and as much pain in your life, like death
[03:24:43.020 --> 03:24:49.340]  of a thousand cuts over and over, slow enough that you can feel it, but you still feel paralyzed
[03:24:49.340 --> 03:24:51.220]  to do something about it.
[03:24:51.220 --> 03:24:54.780]  And the best thing we can do, and I've asked everybody this and this is what I was talking
[03:24:54.780 --> 03:24:59.060]  to you about the app I helped create with a good friend of mine, because we said the
[03:24:59.060 --> 03:25:03.940]  only way this could have ever happened is because we did not have strong men in this
[03:25:03.940 --> 03:25:04.940]  society.
[03:25:04.940 --> 03:25:08.580]  If we had strong men in the society, the last thing they would have ever done is put a mask
[03:25:08.580 --> 03:25:12.740]  on themselves, put a mask on their wives, put a mask on their children going to school
[03:25:12.740 --> 03:25:16.260]  and force an injection into themselves just to keep their jobs.
[03:25:16.260 --> 03:25:18.340]  The men of old would not have done that.
[03:25:18.340 --> 03:25:24.420]  It took decades and decades of weakening men and then COVID made it way worse for everybody.
[03:25:24.420 --> 03:25:29.780]  They killed all the healthy routines, all the healthy habits that people strive to spend
[03:25:29.780 --> 03:25:31.500]  years building up in their life.
[03:25:31.500 --> 03:25:33.900]  COVID put everyone into survival mode.
[03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:38.540]  Everybody stopped training, everybody stopped meditating, everybody stopped eating healthy.
[03:25:38.540 --> 03:25:39.540]  And what did we have?
[03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:45.260]  We had a massive mental health crisis that dwarfs any of the other consequences of COVID,
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:46.380]  in my opinion.
[03:25:46.380 --> 03:25:47.380]  More suicides.
[03:25:47.380 --> 03:25:54.260]  What we also had was women that tear down men being elevated in the media, and this
[03:25:54.260 --> 03:25:56.260]  has been happening over such a long time.
[03:25:56.260 --> 03:26:02.180]  And I'm allowed to say this because I'm a woman, this toxic feminism is disgusting.
[03:26:02.180 --> 03:26:03.180]  And you know what?
[03:26:03.180 --> 03:26:06.700]  Men are allowed to say it too because it is disgusting and it doesn't matter what gender
[03:26:06.700 --> 03:26:10.140]  you are, and there are only two of them, by the way, you're allowed to call something
[03:26:10.140 --> 03:26:12.380]  out if it's wrong regardless of your gender.
[03:26:12.380 --> 03:26:21.220]  So the clear attack on men over the generations, but particularly over the past two years is
[03:26:21.220 --> 03:26:23.100]  just unbelievable.
[03:26:23.100 --> 03:26:24.580]  I can see it from a mile away.
[03:26:24.580 --> 03:26:25.580]  Do go on.
[03:26:25.580 --> 03:26:26.580]  Yes.
[03:26:26.580 --> 03:26:33.340]  We went from men that would literally fight and die in wars to protect individual freedoms
[03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:38.180]  because individual freedoms were paramount to a successful and happy society, to men
[03:26:38.180 --> 03:26:42.980]  that willingly gave up their rights and freedoms because they were convinced they were selfish
[03:26:42.980 --> 03:26:48.140]  and also convinced that compliance and not questioning authority is the new virtue of
[03:26:48.140 --> 03:26:49.140]  the day.
[03:26:49.140 --> 03:26:52.740]  That is a complete opposite of reality.
[03:26:52.740 --> 03:26:57.740]  And I used to say the only way that I believe men can get stronger is by going through another
[03:26:57.740 --> 03:26:58.740]  round of this suffering.
[03:26:58.740 --> 03:27:02.460]  And I ended up meeting with a good friend of mine, Jekov, he's a freedom fighter living
[03:27:02.460 --> 03:27:03.460]  in Mexico.
[03:27:03.460 --> 03:27:08.020]  And he's like, no, he's like, like you've been training people, we can train people.
[03:27:08.020 --> 03:27:13.220]  We can train men and women to be physically stronger, mentally stronger, spiritually
[03:27:13.220 --> 03:27:16.380]  stronger and more healthy in all those regards.
[03:27:16.380 --> 03:27:20.780]  So when the next time the government tries to take advantage of them, the next time anybody
[03:27:20.780 --> 03:27:24.500]  tries to take advantage of them, they're prepared to fight back.
[03:27:24.500 --> 03:27:31.060]  So we created an app that he called Atherics Academy Pro and it combines fitness, nutrition
[03:27:31.060 --> 03:27:36.260]  and all different types of retraining the mind because just like the government spent
[03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:42.420]  decades reprogramming men, and then the last two years traumatizing the entire world, we
[03:27:42.420 --> 03:27:47.700]  need to deprogram the people from what they were artificially taught.
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:54.180]  They were provided with lies and false information and it trained them to start acting in ways
[03:27:54.180 --> 03:28:00.140]  that were not beneficial for them, not beneficial for their families, not beneficial for society.
[03:28:00.140 --> 03:28:06.540]  So we decided the best way to stick it to the friggin globalist is retrain an entire
[03:28:06.540 --> 03:28:14.700]  world into an army of good people, strong people, people that will stand up for what
[03:28:14.700 --> 03:28:18.860]  they know is right, people that will stand for their fellow freedom fighters.
[03:28:18.860 --> 03:28:20.420]  And that's what this app is all about.
[03:28:20.420 --> 03:28:25.620]  It's about creating strong men and women, stronger communities and raising the health
[03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:29.780]  and well-being of virtually everybody that has access to it.
[03:28:29.780 --> 03:28:30.780]  I think I gave you a link.
[03:28:30.780 --> 03:28:31.780]  That's amazing, Chris.
[03:28:31.780 --> 03:28:32.780]  For free.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:36.460]  Well, I was just about to say we'll ask the team to pop the link in the description below
[03:28:36.460 --> 03:28:40.620]  so that people can check it out and I want to talk a little bit more about how it's actually
[03:28:40.620 --> 03:28:46.460]  backfiring in their faces for everyone that's waking up, the persecuted get stronger.
[03:28:46.460 --> 03:28:48.580]  And this is a pattern in history.
[03:28:48.580 --> 03:28:52.260]  When you persecute people and continue to persecute them, they actually get stronger.
[03:28:52.260 --> 03:28:53.660]  It's about to blow up in your faces.
[03:28:53.660 --> 03:28:56.780]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:28:56.780 --> 03:29:01.740]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has
[03:29:01.740 --> 03:29:07.220]  truly earned the title of top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has
[03:29:07.220 --> 03:29:08.780]  enraged the globalist.
[03:29:08.780 --> 03:29:14.060]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[03:29:14.060 --> 03:29:19.060]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[03:29:19.060 --> 03:29:26.220]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[03:29:26.220 --> 03:29:28.540]  Introducing top G supplements.
[03:29:28.540 --> 03:29:33.020]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and
[03:29:33.020 --> 03:29:34.020]  his crew.

[03:29:55.300 --> 03:29:58.500]  who protect and provide for the people close to them.

[03:30:15.780 --> 03:30:19.260]  of supply chain breakdowns, it will be months and months until these great products come
[03:30:19.260 --> 03:30:20.260]  back in.
[03:30:20.260 --> 03:30:21.500]  X3 sold out.
[03:30:21.500 --> 03:30:25.500]  Our great American coffee blend has sold out.
[03:30:25.500 --> 03:30:27.300]  Biotrystallinium has sold out.
[03:30:27.300 --> 03:30:33.340]  But what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, vitamin mineral fusion, body's ultimate
[03:30:33.340 --> 03:30:39.460]  turmeric formula, whole food multivitamin, brain force ultra, supermail volatility and
[03:30:39.460 --> 03:30:40.460]  so much more.

[03:30:45.420 --> 03:30:46.420]  to find them.

[03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:48.420]  Don't fight the traffic.
[03:30:48.420 --> 03:30:51.060]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool.
[03:30:51.060 --> 03:30:52.260]  Do it now.

[03:30:58.700 --> 03:31:04.100]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[03:31:04.100 --> 03:31:09.020]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[03:31:09.020 --> 03:31:14.700]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[03:31:14.700 --> 03:31:20.500]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[03:31:20.500 --> 03:31:26.380]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars despite the massive law
[03:31:26.380 --> 03:31:32.100]  fair being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[03:31:32.100 --> 03:31:33.100]  Info Wars.
[03:31:33.100 --> 03:31:38.460]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier,
[03:31:38.460 --> 03:31:43.340]  wealthier and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air and what that does is keep the
[03:31:43.340 --> 03:31:48.380]  populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:31:48.380 --> 03:31:49.820]  So continue to do it.
[03:31:49.820 --> 03:31:51.980]  Go to places like infowarstore.com.
[03:31:51.980 --> 03:31:54.460]  Go to the places like Save Info Wars.
[03:31:54.460 --> 03:31:58.620]  Continue to keep Info Wars alive because in the process, you're keeping American liberty
[03:31:58.620 --> 03:31:59.620]  alive.
[03:31:59.620 --> 03:32:06.660]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[03:32:06.660 --> 03:32:11.220]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[03:32:11.220 --> 03:32:15.660]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:32:15.660 --> 03:32:20.500]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[03:32:20.500 --> 03:32:24.100]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:32:24.100 --> 03:32:30.260]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[03:32:30.260 --> 03:32:34.260]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's
[03:32:34.260 --> 03:32:38.820]  very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[03:32:38.820 --> 03:32:42.740]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[03:32:42.740 --> 03:32:47.540]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into

[03:32:59.180 --> 03:33:12.580]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.580 --> 03:33:16.140]  We're back live on the Alex Jones show with Chris Sky.
[03:33:16.140 --> 03:33:22.740]  Chris, you were just talking about getting stronger mentally, physically, spiritually.
[03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:27.580]  These things are so crucial and the one thing that one of my taglines, my favorite taglines
[03:33:27.580 --> 03:33:30.780]  is do not let the tyrants rule your mind.
[03:33:30.780 --> 03:33:36.860]  It's like the harder they push me, the harder and more determined I become to not let them
[03:33:36.860 --> 03:33:37.860]  affect my life.
[03:33:37.860 --> 03:33:41.500]  You know, I look up in the skies these days, Chris, I don't know what it's like in Canada,
[03:33:41.500 --> 03:33:49.340]  but here in Australia, our skies are covered every single day with GT stripes and it's
[03:33:49.340 --> 03:33:55.940]  gloomy and we're in, to give you an idea, we're about to start summer and it's where
[03:33:55.940 --> 03:33:59.940]  I am at the moment, it's 12 degrees.
[03:33:59.940 --> 03:34:03.100]  So it's just unbelievable how much they're messing with our weather.
[03:34:03.100 --> 03:34:09.140]  I recently interviewed Dane Wiggington that interviews up on Zmedia.com, that's Z-E-E-Media.com
[03:34:09.140 --> 03:34:10.140]  three days.
[03:34:10.140 --> 03:34:15.340]  I interviewed Dane Wiggington, geoengineering expert and he said La Nina is a manufactured
[03:34:15.340 --> 03:34:16.340]  weather crisis.
[03:34:16.340 --> 03:34:21.940]  They are actually doing this too and he really explained how they are manufacturing this
[03:34:21.940 --> 03:34:26.740]  and so it's like they're coming at us from every single angle through our food, through
[03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:32.060]  the economy, through our health, through the skies, in every single way they're coming
[03:34:32.060 --> 03:34:37.980]  at us and yet people like you and I can say personally, people like me, our resolve has
[03:34:37.980 --> 03:34:38.980]  gotten stronger.
[03:34:38.980 --> 03:34:42.660]  How do you achieve that, Chris?
[03:34:42.660 --> 03:34:47.100]  Because when you put yourself in a mindset and you start actually training your body,
[03:34:47.100 --> 03:34:52.460]  mind and soul, when they try to do this stuff to you, just like you said, it increases your
[03:34:52.460 --> 03:34:53.960]  power.
[03:34:53.960 --> 03:34:56.140]  It's like a knife being sharpened.
[03:34:56.140 --> 03:35:00.500]  So when you're ready for the fight and you're, no, you're in a fight, you're going to get
[03:35:00.500 --> 03:35:03.820]  smarter, you're going to get stronger, you're going to get faster, you're going to get more
[03:35:03.820 --> 03:35:07.820]  efficient with all the propaganda methods they're throwing at you and you're going to
[03:35:07.820 --> 03:35:09.500]  be quicker to adapt.
[03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:15.580]  It's only the people that either deny that they're in a fight in the first place or that
[03:35:15.580 --> 03:35:17.620]  don't get themselves in that mindset.
[03:35:17.620 --> 03:35:20.340]  They allow the government to break their resolve.
[03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:25.900]  They allow the government to make them feel isolated, to make them feel hopeless because
[03:35:25.900 --> 03:35:30.820]  if you feel hopeless and you feel helpless and you feel alone, then you're much more
[03:35:30.820 --> 03:35:33.460]  likely to comply because you're just going to give up.
[03:35:33.460 --> 03:35:37.220]  But if you add that mindset that you're going to possibly evolve and you're never going
[03:35:37.220 --> 03:35:41.300]  to give up no matter what and you apply yourself in the right ways and you nourish your body
[03:35:41.300 --> 03:35:45.820]  in the right ways, you'll be stronger, you'll be healthier, you'll be more mentally effective
[03:35:45.820 --> 03:35:51.780]  and you'll be more spiritually ready to handle everything they throw at you because like
[03:35:51.780 --> 03:35:54.420]  you said, they're coming at you from all angles.
[03:35:54.420 --> 03:35:57.420]  So you need your defenses up in all angles.
[03:35:57.420 --> 03:35:58.420]  It's that simple.
[03:35:58.420 --> 03:36:02.540]  And if you're one of those people that can recognize that, acknowledge that and works
[03:36:02.540 --> 03:36:08.020]  on that, then just like you, just like me, just like all the other freedom fighters around
[03:36:08.020 --> 03:36:13.620]  the world, we just constantly become better and stronger versions of ourselves and we
[03:36:13.620 --> 03:36:18.180]  outpace the methods of propaganda and the methods of subversion that the government
[03:36:18.180 --> 03:36:19.180]  can use.
[03:36:19.180 --> 03:36:22.580]  They only have so many tricks in the bag and that's why they keep repeating the same ones
[03:36:22.580 --> 03:36:26.300]  over and over because, hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but you can't fool all the
[03:36:26.300 --> 03:36:27.580]  people all the time.
[03:36:27.580 --> 03:36:31.340]  And we've gotten to the point where they're not fooling enough people enough of the time.
[03:36:31.340 --> 03:36:37.020]  And so we just have to literally train millions and millions of more people to be like us,
[03:36:37.020 --> 03:36:42.140]  to literally just say no to the government and not comply when they know it's not in
[03:36:42.140 --> 03:36:43.340]  their best interest.
[03:36:43.340 --> 03:36:44.700]  It's really that simple.
[03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:49.340]  And if the government wants it to be in people's best interests, it's really easy to tell.
[03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:54.380]  The government will give you the choice because that's how you'll know it's in your best interest.
[03:36:54.380 --> 03:36:56.740]  They'll allow you to choose for yourself.
[03:36:56.740 --> 03:37:01.700]  We will as the cornerstone of every single religion on planet Earth, no religion and
[03:37:01.700 --> 03:37:07.500]  even atheism, which is non-religion, will tell you to simply do as you're told by someone
[03:37:07.500 --> 03:37:10.520]  who gives themselves a perceived version of authority.
[03:37:10.520 --> 03:37:12.020]  Am I wrong?
[03:37:12.020 --> 03:37:13.940]  No, absolutely not.
[03:37:13.940 --> 03:37:19.780]  I want to talk about people continuing to be strong in the face of adversity.
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:24.940]  This happened to Canadians, bank accounts were frozen, Trudeau brings out the Emergencies
[03:37:24.940 --> 03:37:30.180]  Act never before used, I've been following some of those discussions around that, Chris.
[03:37:30.180 --> 03:37:35.700]  I mean, he had to deal with the situation as quickly as possible.
[03:37:35.700 --> 03:37:42.180]  That was his excuse for bringing in the Emergencies Act that never before used, I mean, it is
[03:37:42.180 --> 03:37:46.980]  unbelievable, but they've done a similar thing in Brazil now, where they've frozen the bank
[03:37:46.980 --> 03:37:54.140]  accounts of the protesters, not only individuals, but also businesses, large banks are freezing
[03:37:54.140 --> 03:37:57.140]  their bank accounts, and yet people are still going.
[03:37:57.140 --> 03:38:00.620]  You know what happened here, Chris, in Australia?
[03:38:00.620 --> 03:38:09.580]  We had our largest protest, I think, ever, I mean, that I can remember, in Canberra.
[03:38:09.580 --> 03:38:15.580]  Right at the Parliament House, there was a minimum of 150,000 people there, I'm being
[03:38:15.580 --> 03:38:20.420]  very conservative here, most think that it was closer to half a million, and they brought
[03:38:20.420 --> 03:38:26.500]  out energy weapons against people, and it made people very disheartened, and it really,
[03:38:26.500 --> 03:38:33.020]  you know, there was a real lull of the freedom movement in Australia after that, because
[03:38:33.020 --> 03:38:35.300]  people just said, well, nothing's working.
[03:38:35.300 --> 03:38:40.260]  But what the people did do after that was individually say, right, I have to prepare
[03:38:40.260 --> 03:38:41.260]  for the worst.
[03:38:41.260 --> 03:38:47.340]  And Mike Adams said this to me a while ago, he said, preppers are the most positive people,
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:51.900]  and I don't mean just preppers when it comes to food or gold and silver or whatever it
[03:38:51.900 --> 03:38:56.900]  is that you're doing, you know, water, I'm talking about preparing also, as you're saying,
[03:38:56.900 --> 03:39:03.740]  your mind, your body, your soul, because those people plan on surviving, not only surviving,
[03:39:03.740 --> 03:39:07.620]  but thriving on the other side of whatever these psychopaths do to us.
[03:39:07.620 --> 03:39:13.820]  So it is crucial to be strong, it is crucial, and I always say, prepare for the worst, hope
[03:39:13.820 --> 03:39:17.860]  and pray and fight peacefully, lawfully for the best.
[03:39:17.860 --> 03:39:23.460]  This is what we must do, and that is what being a good person, as you said, is about.
[03:39:23.460 --> 03:39:27.780]  Yes, being a good person is confronting evil.
[03:39:27.780 --> 03:39:32.340]  The old saying is, all evil needs to succeed is for good men to do nothing.
[03:39:32.340 --> 03:39:34.340]  Well, nice men will do nothing.
[03:39:34.340 --> 03:39:36.220]  Nice women will do nothing.
[03:39:36.220 --> 03:39:38.820]  Good men and women will stand up.
[03:39:38.820 --> 03:39:42.180]  That's why we created that app, I wanted to say the name again, it's called Aesthetics
[03:39:42.180 --> 03:39:44.580]  Academy Pro.
[03:39:44.580 --> 03:39:48.940]  We have a special link that you can click on to get a free trial of it, and you can also
[03:39:48.940 --> 03:39:55.260]  download it from Google Play or Apple Store, and I believe is a very effective tool for
[03:39:55.260 --> 03:39:58.380]  getting people into the mindset where they need to be.
[03:39:58.380 --> 03:40:00.740]  And just like you said, they're unrelenting.
[03:40:00.740 --> 03:40:04.300]  You mentioned Chrystia Freeland, and you mentioned them freezing bank accounts.
[03:40:04.300 --> 03:40:09.900]  I just want to show you exactly how much they put behind their own puppets.
[03:40:09.900 --> 03:40:12.300]  Chrystia Freeland is a WEF puppet.
[03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:17.820]  Chrystia Freeland used to be a Ukrainian exchange student who got investigated by the Russian
[03:40:17.820 --> 03:40:22.340]  Secret Service because her grandfather was a high-ranking Nazi.
[03:40:22.340 --> 03:40:23.660]  Everybody can look this up.
[03:40:23.660 --> 03:40:25.820]  So everybody knows she's very pro-Ukrainian.
[03:40:25.820 --> 03:40:32.060]  Meanwhile, she's got so much clout in Canada, and it was not elected all appointed, all
[03:40:32.060 --> 03:40:36.940]  given to her, deputy prime minister, minister of finance, which allowed her to freeze people's
[03:40:36.940 --> 03:40:37.940]  bank accounts.
[03:40:37.940 --> 03:40:40.500]  And why am I mentioning this?
[03:40:40.500 --> 03:40:44.140]  Because now globally, she's the number one candidate to be the next secretary general
[03:40:44.140 --> 03:40:45.340]  of NATO.
[03:40:45.340 --> 03:40:50.220]  And if they put her in there, her primary objective will be to try to get Ukraine to
[03:40:50.220 --> 03:40:55.980]  be the newest NATO member, which will have a 100% guaranteed effect of escalating the
[03:40:55.980 --> 03:40:58.060]  war in Russia.
[03:40:58.060 --> 03:41:02.220]  And that's another thing they want, because it's just another way they can have distraction
[03:41:02.220 --> 03:41:06.780]  and it's just another excuse where they can blame on inflation and all the rising prices.
[03:41:06.780 --> 03:41:12.380]  So this is the kind of power these globalists have, that they can get one person, one woman,
[03:41:12.380 --> 03:41:17.280]  and put her in all these different positions where she can cause so many detrimental effects,
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:21.700]  not just to Canada, but not just to your country, but to virtually the entire world
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:24.260]  if she becomes that one of the heads of NATO.
[03:41:24.260 --> 03:41:27.420]  I just wanted to point that out.
[03:41:27.420 --> 03:41:36.380]  Well, and the Ukraine situation is being used, the whole, I mean, they're creating a recession
[03:41:36.380 --> 03:41:37.540]  crisis.
[03:41:37.540 --> 03:41:44.060]  And we've just been told in Australia that we're going to adopt Biden's inflation plan
[03:41:44.060 --> 03:41:46.020]  here in Australia.
[03:41:46.020 --> 03:41:51.540]  The very inflation plan that's driving the economy into the ground, we want to do it
[03:41:51.540 --> 03:41:56.900]  here because apparently this is going so well in the United States, people can't afford
[03:41:56.900 --> 03:41:57.900]  gas.
[03:41:57.900 --> 03:42:00.380]  They can't afford to eat.
[03:42:00.380 --> 03:42:03.300]  It's going so well in the United States.
[03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:07.580]  They literally have to change the definition of recession.
[03:42:07.580 --> 03:42:11.260]  Everyone knows their definition of recession is two straight quarters of negative growth.
[03:42:11.260 --> 03:42:14.540]  And then they have two and a half, three straight quarters like, well, no, no, we're not in
[03:42:14.540 --> 03:42:15.540]  a recession.
[03:42:15.540 --> 03:42:20.140]  A recession doesn't mean what it generally used to mean, bull.
[03:42:20.140 --> 03:42:23.140]  And I would like to say one thing because you said a lot of people feel helpless and
[03:42:23.140 --> 03:42:26.220]  a lot of people feel like there's nothing they can do, especially when the government
[03:42:26.220 --> 03:42:27.220]  comes out heavy-handed.
[03:42:27.220 --> 03:42:32.620]  Well, when I went to Netherlands as part of my world tour and I spoke there at the end
[03:42:32.620 --> 03:42:37.620]  of September, early October, or sorry, early October at the Hague, I told them they needed
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:41.820]  to stand up, especially to the climate crisis there because the Netherlands is the number
[03:42:41.820 --> 03:42:43.820]  one food supplier for all of Europe.
[03:42:43.820 --> 03:42:48.540]  And they were putting in climate change policies that were designed to absolutely decimate
[03:42:48.540 --> 03:42:51.100]  the farmers and decimate the food supply that was not.
[03:42:51.100 --> 03:42:52.100]  Stay with us, Chris.
[03:42:52.100 --> 03:42:53.100]  We've got to go to a quick break.
[03:42:53.100 --> 03:42:54.100]  Stay with us.
[03:42:54.100 --> 03:42:56.300]  I really want to hear this right on the other side of the break.
[03:42:56.300 --> 03:42:58.620]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[03:42:58.620 --> 03:43:01.620]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[03:43:01.620 --> 03:43:07.420]  Now, the good news is, I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[03:43:07.420 --> 03:43:11.700]  The bad news is, by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[03:43:11.700 --> 03:43:14.020]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[03:43:14.020 --> 03:43:17.900]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:18.900]  the year.
[03:43:18.900 --> 03:43:23.660]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotru Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning
[03:43:23.660 --> 03:43:24.660]  coffee.
[03:43:24.660 --> 03:43:29.900]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other
[03:43:29.900 --> 03:43:35.660]  great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12, they are
[03:43:35.660 --> 03:43:39.620]  all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[03:43:39.620 --> 03:43:42.340]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[03:43:42.340 --> 03:43:47.340]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarsstore.com, ChromoCode
[03:43:47.340 --> 03:43:52.740]  1776, and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:52.740 --> 03:43:54.740]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:43:54.740 --> 03:43:55.740]  God bless.
[03:43:55.740 --> 03:44:00.780]  Look at that, everybody else is just like yellow or clear, and that's because it's
[03:44:00.780 --> 03:44:01.780]  been denatured.
[03:44:01.780 --> 03:44:02.780]  It's been worked out.
[03:44:02.780 --> 03:44:05.260]  We didn't do that.
[03:44:05.260 --> 03:44:09.100]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can
[03:44:09.100 --> 03:44:10.100]  get?
[03:44:10.100 --> 03:44:11.820]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[03:44:11.820 --> 03:44:17.780]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because
[03:44:17.780 --> 03:44:21.100]  I want that good will.
[03:44:21.100 --> 03:44:24.300]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:27.020]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:44:27.020 --> 03:44:29.020]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[03:44:29.020 --> 03:44:39.500]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[03:44:39.500 --> 03:44:46.940]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:44:46.940 --> 03:44:52.500]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil, just like
[03:44:52.500 --> 03:44:55.580]  our information is dynamite, so are our products, infoorstore.com.
[03:44:55.580 --> 03:44:59.060]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[03:44:59.060 --> 03:45:04.140]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[03:45:09.580 --> 03:45:13.780]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products have already sold out, and because
[03:45:13.780 --> 03:45:17.260]  of supply chain breakdowns, it'll be months and months until these great products come
[03:45:17.260 --> 03:45:18.260]  back in.
[03:45:18.260 --> 03:45:24.420]  All three sold out, our great American coffee blend has sold out, bio crystallineum has
[03:45:24.420 --> 03:45:30.780]  sold out, but what hasn't sold out is DNA force plus, vitamin mineral fusion, body's
[03:45:30.780 --> 03:45:37.500]  ultimate turmeric formula, whole food multivitamin, brain force ultra, supermail vitality, and
[03:45:37.500 --> 03:45:38.500]  so much more.

[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:44.420]  to find them.

[03:45:47.700 --> 03:45:52.780]  month like a fool, do it now, get it all over with, get a great deal, and keep Info Wars
[03:45:52.780 --> 03:45:57.060]  on the air while empowering your body, infoorstore.com.
[03:45:57.060 --> 03:45:59.620]  It's a post COVID world now.
[03:45:59.620 --> 03:46:03.180]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health system.
[03:46:03.180 --> 03:46:04.420]  There's a solution.

[03:46:43.540 --> 03:46:44.540]  that we're living in.

[03:46:58.340 --> 03:47:12.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.380 --> 03:47:16.460]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, we're here with Chris Sky for our final segment
[03:47:16.460 --> 03:47:17.460]  today.
[03:47:17.460 --> 03:47:20.540]  Chris, you were talking before the break about what you were saying to the people of the
[03:47:20.540 --> 03:47:24.180]  Netherlands, huge food supplier for the world.
[03:47:24.180 --> 03:47:26.020]  Please continue from where you were at.
[03:47:26.020 --> 03:47:29.820]  Well, everyone knows the Netherlands is the largest food supplier for Europe, and that's
[03:47:29.820 --> 03:47:32.020]  one of their main industries at home.
[03:47:32.020 --> 03:47:35.100]  And under the guise of climate change, and under the guise that nitrogen is going to
[03:47:35.100 --> 03:47:40.060]  kill us now, not even CO2 nitrogen, even though it's over 70% of the atmosphere, they're
[03:47:40.060 --> 03:47:45.220]  saying the number one producers of nitrogen in the world are agricultural and farming.
[03:47:45.220 --> 03:47:50.780]  So under that guise, they put forth these law that would basically eliminate 30% of
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:56.180]  the food supply of the Netherlands by 2030, while increasing the population of the Netherlands.
[03:47:56.180 --> 03:48:01.180]  So when I went down there and I spoke, I talked about that, and I talked about the manufactured
[03:48:01.180 --> 03:48:04.620]  energy crisis where they're literally just raising people's gas rates, whoever they don't
[03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:08.980]  want to be in business, and I actually burnt the gas bill on stage and I said, all you
[03:48:08.980 --> 03:48:14.780]  have to do is not pay, all you have to do is not comply, simply don't stand for it.
[03:48:14.780 --> 03:48:18.260]  And they already had a movement going because of our trucker convoy, and after I showed
[03:48:18.260 --> 03:48:22.300]  up there and we left, I just found out in the last couple of weeks, the guy that put
[03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:27.020]  forth those climate change policies was fired and those policies have since been rescinded.
[03:48:27.020 --> 03:48:31.380]  So we have the effect, we make the difference.
[03:48:31.380 --> 03:48:35.580]  So everybody needs to look around the world and see that, that when the people of that
[03:48:35.580 --> 03:48:41.740]  particular country stood up, stood together, did not comply, they got the result they wanted.
[03:48:41.740 --> 03:48:45.860]  So never feel disheartened, yes, the government can come down heavy handed, yes, the government
[03:48:45.860 --> 03:48:47.060]  can go after individuals.
[03:48:47.060 --> 03:48:51.620]  I know this, I've been arrested 23 times in 25 months, I even got arrested in the Netherlands
[03:48:51.620 --> 03:48:54.380]  and in Ireland when I was on my tour.
[03:48:54.380 --> 03:49:00.140]  So trust me, I know, but guess what, I'm still here, I'm still fighting, I'm still smiling.
[03:49:00.140 --> 03:49:06.340]  And why, because every single day I live life the way I want, no matter what the hell they
[03:49:06.340 --> 03:49:08.980]  tell me, and you need to do the same thing.
[03:49:08.980 --> 03:49:10.940]  That's what it comes down to ladies and gentlemen.
[03:49:10.940 --> 03:49:16.060]  I love your attitude, Chris, everyone that watches you always says they feel so encouraged
[03:49:16.060 --> 03:49:22.340]  by you, and you really do spark courage, and that's the thing, courage will spark courage.
[03:49:22.340 --> 03:49:28.220]  And being the example for others then gives others the courage to be the example for others.
[03:49:28.220 --> 03:49:33.220]  Tell us again where people can find your app again, and we're going to put the link in
[03:49:33.220 --> 03:49:34.220]  the description below.
[03:49:34.220 --> 03:49:36.900]  I'm going to ask the team if they can do that for you.
[03:49:36.900 --> 03:49:42.900]  Sure, you can find me on Telegram, Real Chris Sky, All Caps, the one with 66,000 followers.
[03:49:42.900 --> 03:49:47.100]  It's censored, so you can't get the app from Google or Apple Store, you got to get it from
[03:49:47.100 --> 03:49:50.220]  telegram.org or you won't find me, surprise, surprise.
[03:49:50.220 --> 03:49:52.100]  I believe I'm the most censored man in the world.
[03:49:52.100 --> 03:49:56.420]  You can't even hashtag my name on TikTok, you can't even put the words Chris Sky in
[03:49:56.420 --> 03:50:00.620]  the TikTok description, it says contain banned words, I'm banned on Twitter.
[03:50:00.620 --> 03:50:03.060]  Well, let's get this out to Elon Musk.
[03:50:03.060 --> 03:50:05.020]  Why am I still banned on Twitter?
[03:50:05.020 --> 03:50:07.620]  Reinstate Chris Sky.
[03:50:07.620 --> 03:50:08.620]  Hashtag free Chris Sky.
[03:50:08.620 --> 03:50:10.500]  Elon, I know you know who I am.
[03:50:10.500 --> 03:50:15.460]  If you can reinstate Kanye, Andrew Tate, you can reinstate Chris Sky.
[03:50:15.460 --> 03:50:16.460]  Thank you very much.
[03:50:16.460 --> 03:50:19.980]  Well, he won't reinstate him for wars, he won't reinstate Alex.
[03:50:19.980 --> 03:50:26.140]  He's spreading the mainstream narrative around why he won't reinstate Alex, and I'm very,
[03:50:26.140 --> 03:50:31.380]  I mean, I'm not disappointed because I don't really expect anything from someone at his
[03:50:31.380 --> 03:50:39.820]  level, but at the end of the day, you know, just posting the wrong information about Alex.
[03:50:39.820 --> 03:50:44.500]  A lot of people do expect Elon to do the right thing, so he should do the right thing.
[03:50:44.500 --> 03:50:49.140]  He says he believes in free speech, but he doesn't support certain speech because it
[03:50:49.140 --> 03:50:53.220]  was so egregious that that person should never be allowed to speak again.
[03:50:53.220 --> 03:50:56.660]  That's literally the antithesis of supporting free speech.
[03:50:56.660 --> 03:51:02.220]  You could say, I could come up with the absolutely worst possible thing imaginable and say it,
[03:51:02.220 --> 03:51:07.140]  and you should still support my right to say it, no matter how much you disagree, how disgusting
[03:51:07.140 --> 03:51:11.780]  you think it is, even if you think I should go directly to hell for saying such a thing,
[03:51:11.780 --> 03:51:14.660]  you should still defend my right to say it.
[03:51:14.660 --> 03:51:16.540]  And I don't think he has that excuse with me.
[03:51:16.540 --> 03:51:20.580]  I don't think I've said anything except, suppose a COVID misinformation that actually
[03:51:20.580 --> 03:51:24.300]  just ended up being stuff that came out to be true a few months later.
[03:51:24.300 --> 03:51:28.620]  So I would love to see my Twitter reinstated, and I would love everybody to get the app
[03:51:28.620 --> 03:51:33.180]  Aesthetics Academy Pro, that you can get at the Google or Apple store because it hasn't
[03:51:33.180 --> 03:51:38.020]  yet been censored, and you'll have access to me and access to Jekov, and I believe it
[03:51:38.020 --> 03:51:40.360]  will change your life permanently for the better.
[03:51:40.360 --> 03:51:45.860]  And secretly, it's my way of recruiting new free fighters.
[03:51:45.860 --> 03:51:52.180]  Well, Chris, we thank you so much for everything that you do for your time here today.
[03:51:52.180 --> 03:51:57.900]  I appreciate you, and keep up the good fight, we really thank you for your time.
[03:51:57.900 --> 03:52:01.140]  I'd love to come to Australia, I'd just like to say that one day too, and I want to come
[03:52:01.140 --> 03:52:04.540]  to Australia because I love you guys over there, and I've never been there in my life,
[03:52:04.540 --> 03:52:05.540]  so I'm putting that up.
[03:52:05.540 --> 03:52:08.820]  Well, we'd love to have you, I can assure you we would love to have you.
[03:52:08.820 --> 03:52:11.340]  Thank you again for your time, Chris.
[03:52:11.340 --> 03:52:12.340]  Thank you.
[03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:16.740]  Well, I'm so grateful for all of the people that are standing up courageously all over
[03:52:16.740 --> 03:52:17.740]  the world.
[03:52:17.740 --> 03:52:26.740]  These attirements will not stop as long as the compliance, at the slightest sniff of compliance,
[03:52:26.740 --> 03:52:29.420]  they will keep doing this to us.
[03:52:29.420 --> 03:52:34.940]  And this is why every single person that watches this broadcast, that watches other independent
[03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:39.700]  media is so crucial.
[03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:43.940]  You are the soldiers of today, I am not exaggerating this.
[03:52:43.940 --> 03:52:50.660]  You literally are in a war and you are the modern day soldiers and you're needed.
[03:52:50.660 --> 03:52:54.460]  And here's the thing, they would love nothing more than to wear you down.
[03:52:54.460 --> 03:52:59.180]  You see what they're doing here in Australia and Canada, that we have the opportunity to
[03:52:59.180 --> 03:53:03.940]  say, oh, not again, don't do it to us again.
[03:53:03.940 --> 03:53:09.220]  Why would I beg my oppressors to stop oppressing me?
[03:53:09.220 --> 03:53:13.340]  Oppressors don't have mercy, that's why they're oppressors.
[03:53:13.340 --> 03:53:19.740]  I'm not going to appeal to my oppressor, in fact, they're not even my oppressor.
[03:53:19.740 --> 03:53:27.300]  They can proclaim and think that they're my oppressor all they want, but I am a free human
[03:53:27.300 --> 03:53:28.300]  being.
[03:53:28.300 --> 03:53:34.060]  My freedom is God given, no one will take that from me and I will stand up and fight
[03:53:34.060 --> 03:53:40.660]  till my death, if need be, for that right.
[03:53:40.660 --> 03:53:45.900]  And the people all over the world need to grow that resolve, that no matter what they
[03:53:45.900 --> 03:53:51.060]  come at us with, see if this social experiment right now that's happening in Australia and
[03:53:51.060 --> 03:53:58.460]  in Canada, if every single public response, every single person's public response to their
[03:53:58.460 --> 03:54:04.140]  social experiment is absolutely not, you're not doing this again, you can forget it.
[03:54:04.140 --> 03:54:11.340]  And people actually do that with some backbone and some courage, they won't do it.
[03:54:11.340 --> 03:54:17.260]  But if the comments on social media are flooded, if people are turning up and they go, oh, please
[03:54:17.260 --> 03:54:24.500]  don't put us back into a lockdown again, these people thrive off you begging them for mercy.
[03:54:24.500 --> 03:54:28.540]  I'm going to beg them for mercy, they're killing people.
[03:54:28.540 --> 03:54:34.300]  I'm going to beg someone that's a mass murderer, genocidal maniac, bringing out death shots
[03:54:34.300 --> 03:54:38.540]  to the whole world and continuously lying on camera, safe and effective, safe and effective.
[03:54:38.540 --> 03:54:44.180]  I'm going to beg them for mercy, absolutely not.
[03:54:44.180 --> 03:54:49.380]  This is and always has been about the people, the power is with the people, the power is
[03:54:49.380 --> 03:54:57.660]  in the people saying no and the power to say no comes from when you understand the depth
[03:54:57.660 --> 03:55:05.340]  of the agenda and the depth, my friends, is this, they want you dead.
[03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:10.180]  They want you dead, can I say this any clearer?
[03:55:10.180 --> 03:55:15.860]  There is no regard for human life, they consider you worthless.
[03:55:15.860 --> 03:55:23.580]  Now, this isn't designed to make you feel worse about yourself, the truth hurts.
[03:55:23.580 --> 03:55:27.940]  But when you accept the truth and you say, right, what do I need to do about this?
[03:55:27.940 --> 03:55:32.220]  There are murderers out there that think that I'm worth nothing.
[03:55:32.220 --> 03:55:33.660]  What do I need to do about this?
[03:55:33.660 --> 03:55:39.420]  So whatever sphere of influence you have, whether you're a mother in a community group,
[03:55:39.420 --> 03:55:45.780]  whether you are in school boards, whether you have community groups set up for families
[03:55:45.780 --> 03:55:53.500]  or even individuals, people need to start to gather now, mobilise and help people.
[03:55:53.500 --> 03:55:57.860]  There are other people at a local level, you need to start forming groups that will help
[03:55:57.860 --> 03:56:01.660]  one another and then get out there and somehow get the message out.
[03:56:01.660 --> 03:56:07.100]  I don't care if people have to go on the streets and, you know, evangelise anti-New World
[03:56:07.100 --> 03:56:14.140]  Order messages, whatever it is, people need to do more.
[03:56:14.140 --> 03:56:19.260]  And I know that so many that watch this broadcast and so many from my audience are already very
[03:56:19.260 --> 03:56:24.220]  active and I thank those people, you are all so crucial and I was reminded of that last
[03:56:24.220 --> 03:56:28.740]  week when I was on and the callers rang and they were just amazing people.
[03:56:28.740 --> 03:56:35.460]  They really were, every single person who's on the right side of truth is an amazing person.
[03:56:35.460 --> 03:56:38.300]  You wouldn't believe the truth if you weren't.
[03:56:38.300 --> 03:56:42.580]  You wouldn't be able to accept the truth without being offended if you weren't.
[03:56:42.580 --> 03:56:45.340]  That takes courage and that takes character.
[03:56:45.340 --> 03:56:51.900]  Something the left and the climate cultists and the Covidians have none of, unfortunately.
[03:56:51.900 --> 03:56:59.460]  But we must break through that not everyone is beyond repair, not everyone is beyond saving.
[03:56:59.460 --> 03:57:05.100]  And the world is depending on those who are watching this broadcast now.
[03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:08.700]  Head to Zmedia.com for all my latest interviews.
[03:57:08.700 --> 03:57:13.900]  I will be putting up a video about smart cities called the final lockdown right here on Band
[03:57:13.900 --> 03:57:14.900]  Dot Video today.
[03:57:14.900 --> 03:57:20.500]  Support this broadcast, support Alex and this amazing team that makes sure that you are
[03:57:20.500 --> 03:57:26.340]  informed and empowered every single day with this life-saving information and it is.
[03:57:26.340 --> 03:57:32.380]  Because if you didn't know that killers were coming after you, then you may be subject
[03:57:32.380 --> 03:57:33.380]  to their attack.
[03:57:33.380 --> 03:57:38.620]  But because of this broadcast and others, you're able to stay strong and withstand their attacks.
[03:57:38.620 --> 03:57:39.620]  God bless you all.
[03:57:39.620 --> 03:57:42.020]  It's been an honor to be with you here today.
[03:57:42.020 --> 03:57:43.020]  Thank you.
[03:57:43.020 --> 03:57:53.140]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day counting
[03:57:53.140 --> 03:57:55.300]  these mail-in ballots.
[03:57:55.300 --> 03:58:01.860]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's
[03:58:01.860 --> 03:58:03.260]  election month, Alex.
[03:58:03.260 --> 03:58:04.900]  It's not election day.
[03:58:04.900 --> 03:58:06.620]  And that's the problem.
[03:58:06.620 --> 03:58:09.220]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[03:58:09.220 --> 03:58:16.140]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes
[03:58:16.140 --> 03:58:18.180]  mailing multiple ballots to people.
[03:58:18.180 --> 03:58:20.500]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[03:58:20.500 --> 03:58:24.780]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:58:24.780 --> 03:58:29.340]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no
[03:58:29.340 --> 03:58:30.980]  problem saying that.
[03:58:30.980 --> 03:58:37.220]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity
[03:58:37.220 --> 03:58:42.740]  and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:58:42.740 --> 03:58:47.220]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[03:58:47.220 --> 03:58:52.620]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[03:58:52.620 --> 03:58:54.140]  a healthier life.
[03:58:54.140 --> 03:58:58.500]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[03:58:58.500 --> 03:59:00.140]  that contains both.
[03:59:00.140 --> 03:59:05.100]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[03:59:05.100 --> 03:59:06.700]  from the InfoWars store.
[03:59:06.700 --> 03:59:11.540]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[03:59:11.540 --> 03:59:14.220]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:59:14.220 --> 03:59:19.060]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[03:59:19.060 --> 03:59:24.260]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[03:59:24.260 --> 03:59:25.260]  shown.
[03:59:25.260 --> 03:59:29.060]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[03:59:29.060 --> 03:59:33.660]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:59:33.660 --> 03:59:38.740]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[03:59:38.740 --> 03:59:39.740]  like here in America.
[03:59:39.740 --> 03:59:44.580]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[03:59:44.580 --> 03:59:53.980]  our rose hips don't lie.
