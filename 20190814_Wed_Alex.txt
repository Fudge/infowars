[00:00.000 --> 00:25.860]  Hello, hello, welcome, my name is Will Johnson, I'm sitting in for Alex Jones, he's on vacation
[00:25.860 --> 00:33.240]  but he is never on vacation, he will be joining us after this first segment, Veritas released
[00:33.240 --> 00:39.880]  another video, Alex is going to get into that with more detail, I believe Keith is going
[00:39.880 --> 00:45.240]  to be on with him, you know, Google with the censorship, the way they're attacking conservatives
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.200]  is unbelievable, the craziness that's going on and we're supposed to just go along with
[00:51.200 --> 00:56.480]  it because it's supposed to be fair that they can attack conservatives and liberals are
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.080]  supposed to get everything that they asked for, nothing's ever supposed to happen to
[01:00.080 --> 01:06.240]  liberals, only conservatives and when it happens to liberals then they cry foul, so like I
[01:06.240 --> 01:12.160]  said Alex will be joining us after this first segment, so I have the honor and the privilege
[01:12.160 --> 01:17.520]  to host this first five minutes before he comes on with us, let me say this, every day
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.120]  I walk into the studio and I see all of the people working so hard against the tyranny
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.440]  of the left, against the tyranny of the globalist and it just makes me think that all of these
[01:28.440 --> 01:35.480]  people have on the same page and they understand, they are awake to what is actually happening
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.840]  here and Alex Jones has created something that is completely remarkable and every time
[01:42.840 --> 01:50.200]  I walk in like I said I'm at awe, people understand that Alex Jones is doing everything he can,
[01:50.200 --> 01:56.640]  he's putting everything on the line to wake up people and to fight for humanity and for
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.640]  me that is a great honor to be sitting here to try to represent the best of my ability
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.960]  and show my appreciation and say that, you know, Infa Wars is a wonderful opportunity
[02:08.960 --> 02:17.040]  for anybody, I'm glad to be here to be able to guest host, but let me say this because
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.080]  Alex, he did a commercial spot talking about he doesn't like the plug but I understand
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.600]  why he does the plug, it's because he does the plugs because it gives us the opportunity
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.440]  to be here, it gives me the opportunity to be here, without you supporting Infa Wars
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.680]  against what the left is doing, it doesn't happen, we don't have someone in the pocket
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.120]  like George Soros or Tom Steyer, all of these filthy rich billionaires is trying to take
[02:44.120 --> 02:50.280]  out America, Alex is depending on the American people, he's depending on all of us to step
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.720]  up and to support InfaWars.com and when you share the articles, you tell them that you're
[02:56.720 --> 03:03.120]  not taking it lying down, you're not going to take it any longer, by you going to InfaWarsStore.com,
[03:03.120 --> 03:08.560]  you show everybody that you love everything that Alex Jones is doing and you don't believe
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.400]  the lies that's coming out of the left, that's what it comes down to, is if you believe the
[03:13.400 --> 03:19.600]  lies then don't buy anything, but if you believe in humanity, you believe in this country and
[03:19.600 --> 03:26.120]  you believe everything that Alex Jones has been doing here, then you need to go to InfaWarsStore.com
[03:26.120 --> 03:33.120]  and buy the product, the TurboForce, the BrainForce, the DNAForce, they're always doing specials
[03:33.120 --> 03:40.840]  that's unbelievable, have you ever seen anyone that's doing a special on their products constantly?
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.160]  And the main reason why they're doing it is because it gives people the opportunity to
[03:45.160 --> 03:49.640]  find out how good the products really are, that's what it comes down to.
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.520]  Okay, so Project Veritas, they've been trying to take out InfaWars for the longest and I'm
[03:55.520 --> 04:02.440]  talking about Google, Google, Facebook, Twitter, they have to take out Alex Jones, why?
[04:02.440 --> 04:06.440]  Because he's speaking the truth, you can't have someone running around, you can't have
[04:06.440 --> 04:10.680]  someone broadcasting, telling the truth to the American people when they have a completely
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.400]  different agenda, how does that work?
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.040]  So after the break, they're gonna play a video and Alex is gonna be on with this, after the
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.280]  break they're gonna play a video and if I'm not mistaken with the Veritas and with another
[04:24.280 --> 04:30.040]  Google Insider and what happened here, I'm not gonna break all of it out, I'm gonna
[04:30.040 --> 04:36.760]  let Alex do it, but everything that's taking place here should be an alarm, a wake, a waking
[04:36.760 --> 04:42.720]  call for everybody, send the alarm, send the alarm, because if we don't pay attention to
[04:42.720 --> 04:46.600]  what's actually happening here, every last one of us that think we have freedoms, they're
[04:46.600 --> 04:50.160]  gonna go away, you're not gonna even have freedoms, you're gonna wake up tomorrow, you're gonna
[04:50.160 --> 04:54.120]  be like what in the world happened, no one told me and it's not that anyone told you
[04:54.120 --> 05:00.160]  because Alex has been telling you, you need to wake up to it, we'll be back after this.
[05:00.160 --> 05:05.520]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.600]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[05:09.600 --> 05:14.720]  and make your own decisions, gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.400]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.920]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[05:22.920 --> 05:25.880]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[05:25.880 --> 05:31.160]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it.
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.480]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[05:35.480 --> 05:41.200]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[05:41.200 --> 05:46.120]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're gonna
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.120]  find anywhere.
[05:47.120 --> 05:52.240]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[05:52.240 --> 05:59.920]  Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com or AAA-253-3139.
[06:22.240 --> 06:27.280]  Johnston is here visiting InfoWars and guest hosting, he's gonna be hosting throughout
[06:27.280 --> 06:30.760]  the next four hours with many special guests.
[06:30.760 --> 06:38.560]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is set to drop massive new bombshells exclusively here
[06:38.560 --> 06:44.720]  coming up on air at the bottom of the hour because he always gives us even more information
[06:44.720 --> 06:52.080]  than what's in his latest report with major executives inside Big Tech coming out and
[06:52.080 --> 06:55.840]  exposing whistleblowing and more.
[06:55.840 --> 07:02.720]  That will also tie into stories up on DrudgeReport.com, TechLash, only making Facebook stronger,
[07:02.720 --> 07:10.000]  FTC helping dominate platform paid contractors to just cram scribe users, audio chats.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  They're recording everything, the sky is the limit.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.520]  It's absolutely evil.
[07:16.520 --> 07:21.760]  It's beyond the left, authoritarianism and of course to reign in Trump in his trade war
[07:21.760 --> 07:27.200]  with China with the global allied with the last four heads, the private Federal Reserve,
[07:27.200 --> 07:32.240]  New York Board of Governors came out and said, we're gonna crash the economy to teach Trump
[07:32.240 --> 07:33.240]  a lesson.
[07:33.240 --> 07:34.240]  He's being political.
[07:34.240 --> 07:37.040]  Well, China is being totally political with their currency.
[07:37.040 --> 07:39.440]  Trump's barely even countered them.
[07:39.440 --> 07:43.360]  Because he flipped to the shield against it, they're trying to destroy the stock market
[07:43.360 --> 07:46.880]  right now, yields flash recession warning.
[07:46.880 --> 07:51.560]  Stocks dive, banks hammered, reads DrudgeReport, and it tells you everything you know up above
[07:51.560 --> 07:59.120]  in the left hand corner, dim contenders, Trump 2020 rust belt pitch threatened by manufacturing
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.840]  downturn.
[08:00.840 --> 08:02.680]  What did Bill Mars say last year?
[08:02.680 --> 08:10.120]  He said, I want to crash the markets, the economy to teach these Trump supporters a lesson.
[08:10.120 --> 08:11.920]  You can't have your country back.
[08:11.920 --> 08:13.120]  You can't have prosperity.
[08:13.120 --> 08:15.560]  No, no, everything's got to go to China.
[08:15.560 --> 08:17.600]  You dirty Americans.
[08:17.600 --> 08:21.360]  We're going to teach you.
[08:21.360 --> 08:28.120]  So ginormous developments on the Trump front with the fact that he's coming in to go after
[08:28.120 --> 08:34.480]  the censorship and then even bigger developments on the Epstein House of Cards coming down
[08:34.480 --> 08:38.920]  and just the fact that no one's buying the official story.
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.400]  And you've got the head of the jail removed, the guards, special guards were brought in.
[08:43.400 --> 08:46.400]  They heard him screaming for his life.
[08:46.400 --> 08:50.360]  And then as you say, breathe, breathe, it's all coming up today.
[08:50.360 --> 08:54.480]  James O'Keeffe, bottom of the hour, but hosting until the bottom of the hour.
[08:54.480 --> 09:01.480]  The rest of this segment and the next is Will Johnson visiting guest hosts.
[09:01.480 --> 09:02.480]  And then I'll be back.
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.200]  Your co-hosts with Will at the bottom of the hour with James O'Keeffe.
[09:07.200 --> 09:14.040]  Remember infowars.com, newswars.com is tomorrow's news today and we had to end the big storewide
[09:14.040 --> 09:19.760]  mega sale 50, 60% off because so many things were about to sell out, but we are still extending
[09:19.760 --> 09:23.760]  storewide free shipping and we're still extending double patriot points and we're still extending
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.280]  sales on everything else that we have decent supplies of.
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.440]  And so it's basically 90% of the last sale for each item you're getting, it's the same.
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.440]  We're keeping krill oil that just came back in last week that's so popular to have a
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.160]  highest quality at 50% off despite the fact that we've already sold a third of it.
[09:43.160 --> 09:49.240]  So I promise you the krill oil will be taken off sale by the weekend because we have to
[09:49.240 --> 09:52.920]  do because it'll be another three months until more comes in or try to double our order
[09:52.920 --> 09:53.920]  of it.
[09:53.920 --> 09:57.240]  It's so popular now because all the stuff in the news about how good it is and everybody
[09:57.240 --> 09:59.800]  heard me already tell you that years ago and now here it is.
[09:59.800 --> 10:04.440]  But if you want to have amazing dreams, not just for your heart or your brain, krill oil
[10:04.440 --> 10:05.440]  50% off infowars.com.
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.360]  But Will Johnson has got a lot he's going to be covering today.
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.640]  Will tell us who's coming up today, your views on this time in history we are and so much
[10:12.640 --> 10:15.920]  and again it's great to have you here in the middle of this historic event that's happening
[10:15.920 --> 10:16.920]  my friend.
[10:16.920 --> 10:22.360]  It's an honor to be here Alex you know I'm really interested to see the interview with
[10:22.360 --> 10:30.160]  Veritas at the bottom of the hour and with you coming on and it's just so so amazing
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.000]  at the time that we're living in to see all of this take place.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.440]  You know I really want to talk about and get into how the left is still pushing the whole
[10:38.440 --> 10:44.520]  white supremacists and how they're continuing on to try to demonize President Trump or anybody
[10:44.520 --> 10:47.080]  white who supports President Trump.
[10:47.080 --> 10:52.840]  That's the thing I and it really runs through run through me runs through me because we
[10:52.840 --> 10:56.800]  have people believing this nonsense.
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.680]  You know no one was calling President Trump a white supremacist before he ran for president
[11:01.680 --> 11:03.520]  before he went down the escalator.
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.840]  Once he went down then all of a sudden he became racist he became all of these things
[11:07.840 --> 11:09.640]  that he never was before.
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.480]  You have black hip hop stars saying they want to be like Trump.
[11:13.480 --> 11:16.680]  You have many people saying they want to be like Trump.
[11:16.680 --> 11:23.080]  So you know with all of this taking place right now because 2020 is coming up they have
[11:23.080 --> 11:28.000]  to do something to get people black people not to vote for President Trump.
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.440]  See that's the whole thing and for the life of me I don't understand how they're able
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.320]  to get so many people to be so naive to believe that all of a sudden because they've been
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.040]  saying it that President Trump is now a white supremacist.
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.480]  Are he supports white supremacy?
[11:45.480 --> 11:46.720]  You know it's ridiculous.
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.560]  So even Bernie Sanders this is going to be number clip do we have time for this?
[11:51.560 --> 11:54.880]  This is clip number eight.
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.640]  Clip number eight where Bernie Sanders he came out and said that okay let me just read it
[12:00.640 --> 12:02.080]  to you because this was on his tweet.
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.440]  He said do you think it's a coincidence that the racist manifesto of the El Paso shooter
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.760]  echoes Trump's language of invasion and infestation of immigrants.
[12:12.760 --> 12:16.160]  He's Bernie Sanders going to say I don't.
[12:16.160 --> 12:23.520]  Then he replies then he does at real Donald Trump is fanning the flames of white supremacy
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.240]  we must stop him.
[12:25.240 --> 12:31.960]  If anyone is fanning the flames of white supremacy if anyone is doing the white supremacy keeping
[12:31.960 --> 12:36.800]  this whole racial division going it is the liberal left.
[12:36.800 --> 12:46.160]  So if we can go to that video this is number eight number eight on the chart.
[12:46.160 --> 12:52.920]  I am concerned about the rise of any group of hate whether it's white supremacy I am
[12:52.920 --> 12:55.600]  very concerned about it.
[12:55.600 --> 12:57.840]  He's a savage killer.
[12:57.840 --> 13:03.880]  My administration believes our city should be safe havens for Americans not sanctuaries
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.320]  for criminals.
[13:08.320 --> 13:13.760]  So let me break in if you listen to the rhetoric pause it real quick right there for some reason
[13:13.760 --> 13:19.800]  when President Trump said it should be sanctuary for Americans and not criminals and they're
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.520]  suggesting that he's a white supremacist for saying that do you see the disconnect do you
[13:25.520 --> 13:31.560]  see how people are not realizing that they're being blatantly lied to I mean it's right
[13:31.560 --> 13:37.760]  there how is it possible another prime example is when President Trump said black people living
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.480]  in these rat infested cities like Baltimore all of a sudden you have people saying that
[13:43.480 --> 13:48.360]  President Trump is being racist because he's telling black people you don't have to live
[13:48.360 --> 13:55.920]  this way is anyone else okay with that I don't think so okay let's go back to it.
[13:55.920 --> 13:59.760]  If you listen to rhetoric from the president you would think that every person of color
[13:59.760 --> 14:04.080]  is somehow a gang member or ready to to rape and to kill the plunder and that's simply
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.000]  not the case but it's good politically however it's very useful for autocrats to demonize
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.640]  and project all these social ills upon the other when you have 15,000 people marching
[14:13.640 --> 14:19.400]  up you have two or three border security people how do you stop these people you can't this
[14:19.400 --> 14:28.480]  not that's only in the panhandle you can get away with that state okay so the gentleman
[14:28.480 --> 14:34.480]  before that said that President Trump is using this calling all black people people of color
[14:34.480 --> 14:43.040]  rapists and thugs and terrorists or you know criminals when President Trump was referring
[14:43.040 --> 14:46.920]  to the people that's coming across the border that's taking our children that's causing
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.520]  all this violence he's talking about ms-13 he's talking about these games they know very
[14:52.520 --> 14:57.960]  well who President Trump is referring to but they take it and they spin it and then and
[14:57.960 --> 15:01.040]  they talk about what President Trump does this because it's very good politically for
[15:01.040 --> 15:05.720]  him to do this to try to drum up his base to try to drum up support because people want
[15:05.720 --> 15:11.080]  to hear this no one wants the chaos is happening on the border to be taking place at all except
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.720]  for the left the only people that gain are the only people that stand to benefit from
[15:16.720 --> 15:22.560]  the chaos that's happening on the border and across America is the left because without
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.880]  the chaos the left has nothing that's the only reason why they keep talking about racism
[15:27.880 --> 15:37.160]  right supremacy division in this country because without that they have nothing nothing nothing
[15:37.160 --> 15:43.400]  but they keep doing it over and over my name is will johnson i am sitting in for alex he

[18:02.800 --> 18:07.280]  hey uh yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[18:07.280 --> 18:11.920]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.400]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[18:16.400 --> 18:20.560]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[18:20.560 --> 18:25.040]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.720]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.480]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.520]  shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.360]  80 years old i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut
[18:41.360 --> 18:46.880]  you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[18:46.880 --> 18:50.720]  like myself and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the
[18:50.720 --> 18:55.360]  info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've
[18:55.360 --> 19:02.080]  gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling thomas jefferson predicted
[19:02.720 --> 19:07.840]  over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.400]  were close to the ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.400]  saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and
[19:18.400 --> 19:23.360]  we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade
[19:23.360 --> 19:29.680]  war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.800]  and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.440]  want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've
[19:39.440 --> 19:44.720]  done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars
[19:44.720 --> 19:50.240]  dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those links because we are the light
[19:50.240 --> 20:01.280]  the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[20:01.280 --> 20:14.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:31.280 --> 20:34.320]  all right welcome back
[20:37.840 --> 20:44.160]  will johnson unites america first dot com guest host sitting in for alex he is on vacation
[20:45.040 --> 20:52.240]  but like i said earlier he is never on vacation he's always working hard he's never he's never
[20:52.240 --> 20:57.520]  stopped fighting against this tyranny okay so what i was talking about before we went to the break
[20:57.520 --> 21:02.800]  i was talking about bernie sanders and the white supremacists and how they're targeting president
[21:02.800 --> 21:08.320]  trump and the main reason why they're doing this is to get black people people of color to not vote
[21:08.320 --> 21:14.960]  for president trump there was an article that came out um i guess it was maybe uh two weeks ago
[21:15.760 --> 21:21.120]  where uh they said it was 36 percent of the black community now supports president trump
[21:21.120 --> 21:28.080]  can you imagine that 36 percent so all they they're thinking is okay we have to change this number
[21:28.080 --> 21:32.320]  we can't have people believing that president trump is for the american people
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.720]  you know one thing that i've noticed and i've always noticed this from the past that every
[21:38.720 --> 21:46.240]  time you have a white person yes there it is every time you have a white person that does
[21:46.240 --> 21:51.280]  something be it i'm not i'm using president trump in his example but it's happened in the past in
[21:51.280 --> 21:56.560]  history every time you have a white person that does something and benefit and black people benefit
[21:57.200 --> 22:03.680]  guess what they do they say he's a white supremacist are they saying he's being racist it happens
[22:03.680 --> 22:10.000]  every single time you know um or if they don't call you white supremacist they take you out look
[22:10.000 --> 22:17.360]  what they did to abe lincoln you know he he freed the slaves they took him out they can't have those
[22:17.360 --> 22:21.840]  type of scenarios they can't have people like president trump helping black people and going
[22:21.840 --> 22:29.440]  around what has president trump done name one thing that he has done that would would would
[22:29.440 --> 22:35.360]  validate saying that he is a white supremacist because oh women charlesville right charlesville
[22:35.360 --> 22:41.120]  he said there were good people on both sides i wish they would stop saying that there's no
[22:41.120 --> 22:44.800]  there's no democrats that are good on both sides i mean i wish they would say that because there
[22:44.800 --> 22:50.640]  has to be at least one democrat that's good on that side you get my point but they keep saying
[22:50.640 --> 22:55.680]  that he's talking about all the white supremacists good people on both sides as if white people on
[22:55.680 --> 23:01.920]  the right are not good you have to pay attention to exactly how they're doing this and you know what
[23:01.920 --> 23:07.760]  for the most part majority of the american people they're either not even paying attention to this
[23:07.760 --> 23:14.320]  craziness or if they are the the people that have brain cells left they're not they're not even saying
[23:14.320 --> 23:18.720]  you know what they're they're acknowledging that what the left is doing is completely crazy
[23:18.720 --> 23:25.280]  and it does not go along with rational thinking the american people are not dumb the american
[23:25.280 --> 23:31.040]  people are not stupid but for some reason you have the left they believe that the american people
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.640]  don't understand what they're doing they for another example and i'm not going to go into
[23:36.640 --> 23:43.680]  great detail on it but epstein they believe that the american people won't want to even question
[23:43.680 --> 23:50.000]  how did epstein die or all of these different things that took place during that they expect my
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.960]  point in that is that they expect the american people to just go along with it and not even
[23:54.960 --> 24:00.480]  question it this is what happened this will take place okay so i have another video i want to play
[24:00.480 --> 24:07.760]  this is of cori booker okay or i like to say cori booger this is going to be number 10 i'm
[24:07.760 --> 24:13.600]  going to play this clip of cori where he's trying to act like he's not like he's not the racist or
[24:13.600 --> 24:20.720]  he's not uh sponsoring it but that's exactly what they do the democrats sponsor they advocate for it
[24:20.720 --> 24:26.080]  they push for it they want the division without it they have nothing okay so let's go to this clip
[24:26.080 --> 24:35.120]  number 10 we can't let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who
[24:35.120 --> 24:43.920]  is or isn't a racist because of the answer to the question do racism and white supremacy exist
[24:43.920 --> 24:52.320]  is yes then the real question isn't who is or isn't a racist but who is and isn't doing something
[24:52.320 --> 25:07.760]  about it this is a question that has a deep moral resonance it's not enough to say i'm not a racist
[25:07.760 --> 25:17.280]  we must be anti-racism because there's no neutrality in this fight you are either an agent of justice
[25:17.280 --> 25:22.640]  or you are contributing to the problem okay pause it right there he's so you're either
[25:22.640 --> 25:28.560]  asian or you're contributing to the problem i would have to say that every single one of these
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.600]  politicians up on the hill that are democrats leftists and there are some rhinos in there
[25:33.600 --> 25:38.640]  because they don't say anything they're contributing to all of this they're the ones that's creating
[25:38.640 --> 25:45.040]  this aoc rushita to leave ilhan omar they're like the the four and i can't recall what's the other
[25:45.040 --> 25:54.960]  latest name uh presley they're all and i mark dice mark dice he coined the term the fascist
[25:54.960 --> 26:01.840]  four the fascist four i love it but they are like the the four horse women of the apocalypse when
[26:01.840 --> 26:08.160]  it comes to the chaos into the the the the destruction of america they are the ones
[26:08.160 --> 26:16.160]  that's leading the charge and you have the rest of these people uh bernie sanders coy booker and
[26:16.160 --> 26:22.880]  lizabeth warren the rest of them saying oh yeah we need to talk crazy like the four horse women of
[26:22.880 --> 26:28.160]  the apocalypse because they're getting attention they're getting all the attention so they're
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.280]  coming out they're speaking just as crazy as the rest of them because they want the attention as well
[26:33.280 --> 26:39.120]  so my thing is that what we really need to pay attention to is the state of the world that we're
[26:39.120 --> 26:46.080]  in right now the state of the world that we're in right now is that people are believing these crazy
[26:46.080 --> 26:52.640]  things that they're saying and they're taking it as if it's factual information that's the part that
[26:52.640 --> 26:59.520]  people don't realize they're taking it and believing it as if it's true i mean you can even talk about
[26:59.520 --> 27:04.960]  the whole climate deal the climate deal you pay money and the climate problems will go away we're
[27:04.960 --> 27:09.600]  supposed to believe the nonsense that they're putting out and there's another thing i'm going to get
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.800]  to maybe in the third hour about how uh lizabeth warren is fighting for trans to have health care
[27:17.360 --> 27:23.040]  why not just how can people just can't have health care how can you just can't say hey i'm so and so
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.480]  and i need health care and if you go to the doctor how are they gonna diagnose you how did
[27:28.480 --> 27:34.880]  how did they know how to treat you what if you have a grown problem you know i'm seriously
[27:34.880 --> 27:44.880]  how did they do it but anyways i digress the democrats the liberal media the socialist internet
[27:44.880 --> 27:52.080]  media social media i like to say socialist media they are all colluding with one another
[27:52.080 --> 27:58.960]  to take out the president of the united states and on top of that to undermine the united states
[27:58.960 --> 28:05.360]  president that's where we are and if you don't recognize it and you don't pay attention to
[28:05.360 --> 28:12.560]  what's going on in this war that we're in right now america is in the second world war a second
[28:12.560 --> 28:18.800]  world war second civil war we're in it right now we're in the second civil war right now
[28:18.800 --> 28:23.760]  and if you don't recognize you don't pay attention you're just going to be a casualty of this war
[28:24.560 --> 28:29.120]  so after the break we're going to come back alex is going to be with us we're going to talk more
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.960]  about he's going to talk about the veritas um and the video that just came out where google
[28:35.600 --> 28:42.400]  is getting caught red handed doing it again red handed they got caught with their hand in the
[28:42.400 --> 28:48.880]  cookie jar you're gonna see that and much more from alex after the break my name is will johnson and

[30:04.080 --> 30:07.920]  i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six
[30:07.920 --> 30:12.160]  years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about

[30:16.000 --> 30:19.920]  our experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to
[30:19.920 --> 30:23.520]  really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because
[30:23.520 --> 30:27.280]  they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere
[30:27.280 --> 30:34.080]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[30:34.080 --> 30:38.720]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.200]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[30:43.200 --> 30:47.040]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[30:47.040 --> 30:50.960]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma

[33:33.600 --> 33:38.080]  ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide i'm broadcasting from san diego
[33:38.080 --> 33:44.800]  california will johnson is in the austin info wars this center the atx and james oteef veritas fame
[33:44.800 --> 33:51.520]  is on the road but he's calling in and they'll let me know uh the minute that we get him there has
[33:51.520 --> 34:00.480]  been a new giant google data dump by whistleblowers google machine learning fairness it's always our
[34:00.480 --> 34:08.400]  wellion named whistleblower goes public says burden lifted off my soul and they have in there
[34:08.400 --> 34:14.880]  specifically that info wars is not good information they've said because i exposed everything you know
[34:14.880 --> 34:20.160]  years and decades before like trump would win and then jeffrey epstein was running a pedophile
[34:20.720 --> 34:27.520]  island and so i've got to be stopped but here's the big thing they've been telling congress
[34:28.080 --> 34:33.040]  that they don't censor any conservatives they don't censor any libertarians they don't censor any
[34:33.040 --> 34:39.760]  crump supporters they only censor fake news which they can define as whatever they want and then
[34:39.760 --> 34:47.120]  of course mitch mcconnell tried to put a link up to his house being basically assaulted people
[34:47.120 --> 34:53.200]  say they want to kill him they let the people keep their videos up on twitter and facebook that were
[34:53.200 --> 35:02.400]  pro attack mitch mcconnell leader of the senate but they would not allow the response to it and
[35:02.400 --> 35:09.680]  that's what this is about is fixing the election as the last big piece or tranche of document showed
[35:09.680 --> 35:16.000]  a month ago from james o' keith and project veritas he joins us now please in the one segment you
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.280]  have you've got the floor james o' keith tell us about the latest bombshell right as trump says

[35:36.400 --> 35:43.360]  sent us the machine learning documents um has gone public and he says a burden has been lifted off
[35:43.360 --> 35:50.720]  of his soul his name is zachary vorhees he's released thousands of documents from within google
[35:51.840 --> 35:58.160]  blacklist human raiders um he's basically blowing the whistle and saying that this is his google
[35:58.160 --> 36:04.240]  snowden moment and he's and he's and he's willing to go public he he was making 260 thousand dollars
[36:04.240 --> 36:10.960]  working for google a year he he says the police have been called on him from google there's video
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.560]  of him police confronting him outside his home so this man has gone public he sat down and talked
[36:16.560 --> 36:23.200]  to me and the video is up online alex now that's amazing and after you leave us we're grabbing that
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.880]  video right now from project veritas uh website tell people the headline on that video so they can
[36:28.880 --> 36:35.680]  find it and share it easier the headline alex is google whistleblower goes public says quote
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.120]  burden lifted off of my soul that's the headline of the video and it's on twitter it's on youtube
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.080]  it's the highest performing youtube video we've ever done today it's blowing up youtube we hope
[36:46.080 --> 36:52.480]  they don't take it down if they don't take it down it'll get well over a million views well this
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.200]  is you should get 500 million views i mean they've google testified i was there when it happened
[36:57.200 --> 37:01.200]  that they don't control any searches of any type well their whole system is about controlling
[37:01.200 --> 37:05.840]  searches uh that they've never censored anybody i mean they have really perjured themselves
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.600]  to congress can you elaborate on just how wild these documents are this is beyond smoking gun
[37:12.640 --> 37:20.640]  well i think in the video he goes into the blacklist that exist at google um these are
[37:20.640 --> 37:28.400]  uh uh documents that prove maybe that they've perjured themselves under oath he talks about
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.560]  um he talks about this algorithmic fairness document that was leaked this is the one that
[37:32.560 --> 37:39.360]  was cited in congressional hearings algorithmic fairness sounds like a orwellian fiction but it's
[37:39.360 --> 37:45.520]  an actual document within google uh talking about machine learning fairness they need to use
[37:45.520 --> 37:52.000]  product intervention to make the world more fair um and uh it's pretty pretty extraordinary
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.960]  perhaps the most extraordinary thing is that he has he's a thousand of these documents and he's
[37:56.960 --> 38:03.840]  we've published them on our website um a fringe ranking classifier score that that lists various
[38:03.840 --> 38:11.600]  news sites including cnn and gives them ratings um internal threat of communication shows uh
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.800]  an apparent discussion about the coffee beans document where one google employee expresses
[38:16.800 --> 38:24.800]  concern about hiring so it's all there it's a it's a wiki leak style dump um on our website
[38:24.800 --> 38:31.680]  project veritas.com and zack has courageously been willing to uh to to put himself on the
[38:31.680 --> 38:38.400]  line for the country with the hope that others follow in his footsteps alex incredible let's
[38:38.400 --> 38:43.680]  remember google has decided along with other tech giants to move to china to help suppress their
[38:43.680 --> 38:49.760]  population to help build censorship uh search engines like dragonfly they're already implementing
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.360]  that here uh being is somewhat censored but nothing compared to uh google we put in exact
[38:57.360 --> 39:04.000]  Breitbart headlines exact infowars headlines exact project veritas headlines and they won't even come
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.280]  up on google you go to Bing they're at the very very top and that's owned by microsoft so
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.880]  google has done what no one except the chai comms have done before build a search engine where they
[39:14.880 --> 39:20.400]  just put what they want on the top and the even bigger scandal is it's coming out that people
[39:20.400 --> 39:25.440]  are paying not just for the top ranking as an ad but that the other stuff is being paid uh to put
[39:25.440 --> 39:28.960]  up there and obviously it's going to take time to go through all these documents the bombshell
[39:28.960 --> 39:34.560]  after bombshell but look at the intimidation factor of them sending the police after him yeah
[39:34.560 --> 39:42.800]  they did it they did a what what we we've learned to be a wellness check um uh zack believes that
[39:42.800 --> 39:48.240]  google called the police on him google confirmed that they were they received a call sorry the police
[39:48.240 --> 39:54.560]  refer them they received a call and uh there's videotape of zack in san francisco on the street
[39:54.560 --> 40:01.920]  outside of his apartment putting his hands up um and and i guess submitting to the police again
[40:01.920 --> 40:08.800]  the google has sent zack a legal letter they uh are threatening him to cooperate so zack
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.600]  did in fact cooperate with the authorities but sent the documents to the department of justice
[40:14.640 --> 40:20.320]  to uh under william bar so this is all happening it's it's all part of this watershed moment the
[40:20.320 --> 40:26.480]  series of events these whistleblowers these brave insiders alex we know there's many more people
[40:26.480 --> 40:32.240]  on the inside we we've asked them to come forward we know that they will come forward our email address
[40:32.240 --> 40:40.880]  that that they're coming to is veritas tips at proton mail dot com that's veritas veritas tips
[40:40.880 --> 40:46.960]  at proton mail dot com and uh we we believe that there are people listening to this interview right
[40:46.960 --> 40:53.680]  now who work for google who are on the fence about coming public they're afraid don't be afraid
[40:53.680 --> 40:59.600]  they're actually more afraid of us uh than we are afraid of them because you you can't you can't
[40:59.600 --> 41:07.360]  stop morally courageous people who keep on coming out well that's right and look at how info wars
[41:07.360 --> 41:11.120]  is listed in there i mean they sit up there and say we're not censoring anybody they're censoring
[41:11.120 --> 41:18.320]  everybody and notice info wars is in there info wars is in there they have they have a lot of
[41:18.320 --> 41:24.400]  conservative websites in there again it the people say what's the solution what's the solution we
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.080]  don't want government involvement i'm not suggesting government involvement i'm suggesting these
[41:28.080 --> 41:34.000]  companies to be honest about what it is that they're doing at the very least let's begin with that
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.400]  and the only way to make them honest is to hold their feet to the fire and let sunlight be the
[41:38.400 --> 41:44.160]  best disinfectant they can't perjure yourself in congress you can't lie to the government at the
[41:44.160 --> 41:51.040]  very least so we we we want them to be honest and we think that the a continued crusade of people
[41:51.040 --> 41:56.000]  like jack but if you watch this video again the title of the video is google whistleblower goes
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.320]  public says quote burden lifted off my soul what strikes you is the passion of zack he's an extremely
[42:02.320 --> 42:10.000]  passionate committed man he's given up to he's given up his salary is his willingness to ability
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.360]  to get a job no that matters to him what matters by silicon valley standards of this man's a hero
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.680]  and talk about next shoe to drop what would you call this time we're in historically but there's
[42:21.680 --> 42:26.880]  a quickening with epstein and the chinese government and the economic war and all the
[42:26.880 --> 42:32.880]  clinton corruption of the foundation and the fbi corruption justice department and the russia gate
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.840]  i mean it's the wheels are coming off everything and i think the hubris of the democrats of the
[42:37.840 --> 42:44.960]  hubris of big tech at some point's got a break i think it is a watershed moment alex i think the
[42:44.960 --> 42:51.280]  people on the inside of these organizations are heroes our heroes tend to be anonymous they're
[42:51.280 --> 42:57.840]  not the celebrity flashy people we see in corporate media they're not the deep state individuals or
[42:57.840 --> 43:02.320]  the government individuals amazing job it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.200]  arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is is it the only network
[43:07.200 --> 43:11.920]  of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate trigger daddy that's not backed
[43:11.920 --> 43:16.240]  by some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government it is completely
[43:16.240 --> 43:22.080]  independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.480]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.960]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like
[43:30.960 --> 43:34.800]  this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era
[43:34.800 --> 43:38.800]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've
[43:38.800 --> 43:44.160]  been able to control and manipulate what news it views the person's allowed to have or express or
[43:44.160 --> 43:48.720]  hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the
[43:48.720 --> 43:52.800]  founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's
[43:52.800 --> 43:58.400]  been an unprecedented onslaught of deep blackwarming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[43:59.360 --> 44:04.640]  george arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.920]  and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the american flag because we still loved our country
[44:09.920 --> 44:14.480]  and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it but now they're trying to take
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.800]  it out of schools they're taking it down off of government buildings weird white leftist that
[44:18.800 --> 44:23.680]  want to virtue singular pulling down american flags and running up mexican flags this is the
[44:23.680 --> 44:28.640]  bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act in the time of
[44:28.640 --> 44:33.920]  incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american flag particularly the betsy
[44:33.920 --> 44:39.600]  ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back right there ladies and gentlemen
[44:39.600 --> 44:46.080]  america's back info wars dot com so whatever you do take action today and exercise your free speech
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.800]  in these bullies face all over not just the u.s but worldwide because more than ever the american
[44:50.800 --> 45:04.720]  flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.440]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.160]  close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the
[45:14.160 --> 45:20.480]  communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in
[45:20.480 --> 45:26.000]  polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.840]  our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so
[45:31.840 --> 45:36.640]  to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell
[45:36.640 --> 45:41.520]  us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've done is a wake of the human spirit
[45:41.520 --> 45:46.720]  and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners
[45:47.360 --> 45:51.920]  whatever you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[45:51.920 --> 46:04.560]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide without your support we won't be here and i couldn't thank you
[46:04.560 --> 46:08.400]  all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game i mean i want to stay in this game i want
[46:08.400 --> 46:13.520]  to take the globalist on total transparencies our whole operation if i bring in 35 million dollars
[46:13.520 --> 46:17.600]  half of that's the cost of the products we don't mark stuff up that much i don't care if i'm not
[46:17.600 --> 46:22.320]  making money but you need to buy the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got
[46:22.320 --> 46:26.960]  great toothpaste we've got great things like dna force plus but ultimate krill oil has been sold
[46:26.960 --> 46:31.520]  out for four months for whatever reason this became the most popular fish oil it's totally full of
[46:31.520 --> 46:37.120]  the bottle and it is the strongest purist krill oil and it cost us three times more because we
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.240]  have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any type of krill oil
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.560]  you get that doesn't give you fish burps which i don't like but gives you all the great benefits
[46:46.560 --> 46:51.280]  isn't real it's been boiled it's been real and it's been homogenized this is not this ladies and
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.480]  gentlemen is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere real krill oil folks is red
[46:56.480 --> 46:59.760]  it's not yellow it's not milky this is nothing but krill oil
[46:59.760 --> 47:06.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:23.840 --> 47:27.840]  welcome back on this live wednesday global edition will johnson's riding shotgun with me
[47:27.840 --> 47:33.760]  james ok only one segment he's on the road going into another meeting and ladies and gentlemen
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.840]  we got secret google documents the year and a half ago from a source i'll just leave it at
[47:39.840 --> 47:45.360]  that inside google they were paying millions of dollars to have people organically go out
[47:46.080 --> 47:54.320]  and downvote me all over the web in ratings so that google could delist me and then say
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.200]  he's rated as a non-credible source they also did it to my credit rating they did it to my
[47:59.200 --> 48:06.480]  banking rating and yeah we're getting the lawsuits ready you saw that the covington kid
[48:06.480 --> 48:12.000]  lawsuit got thrown out robert barnes predicted that here on air is basically
[48:13.840 --> 48:17.120]  from his research what they call captured councils with what it looked like
[48:18.800 --> 48:22.640]  got thrown out immediately he's he's filed suits there we are getting ready to file suits
[48:22.640 --> 48:27.520]  because the epstein case to bring on even more documents and we're looking to file suits on
[48:27.520 --> 48:31.120]  some of these financial institutions we have them dead to rights it's just going to cost a lot of
[48:31.120 --> 48:39.520]  money this war cost a lot of money to stand up and fight these people cost a lot of money but
[48:39.520 --> 48:45.760]  now the climate is here the climate is right and trump is starting to take big action these companies
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.680]  are spying on us they're selling our data they're working with foreign governments they're working
[48:49.680 --> 48:56.240]  with authoritarians they're acting in total bad faith and they've lied to congress and they are
[48:56.240 --> 49:02.080]  stealing our futures and stealing our ability to see and hear what we want this show is compelling
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.480]  it's powerful because of our guest because of our research and because of our dedication
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.200]  there's a lot of things in the chemical kingdom where you'll have a drug that something is supposed
[49:15.200 --> 49:22.000]  to carry the drug across the blood brain barrier tobacco companies add chemicals to cigarettes
[49:22.560 --> 49:28.160]  to make it go across the blood brain barrier even more well that's an analogy of inforce
[49:29.440 --> 49:35.440]  i can be brash i can be aggressive i can be angry but i carry it across the blood brain barrier
[49:35.440 --> 49:40.560]  all the other guests all the other info i got people's attention i love being made fun of
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.440]  in memes and things the the globalist figure that out they try to stop it because i didn't care what
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.840]  happened to me i cared about the truth of getting across so that when all came out people know they
[49:51.840 --> 49:56.560]  were being lied to so on hundreds and hundreds of issues we've been proven totally right our
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.280]  guests have been proven right and you are the info war i'm not just saying that as a pat on the head
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.680]  you are the reason we're here so please take advantage of the ultra massive extended sale
[50:07.680 --> 50:11.920]  we've had to take some of the things down because they're about to sell out so uh it's a new sale
[50:11.920 --> 50:15.600]  but it's still store i appreciate being double paid for your points and massive specials up to 60
[50:15.600 --> 50:19.520]  percent off storeable food still 50 percent off they're telling me that has to end a lot of the
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.440]  water filters have sold out still some of the great ones are there in full war store.com thank
[50:23.440 --> 50:27.680]  you all for the support will johnson is going to take over a bunch of guests for the balance of
[50:27.680 --> 50:34.000]  the transmission here in a moment but i wanted to air here just a few minutes from the full project
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.040]  veritas report that's also posted to info wars.com and news wars.com and yes twitter might slap you
[50:41.040 --> 50:46.240]  on the wrist or google might do something to you if you share this but they're going to take everything
[50:46.240 --> 50:51.200]  you've got these bullies if you don't start standing up so i know our audience gets that
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.200]  it's time to bring more people in and in closing a lot of folks right now are blown away a lot of
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.600]  people right now are apologizing info wars and we're seeing the most traffic we've ever received
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.960]  since the last election people are really understanding that we're not playing games
[51:06.960 --> 51:12.320]  and sure this stuff sounds incredible and shocking but it's true true the strange of the fiction
[51:12.320 --> 51:16.880]  so think of what's coming next think of what's going to come out next on google and facebook and
[51:16.880 --> 51:21.680]  twitter and apple think about what a huge time in history we're in and how amazing this all is
[51:21.680 --> 51:28.000]  so here's the whistleblower that the police have now come to his house hands up as a google intimidation
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.840]  in san francisco which they own these stills purpose of hearing and i can't wait to try to get
[51:31.840 --> 51:36.560]  this whistleblower on the broadcast here it is with james o'keith i've been living with this
[51:36.560 --> 51:45.200]  like burden for three years since 2016 when they started changing everything and you know and and
[51:45.200 --> 51:56.000]  to have that burden lifted off of my soul is i've never felt happier or you know more more
[51:56.000 --> 52:12.000]  peace with myself than i have like right now the police didn't announce themselves i decided that
[52:12.000 --> 52:18.800]  i'm just not going to talk to them so why are the police outside your home in san francisco
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.960]  and so what i did is i put out a dead man switch people like well you're brave it's like when i'm
[52:24.960 --> 52:31.680]  coming and and explaining what google was doing this is an act of atonement okay to make my conscious
[52:31.680 --> 52:38.720]  clear they're not objective peace they're not an objective source of information they are highly
[52:38.720 --> 52:45.360]  biased political machine um that is bent on never letting somebody like donald trump come to power
[52:45.360 --> 52:51.680]  again the google whistleblower has come out of the shadows this time releasing a large cash of
[52:51.680 --> 52:58.480]  remarkable confidential google documents that expose google's political bias and a scary progressive
[52:58.480 --> 53:05.760]  social agenda my name is zack forhees and i was an employee at google for eight years and the reason
[53:05.760 --> 53:11.760]  why i collected these documents was because i saw something dark nefarious going on with the company
[53:12.640 --> 53:20.400]  i felt that our entire election system was going to be compromised forever by this company that
[53:20.400 --> 53:26.320]  told the american public that it was not going to do any evil and i saw that they were making
[53:26.320 --> 53:31.920]  really quick moves not only in the documents but also in the internal speeches that the
[53:31.920 --> 53:36.080]  executives were giving to the company that they were intending to do that they were intending
[53:36.080 --> 53:43.920]  to sculpt the information landscape so that they could create their own version of what was objectively
[53:43.920 --> 53:50.480]  true it was june 24th project veritas released an investigation that included an interview in the
[53:50.480 --> 53:58.480]  shadows with google insider zack forhees within days it seems google was on to him what happened
[53:58.480 --> 54:04.400]  since you and i last spoke uh there's a lot of stuff that happened since you and i last spoke um
[54:04.400 --> 54:14.560]  um i went back to san francisco and i laid low and uh then out of the blue i got a letter from google
[54:15.360 --> 54:24.000]  um indicating that they knew what i had done and that letter contained uh several demands six of
[54:24.000 --> 54:32.800]  them in fact uh asking me uh whether i retained documents asking me to list the people that i
[54:32.800 --> 54:43.600]  give the documents to and uh requesting access to all of the data all of my uh all of my personal
[54:43.600 --> 54:50.640]  data my laptop my backup hard drives in order for them to come in and start scrubbing all of it so
[54:50.640 --> 54:55.440]  we have the letter in front of us and i have a copy of it here this letter does make a few
[54:55.440 --> 55:02.000]  demands it asks you to cease and desist it asks you to comply by a certain date no later than
[55:02.000 --> 55:10.560]  friday july 26th did you i did i did comply and i complied honestly what did you do uh what i told
[55:10.560 --> 55:17.120]  google is that yes i had retained some of their files and um i told them that yes i had sent it out
[55:17.120 --> 55:24.800]  and i told them truthfully that i had um sent their files to law enforcement uh what law enforcement
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.600]  agency did you send it to the law enforcement agency that i sent it to was the department of
[55:29.600 --> 55:35.360]  justice antitrust division under attorney general william bar but according to zack google's attacks
[55:35.360 --> 55:42.560]  on him had only just begun a twitter troll outed him as the leaker saying by the way zack shouldn't
[55:42.560 --> 55:50.880]  she remove well-employed tech geek from your bio mr leaker hmm so who do you think one snowflake
[55:50.880 --> 55:57.360]  is well i had my suspicions that it might be uh insider from google since that information that
[55:57.360 --> 56:04.880]  he posted wasn't public after i realized that google knew who i was um i started going to uh
[56:04.880 --> 56:11.520]  lawyers and attorneys and trying to figure out like um what google's likely next step was going to be
[56:12.160 --> 56:18.880]  and uh both attorneys i talked to both said this is the first step in having your life ruined
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.360]  they're gonna come after you and so i realized that this is what was coming to me so what i want to
[56:23.360 --> 56:33.760]  let them know is you know um you know look i've yeah i've got your data yeah and so what i did is
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.720]  i put out a dead man switch so that in case they were going to either try to destroy my life through
[56:38.720 --> 56:44.560]  the legal system or that they were trying to just you know off me because you know i'm exposing their
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.880]  a really big thing how they are tampering with elections um i wanted to let them know that hey
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.360]  look if something were to happen with me then these documents are going to be released immediately
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.760]  what is a dead man switch for those who aren't familiar with that so a dead man switch is
[56:59.760 --> 57:06.000]  something that people that have um information about a corporation or somebody else uh and
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.120]  they're concerned about their personal safety and possibly their life and what they do is that they
[57:11.680 --> 57:18.960]  let that entity know that in the case that they get offed that uh the information will be released
[57:18.960 --> 57:25.600]  to the public and so i set up a dead man switch to trigger in the case that i was killed or
[57:25.600 --> 57:34.480]  assassinated and so um i let them know that i was going to do that um and uh to protect myself
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.760]  the next day uh the police uh began looking for me in two different locations
[57:41.760 --> 57:49.120]  so google
[58:12.160 --> 58:16.720]  great things like dna force plus but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months

[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:33.520]  all right welcome back will johnson sitting in for alex jones um you know i took a picture and i
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:39.840]  posted the picture for me here in the studio and i just put it on facebook and in the picture you
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:47.360]  can't really see where i'm at or anything and i said it's uh you know um actually my my my uh my
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:54.240]  better half put a comment out there about the the show being the most banned show on in the world
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:01.360]  and i just tried to put another comment out here and i put i abbreviated i put iw.com for its last
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:08.880]  show because a lot of people asking about the link so and facebook is not allowing me to do that even
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:14.640]  it just came back when i tried to when i tried to post it it just came back and says you cannot
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:23.360]  post this so their their the censorship is at an all-time high you know i mean what was it over a
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:31.040]  year ago was it august uh six last year info wars was banned from all the socialist media platforms
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:36.800]  all in the same day you know it's just a coincidence that they all did it the same day
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:44.400]  what what how does that happen so did they pick up the phone call twitter call google and google
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:50.640]  call facebook facebook called apple and then they just went on the on their rounds and called the
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:55.280]  different socialist media outlets and said okay now we're going to pull the plug on them
[1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:06.960]  have you not paid attention this is to me these socialist media outlets that are on the internet
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:13.840]  remind me of nazi germany and then they want to call white people neo-nazis and everyone else
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:22.880]  the fascists but it's what they're doing is nothing different than the neo-nazi germany was doing
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:28.960]  and instead of taking physical books taking them out to the field and burning them what they're
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:37.920]  doing today what they're doing today is that they're taking digital books and burning them
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:48.080]  them and that's what they did here so why would anybody support a socialist entity that is trying
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:57.120]  to take away americans voice right think about that you have people are saying yes alex jones
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:03.440]  should be removed he should be removed and then they want to if you say alex jones on these socialist
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:09.920]  media platforms there's your subject to get banned they're subject to delete your facebook
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:17.760]  they're gonna they're gonna digitally burn your book and it's not just facebook google
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.520]  you know they had they they used to google had uh what was it called google plus where people go
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:28.480]  on there and they can do comments and different things like that but i think they've since people
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:33.680]  didn't really gravitate to it so they didn't there's not too much of it around but you still
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:39.840]  have twitter you still have fascist book you still have um youtube where a lot of people
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:45.920]  communicate and do videos and you have these socialist media outlets that are blocking conservatives
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:52.640]  now just to be clear they have blocked some liberals some that are on the left and the only
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:58.080]  time they get blocked is when they start waking up when they start waking up to what's happening
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:03.760]  then these socialist media outlets will start blocking them they didn't experience it before
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:09.600]  then and so as long as you're anti-american as long as you're anti-trump as long as you're anti
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:17.280]  info wars dot com then they will let you thrive they will even help you succeed they will even
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:27.200]  push your videos above and beyond it is crazy what's happening in america in this second civil war
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:34.960]  right now the battle was primarily on the internet now the battle is going to the streets
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:41.840]  the battle is going to portland the battle is in el paso the battle is wherever these
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:47.760]  leftists can get people to go and be destructive you've got to wake up next we're going to have
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.240]  robert burns on with us and he's going to go into great detail about every this and much more
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:05:02.080]  will johnson this is info wars dot com as we witness the most disastrous geological activity
[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:08.720]  in recorded history the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:16.240]  war borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged the world is going to change
[1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:21.760]  and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:28.560]  when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could be gone in an instant and
[1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:35.920]  grocery stores could be empty in three days having storable foods and the ability to purify water
[1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:41.760]  will give you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:48.320]  or makes you a slave to a dying system buys storable foods and an alexa pure gravity water
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:56.880]  filter today support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from info wars store

[1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:39.280]  for alex why he's on a well-deserved vacation so we're soon before let me let me talk about this
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:49.040]  real quick turbo force you see i have an orange juice right here i traveled from california
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:55.280]  to texas and it's like a three-day drive especially if you're not i had a trailer
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:07:02.400]  behind me so i can't go really fast so i'm driving and i love god's country and it's beautiful
[1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:09.200]  but being humans we get tired and even just after four hours of driving and i'm starting
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:15.680]  to get tired and i remembered i said oh i have a pack of turbo force so i reached into my console
[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:22.080]  in my vehicle and i took out the turbo force and i stopped at a gas station and i got me some orange
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:28.960]  juice um it wasn't quite this big um the the typical size is a little bit smaller but and i'll put
[1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:34.320]  like half the packet of the turbo force in it because the stuff is so great and so wonderful it
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:40.000]  gets you going but there's quite a bit in this one so i'm gonna put the whole thing in this one and
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:47.520]  when i was driving from california to texas i took the turbo force and i put it in orange
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:59.680]  juice and i took it and i shook it up get it get in there real good and you know it's amazing it
[1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:05.600]  actually enlightens the taste i mean i really like it i mean i'm a big fan of orange juice already but
[1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:13.440]  yeah it's i mean it's it's really good let me see
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:22.880]  wow it's like energy immediately
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:33.360]  i can't believe you know what maybe info wars should sell orange shoes with the turbo force in it
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:40.800]  because the way it tastes it it's almost like it just brightens up the orange shoes it gives it
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:47.200]  more energy in the orange juice itself if that makes sense but turbo force here i got another
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:54.400]  packet here let me show it the turbo force at info wars store dot com most of the time they
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:09:00.400]  keep it on sale and i'm like how do they how are they able to do that they keep it on sale
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:06.640]  for so long and i think now i've never been told this but i think the main reason why they keep it
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:13.600]  on sale and they keep the price so low is that so people will try it i mean it's the whole box
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:24.720]  full is it 30 bucks right at 30 bucks 29.95 you get it and you try it 29.98 30 bucks 30 bucks
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:31.040]  today's prices you could you spend that just going to mcdonald's but 30 bucks you get it and you
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:39.680]  will be amazed so you know i went through and i think i have a copy somewhere here um maybe not
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:44.400]  but i went through and i always like looking at the reviews because i talk about the the different
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:51.360]  reviews that's going on with uh with the people who buy the turbo force and just to see if the
[1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:56.320]  reviews are similar to mine and ever since i've been talking about the orange shoes with turbo
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:03.760]  force i've actually seen people comment on there about them taking turbo force with the orange
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:11.280]  shoes uh yeah there's one with johnny boy and he says uh he says i'm absolutely addicted to this
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:20.720]  amazing product uh also a member of the houston info wars army as well as the daily distance
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:27.520]  runner um i live on this stuff and he says personally he said personally i'm not crazy
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.960]  about the taste now just in water it is pretty strong and but i like it in hot water because
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:39.200]  then i'm drinking like tea but he says personally um i'm not crazy about the taste so usually he'll
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:45.200]  mix it into uh power aid or orange juice see and that's exactly what i did
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:54.000]  and i you've got to do it and i encourage anyone go to info wars store dot com right now
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:00.720]  leave a comment try with orange shoes leave a comment let me know and i would love to get

[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:27.200]  bottle of it and that is the dna force i've heard nothing but remarkable things about
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:33.920]  taking dna force and it's it's and it's not that it's like the miracles not like the miracle drug
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.240]  it's not a drug it's like a supplement but it's not anything that you like okay i'm gonna take
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:46.560]  this is gonna cure all elements that's not even it the dna force has so many benefits and i want
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:50.800]  to take it i'm going to get it today and i'm gonna once i get it and i take it then i'm gonna come
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:54.560]  back and i'm gonna tell everyone my personal experience because i think that's what people
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:59.120]  want to hear because i can go down the long line list of everything the reasons why you
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:04.640]  should take it based on the documentation that they have in there but i like to do it based on
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:12.640]  my personal experience just like the turbo force sounds good all right so while we're waiting for
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:18.400]  mr burns to join us i want to go to another clip that i had here and i think we have time
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:28.160]  time um before veritas james james o' keith came on um actually let me talk about that real quick
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:37.360]  with james o' keith and the veritas google attacking this gentleman for exposing them
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:44.560]  for what they're doing why would that not terrify people how is it that google has so much power
[1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:51.120]  and what and what did google tell okay so the google told the police department a wellness check
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:59.600]  a wellness check to go see to go check on him and you know they're like looking at him okay so
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:04.320]  a wellness check is just walking up to him right why not why does he have to hold his hands up
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:10.960]  don't shoot how does he get in that position because google asked for them to go do a wellness
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:17.280]  check now correct me if i'm wrong but a wellness check is to go check on someone's well-being
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:23.600]  to make sure that they're okay right but i think in this case google is trying to build up
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:30.960]  documentation or build up a case against him to say that he may be you know off his rocker or he
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:38.800]  may be mentally disturbed but he was getting played a quarter million dollars a year from google
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:44.720]  so you mean to tell me that google is hiring people that's mentally unstable or they're just
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:52.160]  saying that now you're mentally unstable because you shared inside documents that prove what google
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:58.240]  and what all of us have been believing why is google trying to change the outcome of the 2020
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:05.440]  election that's the most important thing and who gave them this power why do they why who's allowing
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:11.440]  them to do that and i'm gonna tell you it is us the american people that has allowed google to do
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:16.960]  this and i i'm gonna be honest with you i used to work in it and i loved using google because
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:21.680]  if i need to find the answer to something i could google it and some super geek out there has put
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:28.800]  the solution on google be it in the youtube video be it in the documentation you can find it via google
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:37.520]  and google knew and they know exactly what they've done and because they don't like somebody because
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:42.480]  they don't like the president of the united states that the american people elected so basically
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:48.080]  they're saying that the american people you don't understand what you did so we're going to try
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:53.920]  everything we can to reverse the will of the american people the american people should not
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:15:00.800]  be allowed to select the sitting president of the united states and that's exactly what they're saying
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:07.200]  and that's exactly what they're doing that's their agenda they want a socialist communist democrat to
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:14.880]  run this country into the ground which is amazing to me because google resides in america so i guess
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:21.200]  what does that mean google they get to stay at the top of the food chain because at some point
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:27.040]  they're going to come from google as well google is helping these socialists right now to take them
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:32.560]  out to take us out but they're going to come for you as well google elizabeth warned she stopped
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:39.680]  talking about it here lately but even elizabeth warned wants to go after you did someone at google
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:46.080]  get to elizabeth warned you have to ask that question did they did they because she's not
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.080]  talking about it any longer i haven't heard her say anything in a while all right my name is will

[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:31.120]  reason this became the most popular fish oil it's totally full the bottle and it is the strongest
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:36.320]  purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive

[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:01.840]  this is nothing but krill oil robert barnes what does big tech become a big tech are big babies
[1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:05.920]  that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence social
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:10.240]  economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that
[1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:14.320]  that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:18.000]  about this the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this has to bring
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.320]  real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:26.800]  change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:31.120]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:35.920]  recover after the great depression the informers audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:41.040]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:45.360]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:49.680]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:53.440]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[1:19:53.440 --> 1:19:57.920]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what we just saw
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:18.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:37.360]  now mr burns i've i've watched mr burns and i listened to him talk and it's just like uh
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:44.240]  here's like a wealth of knowledge just walking around on two feet and it's amazing um i've learned
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:50.960]  so much just listening to him and he has so many points that are on point and it's just like how
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:56.160]  how is it even possible that someone has all of this together like this and it's a real honor
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:21:02.960]  and pleasure to uh talk to you again mr burns hey happy to be here yeah cool so did you see the
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:10.320]  video with the veritas but the google and the whole the whole document dump i did i see i mean
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:14.720]  it's another whistleblower not only that sarah carter reported that this information has been
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:20.560]  turned over to the department of justice as part of their antitrust investigation as evidence improved
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:26.320]  of that antitrust investigation so at multiple levels it's significant and consequential and
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:31.600]  it's uh it's revelatory at the scope of it it's amazing what veritas is doing and it shows the
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:37.440]  degree to which what google is doing is so egregious that whistleblowers like this are willing to come
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:42.880]  forward so it's it's extraordinary it's it's an amazing time to be alive in that sense
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:47.280]  in these big tech oligarchs think they're beyond the law and above the law and i think the fact that
[1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:53.360]  the president had attorney general bar come out and announce a full-scale wholesale antitrust
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:59.280]  investigation not just a potential antitrust investigation not just a possible review but
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:05.440]  a microsoft level antitrust investigation and bill gates just was uh on the other day saying that the
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:11.120]  antitrust investigation is the main reason why microsoft never developed into a full-scale
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:17.280]  monopoly in the mobile app space because they were so concerned with the antitrust investigation
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:21.840]  they end up not pursuing that to the degree they otherwise actually would have any things
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:26.640]  they would have otherwise dominated it so that's why just announcing it it's not a coincidence
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:31.760]  that after announcing it two major google whistleblowers have both come out and blown the whistle
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:36.720]  and given inside information and intel that it's critical and essential to breaking up big tech
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:41.520]  to taking on big tech that has occurred so the president is taking the necessary steps
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:46.480]  you may need to take more steps but these are the necessary immediate steps that are already
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:52.880]  paying off with the veritas whistleblower activity taking place in just the last two weeks right mr
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:59.040]  mr barn so let me ask you do you think the attorney general bar is actually gonna do anything
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:03.200]  do you think that it's going to sit on it and gather more information the only reason why
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:08.080]  i asked that question because we're we've seen hillary clinton she's still walking around nothing's
[1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:13.360]  happened to her comey he leaked information nothing happened to her president trump has already
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:18.160]  mentioned you know had the summit about the whole censorship with the socialist tech media
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:22.720]  out there and nothing has happened people are still getting banned people are still being
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:28.800]  censored the shadow bandings taking place you're still being threatened to be removed if not
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:35.280]  deleted or dizzily burned from these platforms do you think something's actually going to happen
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:41.920]  i think something is happening in that sense so before there was talk of it but there's been a
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:48.000]  steady escalation of activity by the executive branch so it started off the sort of a warning
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:53.040]  then it would then it was the trump using the bully pulpit to question what big tech was doing
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:58.880]  then that went even further with the announcement of a review of a possible investigation and then
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:04.720]  attorney general bars announcement of a full inquiry and the difference is antitrust full
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:10.080]  inquiries are rare so for them to announce that they're doing a meaningful so this is not like the
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:15.680]  what sessions was doing with these sort of cover let's have someone look at whether or not the
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:20.320]  clinton foundation investigation was done correctly it's not like that this is a full scale
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:25.680]  investigation any trust lawyers understand its consequence it means the u.s. governments highly
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:32.320]  likely to go forward with both civil and criminal action and google cannot afford to continue to
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:37.760]  have these kind of people give inside intel information to the department of justice to
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:42.960]  go public with their whistleblowing activity continuously because what it reveals is that
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:48.400]  forever google has been saying that they are not manipulating their algorithm for partisan purposes
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:53.920]  and they're not manipulating their algorithm against economic competitors but but what this
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:59.120]  evidence that came out today showed is that they are doing both and that they have made extensive
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:05.440]  and expansive efforts into doing both the that would clearly implain me by the antitrust laws
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:10.560]  in ways that could easily bankrupt them if the department of justice pursues that path i think
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:15.280]  attorney general bar has shown a willingness and a readiness to pursue it and the president's
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:20.080]  willingness and a readiness to pursue it that i think the only thing that could salvage big tech
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:25.360]  is if they do not meddle in the 2020 election but they're already doing that i mean for example
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:30.720]  just yesterday i was on youtube which is owned by google and they have what they call suggested
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:36.640]  search terms and i just i curious thought i wonder what the clinton body count documentaries are
[1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:42.640]  now currently on youtube so i searched clinton body count in the search suggestion box nothing
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:48.000]  came up at all instead what came up was clinton body shop reviews i mean that was it that was
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:52.480]  youtube's recommendation is that you go somewhere to find that that and clinton you know there's
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:56.560]  a lot of little towns called clinton new york other places that you can get body shop reviews
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:00.320]  they clearly that's what you were looking for that they that youtube doesn't know and google
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:06.320]  doesn't know what what does clinton body count things all about so i think that's that's the scope
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:10.960]  of it that's the scale of it it shows a degree to which there i mean there you can see right there
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:16.560]  they're doing a lot of time you know that's google that proves that it's google right yeah when you
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:21.840]  do and when you type in count it's not it's not even populating anything so they're perfect exactly
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:27.360]  and i can imagine thousands upon thousands if not millions of people are searching the clinton
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:33.600]  body count body bags you know let me ask you this do you think do you think in with inside of google
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:39.840]  that they're probably going to do a purge of the people that they think might be you know whistleblowers
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:46.880]  are you know if they've ever hinted to it well these kids oh absolutely the thing is in california
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:50.960]  they have to be very very careful so one of the reasons why these people are going forward and
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:58.080]  going forward in a public way is that california prohibits uh retaliation or firing or any employment
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:03.200]  discrimination against someone because they're a whistleblower so if you're at google right now
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:09.440]  the best way to protect yourself job wise is to blow the whistle because then google can do nothing
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:15.600]  and if they do do anything you have an easy lawsuit for major damages so that's why the smart thing
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:19.760]  to do for anybody at google it even if they didn't want to be a whistleblower but they just want
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:24.400]  employment security the best way to get employment security become a whistleblower you become a
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:29.920]  whistleblower in california and the any employer who terminates you the size and scale of google
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:35.120]  they're going to be subject to unique liability and responsibility and and there are a lot of
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:40.400]  whistleblower cases in california i've litigated several of them and they can lead to big damages
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:45.360]  awards because juries don't like it when employers take any punitive or retaliatory action against
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:49.760]  an employee so for example there are some smart employees that might think they're an employment
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:54.080]  trouble or difficulty and one of the things you do in california is when you find something that's
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:58.480]  wrong with your employer and you run and blow the whistle on it and now all of a sudden the employer
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:02.800]  who might have been planning on firing you independently now is in a troublesome situation
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:08.080]  so the uh so any smart employee at google right now or any of the california big tech companies
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:13.840]  the best way to have a guaranteed employment security is find something that they're doing
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:19.920]  illicitly and blow the whistle on it whether it's political partisan manipulation or uh
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:25.840]  discrimination against other economic competitors anti-trust activity anti-trump activity whatever
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:30.960]  it is blow the whistle now and you can have full employment economic security moving forward
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:37.520]  yeah i see that you know i was working at a tech job in in in silicon valley and my boss
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:43.760]  he expressed how much he hated president trump during our team meetings constantly and i just
[1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:49.920]  had to be tight-lipped because i had a family to feed and i didn't want to and i talk out now

[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:35.840]  strongest purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the

[1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:34.720]  show and now your host will johnson all right welcome back we have mr barnes on with us and
[1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:42.080]  we've been talking about great detail about google and the censorship and i consider this
[1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:50.000]  warfare because they're doing what they want to break down communications to try to disrupt
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:58.720]  the the normal process of election season and mr barnes we were talking about uh google and the
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:03.920]  people working inside of google and people working inside of big tech and you have a very good point
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:09.920]  that the best way to save your job is to go ahead and do the whistle blowing if you if you don't
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:16.160]  agree with with the big the socialist big techs have been doing then and you see the information
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:23.200]  what they're doing tell it right i mean tell it i mean that's the best way and i agree i agree with
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:28.800]  you if you see if you see the corruption i mean as a human being you would imagine that these people
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:33.280]  would be saying yes i got to do it even the gentleman in the video saying he felt a burden
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:40.880]  lifted off of his soul exactly if you want to save your job you can also save your country
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:46.800]  blow the whistle on big tech because that's the best way to do both and so i think there's going
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:51.760]  to be more people who have more intel who have more information that goes to the intentionality
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:56.480]  aspect of what google is up to i think also google has been very creative at how they've
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:01.840]  approached certain aspects of their big tech monopoly so the way antitrust works it's when
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:07.600]  you have an economic monopoly that by itself does not constitute an antitrust violation there's some
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:12.320]  that say it should but just legally right now the courts don't consider that to be an antitrust
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:19.280]  violation it's when you leverage that monopoly power to gain an unfair economic edge over a
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:25.040]  competitor that that constitutes an antitrust violation for which there are severe consequences
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:30.400]  under the sherman act and other laws including trouble damages and lawsuits attorney fees you
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:36.240]  have to pay including civil fines that can go into the billions and billions and of course criminal
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:41.600]  prosecution that can completely break up the company antitrust has unique remedies that the court
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:46.720]  systems are afforded in order to take on people who are violating the antitrust laws so in this
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:52.080]  context what google has done is they've levered they didn't become a 92 percent monopoly over the
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:57.760]  search engines by accident by coincidence or by natural technological edge they achieved it and
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:04.160]  attained it by using their monopoly power in other areas like android by owning the android system
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:10.000]  and things like it in order to monopolize other aspects of economic power and that in turn gives
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.480]  them the political power they have so it's how the two things are connected like people have said
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:18.800]  well just because it's an antitrust case doesn't mean it will do anything about their political
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:24.720]  discrimination not on its face but the way it's indirect because what happens is without their
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:30.000]  economic monopoly they wouldn't be able to have their political monopoly their monopoly over news
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.920]  their monopoly over information because the two are so interrelated and integrated and so by taking
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:41.200]  on their economic predominance you'll be able to take on their political predominance so that's
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:46.560]  why the two are connected that's why the president has escalated into that area because he knows their
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:53.440]  monetary motivation and their monetary means of economic control and economic monopoly is how
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:58.720]  they're deliberately interfering with and intruding in the elections now there's no doubt
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:03.840]  that's continuing to happen because right now today people can go on to google and then compare
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:10.960]  say bing.com or compare duck.go and just search Alex Jones's name and on google info wars doesn't
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:16.320]  even show up on the first page uh whereas by contrast info wars is the almost the only one
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:21.680]  that shows up in the search results for bing or duck.go and always at the top so they've been
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:26.480]  deliberately back at the time when google was first hit with an antitrust investigation
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.440]  for a couple of days there was somebody at google who fixed the algorithm so that it was honest
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:36.800]  and accurate not deceptive and misleading and you could actually search google and and info wars
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:41.280]  is what came up first and info wars came up repeatedly then about a week later somebody
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:46.960]  went back in and fixed it and when they fixed it they basically took away the ability to find info
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:52.960]  wars directly on the front page by searching for Alex Jones. Mr. Barnes let me let me ask you a question
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:59.680]  if you're if you're google execs right now because i don't know if you if you saw i would imagine
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:05.120]  that you did see the video right after the 2016 election it was a panel of google execs
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:10.240]  came up to figure out and they had a they had a discussion on how they can stop this election
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:15.920]  from happening again and they had and they were thinking okay we got four years to try to figure
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:22.240]  out how to prevent president trump from becoming president starting in 2016 if you're a google exec
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:27.600]  right now and one of these that were sitting on that panel and this document dump just took place
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:34.160]  what would you what would be going through your mind right now well i think there's no doubt that
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:38.960]  if you're after any of the google board members you should see escalating trouble that you're not
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.720]  going to be able to contain or control because it's your own people repeatedly going outside
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:49.120]  the fold to blow the whistle against you if you're the legal team you see escalating risk
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:54.800]  by continuing to meddle in the elections you're continuing to motivate trump to motivate attorney
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:59.760]  general bar to motivate the department of justice to reaction against you but in particular i would
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:06.400]  worry if i was at google aside from stock value and market value over time i would worry about
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:12.880]  perjury by high ranking google employees before congress over the past three years so one of the
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:16.320]  utilities those congressional hearings which could have been better conducted could have been far
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:21.280]  more effective effective congress should have tied it to legislation they didn't but what was still
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:26.000]  effective about it wasn't it set up a lot of potential perjury allegations and accusations
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.120]  against high ranking big tech individuals particularly at google who denied manipulating
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.920]  their algorithm at all and that's just being contradicted today by the whistleblower with
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:40.400]  documents to prove it with his own personal testimony to prove it with his own whistleblowing
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:47.280]  to prove it uh but on top of that the uh you have the implication that the various google
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:52.640]  employees including the google ceo that alex challenged up in dc just about a year ago
[1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:57.920]  which involved a perjury they made statements underwrote that they were not doing a bunch of stuff
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.480]  as these documents show that they were in fact doing so is the ceo's defense going to be that he
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:07.520]  had no idea what his own company was doing when it appears that this was done in detail
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:12.160]  it was easily available in documents did they support perjury did they conspire to commit
[1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:18.080]  perjury these are crimes easily prosecutable crimes and prosecutable crimes against high
[1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:25.280]  ranking google people including the google ceo himself so if i was a ceo at google i would be
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:30.880]  sweating bullets right now i would be lawyering up as much as possible i'd be looking at exit packages
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:35.920]  to not be around for when the storm comes so i think that will be the aspect and they have to
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:41.760]  meaningfully take action because big tech has shown no ability to restrain itself it's only
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:46.880]  going to be restrained by executive action from the executive branch by president trump i agree with
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:52.000]  you and you know what i'm i'm wanting president trump to bring the hammer down on these socialist
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  tech companies because it seemed like they've doubled down on you know when president trump
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  had the summit it's like they doubled down on it say we don't care what president trump says
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.440]  we're gonna just continue to do more of this and guess what we're gonna we're gonna pick it up and
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:13.680]  even do more you know if you go to google and type in was it president list of president united
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:19.840]  states presidents and i did this like a month ago they and they changed the order of it and they have
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:25.920]  president obama listed first can you can you guys showed up on the screen for us see i mean why would
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:32.320]  you do that president of the united states and they list president obama first and then they have
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:40.640]  president trump and then they have george hw bush and then they mix up the order as it go down a
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:46.480]  little bit because then they have kennedy's and that bill clinton why do you i mean just imagine
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:52.640]  a young child doing their school paper research you know and they they type in president united
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:56.480]  states they're not going to like look at the dates they're going to look at the listing of the
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:00.880]  presidents and they're going to say president obama is president you know i mean and it's
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:07.120]  such manipulation on a mass scale and most people won't even catch it and only reason why i noticed
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:12.800]  that because about six months ago google did something similar where they had the list of
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:17.920]  presidents and they had them all in order but and where where president trump's picture was they had
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:23.520]  it blank they had his name but they had his picture blank and then like he did like he didn't even exist
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:28.800]  and went over to being being showed it correctly and being is because it's not google a lot of people
[1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:34.320]  don't know that because it's not google it's it's it's really amazing that these socialist tech
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:39.760]  companies are doing all of this mr barnes i would love to talk to you more after this break so stay
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:44.000]  with me i want to get your opinion on more of this censorship that's taking place against
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:49.920]  conservatives and how liberals are being affected by it do liberals even care i don't think they do
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:58.320]  they love seeing conservatives being tortured in this in the city info wars dot com without your
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:03.200]  support we won't be here and i couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:07.360]  game i mean i want to stay in this game i want to take the globalist on total transparencies
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:11.840]  our whole operation if i bring in 35 million dollars half of that's the cost of the products
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:15.760]  because we don't mark stuff up that much i don't care if i'm not making money but you need to buy
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:20.560]  the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got great toothpaste we've got great
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.280]  things like dna force plus but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever
[1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:30.160]  reason this became the most popular fish oil it's totally full the bottle and it is the strongest
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:35.360]  purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:40.960]  laboratory process to remove mercury any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:44.960]  which i don't like but gives you all the great benefits isn't real it's been boiled it's been
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:49.840]  real and it's been homogenized this is not good this ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:54.800]  krill oil you're gonna find anywhere real krill oil folks is red it's not yellow it's not milky
[1:43:54.800 --> 1:44:01.600]  this is nothing but krill oil last night i'm on info wars dot com and i read chris pratt
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:08.080]  criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the shirt that i envisioned a betsy ross but also
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:14.000]  another just classic american flag all 50 stars with the gadson snake super imposed over and on
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:18.480]  the back america's back info wars dot com but what's better than just an american flag about a
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:22.720]  don't tread on me under the flag take don't trail the american flag it's a perfect combo so great minds
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:26.400]  think alike i mean whoever designed that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar

[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:18.960]  all right let's get back to mr barns talking about the censorship with google facebook and twitter
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:26.720]  and all of the socialist tech giants out there socialist media tech giants so mr barns let me
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:36.320]  ask you this if if you're working at google and you see this information do you think and you
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:40.560]  alluded to it earlier that the best thing you can do is go ahead and put the information out
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:48.240]  i don't but people are afraid because what what what's to stop google from doing a wellness check
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:54.560]  for for anybody at this point because to me that is retaliation what's to stop them from doing it
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:59.280]  and they just gonna build up a case that you have a mental illness and then we had we do a wellness
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.920]  check on you because you're doing something you shouldn't be doing and isn't now isn't hasn't it
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:10.160]  been proven that google has been working with china and they won't even work with the pentagon
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:17.520]  but yet they're upset because people are putting the truth out well no doubt peter teal has gone
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:24.320]  public and has disclosed in detail the degree to which google is involved in in his view is is
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:31.280]  borderline treasonous activity according to peter teal who is the founder paypal and other big tech
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:36.000]  companies but is more on the libertarian side of the political aisle so i think the fact that
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.880]  peter teal is willing to go public with that in a high-profile way reveals the degree to which
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:46.800]  he believes google is enabling the chai comms and enabling china at the expense of the united
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:52.800]  states of america to pursue a certain national security interest i mean we're seeing right now
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:58.640]  what china's attitude is towards freedom and liberty and democracy that it hasn't changed at all
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:04.000]  by what's taking place in hong kong so the for people who don't know i mean hong kong was not
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  traditionally part of china for a long time now and in fact there was a uk protectorate up until
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:16.240]  about 1999 and then with the agreement to turn it back over to china china agreed to recognize
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:21.520]  hong kong independence and hong kong autonomy i've been to hong kong several times and the
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:26.640]  locals in hong kong do not consider themselves part of the mainland chinese culture or government
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:31.200]  they consider themselves independent and yet right now they're being beaten up in the streets
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:36.480]  one of the things that info wars talked about before almost anyone else that's now been confirmed
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:40.720]  is that in fact they were infiltrating the protest they were chinese police officers
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:44.480]  going undercover trying to infiltrate the protest trying to direct the protest
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:49.520]  who were exposed by the hong kong protesters themselves so in fact that that's now public
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:55.120]  news but info wars is one of the first places to print and produce that and it's it goes against
[1:50:55.120 --> 1:51:01.760]  what google's goal is google's goal is an authoritarian system an authoritarian system that is uh
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:07.440]  that puts google in control over what information you see what news you have ideally what views you
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:14.720]  choose to employ by by shaping what information you see so for example professor robert epstein
[1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:19.760]  who's on the left lefty professor has come out repeatedly and he's been following the
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:25.280]  antitrust investigation in particular because he believes it has major consequential capability
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:30.320]  to reshape the big tech industry the president trump's actions against big tech in the google
[1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:36.640]  space in particular presenting unique opportunity to finally bring big tech to heal to finally tame
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:41.200]  big tech because big tech has bought off a lot of even so-called conservative think tanks and
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:46.560]  foundations has spent lots of money on even conservative politicians so they've been able to
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:52.560]  to muck up the works and gum up the works when it comes to legislative reform so that's or state
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:56.960]  level executive reform but even there they're starting to see action and movement as attorney
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:02.480]  general bar met with a bunch of state attorney generals and who said they're going to take action
[1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:08.640]  so you see that what robert epstein is talking about is that in 2016 president trump won the
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:13.440]  popular vote legitimately the only reason he didn't it didn't show up in the vote tallies
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:19.440]  was because of google's meddling in the elections according to professor epstein who was a hillary
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.240]  clinton supporter he said he had no doubts whatsoever that there had been at least five
[1:52:24.240 --> 1:52:30.480]  million or so votes uh orbit dot more uh done done taken from donald trump to hillary clinton
[1:52:30.480 --> 1:52:35.040]  solely by the manipulation of google's algorithms in the political space and that's a small scale
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.840]  version of what google can do google can do far more yeah i completely believe it so let me ask
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:47.760]  you this if president trump doesn't get the whole socialist communist tech uh giants under the you
[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:54.000]  know to do the right thing here does he does he stand a chance to lose in 2020 because a lot of
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:58.240]  people saying a lot of people i've had people send me messages and say you know what it doesn't
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:02.880]  matter what google does it doesn't matter what facebook does or twitter and the rest of them it
[1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:08.720]  doesn't matter because we're still gonna vote for him if president trump does not get this under
[1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:14.800]  control and he and personally i think he needs to get under control immediately it's already gone too
[1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:21.360]  far but on you but based on your opinion do you think if he doesn't get under control is he going
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:29.520]  to win or lose come 2020 in my view his only risk is big tech manipulation of the election so if you
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:33.520]  look at the uh betting odds and the political odds markets uh president trump is currently
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:39.120]  considered a 50 chance of winning reelection i would say that's much higher under normal circumstances
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:46.960]  when the party in power is united the party in power incumbent wins every single time no incumbent
[1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:52.320]  has ever lost when he wasn't meaningfully contested within his own party because of party division
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:59.040]  so by that standard trump should be a 95 favorite or or better but instead the betting market to
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:04.240]  treating him as a 50 favorite in part because they're undervaluing under pricing trump but also
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:09.120]  because they see and recognize the threat that big tech presents professor epstein has gone to
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:15.920]  detail with a study after study after study that shows google by itself can can move up to 20 million
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:22.000]  voters in the us election process and trump won the electoral college by about 100 000 aggregate
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:28.240]  votes across three states so all they need to do is target it and it appears they did do so in 2017
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:34.240]  explain some of the anomalies in the 2017 alabama senate election it appears they did so again in
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:39.280]  2018 because it explains anomalies in the house it's not true the democrats would have won the
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:43.840]  house without big tech favoring them and manipulating and meddling in the elections in a wide range of
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:48.240]  ways and so they can do things like they send certain people a message to go out and vote but
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:52.880]  not other people they tell you they show certain stories but not other stories they let something
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:59.760]  like trump body count trend which is a tagline that makes no sense but clinton body count disappear
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:05.600]  and vanish so the so that's the the power that they have to manipulate the mind and so just more
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:11.440]  and more so just just let me jump in so just to make clear because a lot of people so what happens
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:18.800]  is that google and these socialist tech companies will allow anti-trump rhetoric to come to the surface
[1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:25.120]  is to give the impression that the entire country doesn't want president trump and
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:32.640]  because they they're influencing people's thoughts so when they go to vote that's when that's what
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:39.040]  they remember in a subconscious mind they'll remember oh yeah trump is a white supremacist
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:45.120]  trump hates colored people trump doesn't want people to come here to the country he hates
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:51.440]  immigrants when none of that is true so they allow all of that anti-american anti-trump
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.240]  rhetoric to come to the surface and that's how they influence a lot of people don't understand
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:02.000]  that and you know and just to go to it I remember when I was younger and I would go watch a kung fu
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:07.520]  movie and after the kung fu movie I would come outside and I thought I'm like doing kung fu
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:12.160]  because as a kid as sublimity I thought you know it's like yeah I can do that you know I just saw
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:18.720]  the action hero fighting boom boom boom it still goes on as adults just because we're not going
[1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:24.480]  out acting like kung fu masters or anything but in our back of our mind people that are easily
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:30.080]  manipulated they take that information to the poll and they know that and that's how they're
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:34.480]  manipulating people on the mass scale would you agree or disagree that's exactly what it is they
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:39.520]  shape conversation they shape thoughts they shape ideas they shape where you focus your attention
[1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:45.520]  so for example uh it's not a coincidence that info wars has been the primary target of big tech
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.720]  censorship because info wars is able to break through that thought control process that big
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:56.640]  tech engages in so for example uh Alex Jones at info wars was the first to broadcast that Joe
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:02.880]  biden had clearly serious cognition and health related issues showed signs of having a stroke
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:07.840]  problems uh all of his s's now are always slurred or have some sort of problem with him yeah absolutely
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:10.800]  let me let me start let me break in because we're getting ready to come to a hard break
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:15.200]  can you stay on longer with me because i'm oh yeah i love your insight so i'm gonna get
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:20.320]  get more of that on it after this break so we have a i think this is a short break and we'll come

[1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:56.000]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.800]  close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:07.040]  communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:12.720]  polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:19.360]  farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:23.840]  walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back

[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:41.760]  white supremacist and he's supporting all this white supremacy which is a total lie everyone
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:46.560]  knows that president trump is not racist but for some reason they take this information in
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:50.800]  and they tell the lie over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:56.400]  until people start believing it and then they're like yes yes yes you even have people going out

[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:31.360]  of a white man we're proposing that we could change them to be more representative of an
[2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:37.280]  inclusive environment that's so cute oh my god yeah three that's awesome is this something you
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:42.960]  thought about before no like i never thought about it like i can see like i guess like by some students
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:48.720]  have a problem with it okay yeah that's cool that's what we sign up we propose like these other things
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.120]  so it could be more yeah we just didn't want to offend anyone you know yeah no that's cool so is
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:58.640]  this something you guys can get on board with absolutely yeah you guys sign up i assume it's
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:04.000]  like one of many one of many ways in which the default is imagined to be a white man
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:09.840]  man see this just goes to show how easily people to manipulate it to believe a certain narrative
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:15.760]  to believe that white supremacists is on the rise and they got to change everything in our culture
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.400]  they have to change everything that we see and believe continue i totally get that
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:26.560]  we're trying to be you know yeah trying to be pioneers that's a good idea thank you so much
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:30.720]  i haven't really thought of it as a white guy i haven't just thought of it as the lightest
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:34.880]  white i mean now that i've thought about it i haven't ever thought about it but it's just one of
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:39.360]  those things that it's definitely a lack of representation yeah for sure is this something
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:45.600]  you've thought about before uh yeah i think it's a good idea the only problem is if you're doing
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:49.440]  such a variety there might be just a lot of money involved how do you think like students who
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:55.600]  like are offended by this would feel probably more validated yeah like of course i'll stop and this
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:03.920]  is kind of simple you know just the guy walking across the street but if it can help other people
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:11.920]  out then why not you know look at this so i think there's gonna put a picture up here where they're
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:19.680]  gonna show the different ones um can we get to a picture so basically the gist of this is to get
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:26.320]  people to sign this petition to say that we need to change the street sign to all these different
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:31.680]  colors and different characters so now if you're looking on the screen you have one here i guess
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:40.400]  this is a pregnant man for crossing and then you have what is this uh trans maybe um or just and then
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:48.080]  the lgbtqp and i guess this is i guess maybe this is the only one they consider to be uh white
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:53.360]  supremacists because it's just a white lady i guess i'm assuming and uh don't forget we have a brown
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:04:02.000]  people and then of course you know disabled people so they're going to change all of this to to just
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:08.480]  because of someone's feelings and because they make up one every single day they make up a new
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:10.800]  gender every single day
[2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:21.120]  they probably need to put 20 or what is it 78 78 of these signs in one location and people are gonna
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:26.960]  look okay is mine listed up there do i get to go across the street now this is what we're coming
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:31.120]  to this is a society that we're coming to and it was really crazy that you have people that's
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:37.520]  actually signing this petition they're believing that they have to do this to get people to understand
[2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:42.480]  this and they're doing it they're being very successful with it all right my name is will

[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:34.960]  i love the tunes and grand they're so awesome i mean how does how does it function without them
[2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:41.440]  it doesn't all right we're back and we have mr barnes with us still a great honor and pleasure
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:48.000]  um mr barnes let me ask you this you know do you think google
[2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:58.640]  will say enough is enough and you know kind of maybe loosen up a little bit and before we went
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:07.600]  to the break i was asking you about conservatives versus liberals which one you know our liberals
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:12.480]  happy which ones attack more because there's some liberals that say that you know google has censored
[2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:18.800]  them and only time i've ever seen that is when they said that they started you know okay well i
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:23.760]  agree with president trump here i agree with him there and then all of a sudden they start getting
[2:07:23.760 --> 2:07:30.320]  this censorship i think was is it tim timpool is that his name tim pool he you know because he says
[2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:35.680]  he was a liberal all right i think he still claims that he's a liberal but he came out and he said you
[2:07:35.680 --> 2:07:39.280]  know i was watching him on joe rogan and he said i'm a liberal and i'm like what but i love everything
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:44.720]  he was saying and he said i'm he said but what google is doing what twitter is doing he said i'm
[2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:51.200]  terrified there's someone right there that is absolutely thinking for himself and then i think
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:55.920]  he started experiencing the censorship as well because i've seen some of his youtube videos
[2:07:55.920 --> 2:08:00.400]  and i actually come to think about it he used to show up on my feed all the time but now he
[2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:06.240]  doesn't even show up any longer i you know i have to go look for him it's just it's really crazy
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:12.160]  i mean it's extraordinary so it has happened to people on the left particularly people on the
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:17.920]  anti-war left on the anti-establishment left and the anti-big tech left so one of the things that's
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:23.200]  happening for which alex jones is always the best template so that when you do the comparison between
[2:08:23.200 --> 2:08:28.240]  the google search and the being or duck duck go search for alex jones you get multiple levels
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:33.040]  of information the first level of information is that clearly google is manipulating its algorithm
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:38.000]  to create a false result because most people when they search google they think they're getting what
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:42.400]  other people have searched for that's what they that's their trust and confidence in the google
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:48.080]  algorithm is that it will honestly and accurately reflect broader public interest and opinion
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:52.160]  not that it's being manipulated or metal google doesn't put on the front page by the way the
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:56.800]  search results will be based on what google thinks you should see not based on what the world actually
[2:08:56.800 --> 2:09:02.880]  is interested in seeing so the but you go further and deeper into it and you'll see exactly how they're
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:07.120]  doing the manipulation and what they're doing in the manipulation so for example clearly they're
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:12.160]  discriminating and have changed the manipulation so that alex jones only triggers certain kind of
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:17.840]  information and they filter out any positive information and filter in any negative information
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:22.240]  but part of the way they're doing that is by elevating certain publications as gatekeepers
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:27.600]  over others this is facebook is doing this big time and so what happens is anybody who's sort of
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:33.920]  under the anti-establishment press anti-war press things of that nature they're also getting screened
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:41.200]  out of the gatekeeper role so like mitt press katlyn johnstone uh uh the certain uh a certain
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:46.480]  anti-war publications counter punch these are publications that may be culturally to the left
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:51.760]  but on certain issues of war and establishment and elite power are actually more on the trump
[2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:58.080]  side of the equation the alex jones side of the equation so for example uh in certain context when
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:03.200]  you do certain searches you won't find certain left leaning sources the best example of this most
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:08.800]  recently was there open and overt discrimination against tulsi gather so tulsi gather has a lot
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:15.200]  of left wing views on a wide range of issues but not on war and not on certain establishment politics
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:20.080]  involving the deep state and so what happened is the first debate people are like wow this is a
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:25.520]  totally interesting uh unique person and so she was trying to appeal to the anti-war part of the
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:29.680]  democratic base which used to be much bigger but the political establishment within the democratic
[2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:35.600]  party is now very pro war pro deep state and so uh google what they did is they right away
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:41.760]  turned off the spigot so that like her advertising was driven based on if there was suddenly a big
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:47.920]  surge in popular support she would be able to tap into that for donations tap into that for support
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:53.520]  by having her campaign ads run at the top when you look but what happened is google turned it off at
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:58.640]  exactly the moment there was a sudden surge of interest in her during the debate that's why
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:04.800]  they that's why she sued them for $50 million because that's how much they cost her uh they
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:09.520]  they might have done fatal damage but for the fact that she was able to replicate her performance
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:14.800]  in the second debate and most importantly she brought suit before that second debate so all
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:18.400]  of a sudden google realized they were being exposed and they're like well we don't want to
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:23.360]  you know be obvious what we're doing so after the second debate when she surged again uh in
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:27.840]  fact Owen and I the we're doing the pre-debate activities and we were predicting certain things
[2:11:27.840 --> 2:11:31.440]  that almost every prediction came true who was going to win the drugs poll who was going to win
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:34.960]  the google search who was going to go up in the political betting markets who was going to go
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:38.720]  up in the democratic political opinion polls all of it and one of the big ones was that Tulsi
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:44.000]  Gabbard would do well on all four uh fronts and she in fact did so the uh in fact the people who
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:48.960]  were watching info wars and had a little bet uh there's the uk fans and other fans or there's
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:54.720]  online various methods uh had any sort of bet on the uh predicted and the rest had bets on uh
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:59.520]  following what we were recommending and advising they made between a 35 and 50 profit overnight
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:04.080]  so the you don't you don't just have to go to the info wars store dot com in order to get great
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:09.200]  deals and those info wars not only are you supporting the freedom and supporting the revolution
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:12.800]  and you're supporting the revolution of information and you're supporting the democratization of the
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:18.240]  press you're reinstating the original organic principles and purposes to the spirit press
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:24.880]  yes free speech support free elections support free religion uh but at the same time you're
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:29.200]  getting above average products at below average prices i mean you're you're not you're not giving
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:33.040]  putting more money in info wars pocket you're putting more money into your own pocket and what
[2:12:33.040 --> 2:12:38.240]  you do so by getting products you need by bidding products you like by getting products you want
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:44.240]  but at cheaper prices and better value than the competition because of the way uh info wars
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:50.800]  is structured and being a direct merchandiser so the uh so the so there's multiple ways to to uh
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:55.040]  to make you the info wars experience more than just a learning experience but make it a
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:13:00.240]  self-profiting experience yeah exactly let me ask you this let me ask you this who do you think
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:05.280]  who do you think google is rooting for because for them to to do taff the gibbet that way
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:10.080]  because she was trending on twitter she was trending everywhere and that would have been
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:14.960]  a prime time for her to run ads to run advertisement you know getting donations like you said
[2:13:15.840 --> 2:13:21.040]  because they did that to her and she's running on the democrat ticket who do you think that they
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:26.080]  want to be on the top of the ticket i don't imagine that it's uh joe biden because he's
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:31.920]  an old white man they don't want white people they hate white people let them tell it so who
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:37.840]  is it do you think that they want uh they are satisfied with any of the democratic nominees
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:44.160]  except tulsi gathered so the uh all the others are just fine all the others serve and suit their
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:50.400]  purposes across the board um in terms of in their perception having a chance to beat donald trump
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:55.360]  also and even though people like elizabeth warren is talking about breaking up big tech
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:59.520]  they really don't take her seriously in that capacity warren is someone who talks a lot
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:06.000]  does little um and so the so gabber's doing one that really scares them because she raises issues
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.320]  and topics that challenge the deep state's establishment power related to the military
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:16.080]  industrial complex and permanent war uh and in fact buttresses trump it's not a coincidence
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:20.080]  like the deep state in particular and that's the important thing about google google's in bed
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:25.280]  with china and deep state operators so it's not so much that they're partisan it's that they see
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:30.000]  particular threats to deep state right now from the right from the independent right
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:33.760]  from the alex jones part of the right and from the tulsi gathered part of the left
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:37.200]  so that's who they're going to suppress and censor so it has a partisan
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:41.920]  coloration currently but not necessarily because it's about whatever advances
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:48.400]  deep state politics deep state policies uh and the rising power of china who google has
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:52.720]  gotten to bed with so that's sort of their overarching theme and that's where you can see
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:57.920]  tim tim pool uh i think uh it has a big youtube network they're trying to suppress and censor
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:03.360]  him as much as steven crowded and it's because both of them have anti-establishment populist
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:07.760]  politics and policies on a wide range of topics even though they are on different sides of the
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:12.160]  ideological spectrum in general and different sides of the partisan spectrum in general yeah
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:16.800]  exactly exactly yeah so we're giving it to a hard break but yeah you're absolutely right
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:23.680]  you know um the reason why i stopped getting tim pools uh feed or his videos popping up
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:29.840]  on my youtube channel i just went looked at it they unsubscribe me they don't subscribe me from
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:35.280]  tim pool i mean i just literally look at it they unsubscribe me from tim pool so how many other
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:40.560]  people and they've done me that way with mark dice i had to go back in and subscribe to mark dice
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.320]  they constantly do it because they don't want us seeing it now i'm getting all this stuff from

[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:37.200]  course last show we're talking with mr barnes beautiful awesome information
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:42.240]  like i said when the beginning it's amazing that someone's walking around with so much
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:48.320]  knowledge and so much information um and this on point about everything has been talking about
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:54.800]  about um i guess one thing i would like to know is what do the american people do what can we do i
[2:20:54.800 --> 2:20:59.200]  mean because so so think about it us as the american citizens we're the ones that's being
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:06.400]  affected by the tech companies and a lot of us we depend on president trump to fix it and i've had
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:10.160]  i've had conversation with people in the past and they said well you know president trump
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:17.120]  he hasn't done anything and on the surface on just just looking at it it doesn't look like he's done
[2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:23.440]  anything to stop these tech companies these socialist tech companies from censoring conservatives
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:29.040]  because i can put a video on youtube right now and they will suppress it they demonetize it
[2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:37.200]  if i timed it the i timed it like a week ago i put a video on youtube and about 14 minutes later
[2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:42.560]  it was already demonetized didn't even say it didn't have anything no violence in it no nudity no
[2:21:42.560 --> 2:21:53.040]  cursing no no no bullying nothing zero went against their community standards except for the community
[2:21:53.040 --> 2:21:57.760]  standards is hitting to the rest of us which is if you're pro americans you're pro trump
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:04.720]  then that goes against their community standards so mr mr barn so what can we do i mean because
[2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:10.000]  all of us have the funding none of us can you know just say you know what let's go sue google
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:15.600]  everyone's saying we should sue them sue them i mean you can't do that when you're not billionaires
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:19.680]  or you don't have the money or you don't have the pool like tassie gibbon in this case you
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:26.640]  you we don't we can't do it is it possible to get like conservative lawyers throughout the country
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:33.040]  to possibly come together and do something because every time president trump does something to
[2:22:33.040 --> 2:22:37.920]  protect american people they find a liberal leftist lawyer to stop the president so how can we
[2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:44.480]  can't get a group of team of conservative lawyers and not charge everyone out the leg while zoom
[2:22:45.200 --> 2:22:49.600]  to help us keep our freedoms is that even possible or has that even been brought up
[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:56.480]  oh actually uh that you mentioned we've created an organization called the free america law center
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:02.240]  which people can find at free america law center dot com which is basically a membership driven
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:08.560]  uh mass support driven organization to achieve exactly what you're talking about i brought
[2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:14.800]  together a range of conservative lawyers and legal law firms that uh legal support organizations
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:19.760]  that are willing to uh work at a discount rate willing to work in some cases at a free rate
[2:23:20.400 --> 2:23:25.120]  in in terms of their own legal time willing to advance costs in certain kind of certain
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:30.080]  consequences certain circumstances and the net effect of all of that is a free america law center
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:36.800]  that can help equalize access to the law by democratizing our legal system by having mass
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.760]  support of an organization so basically the way it's supported is people are monthly members
[2:23:42.400 --> 2:23:47.680]  and they it's the monthly membership amounted 17 dollars and 76 cents a month and it's set at a
[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:53.280]  low rate so that it's affordable and accessible for the masses a biggest group of people to support
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:59.200]  it because that will make it self-supporting and self-sustaining in the same way that info wars is
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:04.400]  and so the in addition anybody who's a member gets additional benefits they get exclusive q and a
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:09.760]  podcast uh with the legal experts and lawyers across the country i've donated a lot of my time
[2:24:09.760 --> 2:24:14.640]  to the organization i've donated a lot of my capital to the organization to help it take off
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:18.640]  will be one of the lead counsel for the organization for the cases we're going to bring against big
[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:24.240]  tag uh on top of that people get free digital books on their bill of rights so that they have a
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:27.920]  it's a digital bill of rights book series so that people are self-educated so that they're
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:32.880]  self armored because the best mechanism of uh using your legal remedies is to know your legal
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:37.360]  remedies and so we've created that to have an additional benefit so simply for the cost of a
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:42.800]  book they get a monthly a book that they're getting each month is the uh the sole the whole cost of
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:46.720]  the subscription but it goes beyond that so there's going to be videos there's going to be exclusive
[2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:50.800]  events there's going to be uh newsletters that are exclusive to them there's going to be daily
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:55.520]  information podcasts exclusive to them so the goal is to let's create an organization that provides
[2:24:55.520 --> 2:25:00.800]  real value to people well at the same time providing necessary bridge to the legal remedies that
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:05.120]  exist in the system but that are currently inaccessible or unaffordable to the mass of the
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:10.240]  population so the goal will be to use free american law center to bring class action suits against
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:15.520]  google class action suits against youtube class action suits against twitter class action suits
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:21.360]  against facebook and using every novel creative legal theory that's out there to basically to the
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:26.560]  traditionally the left has been the only one to weaponize the law and have legal remedy it's time
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:31.920]  that there be legal remedy for everybody not limited by party not limited by ideology and to
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:36.800]  protect people that are ordinary economic means and to protect people on the independent political
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:42.240]  right and middle uh against the just the left that has monopolized it to sort of be the counterpart
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:47.040]  to the southern poverty law center yeah i'm glad you brought them up because i was getting ready
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:52.800]  to talk about them i know the southern poverty law center right now has a lawsuit against a group
[2:25:52.800 --> 2:26:01.520]  of people out of arizona and they call themselves the patriot arizona patriots and az and what it is
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:08.960]  they were growing out just doing you know journalism freelancing reporting on what's
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:15.040]  taking place they actually recorded some illegals getting off the bus and going into a church
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:19.680]  and they were recording them they had to they had the permission to to you know to record them
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:26.400]  they didn't not you know they it was on a public area but now the the southern poverty law center
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:33.600]  is going after them because they reported the truth so and that's and that's fearful to a lot of
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:40.560]  people because anyone who has a mobile device a phone you are a reporter you are a freelance
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.440]  reporter you go out there and you see something take place everyone's doing it now first thing
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:51.280]  they do is they turn on their camera record it we just had an episode in uh what was it uh disney
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:56.160]  what was it disney world or disney land one of them where a group of people and they happen to be
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:01.520]  black they all acting completely stupid but what did everybody do that was there they pulled out
[2:27:01.520 --> 2:27:07.200]  their phone camera they started recording it everyone is a reporter a freelance reporter if
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:13.840]  you have a phone right now but how so how was it that they can be sued or try to be sued because
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:21.120]  they're reporting on the truth i mean what kind of society are we living in it's very much selective
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:26.800]  weaponized lawfare and so for example those areas on a patriots may become a clients of
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:30.800]  the free america law center it's one of the clients that they're looking at taking uh
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:35.280]  and i'm part of the organization that's looking at uh basically it'll depend on public support
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:40.240]  the more public support that exists the more cases that can take on uh the it's all dependent in the
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:44.160]  public basically gets to choose in fact anybody who's a member of free america law center gets to
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:48.800]  vote on which cases and what category of cases get taken but what you're describing is sort of what
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:54.240]  the three d's that the free america law center addresses which is deplatforming defamation and
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:58.240]  deep state whistleblowing which would include google whistleblowing and what it is is people
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:02.720]  they're using the legal system not only to interfere with it and pair our elected processes
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:07.440]  by undermining the president with leftist judges but they're also doing it in the same way by using
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:11.680]  the legal system and the threat of the legal system to intimidate and terrorize their political
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:15.920]  and ideological adversaries so they can just bankrupt them just by suing them now of course
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:21.040]  as always the template the tip of the spear for all of this is alex jones that's why alex he's being
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.240]  targeted across the board in the widest range of lawfare in the history of the independent press
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:30.960]  in this country and that's why it's critical and essential that he prevailed in the courts of law
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.520]  yeah you're absolutely right and it's critical and it's crucial that everyone the american people

[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:28.560]  temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system

[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:08.640]  close to the ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the
[2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:14.800]  nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen

[2:33:52.960 --> 2:34:01.360]  because through my entire working career i've had many white people help me and they didn't
[2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:05.760]  help and i know for a fact they didn't help me because i'm black they have nothing to do with it
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:11.200]  can you do the job or can you not do the job do you want to do the job because i've no you know
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:15.520]  i've known black people they say i want to do the job but then they don't want to do the job so
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:22.880]  let's go to this clip this clip is with msnbc msnb crazy c in my opinion and with
[2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:27.120]  taut i'll get your opinion on it when we come back we have to be able to call out the lies
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:31.920]  that he's saying and also the destructive policies that he's putting out today he told 13 lies he's
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:37.760]  also like you said he's dismantling the protection for endangered species he's not a partisan matter
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:43.280]  by the way it never has been a partisan no republicans and democrats both agreed and republican
[2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:47.440]  and conservatives and liberals the world over agree to protect endangered species right but he
[2:34:47.440 --> 2:34:52.720]  but this administration doesn't want to protect anything or anyone other than white supremacy
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:57.520]  so that's just the fact but we have to do the work and that's the thing is that all of this
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:02.240]  gaslighting all of the lies it keeps us spinning so that we can't pay attention to everything but
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:07.760]  that's the work that donald trump has put on our plates we have to tell the we have to tell the
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:13.120]  truth about who he is what he's doing how he's manipulating the public and also tell the truth
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:18.960]  about the policies and who he's hurting and why he's hurting them rick wilson uh 15 seconds to you
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:24.560]  on are there enough republicans to do something about this absolutely not there there are no
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:28.800]  republicans who will stand up and be brave and tell the president he's a lying liar all right be
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:36.800]  rolling all right so this is this is exactly what i've been talking about this is the craziness of
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:40.720]  the left they're trying to say that president trump is the one that's creating all of this racial
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:46.640]  division trying to get all of us fighting each other and it's none of us true none of this is
[2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:51.040]  true everything that they would they sit there and blame president trump for doing they're the
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:57.280]  ones that's doing that we see it constantly and they they have nothing they can't get president
[2:35:57.280 --> 2:36:01.840]  trump on any policies that he's done wrong they can't get president trump for saying stuff you
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:06.960]  know there's blatantly that is racist because he hasn't said it and they can't get him on anything
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:13.840]  that he's doing bad for the economy i've been to the white house twice invitation from president
[2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:20.080]  trump twice to the right to the white house why would he invite someone like me and other black
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:25.280]  people to the white house if he's a white supremacist and on top of that he did not go out himself and
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:32.800]  say look everybody i have black people coming to the white house he didn't do that his main thing
[2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:37.360]  was is look i'm the president of the united states i'm the president of all people and that's what
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:44.640]  i'm here for so robert burns let me ask you do you think that they're doing this because they
[2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:50.160]  have nothing else i mean they have nothing else to lead on because everything that he's been
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.960]  doing for the american people has been a hundred percent positive and black people are benefiting
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:00.000]  and because of that it's 36 percent i believe that it's more support from the black community
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:04.800]  but they don't want people to recognize it so they have to demonize them to make it look
[2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:11.840]  like that he is bad i mean there's no doubt about it i mean really this started around 2014
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:18.400]  in obama's second term when obama failed to deliver the benefits that he promised particularly
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:23.200]  african-american voters in the united states so really if you go back this goes back to a
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:29.600]  political trend in the united states after the end of after the civil war african-american voters
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.320]  became deeply loyal to the republican party understandably because they were perceived
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:39.840]  as the uh as the party that freed the slaves uh but the problem was the republican party failed
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:45.680]  to deliver any tangible benefits after that to african-american voters going on consecutively
[2:37:45.680 --> 2:37:51.440]  for 60 plus years and that's why i always to say about them the nature of racial politics
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:37:55.520]  is that the republican party continued to sort of wave the bloody shirt they called it
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:01.600]  oh hey well we did something great 50 60 70 years ago so keep voting for us for that reason
[2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:07.040]  and it was successful enough that most african-american voters even in the depression in 1932
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:13.040]  stayed republican but by 1936 1940 they started realizing why are we voting for a party that
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:16.960]  is delivering us nothing but rhetoric that is delivering nothing but empty symbolism
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:21.520]  that is delivering nothing but language that's not giving us real policies real benefits for
[2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:27.200]  real lives in a material and more away and the african-american voter poses that challenge
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:32.640]  down to the democratic party because the democratic party was was mostly actually on the segregation
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:39.360]  side but was associated because of lyndon baines johnson with civil rights in the mid 1960s uh the
[2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:43.120]  democratic party's been living off of something they did 60 years ago and they really haven't
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:49.120]  done anything meaningful to uh to benefit african-americans in this country it failed bill clinton who
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:54.560]  did the mass incarceration plan of which joe biden was integral and part of uh it was during
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:58.880]  democratic administrations that african-american employment unemployment went up particularly
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:03.840]  amongst working class men uh it was uh it was under democratic administrations particularly
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:09.840]  obama's latest administration where the threat of illegal immigration kept replacing african-americans
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:14.240]  in the employment market it's not a coincidence that after these recent ice raids the number
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:19.920]  one beneficiary of the people applying for those jobs in poultry plants in mississippi and elsewhere
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:25.520]  were disproportionately african-american men so the uh in fact it's not a coincidence
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:30.400]  that the aggregate set of policies the president has put into place in terms of changing trade
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:36.320]  policy vis-a-vis china which had a deeply destabilizing effect on the working class communities in
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:40.560]  this country but particularly african-american community and african-american men in it especially
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:44.720]  the same is true of illegal immigration disproportionately displaced african-american
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:49.280]  men from the labor force it's not a coincidence of the aggregate effect of president trump's
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:54.960]  policies is the lowest unemployment rate amongst african-american men in the history of that
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:40:00.640]  statistic even being recorded and that's why the democratic party is panicking because they know
[2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:05.760]  logically the key this is one of the key factors when when van jones was going on his uh uh white
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:10.720]  lash and all that stuff during the elect on election night i was telling people in london
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:15.440]  well i had a nice big bet on uh president trump the uh what i said really said just the opposite
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:20.320]  the key to the president winning michigan was that african-american men double digit and by
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:25.200]  double digit percentage numbers shifted from obama to trump the same phenomenon same thing
[2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:29.520]  happened in pittsburgh and philadelphia and pennsylvania same thing happened in milwaukee
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:34.960]  and wisconsin if it wasn't for african-american men voting for trump by double digit margin
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:41.520]  improvement over what they voted in in 2012 trump is not elected the president of the united states
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:46.640]  so trump knows this the people who oppose trump know this so their problem is trump keeps delivering
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:52.000]  in massive amounts for african-american men in particular but for voters across the board working
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:56.640]  class voters across the board but african-american men have probably benefited as much as any
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:41:01.360]  demographic group in the country from the president's set of policies that's anybody
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:07.520]  and the democrats know that so how do they get them to stay on the democrat plantation stay within
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:15.120]  the democrat fold car racism exactly car racing yeah make make make trump look like he's boss
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:20.240]  are make trump look like that scary yes yeah make trump make that that racist boss that harassed
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:24.960]  you the racist kapu harassed you they got to associate him with that and the problem is
[2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:31.440]  trump has been popular with an african-american male culture particularly uh for a long time
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:36.160]  that's why she treated rap songs my old client was the snipes used to reference him yeah every
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:41.040]  reference to films they did in the hip hop music they reference them i want to be like trump i mean
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:46.800]  they they say i want to be like trump these are black people saying it and you know it's it's amazing
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:52.400]  to me that you have and maybe you've seen this in history where a white person is sorry help doing
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:57.360]  something not specifically just directly helping black people but black people benefit like never
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:04.400]  before then they played a race card oh we've got to stop this train where it where it's going because
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:09.840]  if we don't we're going to lose them off this plantation i've had conversations with black people
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:13.840]  and a lot of times they show up to these different events and they have all these plastic chains on
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:18.240]  their hands and their feet and i say you know those shackles that you have on your hands and feet and
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:22.720]  some of them are virtual i said those shackles that you have on your hands and feet they don't have
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:27.600]  any locks and i said you can't take them off then they get them didn't get upset with me what do
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:32.720]  you mean i could take them off how dare you tell me i can take these shackles off my hands and feet
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:39.280]  i want to be a slave i like this democrat plantation because they keep me they what what is it daddy

[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:05.360]  that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:09.760]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:13.760]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:19.520]  old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:23.440]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:27.840]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:31.760]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:36.640]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:41.840]  what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:47.120]  broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:51.600]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[2:44:51.600 --> 2:45:00.080]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting you without your support we won't be here and i couldn't
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:04.080]  thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game i mean i want to stay in this game
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:08.880]  i want to take the globalist on total transparencies our whole operation if i bring in 35 million
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:12.880]  dollars half of that's the cost of the products because we don't mark stuff up that much i don't
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:17.520]  care if i'm not making money but you need to buy the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:22.400]  turmeric we got great toothpaste we've got great things like dna force plus but ultimate krill oil
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:26.800]  has been sold out for four months for whatever reason this became the most popular fish oil it's
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:32.560]  totally full the bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil and it cost us three times more
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:37.600]  because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any kind
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:41.760]  of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps which i don't like but gives you all the
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:46.240]  great benefits isn't real it's been boiled it's been real and it's been homogenized this is not
[2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:51.440]  this ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere real krill
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:55.680]  oil folks is red it's not yellow it's not milky this is nothing but krill oil
[2:45:56.720 --> 2:46:01.920]  talik yes i got a plug for the patriot point second oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this year
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:06.000]  and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:09.040]  get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:12.960]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products the
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:17.760]  products that i do for steve have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:22.480]  lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:26.720]  to get these little uh sore throat so he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his
[2:46:26.720 --> 2:46:31.040]  sore throat uh well sir let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:36.320]  a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:40.880]  two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:45.600]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot point a lot
[2:46:45.600 --> 2:46:49.600]  of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:53.840]  autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh where you have patriot
[2:46:53.840 --> 2:47:09.760]  points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:27.440]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show with will

[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:41.280]  i've been having great conversation i love this conversation that we're having and this wealth
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:52.400]  of information you know the love have controlled black people and uh brown people for the longest
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:58.960]  and they demonized back into where i guess like the 50s and the 60s they demonized black people
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:03.600]  and i'm talking about the love they demonized black people and they they they didn't want
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:07.680]  black people to be successful in the country they didn't even want black people to be able to read
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:13.520]  they didn't want black people to you know to to to drive to have their own businesses to
[2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:17.120]  to have bank accounts they didn't want black people to have any of that they want to black
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:22.320]  people to stay and remain on the plantation and they attack black people they hung black people
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:27.360]  they did horrible things to black people they said black people were attacking all white women
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:37.360]  women now fast forward to 2019 the attack the same group the same entity the left the democrats
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:44.480]  the entire left now they're attacking white people and it's it is unbelievable that it's
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:49.840]  absolutely happening like this is it for some reason people still don't recognize what is
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:54.800]  absolutely happening here do have you noticed that or is it just something that i'm seeing
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:49:00.400]  well i think what it's part of a broader reflection it's a different form of contempt
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:05.680]  so the in the same way when they do studies and they show white liberals talk down to african
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:11.280]  americans uh when they interact with them in any sort of context or space uh that disproportionately
[2:49:11.280 --> 2:49:16.160]  in sort of white lester upscale white liberal communities they try to exclude african americans
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:20.160]  from those communities disproportionately in terms of public housing and other projects
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:25.120]  but you also see it's sort of a broader psychological reflection that professor christopher last
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:29.440]  university broadchester documented a couple of decades ago when he was talking about the
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:34.080]  rise of elitism in general and what he pointed out is that when you treat someone like a victim
[2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:40.160]  it's a form of contempt pity is almost always a form of contempt it's not a form of respect
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:46.160]  when you respect someone you see them as an equal you see them as equally capable equally talented
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:52.640]  and equally in every respect but when you see them as something less than you uh than the way in
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:58.480]  which you can pretend to be racially progressive while in fact being racially oppressive is to
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:03.520]  treat them as a victim say you know you're weak you're not capable exactly you know they even
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:09.120]  tell black people that you know what you can't i mean they go against voter id because black
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:15.280]  people can't even find the dmv according to the left i mean oh yeah black people are you know
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:22.080]  they need our help because they're victims you can't find the dmv you know you don't know who to vote
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:26.800]  for so we're gonna help you let me change the subject here so they just brought this to me it
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:33.360]  says universal movies portray six graders playing with sex toys so now they just had a movie where
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:39.360]  they want to attack deplorables and now they have a movie coming out with six graders playing with
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:46.080]  sex toys when does it end when does it end with the sanity and you know talking about children
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:52.400]  these these people are monsters you have epstein he what he supposedly killed himself but
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:58.640]  you know you have the entire left they attack people anybody who goes against pedophilia you
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:03.360]  have them all going on and we're supposed to just sit back and be like oh this is the norm
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:08.640]  this is okay and then on top of that you have tucker carlson he you know he's on vacation but
[2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:13.680]  you know rumor has it that he might be suspended because he spoke out i've watched tucker carlson
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:17.280]  enough to know that he will speak out for saying why are they doing this to alex jones
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:23.200]  why are they doing this you know as freedom of speech gone he'll talk about the the socialist
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:28.400]  companies and how they're attacking uh the conservatives what are your views on that
[2:51:29.280 --> 2:51:33.680]  so i think of the couple of things one it sort of relates to our topic about the way in which the
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:39.760]  democrats are by necessity trying to re-racialize and polarize the politics most african-american
[2:51:39.760 --> 2:51:45.920]  voters are culturally conservative most of their their generally pro-life uh they're generally they
[2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:50.640]  do not like the attempts to sexualize children they do not they they don't want to have anything to
[2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:57.520]  do with the epsteins of the world um as the uh so it's so it's part of why they have to continually
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:03.200]  elevate racial identity politics above everything else is because it's the only area where they can
[2:52:03.200 --> 2:52:07.680]  try to keep african-american voters in their corner because on almost every other issue
[2:52:07.680 --> 2:52:12.320]  of money or morals the democratic party has abandoned the african-american community and
[2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:17.600]  is contrary to the broad cultural traditions of the african-american community but also it just
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:25.040]  reflects what the people of the epstein experience reflects not only how the alex jones frame of the
[2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:30.400]  world that worldview better informs you and prepares you for the epstein story that anyone
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:36.640]  else's but it also reflects the broader left cultures attempt to sexualize almost all aspects
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:42.000]  of human experience they disproportionately portray incest and other things in hollywood films and tv
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:48.320]  shows uh there's this and there's an obsession with sexuality uh and particularly sexualizing
[2:52:48.320 --> 2:52:56.320]  children in the hollywood culture uh hollywood is far more of a area of pedophiles and uh predators
[2:52:56.320 --> 2:53:02.400]  than the catholic church ever was but they focused on the catholic church because that was a way to
[2:53:02.400 --> 2:53:08.400]  attack conservative cultural institutions while hiding and masking the scope and severity of the
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:14.960]  behavior in hollywood and so it's it's a part of a lack of moral compass that animates them across
[2:53:14.960 --> 2:53:19.280]  the board but i try to explain to people what the info war's audience and alex jones is about
[2:53:19.280 --> 2:53:24.160]  say really it's united by two principles it's not partisan principles it's not a particular
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:30.000]  academic principle it's a principle being anti authoritarian and pro-human and what he recognizes
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:35.520]  the reason why the alex jones worldview helps better explain the world and predict the world
[2:53:35.520 --> 2:53:41.280]  and forecast the world and foreshadow future events like epstein that almost any other worldview
[2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:46.480]  out there is because he understands that people in disproportionate positions of power and the elites
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:51.200]  when they have an obtained that power are disproportionately lack a moral compass their
[2:53:51.200 --> 2:53:56.080]  desire for power the way they seek power they try to misuse it and abuse it that's why they try to
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:00.720]  treat all african-americans as victims that is real human beings that's why they look to sexualized
[2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:04.880]  children and underage behavior epstein kept insisting it was just totally normal what he was
[2:54:04.880 --> 2:54:10.800]  doing they all say is normal and you know and then when you speak out against it they want to look
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:17.680]  bad at you you know what i i know i have a i call him a friend uh terrence william he put a video
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:24.080]  out there and it went with 5.3 million views and now you have left the sending him messages telling
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:28.720]  him that he needs to watch his back because he's talking about how epstein and how the clintas
[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:34.800]  may have played a part in it why why would they do that when why would they allow that on these on
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:41.280]  these socialist tech platforms when bullying is goes against their community standards but it's
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:48.720]  okay to bully a conservative and attack conservatives but when you say something against a liberal and
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:58.160]  they get triggered oh you hurt my feelings you got to go you hurt my feelings well because it's
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:03.600]  entirely a pretext for power so for example it's like the abuse of rape allegations by parts of
[2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:08.160]  the feminist community on college campuses and the moral panic they helped try to create
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:13.680]  and it's in how they're misusing and abusing the me too movement is it's about power it's not about
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:19.920]  protecting women it's not about preventing uh bad behavior it's about protecting power and
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:26.000]  expanding power it's a tool to power everything is in their sort of fucco mindset and mentality
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:30.320]  language itself is just a means to acquire and attain power that's why it has no consistent
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:35.200]  meaning they don't in the in the legal academy most of the left doesn't really believe in consistent
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:39.040]  standards at all they don't believe in what is good for the goose is good for the gander they
[2:55:39.040 --> 2:55:43.280]  believe you should discriminate in the judiciary they believe you should target politically
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:47.920]  because in their mindset it's power that justifies itself and that the everything else is just a
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:53.840]  pretext a pretense for the exercise of that power i mean the the degree to which they're
[2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:58.000]  going to try to cover up what happened with epstein is really going to be fun to watch and yeah i mean
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:02.640]  it's like it's like i'm trying to do oswald in line of time because like today they're talking
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:07.520]  about hey well you know the two guards they just fell asleep and falsified the records right i i do
[2:56:07.520 --> 2:56:12.560]  a lot of these cases in order when you're looking at these cases what you'll find is that they they
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:17.840]  are monitoring the guards activity at all times both with other supervisors physically and personally
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:24.720]  and by cameras everywhere so how did the supervisors not notice that these guys were supposedly asleep
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:30.960]  for three hours but nothing happened here nothing happened nothing unusual this is all normal
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:36.560]  this is there's nothing that you need to look at there's no questions you need to ask if you ask
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:42.160]  any questions about it or if you think for yourself about it then you're going to be considered the
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:49.600]  enemy of the state because that's not the agenda that's not the movement that we want to push and
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:56.480]  anyone who goes against what they've been saying you have to be demonized mr robert barnes thank
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:02.080]  you so much it's been an honor and pleasure to sit here and to have the conversation with you

[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:13.280]  any last remarks 30 seconds yeah i just wanted to say that if the clitons are watching i believe
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:19.680]  it is a complete coincidence that the only person to die of suicide at mcc in the last 40 years is
[2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:27.360]  the guy who had lots of information good point good point good point good point all right so we

[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:39.680]  Twitter for a long time now and I think I'm uh I'm thinking I might put him on the spot here
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:44.880]  hope he doesn't get upset with me but I'm gonna ask Paul hey Paul how you doing can I
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:49.760]  great great good to talk to you again the last time I talked to you I kind of like uh uh I didn't
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:54.400]  know what to say or what to ask you but now I know what I want to ask you can you can I get you to
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:01:01.360]  follow me on Twitter I'll do it right now I would greatly I mean I said like oh man maybe I can get
[3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:06.160]  him to follow me that'd be great so but anyways I noticed uh doing a break there you were drinking
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:12.160]  some orange juice would you by chance have some turbo force in it not right now I do have some
[3:01:12.160 --> 3:01:17.040]  turbo force in the flat but you have you have to go very careful with turbo force because it's that
[3:01:17.040 --> 3:01:22.240]  powerful yes it is yes it is I put a whole thing in mine earlier and I've been sipping on it was
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:27.360]  about up to here earlier and I've been drinking it down to here and right now I feel pumped up I have
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:33.280]  have so much energy and the one thing that I really love about turbo force I don't get this crash
[3:01:33.280 --> 3:01:39.040]  that you get from these other energy drinks and for me it's just wonderful a lot of them just they
[3:01:39.040 --> 3:01:43.680]  just put too much caffeine on and then you get an immediate crash but with that but I only take
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:50.080]  half a sachet to start off with because it is potent stuff yeah you are correct it is it's
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:54.400]  pretty strong it's pretty strong that's why you post when you especially your first time taking it
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:01:59.680]  it you know Alex says it you know take half a packet he'll tell you take half a packet because
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:04.320]  you'll be amazed on how good it really is and it doesn't have all the bad side effects you get
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:10.400]  from these energy drinks so cool hey it's been an honor and a pleasure um I'll let you take it from
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:16.080]  here all right thanks well I'll take it from here yeah we got a big raft of stories coming up on
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:22.400]  the show today obviously we had the huge release of more google manipulation censorship documents
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:29.360]  out of project veritas what angers me continually is the mainstream media continuing to continuing
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:35.600]  to insist that there is no social media bias against conservatives when we see it at every turn
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:41.600]  and I've actually posted the video up on twitter a few hours ago and this has been going on for
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:47.200]  months now but it's getting worse and worse every time I check and you can play the video from the
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:53.120]  article it's up on summit dot news headline new project veritas leaks prove google broke its own
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:03:01.440]  search engine to censor conservatives my youtube channel you cannot find it by doing a google search
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:08.160]  youtube is owned by google you can put in my name paul joseph whatson youtube channel on a google
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:15.600]  search I checked the first 15 pages of search results it did not come up once the only results
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:22.000]  that come up are people doing impressions of me hit pieces against me people who have took my videos
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:26.400]  and uploaded them on their channels which I don't even mind people doing that's completely fair
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:35.840]  no videos of mine in the first 15 page results of a youtube search of my name and youtube channel
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:42.000]  on google you check it on every other search engine it comes up pops up the very first link
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:46.880]  how much longer are they going to pretend that there's no giant algorithmic bias against
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:53.200]  conservatives which is doc dr robert epstein has proven and in fact he testified in front of congress
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:04:01.120]  about this has been illustrated to shift millions of votes on election day there is no purer more
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:07.680]  brazen example of election meddling than google's algorithmic manipulation and you see it with my
[3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:12.800]  youtube channel you see it with other youtube channels we've highlighted before you can go on
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:17.680]  there on youtube search engine which by the way is the second biggest search engine in the world
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:25.520]  after google itself and search for direct headlines related to political figures in quotation marks
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:30.880]  with the direct headline and what do you get you get a wall of mainstream media search results
[3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:36.000]  which in many cases have nothing whatsoever to do with the search that you've performed
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:41.200]  i find it difficult to actually find articles that i've written in the past that other people
[3:04:41.200 --> 3:04:46.720]  have written in the past to refer back to on a day-to-day basis because they've broken their
[3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:52.240]  own search engine this is so brazen we're going to get into it more on the other side info wars
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:57.760]  dot com don't go away it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most

[3:06:11.120 --> 3:06:18.000]  watson we have got a ton of news going on including boltz wagon putting out an ad or
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:24.320]  attempting to put out a commercial in the united kingdom which shows dot forbid the horror of a
[3:06:24.320 --> 3:06:31.440]  woman caring for a baby in a pram it was immediately banned after three people complained
[3:06:31.440 --> 3:06:39.200]  because according to the advertising standards agency in the uk it furthers gender stereotypes
[3:06:39.200 --> 3:06:47.600]  god forbid you would have a poor trail of a woman caring for a baby in 2019 that is verboten of course
[3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:53.040]  you can have ads showing men being complete idiots and clops is on commercials which has
[3:06:53.040 --> 3:06:59.280]  been the case for the past 20 30 years across the board that's completely fine you can have ads for
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:04.880]  the homophobic country of brunei that still stones gay people to death on the london underground
[3:07:04.880 --> 3:07:12.400]  that's completely fine but you can't show an ad featuring a woman with a bikini body that was banned
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:17.760]  very interesting double standard we're going to get into that later on in the show but i want to
[3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:23.520]  start off with this new document dump from project varitas which again only confirms in triplicate
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:28.800]  what we've already been experiencing for the past two years plus for the past three years since the
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:34.080]  election when of course google executives got up in front of a meeting and sounded off about how
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:40.960]  they could not possibly let this happen again i.e a populist or trump getting elected and they've
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:46.320]  certainly took a lot of steps in the interim to prevent that from happening trump administration
[3:07:46.320 --> 3:07:50.880]  has reacted too late we've heard this social media executive order is in the pipeline we've
[3:07:50.880 --> 3:07:56.400]  been hearing that for the best part of six months now nothing has happened so far but now we have
[3:07:56.400 --> 3:08:02.720]  this out of bright bar project varitas google whistleblower goes public i saw something dark
[3:08:02.720 --> 3:08:07.840]  and nefarious going on now i think this guy had already released some information but his identity
[3:08:07.840 --> 3:08:14.880]  was shadowed now he's gone completely public this this is Zachary Voorhees who said he's come forward
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:20.160]  because he quote saw something dark and nefarious going on with the company and realized that they
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:25.120]  were going to not only tamper with the elections but use that tampering with the elections to
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:30.800]  essentially overthrow the united states this is the severity of what we're talking about with
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:36.240]  social media algorithmic manipulation and censorship as i said in the previous segment
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:43.440]  dr robert eppstein has done exhaustive studies of major elections in one case the biggest election
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:49.280]  in the world the indian election and he found that by simply ranking certain search results
[3:08:49.280 --> 3:08:55.520]  above others on election day on the days before election day you can swing the outcome of an
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:09:01.760]  entire election bearing in mind for the past two years plus we've had the media be a mongering
[3:09:01.760 --> 3:09:07.600]  creating this moral panic that because some russian spent three thousand dollars on facebook ads
[3:09:07.600 --> 3:09:13.120]  that that is election manipulation that that is election meddling it's a drop in the ocean
[3:09:13.120 --> 3:09:20.320]  to how google has broken its own search engine by putting certain websites and certain people
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:25.200]  on blacklist and who do you think is on that blacklist you can look at the search terms
[3:09:25.200 --> 3:09:32.080]  as well this came out today and it's a list of search terms from google's query blacklist
[3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:39.920]  relating to the shooting in las vegas the steven paddock massacre in uh october 2017
[3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:46.400]  and they've basically locked down all the keywords that would question that event despite the fact
[3:09:46.400 --> 3:09:52.000]  that as we know the motive behind that massacre has not been revealed in the near two years since
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:56.640]  it happened but they don't want anyone investigating it they don't want anyone looking into it they
[3:09:56.640 --> 3:10:02.000]  don't want any search results popping up at the top of google that could actually give
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:06.960]  anyone an insight into what actually happened gateway pundits have been reporting on this all
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:12.000]  day as well we have a headline here project veritas leaked google documents prove tech giant is
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:18.640]  censoring rush limbaugh gateway pundit newsbusters mrc tv daily caller and of course on that list
[3:10:18.640 --> 3:10:26.400]  is info wars dot com alex jones channel when it existed and many others basically all of them
[3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:31.600]  conservative right wing websites there are a few that aren't media matters is on there but again
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:35.680]  if you got if you go on google and try and search for a media matters article chances are it's going
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:41.760]  to pop up near the top one's written by yours truly aren't my own youtube channels i was talking
[3:10:41.760 --> 3:10:48.080]  about in the previous segment you can google search paul joseph watson youtube channel now
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:53.280]  only does it not come up on the first page i checked earlier the link to my youtube channel
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:58.400]  with the exact search term that you would expect to find it as the first result does not come up in
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:05.600]  the first 15 pages and beyond that i didn't have time to check beyond that it's probably not even
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:11.040]  on there at all and now gateway pundit reports if you search google for prominent conservative
[3:11:11.040 --> 3:11:16.640]  voices including mike synovich joe de jennifer jack posobic or gateway pundit you will see hit
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:22.480]  pieces and biased attacks this is the point this is how they dictate manipulate and create reality
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:26.000]  the gateway pundit is one of the largest most accurate most influential publishers in the
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:31.760]  country today but earlier this year if you search google for gateway pundit the first item that
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:37.440]  popped up was a hit piece on the gateway pundit you had to go to the fifth item before you could
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:45.360]  even find a link to their website and they've got away better than i have because you don't even get
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:52.000]  my youtube channel on the 15th page never mind the fifth result on the first page they have another
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:57.520]  headline here frightening google engineer leaks massive trove of info on google's information
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:04.240]  control operations reveals google sent police to and fbi to intimidate him so again he came out with
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:10.640]  some information back in june they immediately clamped down on it ferreted out his identity and
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:15.680]  start intimidating him against releasing more information but kudos to him because he's released
[3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:21.280]  a huge treasure treasure trove of documents i think it's like a 90 page document something around that
[3:12:21.840 --> 3:12:28.080]  proving once again that they do manipulate their search results for parties and purposes remember
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:35.200]  sundar pitch i got up in front of a congressional hearing and said quote google has never manipulated
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:40.880]  or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political
[3:12:40.880 --> 3:12:48.640]  ideology complete and total bs they were literally in there the days before the referendum on banning
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:56.960]  abortion in ireland on their youtube search engine relegating burying anti-abortion youtube videos
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:03.760]  after one slate writer complained about it this is how it works this is the media now forget about
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:09.920]  journalism forget about muck raking their entire purpose is to now simply de-platforming narratives
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:16.560]  that challenge them one person complained to google they immediately fall into line butcher
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:22.000]  their own search results so they're not even accurate anymore days before a referendum which by the
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:30.560]  way went in the favor of the pro-abortion people in ireland burying anti-abortion youtube videos
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:37.200]  we've caught them doing this time and time again again mark dice you can put in the exact titles
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:45.040]  to his videos uh michelle obama trash's hillary clinton was one example another mark dice video
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:50.640]  called celebrities react to hillary losing election at six million views you put in the
[3:13:50.640 --> 3:13:57.360]  exact headline it's buried beneath literally dozens of mainstream news outlets which have
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:03.920]  nothing whatsoever to do with that issue i mean this is really a crisis in democracy this is
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:09.440]  way worse than four thousand dollars spent on facebook ads by a bunch of russians and they've
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:14.480]  got the nerve to get up there in front of congress and so they don't manipulate anything for parties
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:19.200]  and purposes when we've caught them doing it time and time again they've got the nerve to put out
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:25.680]  headlines saying oh trump's considering a social media executive order based on unproven allegations
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:33.280]  of conservative bias how many examples of this do we need to show you how many times does comedy
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:39.040]  central or steven colbert or any of these shows get to have their videos featured on youtube trending
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:44.400]  get to have ads in their videos cnn can do a report about isis it's chock full of ads
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:49.760]  i do a report about anything it's automatically demonetized we have example after example
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:55.920]  of them manipulating their search engines and again this shifts millions and millions of votes
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:15:02.560]  on election day and now we've had yet another example of that when is this going to be presented
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:09.120]  in a in a master volume of evidence to actually push this executive social media order over the edge
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.080]  because they've been dragging their feet on it for the past six months it's getting ever closer
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:20.080]  to 2020 and it's not looking good for trump this could definitely swing it if you're talking about
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:25.520]  millions of votes on election day this could definitely swing it against trump we need that
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:32.480]  social media executive order and we need it quick absolutely incredible that you can literally search

[3:19:05.600 --> 3:19:10.400]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:16.560]  goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's
[3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:22.640]  doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't

[3:20:25.680 --> 3:20:30.880]  to mention amidst all this social media censorship of course we had the story today or last night but
[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:37.840]  youtube actually took down the quomo frido video of course where he gets irate angry
[3:20:37.840 --> 3:20:43.120]  threats to kick someone in a tea threats to throw them down the stairs for calling him the italian
[3:20:43.120 --> 3:20:49.520]  version of the n word even though it blatantly isn't they took down that video only after bright
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:55.440]  bark complained about it did it go back up they claimed it was bullying and harassment again this
[3:20:55.440 --> 3:21:00.320]  video made quomo look bad it wasn't they didn't take it down because he was engaging in bullying
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:05.120]  and harassment they took it down because it was going viral it went viral that's why they took
[3:21:05.120 --> 3:21:10.640]  it down because it made the cnn host look bad only after bright bark complained put up an article
[3:21:10.640 --> 3:21:16.000]  about it asked you to what they were doing did it come back up so it's like whack them all it's
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:21.440]  like every day you have to bitch and complain about this stuff and it prevents you from pushing

[3:23:15.440 --> 3:23:21.040]  thanks to the javanka presidency headline upper information liberation and vanka trump
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:26.240]  quietly lobbying congress for gun control because that's what's important isn't it that's not
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:31.680]  stabbing everyone who voted for trump in the back we voted for donald trump and got javanka
[3:23:31.680 --> 3:23:37.280]  writes chris menahan. vanka trump is reportedly calling members of congress to feel out various
[3:23:37.280 --> 3:23:42.160]  gun control proposals and to figure out what needs to be done in order to get them passed
[3:23:42.160 --> 3:23:47.200]  axios reports that vanka has been quietly calling lawmakers since the el paso and datum massacres
[3:23:47.200 --> 3:23:53.120]  to gauge their openness to movement on gun legislation when congress returns perhaps she's
[3:23:53.120 --> 3:24:00.240]  showing them sad pictures which is what she did to trump before the bombing of syria back in 2017
[3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:05.520]  that's what's important to the javanka presidency not the fact that the father supporters being
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:10.560]  banned and censored off the internet and persecuted at every term but the fact that we need
[3:24:10.560 --> 3:24:17.120]  yet more gun control measures thanks a lot for that great work. Meanwhile cnn's anderson kooper
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:22.000]  says it's exciting that whites will not be the majority in america see this is the problem
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:28.160]  time and time again every time there's a mass shooting blamed on a white supremacist a right-wing
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:34.400]  extremist they say that they've been radicalized because they believe in this giant conspiracy
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:41.680]  about the great replacement this absolutely harebrained ridiculous notion that white people
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:46.400]  in the west are in demographic decline because that's obviously not the case isn't it not by
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:52.880]  every single metric imaginable so it's bad if you talk about that and say it may have some
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:57.840]  negative consequences that puts you in league with mass shooters and terrorists but if you're
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:04.800]  cnn's anderson kooper and you talk about it and say it's a good thing that's completely fine cnn
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:09.840]  anchor anderson kooper seemed to celebrate the idea of white people no longer constituting the
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:16.080]  majority of those in the united states he said quote the idea that you know whites will not
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:22.000]  be the majority i mean it's an exciting transformation of the country it's an exciting evolution and
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:26.720]  you know progress of our country in many different ways imagine if you said that about
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:31.600]  native americans or if you said it about black abortion rates or if you said it about black
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:38.400]  people killing each other on mass in shy rack and places like that he would be drummed out of a job
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:43.360]  but as long as it's white people the last acceptable form of racism you can celebrate it
[3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:48.480]  and it's all fine and dandy he made those comments while interviewing univision anchor george ramos
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:56.400]  hohey ramos who is openly advocated for more immigration policies ramos said there's nothing
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:01.600]  really they can do against this incredible demographic revolution and in 2044 everyone is
[3:26:01.600 --> 3:26:07.040]  going to be a minority gray tower of babel see how that works out for you and then i think president
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:12.720]  trump represents those who are trying to revert that trend and he doesn't say it well trump just
[3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:18.240]  came out literally four days ago and said he wants millions more legal immigrants coming from non-white
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:26.000]  countries so no he's not really saying that is he meanwhile on the subject of radicalization and
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:30.560]  violent rhetoric which the left never disavows it encourages every possible turn
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:37.680]  headline up on info wars dot com ice director blames political rhetoric for attack on san antonio
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:45.440]  office we've had yet another attempted violent attack on an ice office just as we had the fire
[3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:51.760]  bombing of an ice facility in washington state a few months ago a few weeks ago pardon me by and
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:57.280]  self-admitted and tifa radical who openly in his own manifesto said he was radicalized by
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:04.240]  aoc's concentration camp rhetoric that story was dropped within about three hours by all
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:09.760]  mainstream media outlets and now after an immigration and customs enforcement office was hit with
[3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:15.840]  gunfire in san antonio the director of the office issued a statement blaming various politicians
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:22.240]  media outlets and activists groups of course now we know that most of the democratic presidential
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:28.320]  candidates are running on a policy of abolishing ice altogether many of them have openly encouraged
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:35.440]  the harassment the doxing even in some cases the harassment and doxing of ice agents children
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:41.680]  so is there any great surprise that bullets are now flying towards ice officers across the united
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:48.800]  states fbi special agent christopher combs said had the bullets gone two inches in another direction
[3:27:48.800 --> 3:27:54.400]  we would be here talking about the murder of a federal official but the field director at the
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:28:00.720]  office daniel bible seems more certain that the attack was deliberate and he's blaming leftist ice
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:06.080]  rhetoric you know it's misinformation about how he's being recklessly disseminated by certain
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:12.640]  politicians and activists so again you've got this heightened political extremism on both sides
[3:28:12.640 --> 3:28:19.680]  let's be fair differences people on the right disavow it at every turn and encourage people
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:25.760]  not to engage in it meanwhile you have numerous members of congress numerous presidential candidates
[3:28:25.760 --> 3:28:31.360]  on the democratic side saying go out and harass trump supporters literally in the case of reza
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:37.360]  aslan saying that trump supporters need to be eradicated that kelly and comway needs to be
[3:28:37.360 --> 3:28:42.800]  eradicated so is there any great surprise that many of them are going g had and now literally
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:48.400]  trying to attack government facilities but the media gives them cover and doesn't talk about it

[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:25.440]  left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements
[3:30:25.440 --> 3:30:31.600]  no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because
[3:30:31.600 --> 3:30:35.520]  they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:40.080]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[3:30:40.080 --> 3:30:43.680]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother

[3:31:50.160 --> 3:32:00.240]  a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they
[3:32:00.240 --> 3:32:04.880]  face no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:09.440]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent
[3:32:09.440 --> 3:32:12.800]  free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public in the audience that care
[3:32:12.800 --> 3:32:17.440]  about this has to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:21.360]  otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[3:32:21.360 --> 3:32:25.280]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran american economy
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:28.960]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression the info

[3:32:38.640 --> 3:32:43.120]  free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[3:32:43.120 --> 3:32:47.360]  to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling
[3:32:47.360 --> 3:32:51.360]  us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw
[3:32:51.360 --> 3:32:53.920]  isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[3:32:53.920 --> 3:33:09.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:13.680 --> 3:33:20.640]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:20.640 --> 3:33:24.560]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:33.680]  Volkswagen commercial banned in uk because it shows woman caring for a baby this is the
[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:40.800]  latest out of plan world uk it literally just shows a woman sat on a bench with a coffee next
[3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:49.120]  to a pram this is unacceptable in 2019 this is where we're at with gender stereotypes the asa
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:55.920]  has banned the ad and it's in the uh summit news article with that headline the ad shows a scene
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:34:01.360]  of a woman and a man in a tent on a cliff face again the implication there is that both the man
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:07.120]  and the woman have climbed this giant cliff so that sounds quite like equality to me doesn't it
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:14.640]  but god forbid listen to what they put in this ad two male astronauts floating in a spaceship
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:21.920]  a male para athlete with a prosthetic leg doing the long jump again it's not a transgender
[3:34:21.920 --> 3:34:27.520]  disabled muslim so it's not allowed at the end of the clip a woman is seen sat on a bench next
[3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:34.720]  to a pram god forbid the horror the commercial was banned by the uk advertising standard authority
[3:34:34.720 --> 3:34:41.520]  after just three people complain imagine being such a pathetic sack of crap that you get offended
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:47.920]  over a woman sat on a bench next to a pram and that's your life is to complain about that imagine
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:56.880]  being that weasley of a person the asa said this this is what they said because it's now it's now
[3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:02.160]  against the law basically to have ads showing women doing laundry or women doing the washing up in
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:07.360]  the uk seriously you can show ads of men being complete idiots and failing at everything and
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:15.120]  falling over and being humiliated that's fine but the asa said quote by juxtaposing images of men
[3:35:15.120 --> 3:35:19.920]  in extraordinary environments even though they did that with a woman who climbed the cliff face
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:24.720]  they ignored that and carrying out adventurous activities with women who appeared passive
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:31.600]  or engaged in a stereotypical caregiving role because we can't have young women being encouraged
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:38.800]  to give caregiving roles in society can we I mean what what's gonna happen we considered that the
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:43.520]  ad directly contrasted stereotypical male and female roles and characteristics in a manner that
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:50.160]  gave the impression that they were exclusively associated with one gender we concluded that
[3:35:50.160 --> 3:35:54.640]  the ad presenter gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm and therefore breach the
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:36:01.040]  code cause harm to who the three sacks of crap who are so pathetic that this is their life to
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:09.040]  complain about things the professionally offended outrage twitch fork mob the only thing it harmed
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:13.680]  was their stupid feelings which are like jelly and need to be harmed anyway how on earth do they even
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:19.280]  get through a day how on earth do they even operate in society if they have breakdowns nervous
[3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:24.320]  breakdowns over seeing a woman on a bench next to a pram why are we catering to these people in
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:30.560]  society why is society getting worse why is masculinity getting screwed up the more we
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:36.880]  confuse stereotypical normal in other words gender roles and what's funny about it is
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:43.040]  like Volkswagen came back and tried to inject some sense into this thinking that it would
[3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:48.160]  change anything it's not going to change anything three people complained it's over they normally
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:53.280]  banned something after one person complained so three to them is a deluge listen to what
[3:36:53.280 --> 3:37:01.600]  Volkswagen said defending oh by the way this this is going to put like lots of female actresses out
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:07.920]  of work now that they can't have parts showing them performing care caregiving roles in society
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:13.360]  that's going to eliminate a lot of jobs for female actresses well done yay feminism literally
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:21.440]  putting women out of work bravo Volkswagen said quote the core message of the ad was centered
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:27.120]  on the ability of the human spirit to adapt to challenges and change brought about by circumstances
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:30.960]  they illustrated that through a number of different scenarios featuring various characters
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:34.960]  so that as diverse an audience as possible would be able to identify with the message
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:40.800]  so you've got a couple wasn't a mixed race couple i mean maybe they'll start banning
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:46.320]  that in the future you can't have couples of the same race they had a couple climbing a cliff face
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:52.560]  they had a disabled man doing the long jump they had some astronauts in a spaceship they had a woman
[3:37:52.560 --> 3:37:58.800]  caring for a baby so they tried to cover all the bases but now it's still bigoted it's still wrong
[3:37:58.800 --> 3:38:06.560]  and it will still be banned because three idiots complained Volkswagen went on to say they included
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:11.920]  the final scene of the woman in the park as a relatable example of adaptation to change as
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:16.480]  they believe that welcoming a newborn into the family was a life-changing experience that will
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:23.600]  be shared by many viewers regardless of gender now you can't show positive portrayals of women
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:31.200]  caring for newborn babies that is offensive the scene served a secondary purpose of illustrating
[3:38:31.200 --> 3:38:37.920]  the reduction of engine noise in an electric vehicle so basically this car drives past this
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:42.800]  woman who sat on a bench at high speed and the audio levels go down they're illustrating that
[3:38:42.800 --> 3:38:49.840]  it's a quiet vehicle not that god forbid women do care for babies because we can't have young women
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:54.880]  seeing that message can we no they all need to be out getting drunk and being completely degenerate
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:39:01.680]  ruining their lives and being unhappy that's what we need to push meanwhile ads that reinforce
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:06.960]  negative gender stereotypes about men are still perfectly fine which brings me back to the man's
[3:39:06.960 --> 3:39:13.520]  spreading of course we had the media a couple of weeks ago celebrate the designer of the anti
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:18.800]  man-spreading chair which was completely ridiculous looked aesthetically hideous and would never be
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:25.200]  produced it was just a social justice identity politics stunt but the media treated it seriously
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:31.360]  so why can't we have ads showing women caring for babies because it reinforces harmful gender
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:37.360]  stereotypes and might offend people but we can have ads giant ads on the london underground
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:44.720]  lecturing men how to sit and the image is right there in the article you can see it up on screen
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:52.240]  now that's not how you sit sit properly who the hell sits like this have you ever seen anyone on
[3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:58.320]  public transport this is not even physically anatomically possible to sit like that with your
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:04.960]  legs spread out over two people sat next to you oh and by the way let's talk about bag spreading
[3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:10.800]  no we never seem to talk about that do we and i flashed back in this article to another article
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:18.000]  which is from back in april ads for homophobic brunei appear on london underground bikini ads
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:24.880]  banned you remember back in 2015 we had the big controversy over protein world they had a billboard
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:30.560]  campaign showing an attractive woman who's obviously physically healthy in good condition
[3:40:30.560 --> 3:40:36.880]  wearing a bikini a bunch of fat ugly feminists complained about it and defaced it so it was
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:43.520]  banned but if you want to have an ad for the homophobic nation of brunei which tried to pass
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:50.960]  a law literally allowing gay people to be stoned to death that ad was perfectly acceptable on the
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:58.400]  london underground we had another example of this headline uk ad featuring sexy female
[3:40:58.400 --> 3:41:06.000]  mechanic banned after a single complaint again just takes one permanently professionally outraged
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:13.120]  moron to change the nature of society because now our institutions are catering to their mental
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:18.880]  illnesses an ad for a porch garage in the uk featuring a sexy female mechanic was banned by
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:26.800]  the asa after a single complaint because it was sexually suggestive so where to understand now
[3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:32.400]  that they've banned an ad showing a woman caring for a baby and also banned an ad showing a woman
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:40.240]  working under a car doing mechanics that you can't show a woman engaging in a stereotypically feminine
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:46.560]  role and you can't show a woman engaging in a stereotypically masculine role again putting
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:52.960]  a whole swath of female actor actresses and people who appear in ad campaigns out of work
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:42:02.240]  literally depriving them of income that's feminism in 2019 well done bravo absolutely
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:08.240]  ridiculous talking about degeneracy here's another headline new universal movie portrays
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:14.240]  sixth graders playing with sex toys in the trailer for this they literally have seth rogan at the
[3:42:14.240 --> 3:42:20.240]  start telling the child actors in this movie that they can't watch the trailer because it's quote
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:26.320]  too messed up for kids your age the first scene in the trailer from the actual movie portrays
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:33.760]  these 11 12 year old boys playing with a gimp mask dildos and anal beads and it goes on from there
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:39.920]  they literally have them transporting ecstasy to playgrounds and stuff like that this movie is aimed
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:46.960]  at a pre teen audience someone on twitter joked i think this was supposed to be the in-flight
[3:42:46.960 --> 3:42:54.800]  movie on etstein's plane absolutely absurd don't go away we'll be back george arwell said that in a
[3:42:54.800 --> 3:43:00.160]  time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that
[3:43:00.160 --> 3:43:04.560]  important to wear the american flag because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:09.360]  group of people that actually hated it but now they're trying to take it out of schools they're
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:14.000]  taking it down off of government buildings weird white leftists that want a virtue singular pulling
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:18.880]  down american flags and running up mexican flags this is the bizarreness of the america hating
[3:43:18.880 --> 3:43:24.480]  we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:30.480]  to wear the american flag particularly the betsy ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it

[3:48:44.880 --> 3:48:50.960]  cnn put out an article saying every time a fox news host takes a vacation it's actually a disguise
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:57.680]  for a suspension they go through a list of different examples laura ingraham judge janine
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:03.600]  shorn hannity jessie watters and bill o'reilly of course never returned they all went on vacation
[3:49:03.600 --> 3:49:08.720]  at the same time that they were embroiled with controversy for what they said on air during
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:16.240]  their fox news show and now some people speculating that Tucker Carlson's sudden vacation was actually
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:22.880]  a suspension fox news claims that it was planned well in advance but cnn tried to talk to numerous
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:28.000]  high-profile people at fox news to get a comment on whether it was a vacation or a suspension
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:34.080]  and none of them agreed to talk so that still rages as to whether Tucker Carlson has been
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:39.520]  suspended or not he is slated to come back on august 19th which i expect that to happen
[3:49:40.080 --> 3:49:48.240]  others speculating that his pre-eminent slot at the prime time fox news slot will be replaced or
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:54.720]  at least supplemented with ben Shapiro that is an outcome and eventuality that nobody wants to see
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:50:01.280]  the response on twitter to that possibility has been vehemently no meanwhile
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:07.680]  epstein's guards falsified records to say they had checked on him because what happened with the
[3:50:07.680 --> 3:50:13.600]  deep platform with the censorship was that they started removing jeffrey epstein conspiracy videos
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:18.560]  which would have meant removing basically thousands of videos over the past two days i think they
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:24.960]  only removed one prominent video of people questioning if it really was a suicide and the
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:30.640]  latest explanation as to why epstein suicide was not prevented is that his guards were asleep for
[3:50:30.640 --> 3:50:34.880]  the three hours before it happened and later falsified records to make it look as if they
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:40.560]  had checked on epstein so they're running still with this incompetence theory despite the fact
[3:50:40.560 --> 3:50:47.040]  that he was obviously probably the highest profile prisoner that they'd ever had the guards were asleep
[3:50:47.040 --> 3:50:52.800]  for hours before and they filled in the logbook to make it look as if they had been checking on
[3:50:52.800 --> 3:50:59.520]  epstein every 30 minutes of course yesterday it emerged that epstein allegedly hanged himself
[3:50:59.520 --> 3:51:05.120]  using bedsheets those very same bedsheets were described as not being much stronger than paper
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:10.640]  by a former inmate but apparently he managed to hang himself from a bunk bed using bedsheets not
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:18.160]  much stronger than paper zero hedge asks ladies and gentlemen have we found our patsies in relation
[3:51:18.160 --> 3:51:24.400]  to these incompetent jail guards as we reported yesterday shrieking and shouting was heard from
[3:51:24.400 --> 3:51:29.920]  jeffrey epstein's cell the morning he died while one of epstein's guards at the mcc was not a regular
[3:51:29.920 --> 3:51:36.000]  corrections officer also epstein's cellmate had been mysteriously removed the night before
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:43.360]  meaning there was no one to witness his suicide and of course the cameras didn't pick up anything
[3:51:43.360 --> 3:51:48.800]  just by coincidence meanwhile oh by the way everyone's basically forgotten about epstein
[3:51:48.800 --> 3:51:52.720]  now it's out of the news cycle already that's what happens within three days it's totally gone
[3:51:53.520 --> 3:51:59.840]  meanwhile in london null gallagher of oasis reveals plans to leave london after a man was
[3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:04.320]  stabbed on his street and admits he doesn't want his children growing up in the capital
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:09.760]  so even though null gallagher lives in one of the most expensive areas of london he makes the
[3:52:09.760 --> 3:52:15.760]  point that he's got huge housing estates either side of where he lives and because the gang members
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:20.560]  in those housing estates are at war with each other innocent people are now being stabbed
[3:52:20.560 --> 3:52:26.240]  which i can certainly sympathize with literally five minutes from where i live five minutes walk
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:31.280]  people are being stabbed and now it's not just gang on gang it's innocent people some of whom
[3:52:31.280 --> 3:52:36.480]  try to intervene in some of this carnage and end up becoming the victims well now null gallagher has
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:42.400]  revealed he's leaving london after a man was recently stabbed on his street the former oasis
[3:52:42.400 --> 3:52:46.720]  rocker opened up on his relocation plans after declaring the city is too dangerous to raise his
[3:52:46.720 --> 3:52:53.520]  family in of course liam gallagher said words to the same effect a few years a few weeks ago sorry
[3:52:54.080 --> 3:53:00.400]  questioning why sidi khan always replies to this knife crime wave this acid attack wave in london
[3:53:00.400 --> 3:53:07.600]  by simply saying london is open as it continues to get worse of course exacerbated by numerous
[3:53:07.600 --> 3:53:14.320]  factors which they will never talk about drill rap music being prime amongst them and the increasing
[3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:18.880]  violence on our streets thanks to mass immigration because a lot of these gang members are coming
[3:53:18.880 --> 3:53:25.200]  in from places like the congo and somalia and the gang members already in the uk having to up
[3:53:25.200 --> 3:53:32.720]  their levels of violence simply to compete simply to remain to retain their turf nobody talks about
[3:53:32.720 --> 3:53:40.000]  mass immigration contributing exacerbating this huge problem and now null gallagher has said that
[3:53:40.000 --> 3:53:47.520]  he is leaving london and i'll probably be soon to follow him meanwhile over in germany former
[3:53:47.520 --> 3:53:53.760]  three star general says merkel can't even bring herself to say german people which reminded me of
[3:53:53.760 --> 3:53:58.640]  the incident a few years ago you remember when angela merkel the german chancellor was up on stage
[3:53:59.200 --> 3:54:06.000]  celebrating an election victory she was handed a small german flag to wave in celebration she
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:14.000]  looked embarrassed she shook her head she disposed of that flag very quickly and now former three
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:19.120]  star general jochim wundrak says that angela merkel is so politically correct she cannot even bring
[3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:24.480]  herself to talk about quote the german people he is announced recently that he's going to run for
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:30.240]  the mayor of hanover as a member of the afd slammed merkel for being the front person for
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:35.200]  enacting quote anti-german pro mass migration policies and refusing to even acknowledge the
[3:54:35.200 --> 3:54:41.680]  existence of german people as a group he said quote merkel has sworn an oath to germany but
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:47.200]  she already has a problem talking about german people she prefers to speak of population many
[3:54:47.200 --> 3:54:53.680]  german politicians struggle to profess their own nation show so she den even say the words
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:54:59.760]  the german people anymore meanwhile voice of europe reports germany multiple women sexually
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:05.520]  assaulted senior citizen beaten all by migrant men this happened over the weekend in germany where
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:09.600]  three women were sexually assaulted a senior citizen was sent to the hospital after she was
[3:55:09.600 --> 3:55:15.280]  beaten two afghan migrants have been arrested while the other three suspects remain at large
[3:55:15.280 --> 3:55:22.640]  of course germany is now inundated by commercials and they even weave the storylines into the
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:29.680]  narratives of soap operas trying to get them to accept this new reality even though from the
[3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:35.120]  german government's own numbers violent crime continues to increase and the majority of it
[3:55:35.120 --> 3:55:43.440]  is being committed by these culturally enriching migrants italy animal cruelty investigation
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:49.200]  after muslim migrants slaughter sheep in parking lot a pair of tunisian migrants are under investigation
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:54.400]  by italian authorities for animal cruelty after allegedly slaughtering sorts of sheep in a parking
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:56:00.320]  lot this happened at the village of benti boglio in bologna as part of the annual islamic festival
[3:56:00.320 --> 3:56:05.520]  sacrifice ed but was observed by local security guard we see these stories all across europe

[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:24.000]  for making youtube videos drawing attention to it and in fact last week the angry foreigner had
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:28.480]  his channel on the verge of deletion because they'd falsely flagged two of his videos for
[3:57:28.480 --> 3:57:34.400]  a hate speech this is a very mild mannered moderate person simply drawing attention to the

[3:58:46.800 --> 3:58:51.520]  holding hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[3:58:51.520 --> 3:58:56.160]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[3:58:56.160 --> 3:59:00.640]  wars i think that the neo cons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[3:59:00.640 --> 3:59:04.880]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[3:59:04.880 --> 3:59:09.360]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[3:59:09.360 --> 3:59:12.960]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying
[3:59:12.960 --> 3:59:16.640]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying
[3:59:16.640 --> 3:59:21.600]  to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until
