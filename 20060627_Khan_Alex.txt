[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]  Here in the UK, a computer expert has said that he warned the British police about the
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.400]  activities of two of the London suicide bombers two years before they killed 52 people, including
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.400]  themselves.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.680]  Martin Gilbertson met the men, Shehzad Tanweer and Mohammed Ziddiqi Khan, through his work
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.240]  at a community school in the north of England which had close links to a nearby Islamic
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.160]  bookshop and he gave them technical help, but became increasingly concerned by the two
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.360]  men who repeatedly tried to convert him to Islam.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.560]  In 2003 I sent them some discs that had been produced by the bookshop in Beeston which
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.800]  was very anti-Western, anti-Iraq, anti-everything, very anti-Semitic, also included in it was
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.800]  a list of names which included both Tanweer and Khan.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.960]  Well Martin Gilbertson says Mohammed Ziddiqi Khan and Tanweer thought of him as a potential
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.240]  ally because he was a hell's angel.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.480]  He says he never expected them though to mount an attack on British soil, but was worried
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.880]  enough to go to the police.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.920]  I wasn't the only person in Beeston concerned about them, but we actually thought they would
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.120]  be supporting attacks on British troops abroad, but as I had nobody to turn to and the climate
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.880]  of fear within the area is unbelievable, I actually sent them to the West Yorkshire Police
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.880]  Force.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.040]  Joining me now in the studio Charles Shoebridge, former anti-terrorist intelligence officer
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.600]  with the police here in London.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.400]  Is this a big miss by the authorities?
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.800]  Well I think we've already established actually in the panoply of information that's emerged
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.680]  since the 7th of July attacks that suggests that certainly Khan and certainly Tanweer
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.840]  were known to the security services to varying degrees.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.360]  That has emerged already, but there's no question that this new information which I
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.600]  think sounds credible, it's the sort of information that is given to police quite regularly about
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.840]  the activities of Islamic extremists and others of terrorist interest, should have added to
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840]  that picture.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.520]  So once again we're talking about the intelligence game if you like of a jigsaw in effect, putting
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.240]  together all these disparate elements of information to come up with a profile of a person and
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.080]  assess the risk from that person correctly.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]  That isn't what happened in this case.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.280]  Yeah because we've got what this man says he did, and there's new information just this
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.840]  week from the United States saying that the US tipped off the British authorities about
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.240]  Mohamed Siddiqui Khan anyway, and then there was the original sort of admission which came
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.080]  quite late from the security services here that they were aware of him and that they'd
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080]  been following him tangential to another investigation.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.800]  I mean it does all mount up it seems over time that there was more and more information
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]  there.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880]  No that's right, and I don't think again that's a surprise to people who actually worked in
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.560]  the industry of intelligence, it was always going to be highly improbable that somebody
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.560]  comes straight out as what the media was calling a clean skin and suddenly becomes a suicide
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]  bomber.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.200]  Well the media led on by briefings from the authorities.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.960]  I think that's absolutely right and there was a good reason for that I'm sure which
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.320]  was, from their perspective anyway, which was of course if these are clean skins how
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.240]  can we blame the security services for not having been on their trail, as it's turned
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.720]  out as I think was predictable and predicted.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.600]  This has turned out to be not the case, that really the level of information that was coming
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.120]  in about Khan, particularly if these American reports especially which now seem to be being
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.400]  backed up by the actual American authorities not just appearing in an author's book, that
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.360]  they tipped off the British about the specifics of Khan and this was quite a serious plot
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.120]  in the United States that we were talking about, an attempt to blow up synagogues and
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120]  so on.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.840]  The amount of information coming in and the quality of information coming in, the fact
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.440]  that that has been so consistently overlooked it would appear by the security service MI5,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.320]  to me suggests really only one of two options, either A, we've got a level of incompetence
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.360]  that would be unusual even for the security service, but B, possibly, and this is a possibility,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.200]  that this man Khan may even have been working as an informant for the security service.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.640]  It's difficult otherwise to see how it can be that they've so covered his tracks in the
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640]  interim.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.280]  Interesting, thank you very much.
