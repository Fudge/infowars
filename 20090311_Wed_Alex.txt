[00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:06.375]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.156]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:09.917]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:11.498]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:13.039]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.241]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:26.427]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:29.909]  Get ready for more mass shootings all across the world.
[00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:35.810]  As the bankers attempt to disarm the few slaves that still have firearms.
[00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.194]  They've been saying this was coming.
[00:00:40.194 --> 00:00:46.638]  You know, that chimpanzee a few weeks ago, it was on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the Prozac family.
[00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:50.741]  And it had a bad trip and started tearing people's faces off.
[00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:54.684]  You know, ripped the lady's jaw off.
[00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:55.745]  And in about 99% of the cases,
[00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:09.855]  I mean, I've only seen out of hundreds of cases a few where they were not on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the Prozac family.
[00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:24.464]  And I'll bet you that probably both of these men had been seeing psychiatrists or psychologists, the mass shooting in Alabama last night, the mass shooting killing 16 in Germany that just ended with the gunman conveniently being killed.
[00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:42.559]  And it doesn't have to be a government mind control operation because copycats are going to hear about this and the media advertises the place to go when you're having a bad day on your Prozac is a school.
[00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.762]  And you go there and you shoot people.
[00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:56.088]  You see, the entire class of drugs known as serotonin reuptake inhibitors puts you into an hallucinogenic dream world state.
[00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:09.905]  And you couple that with the fact that most Americans are now in a different brainwave than our predecessors just 50 years ago.
[00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:14.387]  Yes, the average American is in a lower brainwave mode.
[00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.087]  They are in a sleep state because they watch television.
[00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:19.508]  That is a scientific fact.
[00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:25.010]  You just Google, there will be hundreds of mainstream articles admitting television changes brainwaves.
[00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.350]  Television brain damages.
[00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:33.132]  And it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:50.046]  All the major studies show the shoot-em-up video games acclimate people to not care if they see real violence in the real world and acclimate people to be prepared to shoot and kill people in cold blood.
[00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:53.089]  That's why the military uses them and develops them as training aids.
[00:02:54.994 --> 00:03:01.317]  That's why a lot of the mass shooters you see are these shoot-em-up game players, and to them it's just a game.
[00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:06.600]  Whereas a person in the past would become very upset shooting people.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.102]  Now, people they don't know, there are crimes of passion.
[00:03:10.102 --> 00:03:23.809]  In the few cases of mass shootings that happen every few years that aren't Prozac or drug-related, some of them are illegal drug-related as well,
[00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:33.495]  There's two classes, and that is the spoiled brat, live with mommy, my wife divorced me so I'm gonna kill her and kill the kids and then kill her family.
[00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.958]  There's the spoiled brat, instant gratification, uh, mama's boy.
[00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:44.897]  And then there is the enraged postal employee who goes in and shoots people at an office.
[00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:46.577]  And those are real and they happen.
[00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:48.438]  This is a violent society.
[00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:54.359]  We've killed 50 plus million babies and rationalized it and said, ah, just use it as a form of birth control.
[00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.020]  And now they're legalized stem cell.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.020]  They call it stem cell.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.441]  That means embryonic tissue.
[00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:04.202]  They're already in Europe growing the vaccines in dead babies.
[00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.083]  I mean, large ones.
[00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:11.174]  They use that and they mix it up with monkey kidneys and a nice puree.
[00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:13.575]  You can actually go read mainstream articles about that.
[00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:14.736]  That's now going to happen here.
[00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:21.100]  You hear about China with the executed convicts and they put it into cosmetics, BBC.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.022]  Women pay for it, use it here and in France.
[00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:27.329]  Well, now you can see, just have that.
[00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:35.857]  This was just making our little green shoots of grass coming up to the ground, our new humans, are just a by-product now.
[00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:36.757]  That's what that is.
[00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:48.007]  But they call it a stem cell, and the Patriot Act's patriotic, and pulling troops out is a bill down, and... I mean, they just have all these spin words for it.
[00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:51.611]  So we're going to go over what's happened in Alabama, and in Germany.
[00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:53.883]  Guess what?
[00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:57.507]  The Army was involved at the Alabama shooting.
[00:04:57.507 --> 00:05:01.031]  Oh, the Army!
[00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.393]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:08.961]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:11.644]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call
[00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:25.120]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.504]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:35.107]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:39.510]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.791]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:49.209]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:13.377]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:19.861]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.861 --> 00:06:21.843]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.843 --> 00:06:24.305]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:35.213]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:39.150]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.012]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:41.012 --> 00:06:47.916]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:57.763 --> 00:07:02.346]  The people strike back.
[00:07:02.346 --> 00:07:04.288]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.978]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:07:07.978 --> 00:07:12.141]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:15.020]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.422]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.

[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.025]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:09.668]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:14.632]  Well, the New World Order propaganda machine has gone into overdrive.
[00:08:14.632 --> 00:08:21.237]  Hundreds of news stories this morning I pulled up calling for semi-automatic vans.
[00:08:21.237 --> 00:08:25.141]  Sheriff's deputies in Alabama reporting he had full auto.
[00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:28.844]  Most shootings and crimes aren't even committed with semi-auto.
[00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:33.091]  And they are moving against the Second Amendment.
[00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:56.710]  The fact that this nation is a mix of good, hard-working, intelligent, dynamic, inventive, people full of ingenuity, but there's also a lot of spoiled, rotten, mentally ill scum hopped up on every different type of Prozac, hopped up on illegal drugs, and that's all the more reason that we should all have firearms.
[00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.272]  I mean, I have one right here
[00:08:59.815 --> 00:09:07.117]  In my studio, because some nut comes around here, I'm not gonna get down on my knees and say, please, please don't blow my brains out.
[00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:10.998]  I'm gonna defend myself, like my forefathers did.
[00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:26.541]  Now, more children die in an average year of football accidents, you can pull those numbers up, but a lot of mainstream articles written about that over the years, than die in shootings.
[00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:28.802]  Hundreds of times of people die in car wrecks.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.482]  Last time I looked in the World Almanac, it was 12 times as many people die from drowning.
[00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:36.363]  Do we ban swimming?
[00:09:36.363 --> 00:09:38.904]  Do we ban driving in automobiles?
[00:09:38.904 --> 00:09:44.726]  Do we just lock ourselves up in our houses and wear football helmets and cower in the closet?
[00:09:44.726 --> 00:09:46.847]  None of us are going to make it out of this world alive.
[00:09:46.847 --> 00:09:48.408]  That's 100%.
[00:09:48.408 --> 00:09:51.829]  Death is the great equalizer.
[00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:56.631]  Every single one of us was born into this world, and every single one of us is going to go right back into dust.
[00:09:58.206 --> 00:10:11.689]  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and I'm going to break down the psychology of these mass shootings, tell you about some of the guests we've got coming up later in the show, and I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour and 20 minutes here, so here's the phone number, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:13.130]  1-800-259-9231, and I would hope you'd want to talk about
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.804]  The CFR basically announcing world government of and by the banks yesterday on national TV with Ben Bernanke, the head of the private Federal Reserve.
[00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:34.067]  I would hope you'd want to talk about the mass shootings in Alabama and Germany.
[00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:40.772]  I would hope that you would want to talk about how they're now saying they're going to go ahead and try to pass the assault vans ban but expand it now on the heels of this.
[00:10:43.154 --> 00:10:46.615]  I would hope you bring up those issues that I think are very important, but you can talk about whatever you want.
[00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:46.835]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:46.835 --> 00:11:09.984]  By the way, yesterday I talked about maybe releasing the Obama Deception last night or today, but the uploaded versions we have were the low-res quality ones that we post for folks that have dial-up that are PrisonPlanet.tv members, and we've completed uploading all of the high-res Flash and high-res DivX and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:12.165]  We're going to have like seven different formats when we're done.
[00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:16.093]  I'm going to leave it open.
[00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:19.475]  I could pull the trigger today, I could pull it tomorrow.
[00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:25.098]  I would imagine it's not going to end up launching on Sunday at 6pm like I've been saying.
[00:11:25.098 --> 00:11:31.362]  I always launch about a day early.
[00:11:31.362 --> 00:11:42.788]  Later in the show, I may talk about why I'm launching it early, but I had to talk to counsel yesterday.
[00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:48.208]  And counsel concurred with me, but I had to check.
[00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:56.754]  And that counsel is checking with some other counsel.
[00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:58.155]  And, well, you know what?
[00:11:58.155 --> 00:12:03.318]  I'll just go ahead and tell you what's going on, then I'll get into the troops running around in Alabama at the mass shooting.
[00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:05.040]  That's right, U.S.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.103]  Army, Regular Army.
[00:12:10.103 --> 00:12:11.124]  We've had the FBI
[00:12:12.662 --> 00:12:19.444]  Calling up and calling different extensions in the office, trying to talk to employees here at the office.
[00:12:19.444 --> 00:12:27.687]  And then when I get on the phone and I call them, and it is the FBI and it's real agents, they say, we're not going to tell you what it's about, we're just asking you questions over the phone.
[00:12:27.687 --> 00:12:33.548]  And I think it's pure harassment because we're like, where is your office physically located?
[00:12:33.548 --> 00:12:35.489]  Tell us where your servers are located.
[00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:41.591]  And I'm like, hey pal, you need to send me a subpoena
[00:12:43.018 --> 00:12:45.499]  So that's where I am right now.
[00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:51.360]  It's not fun to have them calling up, and they call up when I'm on air, so I can't go to the telephone.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:00.822]  So I've had to refer them to counsel, and it's not fun talking to FBI people, and they won't tell you what it's about.
[00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:10.885]  On some fishing expedition, and there's been some snoopy questions surrounding the film, and so that's what... I mean, listen folks, Tommy Chong
[00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:16.371]  You know, movie star, top comedian.
[00:13:16.371 --> 00:13:24.235]  His son had a pipe company that sold pipes for smoking cannabis, hemp.
[00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:25.416]  And they had it totally legal.
[00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:26.977]  It's legal in all 50 states.
[00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:35.081]  There's a few cities in the country, though, where they've passed laws saying you can't sell these here.
[00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:39.904]  And so the FBI and DEA sent in three employees into their company
[00:13:40.885 --> 00:13:50.228]  And they kept catching him and firing him, trying to mail out a cannabis pipe.
[00:13:50.228 --> 00:14:01.471]  And the third person they didn't catch, and he mailed it out, and then it came out in court that the government had sent an informant in, done it, set him up, and they didn't care.
[00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:06.472]  Things are so kangaroo, so corrupt, even though he had great lawyers, he went to jail for, what was it, two and a half years.
[00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:14.955]  And he was interviewed in prison by Kevin Booth, that's in the film American Drug War we carry, that I consulted on, at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:32.512]  Then he gets out, and a separate group of filmmakers make, aka Tommy Chong, and so the FBI then raids the day before it's going to be shipped, they wait to do that, they raid and grab the films.
[00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:38.217]  Saying, well, this could be evidence of more of Tommy Chung's crimes, because he's talking about it in there.
[00:14:38.217 --> 00:14:39.877]  And then, of course, it blew up in their face.
[00:14:39.877 --> 00:14:40.958]  They got in trouble.
[00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.838]  And then, suddenly, the film got distributed worldwide.
[00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:43.778]  It wasn't going to be that big.
[00:14:43.778 --> 00:14:45.899]  And it went on Showtime and airs every week.
[00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:48.320]  And you've got the Liberty Dollars.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.981]  There's hundreds of little private mints that put out all sorts of silver and gold coins.
[00:14:53.981 --> 00:14:56.442]  It's totally legal, totally lawful.
[00:14:56.442 --> 00:15:00.342]  Any of you could start a little mint and put out copper, silver, gold coins.
[00:15:00.342 --> 00:15:01.883]  And there's literally hundreds in the U.S.
[00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:19.201]  The guy that ran the Liberty Mint with the Ron Paul Liberty Dollars, I remember seeing him on TV and infomercials when he ran the Hawaiian, they called it the Hawaii Mint, putting out commemorative coins, commemorating Ronald Reagan.
[00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:27.263]  Well, they raided them and grabbed all their computers, all their equipment, all their servers, everything, and they never did anything with it.
[00:15:27.263 --> 00:15:30.524]  It was just, we're here to ruin you, this is what we're here to do.
[00:15:32.048 --> 00:15:46.515]  And there's scores of other cases of people like Erwin Schiff writing a book exposing how the IRS collects for the private Federal Reserve and how it's all a fraud, and they told him, don't publish that book, don't sell one more copy or we're going to arrest you, and he was arrested and he's in prison right now.
[00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:54.799]  I mean, I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[00:15:58.632 --> 00:16:06.379]  Now I have some more promo videos coming out, and I have some interviews I did concerning the film, and I wanted to release it in that order.
[00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:18.730]  And if anything did happen to this office, if any criminal activity was carried out by the government against the First Amendment in this Nazi, Soviet, degenerate state we live in, all it will make the film do is blow up a million times bigger.
[00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.113]  So in a sick way, I hope they do something.
[00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.045]  But I just don't want to have to deal with it.
[00:16:25.045 --> 00:16:28.728]  And the other issue is, it is uploaded in other locations.
[00:16:28.728 --> 00:16:33.932]  It's ready to simultaneously go up on a whole bunch of YouTubes and a whole bunch of Googles.
[00:16:33.932 --> 00:16:39.236]  And because my gut has always been so accurate, it's just scary.
[00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:40.577]  And I've never been paranoid before.
[00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:43.159]  I put out a previous film and I've just been, man, I...
[00:16:44.414 --> 00:17:13.075]  feel a disturbance here i i i'm really worried and then all the sudden ring ring ring hello hello we have questions we won't say what it's about and so um... it's just mind-blowing so they're there you have what's going on and uh... they are not happy about the obama deception and different employees being called up being quizzed about this and that what are you asking about well i'm not going to tell you but
[00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:16.873]  So, this company is Alex Jones' company, and this is the address?
[00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:19.175]  This is where you are?
[00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:21.697]  Okay, well, tell me about your servers.
[00:17:21.697 --> 00:17:22.497]  Where are those?
[00:17:22.497 --> 00:17:28.502]  Give me a list of those.
[00:17:28.502 --> 00:17:42.752]  You know, questions like this, and you call the guy up, and he's like, oh, I can't tell you what it's about, Alex, but... And I'm just like, here's my lawyer, subpoena.
[00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:52.019]  So, I mean, I've got FBI fishing lines flying through the windows here at my office, basically.
[00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:53.820]  There's a dragnet over the office.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.042]  They're circling like sharks.
[00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:59.325]  And, uh, President Obama's not pleased with this film.
[00:17:59.325 --> 00:18:07.271]  I'd say 98% chance it has to do with the Obama deception.
[00:18:07.271 --> 00:18:15.538]  And, I'm not gonna sit here and, uh, lay down and take this.
[00:18:16.758 --> 00:18:20.862]  There's also things like, well, it'd be nice if you wouldn't talk about us calling you.
[00:18:20.862 --> 00:18:25.306]  We can't tell you not to, but it'd be nice if you didn't talk about it.
[00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:25.666]  You know what?
[00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:30.290]  I'm going to talk about it.
[00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.771]  I mean, what do I have to lose?
[00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:33.673]  I'm in this thing so deep, so far.
[00:18:33.673 --> 00:18:34.554]  I'm telling the truth.
[00:18:34.554 --> 00:18:35.755]  I know the government's criminal.
[00:18:35.755 --> 00:18:38.817]  The FBI works for a bunch of Bernie Madoffs to rob the country blind.
[00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:41.600]  They've got the Army standing by in case the people try to resist it.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.441]  And we're going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:51.425]  And maybe all you FBI agents think it's cute that your mommy and your daddy and your kids have no future and the country's totally shot and fried.
[00:18:51.425 --> 00:18:54.827]  Maybe that sounds fun to you, but it doesn't sound fun to me!
[00:18:54.827 --> 00:19:05.654]  And if you don't know that I'm the good guy, and that you guys have become the bad guys, you've got a serious, major malfunction!
[00:19:05.654 --> 00:19:06.815]  So there, I'm done talking about it.
[00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:08.076]  I don't want to hear any calls about it.
[00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:11.729]  I don't want Kurt Nemo or Paul Watson to write any stories about him.
[00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:13.590]  Anything happens, it's a testament, it's out there.
[00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.651]  I said it, people know.
[00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:33.285]  But let's just say this, I basically have got to sit there with a cell phone by my side, ready, with people who are staying up, paying shifts, 24 hours a day in different locations, and we all get some money up, 24 hours a day, ready to watch the film, and by one way or another, it's going out.
[00:19:33.285 --> 00:19:34.566]  Unless there's some act of God.
[00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:44.651]  It's another day in the war against the globalists and their counter-strikes against what we're doing.
[00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:49.216]  But we will continue to defend the Republic against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:52.560]  All right, I'll tell you about the troops at the Alabama shooting.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.424]  It's being reported by the Associated Press.
[00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:55.945]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:03.487]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:06.449]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[00:20:06.449 --> 00:20:08.290]  How will you feed your family?
[00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:15.635]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:23.080]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.

[00:20:30.905 --> 00:20:31.486]  I think so.

[00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:07.334]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:07.334 --> 00:22:14.342]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.907 --> 00:22:21.491]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:23.472]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:25.973]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.973 --> 00:22:37.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.221]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:40.582]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:41.084 --> 00:22:47.992]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:56.262]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:56.262 --> 00:22:57.824]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.824 --> 00:22:59.026]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:09.208]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:13.773]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:23:13.773 --> 00:23:18.458]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:19.880]  It's a documented fact.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.300]  We're good to go!
[00:23:38.795 --> 00:23:39.575]  Once a day.
[00:23:39.575 --> 00:23:43.856]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.

[00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:54.619]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:07.367]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:11.970]  I sit down with Big Brother and the National ID.
[00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.111]  Good old Jimmy Bond.
[00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:16.634]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:16.634 --> 00:24:22.419]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:24.040]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.785]  You know, this weekend it came out that Tulsa, Oklahoma is thinking about
[00:24:30.765 --> 00:24:36.787]  Making people have a license to have a garden and to have police inspections because you might grow marijuana.
[00:24:36.787 --> 00:24:41.928]  You know, the citizens are planting gardens and things as they've heard the news saying it's a good thing to do.
[00:24:41.928 --> 00:24:43.528]  Just an example of total tyranny.
[00:24:43.528 --> 00:24:45.889]  We're all just prisoners.
[00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:57.832]  And then, I was riding in this morning listening to XM Radio and I heard, I think it was AP Network News reporting in Connecticut, they've introduced a bill for the state to control the
[00:25:00.325 --> 00:25:10.288]  What's taught in the Catholic Church, and they were saying it could spread to other religions, making Christian denominations and others not criticize homosexuals.
[00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:19.831]  And wherever you are on this issue, you should be for the First Amendment and Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:25:19.831 --> 00:25:27.913]  So I forgot to tell the guys, will you guys Google Connecticut Bill Catholic Church?
[00:25:29.781 --> 00:25:48.696]  for me and I heard a lengthy report on it and I want to get to that later because it's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier and there's just so much happening from so many different angles I don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:56.463]  In Canada they've banned people reading from the Bible you know criticizing certain sexual acts and other things because it's hateful.
[00:25:57.642 --> 00:26:02.886]  See, first it's, oh, you can't question the Holocaust, and whether you agree with that or not, it's free speech.
[00:26:02.886 --> 00:26:06.909]  And then it's, oh, you can't criticize the EU, and they fire ministers for it.
[00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:11.832]  Oh, and now you can't criticize immigrants, and they're passing this all over the world.
[00:26:11.832 --> 00:26:13.734]  They're trying here in the United States.
[00:26:13.734 --> 00:26:17.256]  This is unified.
[00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:26.062]  Now, remember that they've announced that Marines are running around California and other areas running DWI.
[00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:27.834]  We're good to go.
[00:26:45.723 --> 00:26:50.287]  They have 20,000 troops on the streets of America, and they're going to be out at car wrecks with the jaws of life.
[00:26:50.287 --> 00:26:51.207]  Well, the Army's here!
[00:26:51.207 --> 00:26:53.889]  I mean, what's wrong with them with the jaws of life?
[00:26:53.889 --> 00:27:05.098]  But then you read the Army War College and the Pentagon Directive, and it says, no, we're preparing to engage the American people.
[00:27:05.098 --> 00:27:13.665]  And then there's another story today, posted up on InfoWars.com, about police
[00:27:16.363 --> 00:27:19.824]  And Washington State start liaison program with the U.S.
[00:27:19.824 --> 00:27:20.104]  Army.
[00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:24.565]  Now, this has already been going on covertly, but now they're announcing it to the slaves.
[00:27:24.565 --> 00:27:26.345]  This is out of the News Tribune.
[00:27:26.345 --> 00:27:28.566]  Washington State cops start liaison program with the U.S.
[00:27:28.566 --> 00:27:31.306]  Army.
[00:27:31.306 --> 00:27:38.388]  And the Pentagon says, North Com's lead role will be commanding the states, commanding the governors, commanding the legislatures, and the U.S.
[00:27:38.388 --> 00:27:42.189]  Congress is secondary.
[00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:46.952]  To the President, and not involved in the continuity of government.
[00:27:46.952 --> 00:27:55.298]  Well, I want to get into the terrible shooting leaving 10 dead in Alabama, 16 dead in Germany, the group of shootings.
[00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:59.962]  But right in the middle of this, hidden in plain view, Kurt Nemo's done a story about it, U.S.
[00:27:59.962 --> 00:28:03.425]  Army puts soldiers on street in Alabama in response to shootings.
[00:28:03.425 --> 00:28:10.951]  After the shooting's over, they come out in military police battle fatigues,
[00:28:13.815 --> 00:28:31.259]  And stand around with their side arms, and you go to New York, you see young punk kids, probably 18, just joined the army, they got 45s on their sides, they got M16s, they bug their eyes out at you, run up and scream at you and get in your face if you point a camera at them from 50 feet away, that's in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:33.480]  I mean, you can watch them do it to me.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.901]  I told them, back off, buddy, this is America, you don't come over here and tell me I can't stick a camera in your face from 50 feet away.
[00:28:38.901 --> 00:28:42.102]  Meanwhile, they got cameras all over the street corners watching us.
[00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.851]  So it's happening now.
[00:28:45.851 --> 00:28:49.332]  Car wrecks, DWI checkpoints, anytime there's a shooting.
[00:28:49.332 --> 00:28:53.694]  Oh, the Army's here!
[00:28:53.694 --> 00:28:59.177]  I mean, forget the fact they're getting rid of jurisdictions where police from one county come into the other, or they're being covertly federalized.
[00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:04.644]  U.S.
[00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:08.706]  Army put soldiers on the streets in Alabama in response to shootings.
[00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:10.066]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:10.066 --> 00:29:10.426]  The U.S.
[00:29:10.426 --> 00:29:17.849]  Army dispatched soldiers to patrol the streets of Sampson, Alabama, a small southern town where a rampaging gunman killed 10 people on Tuesday.
[00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:28.654]  This obvious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act prohibiting the federal uniformed services from exercising state and local law enforcement was completely ignored by the corporate media with the exception of Reuters and London Telegraph photos.
[00:29:28.654 --> 00:29:30.594]  And we have those right here.
[00:29:30.594 --> 00:29:31.295]  It's also on AP.
[00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:37.074]  Just kind of, oh, in plain view, oh look, the army's here!
[00:29:37.074 --> 00:29:39.456]  All about acclimating you, all about training.
[00:29:39.456 --> 00:29:45.961]  We'll finish up with this, get into what happened with the mass shootings, take your phone calls, straight ahead after this quick break.
[00:29:45.961 --> 00:29:50.985]  Don't forget the obamadeception.net and infowars.com.
[00:29:50.985 --> 00:29:54.908]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.908 --> 00:29:57.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.187 --> 00:30:05.709]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:05.709 --> 00:30:10.790]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.311]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[00:31:01.487 --> 00:31:06.734]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.518 --> 00:31:13.399]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.399 --> 00:31:19.881]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.881 --> 00:31:21.861]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:24.322]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.322 --> 00:31:35.224]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.506 --> 00:31:39.167]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.167 --> 00:31:41.029]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:47.953]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.953 --> 00:31:56.219]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.219 --> 00:31:57.780]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.981]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.566 --> 00:32:04.050]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:07.813]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:07.813 --> 00:32:14.140]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.244]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:32:18.764 --> 00:32:24.768]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:24.768 --> 00:32:28.190]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.854]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:32:32.854 --> 00:32:39.078]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:32:39.078 --> 00:32:44.061]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:47.964]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:32:48.524 --> 00:32:50.106]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.
[00:32:50.106 --> 00:32:50.667]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.667 --> 00:32:50.787]  877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.787 --> 00:32:51.548]  Don't wait.
[00:32:51.548 --> 00:32:51.928]  Call today.
[00:33:15.965 --> 00:33:20.429]  Last night we launched the second trailer.
[00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:23.251]  Launched the first one in late January for the Obama Deception.
[00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:28.556]  The second trailer is at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:28.556 --> 00:33:41.808]  And this morning at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, eight and a half minutes of excerpts from the film, sneak peek at the Obama Deception, was posted up on the site.
[00:33:48.331 --> 00:33:54.754]  And so I hope that all of you will get those and send it out to your email list, post on your MySpace, and spread the word.
[00:33:54.754 --> 00:33:57.955]  Because this film does not go after Obama from a left-right perspective.
[00:33:57.955 --> 00:34:04.778]  It shows how they're all controlled, what the bankers are doing, how they're setting up a new bank of the world, and how we can stop them.
[00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:12.141]  And his whole agenda of the police state, the troops on the streets, the FEMA camps, the youth brigades, the tattletale squads, the million-person security force.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:20.543]  The carbon taxes, it's all covered in 112 minutes.
[00:34:20.543 --> 00:34:27.507]  And then there is about 30 minutes of extras.
[00:34:27.507 --> 00:34:30.848]  And I'm ready to launch the Obama Deception right now.
[00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:35.031]  I'll tell you right now, I'm not going to wait until Sunday at 6 p.m.
[00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.051]  when I was going to release it.
[00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:40.153]  It'll release today or tomorrow.
[00:34:40.153 --> 00:34:43.335]  I might pull the trigger at 3 o'clock today, I might pull the trigger at 3 o'clock tomorrow.
[00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:49.181]  With the film.
[00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:54.604]  Because I'd be a fool to wait with the stuff that's going on around here.
[00:34:54.604 --> 00:34:59.988]  Because dead men tell no tales, or imprisoned men don't tell as many tales.
[00:34:59.988 --> 00:35:10.335]  Once the salvo is launched, that kind of puts the kibosh on anything the boys in black are planning.
[00:35:10.335 --> 00:35:12.517]  So.
[00:35:12.517 --> 00:35:14.058]  Be advised of that.
[00:35:15.788 --> 00:35:17.591]  Okay, I know we've got loaded phone lines here.
[00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:21.658]  We don't have a guest coming on for about an hour and a half, so we're going to have plenty of time to take your calls.
[00:35:21.658 --> 00:35:28.349]  I'm going to go to them here in a few minutes to Eric and John and Bob and Susie and Mark and
[00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:36.604]  Actually, I just pulled up Burmese's I Am From Last Night from the network in Minnesota.
[00:35:36.604 --> 00:35:37.224]  I've got to pull up.
[00:35:37.224 --> 00:35:39.966]  There's two of them named GCN now.
[00:35:39.966 --> 00:35:44.649]  Oh, Adam in Australia, Charles, Rourke, Brandon, Tony, and others.
[00:35:44.649 --> 00:35:45.089]  Okay, there we go.
[00:35:45.089 --> 00:35:49.732]  I was looking at some last night caller list.
[00:35:49.732 --> 00:35:54.676]  Burmese does the show from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time right here in the seat I now inhabit.
[00:35:54.676 --> 00:36:01.080]  I now nest in the disheveled blob, Alex Jones.
[00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:10.818]  But the mind is so alive, crackling with electricity and thoughts and ideas.
[00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:14.560]  And plans within plans.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.022]  Within plans.
[00:36:18.022 --> 00:36:20.744]  Alright, terrible news, obviously.
[00:36:20.744 --> 00:36:22.905]  You know about Alabama.
[00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:24.786]  You're hearing all the calls to disarm slaves.
[00:36:28.922 --> 00:36:33.404]  Gunman turns small Alabama town into a slaughterhouse, ABC News.
[00:36:33.404 --> 00:36:36.946]  Chief says gunman attacked with AK-47 assault rifle.
[00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:38.586]  The police are saying fully auto.
[00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:42.728]  So, there is a restricted gun, but they had it.
[00:36:42.728 --> 00:36:48.451]  He spared no one, not his mother, not his grandparents, not the children, not even the family dogs.
[00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:55.034]  Investigators following the 24-mile trail of death through southern Alabama are still trying to determine what set Michael
[00:36:56.118 --> 00:37:02.482]  Mick Linden, on a murderous shooting rampage that led to the deaths of 11 people, including himself.
[00:37:02.482 --> 00:37:06.625]  He cleaned his family out, Coffee County Coroner Robert Preacher said.
[00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:08.927]  We don't know what triggered it.
[00:37:08.927 --> 00:37:10.188]  We don't know what triggered it?
[00:37:10.188 --> 00:37:16.492]  I mean, he lived with his mother, his wife, I guess, had divorced him, and the children live somewhere else.
[00:37:16.492 --> 00:37:20.535]  And it looks like he may have lost his job from some factory.
[00:37:20.535 --> 00:37:23.397]  And he threw a fit and killed mommy.
[00:37:25.953 --> 00:37:27.053]  Then he burned down the house.
[00:37:27.053 --> 00:37:27.634]  This is what happens.
[00:37:27.634 --> 00:37:31.515]  They kill one person and then they heard it advertised in the media a million times.
[00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:37.797]  The thing to do once you've done this is not turn yourself in or not blow your own head off.
[00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:41.719]  The thing to do is run around and kill your whole family.
[00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:43.199]  Dress up like Santa Claus.
[00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:44.440]  Go to the front door.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.162]  You're mad your ex-wife left you and took the kids.
[00:37:49.162 --> 00:37:49.902]  So you kill them.
[00:37:53.035 --> 00:37:57.359]  Because we are a spoiled, wicked, degenerate culture on average.
[00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:00.061]  Not everybody.
[00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:11.951]  Now, remember the chimpanzee a few weeks ago, tearing the lady's mandible off, ripping her eyeballs out, ripping her face off, attacking police?
[00:38:11.951 --> 00:38:14.694]  The chimpanzee was on a Prozac drug.
[00:38:16.547 --> 00:38:17.307]  Forget the exact one.
[00:38:17.307 --> 00:38:17.827]  You can pull it up.
[00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:19.088]  It was all over the news.
[00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:21.648]  She had it hopped up on a psychotropic.
[00:38:21.648 --> 00:38:24.189]  Chimpanzees don't normally do that.
[00:38:24.189 --> 00:38:32.470]  In the cases that they have torn people apart, they've been drunk or they've been given cocaine in the past.
[00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.851]  But a 100-pound chimp is as strong as a 500-pound pure muscle man.
[00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:39.072]  This sucker weighed 200 pounds.
[00:38:39.072 --> 00:38:40.872]  He was a big'un.
[00:38:40.872 --> 00:38:42.493]  He had the strength of a 1,000-pound linebacker.
[00:38:47.568 --> 00:38:53.411]  They're so strong they can take one finger and just rip your nose off with it.
[00:38:53.411 --> 00:39:00.596]  I've told the stories about my... Well, he was my dad's great-uncle, so I guess what would you call him?
[00:39:00.596 --> 00:39:03.297]  My great-great-uncle?
[00:39:03.297 --> 00:39:07.680]  Uncle Houston, as he was known.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.981]  And he ran away when he was 13.
[00:39:11.414 --> 00:39:15.879]  Got on a ship, sailed around the world, came back, ran booze during the depression.
[00:39:15.879 --> 00:39:18.962]  But the point was, he would tell my dad all these stories.
[00:39:18.962 --> 00:39:23.487]  He died when I was about five, I remember talking to him.
[00:39:23.487 --> 00:39:28.312]  And he would talk about how they would, in Galveston, how they would have the chimpanzee
[00:39:30.319 --> 00:39:31.100]  Why am I telling this story?
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.520]  It's just so interesting.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.801]  How they would have a little champ.
[00:39:33.801 --> 00:39:35.622]  They got like an 80-pound one.
[00:39:35.622 --> 00:39:37.123]  Looks little, looks sweet, sitting there.
[00:39:37.123 --> 00:39:45.669]  And they'd be putting the boxing ring, and they'd have the big fairgrounds, and they'd get all these big old country boys in there, and guys that could, you know, throw a steer over no problem or whatever.
[00:39:45.669 --> 00:39:46.990]  You know, thinking they're tough.
[00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.850]  And they are tough.
[00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.091]  Watch those guys, those rodeos are tough.
[00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:50.332]  It would always be a rodeo champ.
[00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:56.075]  And it'd be some big thousand dollar cash prize, they'd build it up all week, and he's going to fight the chimp.
[00:39:56.075 --> 00:39:58.676]  They put gloves on the chimp so he couldn't tear the guy's face off.
[00:39:58.676 --> 00:40:09.138]  And he'd, you know, get some 250-pound good ol' boy, get in there, and he'd go right in, and the chimp would jump up and down and beg to not be hit, and then the guy would hit the chimp, and the chimp, in seconds, would punch him like 50 times.
[00:40:09.138 --> 00:40:18.080]  Just, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,
[00:40:19.363 --> 00:40:23.367]  Basically any wild animals in some states or chimpanzees.
[00:40:23.367 --> 00:40:25.209]  See what Prozac has done again.
[00:40:25.209 --> 00:40:33.317]  And I'm not saying it's even a good thing to own a chimp, but that's freedom folks.
[00:40:33.317 --> 00:40:37.621]  The point is you don't put chimpanzees on psychotropic drugs in the hallucinogen class.
[00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:50.940]  You know, Fedor, the Mixed Martial Arts World Champion, one in six billion as they call him.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:41:02.105]  Fedor, a 75-pound champ, would totally destroy him.
[00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:07.188]  So, I've said my point on that.
[00:41:07.188 --> 00:41:11.590]  99% of the time, I mean, I can only think of a few cases
[00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:18.564]  Where in hindsight we find out the person's been in counseling, they've been put on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug.
[00:41:18.564 --> 00:41:20.806]  And it isn't just guns you've got to ban if you want to stop this.
[00:41:20.806 --> 00:41:28.170]  You know, why not ban the Prozac, which now in its inserted bits, it causes psychopathic breaks, suicidal tendencies, violent tendencies.
[00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:32.633]  Every time I see an article where a woman drives her children off into a lake,
[00:41:33.598 --> 00:41:38.022]  That happened a decade ago or so, the first time, and women heard about it on TV, and then they copycat.
[00:41:38.022 --> 00:41:39.223]  Well, that's what I do.
[00:41:39.223 --> 00:41:43.567]  I put my three or four kids in, I strap them in, I tie them down in the car, and I drive it off.
[00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:48.652]  And in every single case, they've been on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:50.494]  Every case.
[00:41:50.494 --> 00:41:57.080]  You know, you read about women in, just in my own state, a woman in Dallas, or what was it, Farmers Branch, or a woman in Houston.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.164]  It always happens in clusters because it's on the news and they think, oh, that's what I do.
[00:42:03.164 --> 00:42:03.884]  I better do that.
[00:42:03.884 --> 00:42:10.969]  And they come in and they grab their babies and they chop their arms off with butcher knives.
[00:42:10.969 --> 00:42:13.851]  Just Google, woman kills baby with butcher knife.
[00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:15.673]  You're going to ban butcher knives?
[00:42:15.673 --> 00:42:17.834]  Actually, England is talking about doing that.
[00:42:17.834 --> 00:42:19.956]  No, it's the human mind is the problem.
[00:42:19.956 --> 00:42:20.997]  That's what's going on here.
[00:42:22.628 --> 00:42:26.769]  And all these cases, it happens all over, it's a favorite thing on one of these serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:42:26.769 --> 00:42:32.591]  I've seen stories out of Utah, stories out of Texas and everywhere, where women dance naked on roofs.
[00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:34.312]  I don't know why, that's what they do on it.
[00:42:34.312 --> 00:42:42.774]  They'll pull up at some mansion, there'll be some gorgeous, you know, middle-aged woman, naked, dancing, cutting her breast off with a butcher knife up on top of the house.
[00:42:42.774 --> 00:42:45.615]  And the cops go, we got another Prozac head, police know this.
[00:42:48.362 --> 00:42:50.363]  Because it's a hallucinogen, folks.
[00:42:50.363 --> 00:42:51.824]  Puts you in a hallucinogenic state.
[00:42:51.824 --> 00:42:54.785]  And when you have a bad trip, it's over.
[00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:56.887]  Hey, you take PCP, you take LSD.
[00:42:56.887 --> 00:42:58.968]  Might take it a hundred times if you don't have a bad trip.
[00:42:58.968 --> 00:43:04.671]  But that one time, Mike Nelson, I ought to get him in here, Derek Einkoff, they were both EMTs previously.
[00:43:05.925 --> 00:43:10.027]  Mike in San Marcos, San Antonio, and Derek down in Houston.
[00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:21.893]  And Derek had to quit because, you know, the last time he said he went to some house and there's these drug dealers and left cocaine out and the 18-month-old toddler had eaten a bunch of it and the baby was blew down on the ground and he had to quit.
[00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:26.575]  But the issue is they both went to calls with PCP heads.
[00:43:26.575 --> 00:43:32.598]  Just like a chimpanzee, the people's ears, their noses, their faces would be torn off.
[00:43:32.598 --> 00:43:34.759]  There'd be some guy on PCP out at a park
[00:43:36.658 --> 00:43:48.783]  Both cases, and somebody'd mess with them, and the PCP person, in both cases, little guys, would just tear the person's face off!
[00:43:48.783 --> 00:43:50.583]  They're on a hardcore hallucinogen!
[00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:59.467]  There have been cases where somebody's been on PCP with a gun and the police have shot them 20, 30 times before they quit attacking back.
[00:44:00.615 --> 00:44:03.036]  So, you've got the American people.
[00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:07.577]  There were over 100 million prescriptions for Prozac alone last year, 2008.
[00:44:07.577 --> 00:44:10.158]  I heard that number on Fox Radio News.
[00:44:10.158 --> 00:44:15.939]  They were announcing it proudly on KLBJ 590 a few months ago.
[00:44:15.939 --> 00:44:19.180]  100 million prescriptions.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:24.001]  And they've got all these people on it.
[00:44:24.001 --> 00:44:25.842]  Let's talk about what this is doing.
[00:44:26.974 --> 00:44:32.559]  You know, all these scores of women that have died from the HPV shot, do you hear national calls to ban it or restrict it?
[00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:33.780]  No, they say give it more!
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.981]  Make people take it!
[00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:37.242]  What about people dying of these injections?
[00:44:37.242 --> 00:44:41.306]  You talking about restricting them, or having a five-day waiting period on them, or banning them?
[00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:42.587]  Oh no, you've got to take more!
[00:44:44.127 --> 00:44:46.528]  Twenty-three homeless people are given bird flu vaccine.
[00:44:46.528 --> 00:44:47.189]  Drop dead.
[00:44:47.189 --> 00:44:48.390]  Google it.
[00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:50.531]  Ah, there's no talk of restricting that.
[00:44:50.531 --> 00:44:52.552]  No, they decide to hype up and create all this...
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:08.627]  You've got Germany, where you can own a gun, if you go through all the psychological testing, pay all these fees, and then keep your gun locked up in a shooting club.
[00:45:08.627 --> 00:45:10.389]  Did that stop this lunatic?
[00:45:10.389 --> 00:45:13.952]  I mean, Germany, even more of them are on Prozac drugs.
[00:45:13.952 --> 00:45:24.602]  I'll guarantee you, one of these two guys, if not both, it's gonna come out in a few days, when nobody's paying attention, every mall shooter, every time.
[00:45:24.602 --> 00:45:26.384]  I can't even remember anywhere it wasn't.
[00:45:28.018 --> 00:45:34.323]  He goes into school copycatting what he heard last night, and now you're going to have more copycats.
[00:45:34.323 --> 00:45:36.004]  They don't need to have MKUltra.
[00:45:36.004 --> 00:45:39.707]  You know, somebody grabbed in a government laboratory to do this, which they can do.
[00:45:39.707 --> 00:45:44.591]  That's been declassified in the 70s in church hearings and others in Congress.
[00:45:44.591 --> 00:45:46.072]  It's under Frank Church.
[00:45:46.072 --> 00:45:51.176]  No, the TV's a mind control device, the video games, the culture, the way they advertise, this is what you do.
[00:45:53.447 --> 00:45:58.028]  German school gunman kills 16 people.
[00:45:58.028 --> 00:46:02.149]  16 people have been killed by a teenage gunman who went on a rampage in southwest Germany.
[00:46:02.149 --> 00:46:16.193]  I'll bet my bottom dollar this guy was in psychiatric care and I bet my bottom dollar that it's going to be discovered that somebody gave him the gun with a connection to intelligence services.
[00:46:18.493 --> 00:46:28.179]  And we've seen this in case, after case, after case, after case, after case, after case, after case, after case.
[00:46:28.179 --> 00:46:34.943]  And Kurt Nemo's got some very suspicious articles up there dealing with the German case right now.
[00:46:34.943 --> 00:46:45.209]  16 people have been killed by a teenage gunman among the dead are himself.
[00:46:50.458 --> 00:46:51.721]  And it continues here.
[00:46:51.721 --> 00:47:00.359]  The gunman, a 17-year-old, former pupil, entered the school at about 8.30 Greenwich Mean Time, dressed in black combat gear, and opened fire at random.
[00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:03.993]  Always in the black.
[00:47:03.993 --> 00:47:07.075]  He fled in a stolen car, but was later killed in a shootout with police.
[00:47:07.075 --> 00:47:12.459]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the shooting as incomprehensible.
[00:47:12.459 --> 00:47:14.461]  Oh, is the 1,300,000 dead Iraqis?
[00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:16.963]  Are you going to whine and rub your hands together about that?
[00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:17.683]  Yes, it's horrible.
[00:47:17.683 --> 00:47:19.124]  We're sad for these dead people.
[00:47:19.124 --> 00:47:24.969]  But the point is, you've got a disarmed population.
[00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:27.751]  They've got basically a total gun ban there, and what's the call?
[00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:28.912]  More gun control.
[00:47:34.212 --> 00:47:36.974]  This is a day of mourning for the whole of Germany.
[00:47:36.974 --> 00:47:51.502]  Police said the suspect, now named as Tim Kretschumer, was killed during a shootout with officers in the town about 40 kilometers away from the school.
[00:47:51.502 --> 00:47:51.983]  And you know what?
[00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:53.824]  Every week in Germany and England and the U.S.
[00:47:53.824 --> 00:47:59.207]  I see where a crazy cop, usually on Prozac, goes out and shoots his whole family and then goes on a shooting rampage.
[00:47:59.207 --> 00:48:00.748]  They had one up in Dallas a few months ago.
[00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:05.141]  Or troops come home and do a mass shooting, and that's kept kind of quiet.
[00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:08.764]  It's like, oh, nine dead and a troop, not a big deal.
[00:48:08.764 --> 00:48:11.466]  Or, oh, five dead, killed a whole family, killed a neighbor.
[00:48:11.466 --> 00:48:12.967]  You know, it's just kind of a blur.
[00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:17.210]  But when it's not a cop or the military going crazy, you know, are we going to disarm them?
[00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.471]  They're still going to go crazy.
[00:48:18.471 --> 00:48:22.374]  No, don't disarm the police and military.
[00:48:22.374 --> 00:48:24.276]  But don't disarm the American people.
[00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:34.209]  He had fled in the car he had hijacked after the school shooting, killing a passenger as he made his escape, police said.
[00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:42.737]  Spokesman Eka Buckmiller said the shootout took place at a car showroom where two bystanders were killed and two police officers were injured.
[00:48:43.317 --> 00:48:46.118]  The suspect also died as a result of the shooting.
[00:48:46.118 --> 00:48:48.298]  Well, at least the Germans went after him.
[00:48:48.298 --> 00:48:59.762]  In the United States, at every mass shooting we've seen, for hours, like Blacksburg, they just stand down, as the Feds tell them to, and... Same thing at Columbine.
[00:48:59.762 --> 00:49:06.584]  The Germans stormed in there, and two of them got shot, but they killed him.
[00:49:06.584 --> 00:49:10.385]  Oh, boy.
[00:49:10.385 --> 00:49:10.605]  So...
[00:49:12.578 --> 00:49:24.743]  Now they come out every day, DWI checkpoints, car wrecks, oh the Army, the Marines are here, oh save us, oh they're going to be on our streets now.
[00:49:30.307 --> 00:49:34.149]  And Kurt Nemo has it posted with the Reuters photos, U.S.
[00:49:34.149 --> 00:49:50.478]  Army soldier from Fort Rucker Patrol, the downtown area of Samson, Alabama, after a shooting spree, and they're out there armed, after the shooting sprees happened, running a checkpoint of cars driving down the road, just being seen.
[00:49:50.478 --> 00:49:52.920]  Just wandering and waddling about.
[00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:10.411]  Violating federal law, in your face, they've been ordered to do this everywhere, to condition you to accept full military occupation of the United States, and Canada's announced they're going to use troops against their people, and they're going to be patrolling the streets, and that's now happening.
[00:50:10.411 --> 00:50:12.334]  And they say we're preparing to lock down cities.
[00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:18.556]  And we're preparing to defend against casualties while fighting with the Canadian people.
[00:50:18.556 --> 00:50:29.401]  And they're announcing it in England, and they're announcing it in Australia, and they're announcing it in Germany, as the bankers set all this militarization up for decades, built the camps, and now are imploding the economy by design.
[00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:32.863]  I'm gonna be on John Gibson's radio show for like five minutes, coming up next hour.
[00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:36.125]  We might simulcast it, I don't know.
[00:50:36.125 --> 00:50:38.946]  I got Gerald Cilente coming on.
[00:50:38.946 --> 00:50:39.407]  And others.
[00:50:40.726 --> 00:50:42.387]  So, uh, important broadcast lined up.
[00:50:42.387 --> 00:50:47.649]  But right now, we're gonna go to break and I'm gonna come back to your calls directly.
[00:50:47.649 --> 00:50:51.871]  So just have your questions or comments ready because I want to get to everybody quickly as possible.
[00:50:51.871 --> 00:50:53.091]  Weigh in on all the things that are happening.
[00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:54.592]  There's a lot of other key news we'll be covering today.
[00:50:54.592 --> 00:50:56.152]  It's gonna be completely jam-packed.
[00:50:56.152 --> 00:50:59.014]  By the way, pre-order the Obama Deception now at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:08.693]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest priced, highest quality, storable food for over a decade.
[00:51:08.693 --> 00:51:12.975]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds 4 to 5 people is only $39.95.
[00:51:12.975 --> 00:51:17.996]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds 4 to 5 people for under $4,000.
[00:51:17.996 --> 00:51:18.376]  That's only $99.95.
[00:51:21.817 --> 00:51:22.398]  We're good to go.
[00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:42.630]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.248 --> 00:52:14.240]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:21.406]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.406 --> 00:52:23.388]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.388 --> 00:52:25.890]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:36.859]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.452 --> 00:52:39.134]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.134 --> 00:52:40.996]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.996 --> 00:52:47.903]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:54:11.236 --> 00:54:18.337]  So I'm going to get his comment on the mass shootings and everything that's going on right now.
[00:54:18.337 --> 00:54:21.018]  Okay, Jack McClam, go ahead.
[00:54:21.018 --> 00:54:21.698]  Okay, brother.
[00:54:21.698 --> 00:54:28.299]  Hey, thank you so much, Alex, for all the good you do for all of us across America and the world.
[00:54:28.299 --> 00:54:30.940]  But I wanted to tell you over a month ago,
[00:54:32.014 --> 00:54:40.996]  We heard from military intel people here at our two police and military associations that you're going to see more mind control assassins.
[00:54:40.996 --> 00:54:45.617]  No, I know, you've actually said that here on the show, and I've seen your reports on that.
[00:54:45.617 --> 00:54:50.258]  Right, and so I just wanted to tell the people that this is what's going on.
[00:54:50.258 --> 00:54:54.999]  A month ago, we knew that Eric Holder, Communist Eric Holder,
[00:54:55.746 --> 00:55:05.830]  And totally anti-guns in the hands of the American people and Obama Nation, our phony president, he hates guns.
[00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:06.670]  He's a communist.
[00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.472]  He wants all the guns out of the hands of the people.
[00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:20.056]  And so our military intel told us that we would see more of these mind control assassins going in and shooting up their families, killing their families and killing children and killing
[00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:21.603]  Yeah.
[00:55:21.603 --> 00:55:22.924]  Masses of people.
[00:55:22.924 --> 00:55:25.185]  And that's exactly what's happening now, brother.
[00:55:25.185 --> 00:55:27.107]  So you're right on target.
[00:55:27.107 --> 00:55:46.262]  And I just wanted to tell the people that we have here at our two police and military association, that issue that explains government's five easy steps to creating a mind control assassin out of anyone, even you, you go into your psychologist or psychiatrist and they put you under hypnosis.
[00:55:46.988 --> 00:55:53.532]  The government can tell them to make you a mind control assassin, and it only takes an hour for them to put a key in your brain.
[00:55:53.532 --> 00:55:54.352]  With drugs.
[00:55:54.352 --> 00:55:55.613]  Yeah, they drug you.
[00:55:55.613 --> 00:55:56.914]  They get caught all the time.
[00:55:56.914 --> 00:56:00.816]  They get caught all the time spiking people's water with hallucinogens.
[00:56:00.816 --> 00:56:01.557]  Sure.
[00:56:01.557 --> 00:56:14.024]  And so, our Spring 2007 Aid and Abet Police Military Newsletter on Constitutional Issues is the one that they could order through us if they want to share it with their families and friends and associates.
[00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:23.076]  It's $3, and we've got a bunch of them left over from that mailing at that time.
[00:56:23.076 --> 00:56:28.941]  So, just want to let you know, Alex, let your people know out there that they can order them through us if they'd like.
[00:56:28.941 --> 00:56:30.242]  Yeah, Jack, let's just do this.
[00:56:30.242 --> 00:56:32.784]  Let me just set you up for 30 minutes or an hour later in the week.
[00:56:32.784 --> 00:56:34.625]  I'll have the producer call you, okay?
[00:56:34.625 --> 00:56:35.966]  Okay, sounds good.
[00:56:35.966 --> 00:56:36.987]  Thank you, Jack McClam.
[00:56:36.987 --> 00:56:38.509]  Alright, there he goes.
[00:56:38.509 --> 00:56:39.830]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:42.457]  Adam in Australia.
[00:56:42.457 --> 00:56:43.838]  Adam, you're on the air.
[00:56:43.838 --> 00:56:44.838]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:56:44.838 --> 00:56:45.958]  Good, sir.
[00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:47.279]  It's fantastic to be on here.
[00:56:47.279 --> 00:56:51.540]  I just wanted to say how much I respect everything you're doing, first of all, before I get started.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:58.181]  I think you've been responsible for waking up millions of people around the world, and I really respect you for that, so thank you very much.
[00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.642]  Thank you, sir.
[00:56:59.642 --> 00:57:03.763]  One thing I wanted to mention, I'm actually from an organization called Truth Movement Australia.
[00:57:03.763 --> 00:57:08.924]  I know that you have hundreds of thousands of Australians that listen to your show every day.
[00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:22.258]  And I just wanted to give a shout out to them to let them know that we do exist because I know that a lot of Australians are wondering you know where to go for meetups and my thoughts are you know with the censorship these days which with what's happening
[00:57:22.825 --> 00:57:24.826]  We've got the newspapers, the TVs.
[00:57:24.826 --> 00:57:29.787]  Yeah, we've got to organize now before they shut the web down, which they're already in the process of doing.
[00:57:29.787 --> 00:57:33.308]  And as you know, in Australia, the censorship here is getting worse and worse.
[00:57:33.308 --> 00:57:37.449]  They've announced a Chinese-style net censorship being implemented now.
[00:57:37.449 --> 00:57:40.370]  The government has announced they're shutting down free speech.
[00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:41.331]  Exactly right.
[00:57:41.331 --> 00:57:45.932]  And that's why it's so important that we start to get together with networking and meetups.
[00:57:45.932 --> 00:57:52.374]  So what we've started to do is to start bringing out bigger speakers that are well known for their truth information.
[00:57:52.785 --> 00:57:54.666]  And bring them out to Australia to start speaking.
[00:57:54.666 --> 00:57:59.269]  We've actually got David Icke speaking in Australia next month to about 1,500 people.
[00:57:59.269 --> 00:58:01.591]  We've also got Petty Joseph coming out.
[00:58:01.591 --> 00:58:07.134]  And I wanted to ask you, are you interested in coming out to speak in Australia?
[00:58:07.134 --> 00:58:09.416]  You know, I just can't do it and I appreciate your call.
[00:58:09.416 --> 00:58:11.797]  I am here producing media, doing radio shows.
[00:58:11.797 --> 00:58:13.598]  That's how we reach the maximum amount.
[00:58:13.598 --> 00:58:15.680]  That's why I don't do more speaking engagements.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.861]  We get offers every day, but thank you for the offer.
[00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:19.002]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:23.220]  We're going to start the second hour here in just minutes.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.001]  Continue with your calls.
[00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:31.144]  We may be having a special guest pop in who was in the area in Alabama during the shootings.
[00:58:31.144 --> 00:58:35.425]  I'll just leave it at that as we line that up right now.
[00:58:35.425 --> 00:58:43.189]  And we do have top trends forecaster Gerald Cilente and others coming up.
[00:58:43.189 --> 00:58:45.670]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:48.011]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.998 --> 00:58:52.679]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.679 --> 00:58:57.421]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.421 --> 00:59:00.382]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.382 --> 00:59:03.423]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.423 --> 00:59:08.145]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.385 --> 00:59:09.505]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.505 --> 00:59:12.747]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.747 --> 00:59:19.750]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:23.011]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:38.196 --> 00:59:39.556]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:39.556 --> 00:59:40.176]  Take action today.
[00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:42.157]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:56.126]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.126 --> 01:00:05.516]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.516 --> 01:00:06.837]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.599]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:10.361]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:11.963]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.963 --> 01:00:12.684]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:17.682]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:22.186]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:28.010]  We are continuing with open phones right now, responding to the mass shootings in Alabama and Germany.
[01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.392]  The calls for massive attacks on the Second Amendment.
[01:00:30.392 --> 01:00:35.396]  Germany, they're already disarmed, but they're saying even more gun control there when it's basically impossible to own a gun.
[01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:40.060]  Right now, though, let's talk to more callers here.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.381]  Let's talk to Charles in Florida.
[01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:44.602]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:00:44.602 --> 01:00:45.643]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.503]  I have a question and a comment.
[01:00:47.503 --> 01:00:55.727]  What do you think, like, substance abuse treatment, what kind of role does that play with eugenics?
[01:00:55.727 --> 01:01:04.391]  And my comment is, do you think that the feds could use, like, a way to shut down free speech?
[01:01:04.391 --> 01:01:04.991]  Is it just, like,
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.220]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:48.803]  I have to say that I disagree with the direction the movement is heading, and I believe the restoration is a cop-out because I haven't seen any state legislatures that really accept this movement yet.
[01:01:49.229 --> 01:01:57.376]  Well, maybe if everybody has a loser attitude like you, it won't happen and just, I don't see anything happening.
[01:01:57.376 --> 01:02:00.439]  There were 14 states that did pass it in the 90s.
[01:02:00.439 --> 01:02:02.261]  They are in the process of doing it.
[01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:03.322]  30 plus states have introduced it.
[01:02:03.322 --> 01:02:11.129]  The point is the idea of state sovereignty is taking place and several states are on the verge of doing it, Rourke.
[01:02:11.129 --> 01:02:12.811]  Yeah, but I don't think it can end there.
[01:02:13.746 --> 01:02:23.048]  Well, no, it certainly doesn't, but I mean, it's just one of many solutions, like calling for the indictment of Ben Bernanke and other banksters that engage in all these crimes.
[01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:24.808]  You heard Ron Paul talking about it yesterday.
[01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:28.169]  I mean, there's a lot of solutions we're pushing here.
[01:02:28.169 --> 01:02:31.269]  And you're welcome to give us your solutions, Rourke.
[01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:37.890]  Well, the way that you have set up your audience, I don't think they would be open to them.
[01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:42.331]  And I think if you do this peacefully, and you get these people who are sort of
[01:02:43.095 --> 01:02:43.635]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.457]  I was trying to figure out
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.903]  Where all this bad derivative money is going?
[01:03:13.903 --> 01:03:16.144]  Who's gaining from the bad derivative?
[01:03:16.144 --> 01:03:23.349]  The big private central bank shareholders have fenced the false derivative Ponzi money into real assets.
[01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:30.033]  Now they're just blowing out the debt end of the derivative and passing it on to the people.
[01:03:30.033 --> 01:03:31.594]  Brilliant scheme.
[01:03:31.594 --> 01:03:33.756]  Too bad it's not going to work for much longer.
[01:03:35.171 --> 01:03:45.693]  Well, that's why they want to implode the economy, as they've done in third world nations over and over again, to then cause riots so people see troops on the streets as the savior, to then set the precedent.
[01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:47.533]  It's a process.
[01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:53.854]  It looks like the stimulus bill, they're trying to rewrite, you know, the contract of being a citizen.
[01:03:53.854 --> 01:04:02.196]  They're wanting us to sign the paperwork, accept the money, and usher us into their new deal, but it's not going to work for me.
[01:04:02.196 --> 01:04:03.856]  Their new global new deal.
[01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:10.122]  We're the new global bank of the world that controls every facet of our lives.
[01:04:10.122 --> 01:04:14.105]  Well, my eyes are open, Alex, and I'm going to push this video hard.
[01:04:14.105 --> 01:04:17.447]  I've already got copies ordered and I'm ready to let everybody watch it.
[01:04:17.447 --> 01:04:18.708]  Alright, Brandon, good to hear from you.
[01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:23.151]  That's right, the Obama Deception starts shipping next Monday.
[01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:25.232]  It's going to be released on the web in the next few days.
[01:04:25.232 --> 01:04:28.194]  I'm going to leave that as a surprise.
[01:04:28.194 --> 01:04:29.976]  We're being pushed into releasing it early.
[01:04:29.976 --> 01:04:31.497]  There's a lot of things that are going on.
[01:04:33.396 --> 01:04:35.818]  And so we're going to be covering that more today.
[01:04:35.818 --> 01:04:40.601]  The new final trailer for The Obama Deception is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:40.601 --> 01:04:49.808]  And also an eight-and-a-half-minute sneak peek from some of the sections of the nearly two-hour film is also up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:49.808 --> 01:04:53.551]  Please spread the trailers and the sneak peek out to everybody on your email list.
[01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:54.751]  That's how this goes viral.
[01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:55.192]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.235 --> 01:05:06.139]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:13.585]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:05:13.585 --> 01:05:15.206]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:05:15.206 --> 01:05:19.369]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:05:19.369 --> 01:05:23.192]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:05:23.192 --> 01:05:27.675]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:30.958]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared
[01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:31.218]  We're good.
[01:06:01.681 --> 01:06:07.511]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:14.524]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:21.663]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.663 --> 01:06:23.623]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.623 --> 01:06:26.145]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:26.145 --> 01:06:37.109]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.711 --> 01:06:39.372]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.372 --> 01:06:41.233]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.233 --> 01:06:48.157]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:48.157 --> 01:06:56.401]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.401 --> 01:06:57.982]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.982 --> 01:07:05.346]  The people strike back.
[01:07:05.346 --> 01:07:06.507]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:11.840]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:17.845]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[01:07:17.845 --> 01:07:20.706]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[01:07:20.706 --> 01:07:23.669]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:28.232]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[01:07:28.232 --> 01:07:29.272]  Not.
[01:07:29.272 --> 01:07:29.933]  Get the tea.
[01:07:30.586 --> 01:07:34.047]  Change your body and life from unhealthy to healthy.

[01:07:42.189 --> 01:07:42.990]  Life Change Tea.
[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.390]  The tea that changes how you feel.
[01:08:02.128 --> 01:08:08.589]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:18.391]  More coverage on the mass shooting in Alabama, killing 10 people and the 16 dead in Germany at a school shooting.
[01:08:18.391 --> 01:08:26.173]  Coming up, Trends Forecaster Gerald Cilente, as well as coming up, as society unravels, as the brainwashed, violent,
[01:08:27.697 --> 01:08:32.401]  Violence drunk population that watches all these simulated murders and plays all these violent video games.
[01:08:32.401 --> 01:08:39.988]  All the studies show it increases it as the tens of millions of Prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitor heads gobble these psychotropics.
[01:08:39.988 --> 01:08:43.691]  You're only going to have more and more of this as this society implodes.
[01:08:43.691 --> 01:08:45.153]  Crime is already exploding.
[01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:46.634]  Mexico is collapsing.
[01:08:46.634 --> 01:08:50.878]  They have total gun bans down there for the citizens, but it's just machine gun death every day.
[01:08:50.878 --> 01:08:54.241]  Hand grenades, rocket attacks, dead everywhere, police dead everywhere.
[01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:58.820]  Germany, total gun ban, of course, mass shooting.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.701]  Calls for massive restrictions on the Second Amendment.
[01:09:01.701 --> 01:09:03.421]  Brandon in Indiana.
[01:09:03.421 --> 01:09:04.381]  We just talked to Brandon.
[01:09:04.381 --> 01:09:05.642]  Tony in Illinois.
[01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:06.202]  You're on the air.
[01:09:06.202 --> 01:09:07.422]  Go ahead.
[01:09:07.422 --> 01:09:09.062]  Hey, how you doing today, Alex?
[01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.263]  Good, sir.
[01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:23.266]  Hey, uh, as, uh, you know, the Alabama stuff, it's funny that you have that popping off right after the, you know, suicide bombings in Baghdad and the stuff.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.344]  All these things are happening to sell the other policies.
[01:09:28.344 --> 01:09:43.379]  And then you have a drill going on of terrorists trying to attack a base, and then suddenly six people at the base get shot, two get killed, and the supposed IRA walks up in front of the guards who have weapons that don't fire back and shoots them.
[01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.142]  Then you have an execution-style killing in Northern Ireland.
[01:09:46.943 --> 01:10:04.633]  of a police officer, the next day you have the staged shooting of cricket team, and then even mainstream news says it may be an inside job, because right in front of police the shooters just walk slowly, the police stand down, don't even aim their guns at them when they're 20 feet away, walking by police trucks and vans full of police.
[01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.494]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:09.956]  Yeah, it's like somebody flips a switch and all of this starts.
[01:10:10.828 --> 01:10:16.930]  Oh yeah, and I actually had to leave Chicago for about a month.
[01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:19.810]  I come down, I'm in southeast Missouri, south St.
[01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:29.973]  Louis in the country with my mom, and she gets a lot of magazines, and the magazines too are pure programming, selling up to Newsweek.
[01:10:29.973 --> 01:10:37.615]  I haven't been able to get on InfoWars, but did you see the Newsweek confidence game with Obama on the cover?
[01:10:38.174 --> 01:10:44.618]  And then you open it up and it says on the inside, Barack Obama, Confidence Man.
[01:10:44.618 --> 01:10:46.620]  I'd like to choke on my coffee.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:11:06.193]  Yeah, they know the public is so ignorant that that open insult to everyone, just, you know, that, oh, it's a double meaning, he's a scam artist, con artist, is what Confidence Man says, but they're saying, oh no, now a Confidence Man is good, you've got to buy into the delusion, and then everything's going to be alright.
[01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:07.647]  Absolutely.
[01:11:07.647 --> 01:11:17.170]  I mean, the whole article is just, it's not about, you know, Obama's going to fix anything because, of course, the Lord is not, the Lord Obama's not there to fix anything.
[01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:20.270]  He's just there to be our Lord, of course.
[01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:28.372]  And, uh, you know, he's got his doubt, but, you know, he'll make us feel better as the country collapses around us.
[01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:34.854]  You know, we'll have his, you know, we'll be there to get the fashion tips from his wife and buy dolls of his children.
[01:11:36.807 --> 01:11:39.990]  You know, down here in the country, they're bought and sold on it, too.
[01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:49.017]  I talked to people that I expected to be, you know, completely, you know, under, you know, no kidding when I tell them what's going on.
[01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:52.420]  They're all like, well, you know, he ain't gonna take our guns.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.742]  I'm like, he's got like 10 or 11 bills on the floor right now.
[01:11:55.742 --> 01:11:56.263]  What?
[01:11:56.263 --> 01:11:58.364]  Well... I hear you, brother.
[01:11:58.364 --> 01:12:01.247]  They are under a spell, but a lot of people are breaking the spell.
[01:12:01.247 --> 01:12:02.608]  Thanks for the call.
[01:12:02.608 --> 01:12:03.449]  Good to hear from you, Tony.
[01:12:09.232 --> 01:12:35.212]  Look, I'm at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and I'm reading on the site what people are posting, some of them in the comments under the new trailer and the sneak peek that are up there, and it's like, oh, you evil racist, oh, you just hate Obama, you right-wing fascist, or your film is all lies, all propaganda, and they haven't even seen the film yet.
[01:12:36.926 --> 01:12:42.630]  And then I see on other news articles and message board people saying, alright, all politicians lie.
[01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:44.152]  He did lie about ending NAFTA and GATT.
[01:12:44.152 --> 01:12:46.273]  He did lie about taking the troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:12:46.273 --> 01:12:48.675]  And he did lie about not hiring lobbyists.
[01:12:48.675 --> 01:12:52.378]  And he did lie about ending the warrantless wiretapping.
[01:12:52.378 --> 01:12:54.420]  But you know, that's just what politicians do.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.481]  Well then I guess politicians just let Bernie Madoff steal you blind and take your pension funds.
[01:12:59.481 --> 01:13:02.362]  I guess politicians, you know, just put troops on the streets.
[01:13:02.362 --> 01:13:14.165]  I guess you just acquiesce and capitulate and surrender and roll over, yellow belly up, and then ask the New World Order to rub your little yellow belly.
[01:13:14.165 --> 01:13:19.506]  Like your little doggie.
[01:13:19.506 --> 01:13:21.407]  I mean, the New World Order is not going to rub your yellow belly.
[01:13:23.038 --> 01:13:34.507]  And, look, it was 5% of the people that started and won the Revolutionary War here, and it's, we have more than 5%.
[01:13:34.507 --> 01:13:35.888]  We have a lot more than that.
[01:13:35.888 --> 01:13:39.490]  In every major poll, you know, 90 plus percent want to control the border.
[01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:44.994]  87% want to end the wars.
[01:13:44.994 --> 01:13:48.337]  Upwards 87% don't want any more gun control and want to repeal gun control laws.
[01:13:50.666 --> 01:13:59.028]  Congress still has a 9% approval rating, and Obama's approval rating that was up at 87% is dropping upwards of 20 points.
[01:13:59.028 --> 01:14:06.550]  So, the public isn't as ignorant as some people put on.
[01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:12.631]  You know, when you talk to family, they kind of want to act cool and act like they're not going to be bossed around by you or, you know, you're showing off to them.
[01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:23.418]  But you notice, at the stores, the guns are bare, the ammo's bare, they're trying to make as many guns and produce as much ammo as they can, and they can't keep up.
[01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:29.983]  So somebody out there's listening, somebody knows we're in trouble, somebody knows they're coming after the Second Amendment.
[01:14:29.983 --> 01:14:33.646]  It was 44% over the previous record of gun sales, it's over 120%.
[01:14:33.646 --> 01:14:34.447]  Last numbers I saw from the FBI,
[01:14:38.396 --> 01:14:46.262]  120% above any previous record in gun sales, and it's only growing.
[01:14:46.262 --> 01:14:59.672]  And they're not going to be able to get our guns, ladies and gentlemen, and because there are a bunch of Prozac heads running around, and a bunch of lunatics, and a bunch of psychos with guns, more... all the more reason we need our firearms, just like the police!
[01:14:59.672 --> 01:15:03.155]  If they got criminals shooting at them, they need guns, and more guns!
[01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:06.911]  The answer is more guns.
[01:15:06.911 --> 01:15:13.037]  We are a violent, degenerate society, overrun by criminals.
[01:15:13.037 --> 01:15:16.360]  If you take the guns away, only the law-abiding will be disarmed.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.742]  It's a very simple equation.
[01:15:18.742 --> 01:15:22.946]  Chicago's got four times the national average of crime and shootings.
[01:15:22.946 --> 01:15:25.529]  Almost a complete gun ban.
[01:15:25.529 --> 01:15:26.830]  New York, complete gun ban.
[01:15:28.697 --> 01:15:33.940]  They hand out a few hundred permits a year, and you get like a $30,000 political contribution, big scandals there.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.964]  And for you to get a permit, turns it right into a privilege.
[01:15:38.964 --> 01:15:49.750]  The police and military are finding out now there's plans to actually disarm most of them, and only have paramilitary, larger SWAT team forces merge with the military, and that's in the mainstream news today.
[01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:58.236]  They're coming after everybody's guns, except for Praetorian Guard, highly armed paramilitary police, that'll be bivouacked in every city.
[01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:04.890]  And I tell those paramilitary police, you're working for the New World Order.
[01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:10.914]  And you know you're violating posse comitatus, and you know you're conditioning the public for acclamation.
[01:16:10.914 --> 01:16:14.077]  So the people can be occupied.
[01:16:14.077 --> 01:16:18.520]  An occupied nation by military force.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:25.606]  So we're here, ladies and gentlemen, defending the Republic, getting the word out, defending the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[01:16:25.606 --> 01:16:26.967]  Anthony and Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:16:29.996 --> 01:16:31.236]  Go ahead Alex.
[01:16:31.236 --> 01:16:31.917]  How you doing?
[01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:32.877]  Good.
[01:16:32.877 --> 01:16:39.722]  First of all I want to say thanks for bringing up these subjects because they are vitally important to youth in our country because I know a lot of people are struggling.
[01:16:39.722 --> 01:16:47.287]  You know they're on these Prozac pills and serotonin reuptake inhibitors and so they battle with these kind of issues every day and nobody really talks about it.
[01:16:47.287 --> 01:16:51.329]  So that's one major point that I want to bring up about the shootings.
[01:16:51.329 --> 01:16:52.970]  I mean it's tragic.
[01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:56.913]  I was wondering, I heard you a couple of weeks ago talking about Columbine.
[01:16:57.495 --> 01:17:02.577]  You said that there was federal involvement in that, and you said as far as they might have been inside the schools.
[01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:04.278]  And you know, that was way before I woke up.
[01:17:04.278 --> 01:17:04.838]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:04.838 --> 01:17:11.941]  I'm not, I'm not tooting my horn, but if you go back two, three weeks ago on show after show, I said, I feel it in my gut.
[01:17:11.941 --> 01:17:15.942]  They're going to start mass shootings at schools all over the country.
[01:17:15.942 --> 01:17:16.683]  I know their M.O.
[01:17:16.683 --> 01:17:19.824]  You know, when you say gut, that's hundreds of pieces of data.
[01:17:19.824 --> 01:17:24.166]  You can really thousands over the years, and then you can make the prime projection.
[01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:24.586]  And, um,
[01:17:26.246 --> 01:17:26.987]  Time will tell.
[01:17:42.259 --> 01:17:46.661]  British intelligence actually founded and ran the violent IRA groups.
[01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:50.643]  Then, boom, it came out just as the fingerprint was there.
[01:17:50.643 --> 01:17:51.443]  The fingerprint.
[01:17:51.443 --> 01:17:52.483]  We lifted the prints.
[01:17:52.483 --> 01:17:54.624]  We said, okay, this is who normally does this.
[01:17:54.624 --> 01:17:56.165]  Let's see if we see their signature.
[01:17:56.165 --> 01:17:57.526]  Their prints.
[01:17:57.526 --> 01:17:58.646]  Their wavelength.
[01:17:58.646 --> 01:17:59.106]  Boom.
[01:17:59.106 --> 01:18:00.707]  It's there.
[01:18:00.707 --> 01:18:02.228]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[01:18:02.228 --> 01:18:03.748]  It's too soon to tell.
[01:18:03.748 --> 01:18:07.690]  The Germany thing looks like a staged event.
[01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:09.331]  The Alabama situation
[01:18:11.007 --> 01:18:18.169]  There are real punks who throw fits and are unstable and kill, you know, one member of the family and they go on a rampage.
[01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:19.109]  That's the MO.
[01:18:19.109 --> 01:18:20.629]  That can happen on its own.
[01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:22.810]  It does happen on its own.
[01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:25.591]  Because people don't have impulse control.
[01:18:25.591 --> 01:18:31.012]  They don't know how to just... They don't know how when their wife gets in their face or slaps them to just go get in their car and leave.
[01:18:31.012 --> 01:18:38.514]  They don't know how to... I mean, they don't... But because there's these unstable people, that's why we need our Second Amendment to defend ourselves.
[01:18:39.471 --> 01:18:39.871]  Right.
[01:18:39.871 --> 01:18:51.633]  I mean, um, specifically on Columbine, because I remember you mentioned that and you said something about, uh, feds or, or agents being in private school, maybe even involved in the shooting and all the pipe bombs weren't manufactured by the two students.
[01:18:51.633 --> 01:18:52.094]  There were 100.
[01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:52.434]  Go ahead.
[01:18:52.434 --> 01:18:53.354]  Yeah.
[01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:58.975]  I was wondering if you would, uh, go back into that for people that really don't have all the details.
[01:18:58.975 --> 01:19:01.676]  Cause that was of course never in any kind of mainstream media.
[01:19:01.676 --> 01:19:03.836]  And also, do you think these shootings today,
[01:19:04.392 --> 01:19:09.982]  Or maybe back then, or any of these mass shootings could be related to the government program MKUltra.
[01:19:09.982 --> 01:19:11.304]  Maybe that ties into it.
[01:19:11.304 --> 01:19:12.767]  I'm wondering your opinion on that.
[01:19:12.767 --> 01:19:13.748]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:15.253 --> 01:19:21.075]  I was sitting at Charlie Sheen's house about two and a half years ago, and I'm saying, you know Columbine Stage, and he's like, well I've heard that, but what's the evidence?
[01:19:21.075 --> 01:19:30.419]  And I sat down at his computer in his kitchen, and I, back then I can remember the exact number, I think it was 128 pipe bombs, and I googled it, and there was CBS News, and he was like, whoa!
[01:19:30.419 --> 01:19:40.123]  120 plus, I don't remember the exact number now, I think 128, pipe bombs were smuggled in the night before and the day before, the school was more than half empty, the police chief and the
[01:19:41.883 --> 01:19:46.387]  And the principal were at a Subway Sandwich when it all happened.
[01:19:46.387 --> 01:19:48.389]  Most of the teachers were gone.
[01:19:48.389 --> 01:19:51.851]  Harris and Kleibold's parents were both in black ops and under psychiatric care.
[01:19:51.851 --> 01:19:54.394]  I'm on Prozac and Ritalin.
[01:19:54.394 --> 01:19:58.137]  And the police stood down once it happened and the students reported other shooters inside.
[01:19:58.137 --> 01:19:59.258]  The list goes on and on, sir.
[01:20:02.057 --> 01:20:08.240]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:14.643]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:20.386]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:20:20.386 --> 01:20:22.827]  Starve or surrender.
[01:20:22.827 --> 01:20:27.149]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:28.050]  What then?
[01:20:30.763 --> 01:20:33.845]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.

[01:21:01.078 --> 01:21:01.859]  Gold.
[01:21:01.859 --> 01:21:03.400]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:09.666]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.666 --> 01:21:13.850]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:15.792]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:15.972]  Mint,
[01:21:16.332 --> 01:21:18.213]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:18.213 --> 01:21:26.297]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:21:39.704 --> 01:21:44.125]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.191 --> 01:22:13.073]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.073 --> 01:22:19.555]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.555 --> 01:22:21.536]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.996]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:23.996 --> 01:22:34.880]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.176 --> 01:22:38.837]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.837 --> 01:22:40.698]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.698 --> 01:22:47.622]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:55.886 --> 01:22:57.447]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.447 --> 01:22:58.648]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.603 --> 01:23:02.584]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:23:02.584 --> 01:23:09.547]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:23:09.547 --> 01:23:17.951]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:23.674]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:23:23.854 --> 01:23:25.695]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:23:25.695 --> 01:23:27.877]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:32.420]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.642]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:42.468]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:23:42.688 --> 01:23:44.808]  Okay, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[01:23:44.808 --> 01:23:46.729]  We're waiting on a guest from Alabama.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.621]  We're able to get him on.
[01:24:12.621 --> 01:24:16.147]  It's going to be very informative.
[01:24:16.147 --> 01:24:19.032]  Gerald Cilente and others are coming up.
[01:24:19.032 --> 01:24:20.394]  Just to finish up on Columbine.
[01:24:21.852 --> 01:24:29.417]  How did they get 120 plus, some of them weighing over 100 pounds, giant propane tanks into the school?
[01:24:29.417 --> 01:24:32.680]  Why were most of the teachers gone?
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.282]  Why did all of this happen?
[01:24:36.282 --> 01:24:37.743]  And then it just goes on and on.
[01:24:37.743 --> 01:24:41.666]  And then the Rocky Mountain News, Denver Post reported the SWAT team actually shot three of the students.
[01:24:41.666 --> 01:24:42.947]  I have those mainstream news articles.
[01:24:44.369 --> 01:24:45.830]  It goes on and on.
[01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:47.810]  They reported four shooters inside.
[01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:50.071]  They wouldn't release most of the surveillance camera footage.
[01:24:50.071 --> 01:24:51.352]  They only released a few seconds.
[01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.733]  The school was all wired up.
[01:24:52.733 --> 01:24:55.694]  The school was the first school to have death education.
[01:24:55.694 --> 01:24:56.634]  You can't make this up.
[01:24:56.634 --> 01:25:04.357]  2020 News reported on it, ABC, in 1991, years before the 99 shooting on Adolf Hitler's birthday, April 20th.
[01:25:09.755 --> 01:25:19.688]  Well, it's just mind-blowing that they would have the children get in coffins and simulate dying, and even one child got suffocated at the school and did die.
[01:25:19.688 --> 01:25:26.157]  And see, when they do death education, suicide education, that causes more suicide because they teach them how to commit suicide and say, don't do this.
[01:25:26.778 --> 01:25:27.978]  And all the statistics show that.
[01:25:27.978 --> 01:25:29.879]  I mean, that was a mind control school.
[01:25:29.879 --> 01:25:31.600]  And the evidence just goes on and on from there.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.200]  But, uh, yeah.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.041]  They got 128, I believe, going from memory.
[01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:37.322]  Didn't have time to Google it during the break.
[01:25:37.322 --> 01:25:39.163]  Uh, bombs into the building.
[01:25:39.163 --> 01:25:41.043]  They supposedly did this.
[01:25:41.043 --> 01:25:45.005]  And then, uh, things didn't go as planned, though.
[01:25:45.005 --> 01:25:47.866]  And thank God it was only 15 people, 16 people that died.
[01:25:47.866 --> 01:25:50.487]  But they sure hyped that in the media, didn't they, for total gun control.
[01:25:50.487 --> 01:25:51.667]  But they failed.
[01:25:51.667 --> 01:25:55.649]  Uh, let's go, and they'll fail as well, because the word is out now about what's really going on here.
[01:25:56.601 --> 01:26:04.487]  Whether this was deliberate mind control or not, or whether they were Prozac heads or not, people know they need guns to defend themselves from these type of lunatics.
[01:26:04.487 --> 01:26:07.190]  Andy, in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:08.371]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:26:08.371 --> 01:26:18.899]  I just wanted to know if you'd heard about the explosions in Bozeman, Montana, and Whitehall, Montana, where two American legions were blowing up?
[01:26:18.899 --> 01:26:19.600]  When did this happen?
[01:26:20.182 --> 01:26:25.266]  This happened last week and it's barely been in our news and it hasn't made news at all.
[01:26:25.266 --> 01:26:31.652]  I know there have been bombings of different corporate offices and banks and police have been killed and what was it in Washington State?
[01:26:31.652 --> 01:26:37.677]  I know there's all sorts of weird bombings going on that no one is covering and generally, generally
[01:26:38.669 --> 01:26:42.110]  That means it's a real terrorist attack.
[01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:49.614]  See, the MO is, during the 70s and 60s and 70s, there were hundreds and hundreds of bombings that killed scores of people and wounded scores more.
[01:26:49.614 --> 01:26:54.576]  And because it was real terrorism, you don't give real terrorism, if you're the government, attention.
[01:26:55.492 --> 01:26:58.373]  You only give your staged events attention.
[01:26:58.373 --> 01:27:02.654]  And so, no, I was not aware of the veterans.
[01:27:02.654 --> 01:27:06.675]  They also brought in the National Guard right away within a couple hours of that.
[01:27:06.675 --> 01:27:09.036]  Yeah, that's their way.
[01:27:09.036 --> 01:27:18.158]  They first got their nose under the tent flap was to have the EOD ordinance disposal, and then behind that comes the general policing of the military.
[01:27:18.158 --> 01:27:20.859]  But, no, I will Google that.
[01:27:20.859 --> 01:27:21.719]  Again, where were the bombings?
[01:27:22.481 --> 01:27:25.902]  Whitehall, Montana and Bozeman, Montana.
[01:27:25.902 --> 01:27:27.523]  Main businesses downtown.
[01:27:27.523 --> 01:27:31.104]  Guys, Google for me bombings in Montana, please.
[01:27:31.104 --> 01:27:31.624]  And print that.
[01:27:31.624 --> 01:27:33.305]  See, we're not omnipresent.
[01:27:33.305 --> 01:27:34.805]  People always ask, why aren't you reporting on this?
[01:27:34.805 --> 01:27:35.986]  Because we didn't know.
[01:27:35.986 --> 01:27:37.546]  Thank you for telling us.
[01:27:37.546 --> 01:27:38.747]  We will pull that up right now.
[01:27:38.747 --> 01:27:40.307]  Anything else, sir?
[01:27:40.307 --> 01:27:40.888]  That's about it.
[01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:44.709]  I just wanted to also mention that there's major chemtrail spraying going on here.
[01:27:45.519 --> 01:27:50.620]  And there's just lots of things to look out for, so just wanted to report on those explosions.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.340]  It is certainly interesting times.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.540]  Thank you, Andy.
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.881]  Steve in North Carolina.
[01:27:54.881 --> 01:27:56.821]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:27:56.821 --> 01:27:57.601]  Hello, Alex.
[01:27:57.601 --> 01:28:03.542]  Steve here, and I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina, also with AUnetwork.tv.
[01:28:03.542 --> 01:28:05.782]  God bless you for what you're doing there, brother.
[01:28:05.782 --> 01:28:07.223]  We're with you 100 percent.
[01:28:07.223 --> 01:28:08.743]  I'm with Fred Smart and B.D.
[01:28:08.743 --> 01:28:09.523]  Farrell.
[01:28:09.523 --> 01:28:14.564]  We're getting ready to start our 92nd week since we were the Ron Paul National Meetup call.
[01:28:15.094 --> 01:28:22.858]  And I'm hoping, I know you're busy because you've got the movie coming out, but we'd like to invite one of your associate producers to come on with us this coming Thursday night.
[01:28:22.858 --> 01:28:27.500]  We'd like to run an ad for your commercial for the new Obama Deception coming out.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:36.845]  We definitely support that, and I want to tell your listeners, people, order this on Infowarps.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:36.845 --> 01:28:41.007]  If you get it and it sits on your shelf, it's not helping to get the word out.
[01:28:41.007 --> 01:28:44.029]  Please, for God's sakes, order this movie from Alex.
[01:28:44.537 --> 01:28:47.679]  Get it in your hands, duplicate it and get it to your neighbor.
[01:28:47.679 --> 01:28:48.580]  It's so important.
[01:29:02.668 --> 01:29:04.970]  It'd be 8 o'clock central.
[01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:06.411]  It's aunetwork.tv.
[01:29:06.411 --> 01:29:08.352]  You're saying you have a radio show?
[01:29:08.352 --> 01:29:10.814]  Well, we'll do this, sir.
[01:29:10.814 --> 01:29:17.819]  Just email robd at infowars.com, and we'll try to get somebody on the show for you.
[01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:20.902]  robd at infowars.com.
[01:29:20.902 --> 01:29:24.945]  Okay, I appreciate your call, sir, and the work that you're doing.
[01:29:24.945 --> 01:29:31.630]  Yes, explosions collapsed three buildings in Bozeman, Montana, and here is a news story.
[01:29:33.274 --> 01:29:37.135]  Out of the local newspaper.
[01:29:37.135 --> 01:29:42.457]  So what the caller said is being confirmed right now by us on that.
[01:29:42.457 --> 01:29:45.378]  This happened last week and we didn't know anything about it.
[01:29:45.378 --> 01:29:45.999]  Stay with us.
[01:29:45.999 --> 01:29:51.821]  Important news segment coming up from Alabama.
[01:29:51.821 --> 01:29:53.221]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:55.762]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.762 --> 01:29:58.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.414 --> 01:30:11.977]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:30:11.977 --> 01:30:13.397]  Garden in a can!
[01:30:13.397 --> 01:30:17.538]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:19.558]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[01:30:19.558 --> 01:30:21.839]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:30:22.319 --> 01:30:32.010]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:33.431]  Garden in a can.
[01:30:33.431 --> 01:30:34.633]  It's that simple.
[01:30:34.633 --> 01:30:35.333]  Fresh.
[01:30:35.333 --> 01:30:36.194]  Healthy.
[01:30:36.194 --> 01:30:37.035]  Easy.

[01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:55.312]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:14.332]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.332 --> 01:31:20.914]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:20.914 --> 01:31:22.894]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:25.395]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.395 --> 01:31:36.338]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:36.974 --> 01:31:38.635]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:38.635 --> 01:31:40.496]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:47.418]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:47.418 --> 01:31:55.662]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:55.662 --> 01:31:57.242]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.242 --> 01:31:58.443]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.277 --> 01:32:03.980]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:09.704]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:32:09.704 --> 01:32:14.047]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:32:14.047 --> 01:32:16.509]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:32:16.509 --> 01:32:27.637]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.

[01:32:53.374 --> 01:32:54.074]  Free shipping included.
[01:33:14.833 --> 01:33:16.496]  Well, it's just terrible.
[01:33:16.496 --> 01:33:18.700]  Ten people dead, including the shooter in Alabama.
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:22.907]  Sixteen dead in Germany with some lunatic that went into a school.
[01:33:25.487 --> 01:33:28.308]  I haven't heard the Army interviewed on this.
[01:33:28.308 --> 01:33:37.010]  We saw it in Reuters and a few other newspapers that they were there after the shooting providing security, and so we thought, why not get the regular U.S.
[01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:43.252]  Army on from Fort Rucker, and we have Lieutenant Colonel Scott Weil on with us.
[01:33:43.252 --> 01:33:46.673]  Colonel, I know you're very busy and I appreciate you giving us the time.
[01:33:46.673 --> 01:33:47.153]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:47.153 --> 01:33:47.613]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:47.613 --> 01:33:49.494]  Thank you very much for calling us.
[01:33:49.494 --> 01:33:54.515]  Please, I mean, from your perspective, what happened and what did the Army do?
[01:33:55.492 --> 01:33:57.373]  Well, the incident was very tragic.
[01:33:57.373 --> 01:34:05.780]  The incident took place and all of the local law enforcement from the state of Alabama responded.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.561]  It happened in several different cities.
[01:34:07.561 --> 01:34:14.026]  It was a very ugly situation and it was going to be a long, drawn-out situation.
[01:34:14.026 --> 01:34:21.151]  So here in southern Alabama, we have mutual aid agreements with all of our local surrounding communities where they support us when we need help.
[01:34:21.151 --> 01:34:21.812]  We support them.
[01:34:22.665 --> 01:34:27.227]  Several natural disasters in the past, such as a hurricane and a tornado.
[01:34:27.227 --> 01:34:30.348]  And we support each other in times of need.
[01:34:30.348 --> 01:34:38.111]  So when this happened, we called down to one of the local police departments and offered our assistance.
[01:34:38.111 --> 01:34:42.173]  And when they said, absolutely, we could use some military police.
[01:34:42.173 --> 01:34:48.135]  So we went down and all we did was provide a support role, where we took 20 MPs down there.
[01:34:49.847 --> 01:35:07.899]  The local law enforcement and the state law enforcement were establishing a cordon and taking care of the area, so we just provided support, went in, and allowed the state and local law enforcement folks to go and take a knee and drink water, go and get some food, just rest for a little while.
[01:35:07.899 --> 01:35:13.142]  We took their post for them, and then when they came back, we moved on to other places to see where we could assist.
[01:35:14.907 --> 01:35:28.856]  So the army contacted the police departments, was this while the hour-long rampage was going on, over 20 plus miles, or did you contact them after he'd already killed himself?
[01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.176]  Yes sir, it was after.
[01:35:30.176 --> 01:35:44.145]  After the event, when we realized that this was going to be a major undertaking, then what I did was I called and offered my assistance, and the police chief took me up on it, and we called in the soldiers,
[01:35:44.997 --> 01:35:47.518]  Drove down there.
[01:35:47.518 --> 01:35:50.159]  Perhaps you can shed some more light, because we're getting conflicting stories.
[01:35:50.159 --> 01:35:55.262]  One sheriff's deputy is reporting he had a fully automatic AK-47, or was it semi-automatic, or do you know?
[01:35:55.262 --> 01:35:56.563]  No, sir, I don't have any idea.
[01:35:56.563 --> 01:36:03.246]  I didn't get involved in any part of the investigation, or the active, you know, part of the law enforcement piece.
[01:36:03.246 --> 01:36:11.790]  All we provided was just, you know, some security at some posts, and, you know, we provided relief forces for the guys that were working it.
[01:36:12.196 --> 01:36:18.079]  Well, being there in Alabama, you probably have a clearer picture of this than having your people on the ground than we do.
[01:36:18.079 --> 01:36:22.662]  I mean, just boiling it down, what happened?
[01:36:22.662 --> 01:36:27.745]  Yeah, sir, I'll tell you, what you're hearing in the news is the same thing that we heard.
[01:36:27.745 --> 01:36:31.367]  I didn't get involved in any part of the investigation.
[01:36:31.367 --> 01:36:39.271]  You know, the true heroes were the local and state law enforcement from Alabama, and all we did was just go down there and
[01:36:40.271 --> 01:36:51.604]  And in the exterior part of the corridor, we just relieve the guys that were blocking traffic and protecting the area.
[01:36:51.604 --> 01:36:56.330]  Now, when you talk about mutual agreements with the county,
[01:36:57.839 --> 01:37:06.465]  Previously, you know, we hear about hurricanes or earthquakes or things like that and, you know, certainly with the National Guard and things.
[01:37:06.465 --> 01:37:13.129]  But under posse comitatus, I mean, that's still in forces, isn't it, to have the military out involved in law enforcement?
[01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.589]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:13.589 --> 01:37:17.932]  And we don't provide any kind of law enforcement role off of the installation.
[01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:21.134]  We didn't go down there in a law enforcement role.
[01:37:21.134 --> 01:37:23.336]  What we did was we went down and just
[01:37:23.757 --> 01:37:39.864]  We took our military police, because we're readily available, and just went down and in a support role, we just took up posts for folks to rotate them so that we could, you know, they could get out, get a place to go sit down, get something to eat, and then get back and take their post.
[01:37:39.864 --> 01:37:40.704]  No, I understand.
[01:37:40.704 --> 01:37:44.546]  We didn't provide any kind of law enforcement activity at all.
[01:37:45.450 --> 01:37:46.872]  Okay.
[01:37:46.872 --> 01:37:52.818]  I mean, the reason people ask that is we've all heard about NORTHCOM and the new 20,000 troops for Brigade Homeland.
[01:37:52.818 --> 01:37:54.319]  I'm sure you've heard about that.
[01:37:54.319 --> 01:37:55.561]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:55.561 --> 01:38:00.145]  And how the Army War College says they are preparing for civil unrest.
[01:38:00.145 --> 01:38:01.867]  And so we see more and more reports about
[01:38:02.628 --> 01:38:04.309]  Well, sir, I mean, we wouldn't respond to it.
[01:38:04.309 --> 01:38:07.890]  We would never respond off the installation in a law enforcement role.
[01:38:27.594 --> 01:38:36.260]  What we will provide, though, is in support functions, we will provide assistance to our partner communities.
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:42.424]  Sure, so military police, though, setting up checkpoints, stopping traffic going through, that is not a law enforcement role?
[01:38:42.424 --> 01:38:46.187]  Yes, sir, that is a law enforcement role, and that we would not do here at Fort Rucker.
[01:38:46.187 --> 01:38:53.372]  I can't speak for what NORTHCOM or the Army War College is trying to put together, but here at Fort Rucker, we would not do that.
[01:38:53.769 --> 01:39:01.610]  No, no, but I mean, I'm looking at photographs of police blocking, military police, Army military police, blocking the road.
[01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:02.571]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:02.571 --> 01:39:07.871]  All we were doing was enforcing the cordon and just directing traffic around it.
[01:39:07.871 --> 01:39:12.392]  We weren't stopping anybody, we weren't engaging anybody, we were just directing traffic.
[01:39:12.392 --> 01:39:19.453]  Okay, and Fort Rucker is mainly Army aircraft support, isn't it?
[01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.574]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:20.574 --> 01:39:22.194]  It's the home of the Army Aviation Center.
[01:39:22.694 --> 01:39:26.378]  Well, we know the folks in Alabama are great people, and we know the military are great people.
[01:39:26.378 --> 01:39:32.564]  It's just there's been big national debates about the larger and larger presence of military, and it was just interesting to see this in the report.
[01:39:32.564 --> 01:39:43.374]  We're glad that more people weren't killed, but sadly ten people is quite a lot, and how's the community taking this right now?
[01:39:43.374 --> 01:39:45.056]  Sure, like everything else, the community is...
[01:39:48.953 --> 01:39:59.818]  They're supporting each other, they're taking care of the families of the affected people, and everybody's pulling together to provide whatever it is that's needed.
[01:39:59.818 --> 01:40:03.500]  Well, in closing, we're talking to Colonel Scott Wild.
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.502]  Anything else you think is important to add here, sir, or that you can tell us?
[01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:08.122]  Yeah, no, sir.
[01:40:08.122 --> 01:40:17.567]  I'd just like to, one more time, reinforce that the true heroes in this situation were all of the state and local and federal law enforcement folks that are in the
[01:40:18.047 --> 01:40:18.287]  Yes sir.
[01:40:18.287 --> 01:40:18.467]  Yes sir.
[01:40:42.771 --> 01:40:45.292]  Sure yeah, I just had to respond with it.
[01:40:45.292 --> 01:40:56.015]  As the Provost Marshal, these are all my guys and this was a place that we needed to be in order to make sure that we provided the exact assistance that was within our limits.
[01:40:57.916 --> 01:41:00.839]  We went down and took care of business.
[01:41:00.839 --> 01:41:03.381]  Well, we appreciate you, sir, Colonel.
[01:41:03.381 --> 01:41:14.130]  All I know is I made a film and in it we have the photographs and news articles, you know, during Bayfest in Alabama, where the Alabama Defense Force was out, you know, searching little kids' bags to go into the city.
[01:41:14.130 --> 01:41:17.233]  And, you know, that's the type of stuff that we don't like under the Constitution.
[01:41:17.233 --> 01:41:20.175]  And there's a lot of calls to restrict the Second Amendment right now.
[01:41:21.156 --> 01:41:29.341]  Because of this shooting, and I just hope that the military will protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:41:29.341 --> 01:41:30.361]  Yeah, sure.
[01:41:30.361 --> 01:41:35.224]  I'll tell you, you just said a great deal of stuff, and I don't have a comment on that.
[01:41:35.224 --> 01:41:38.866]  I have nothing to say about that.
[01:41:38.866 --> 01:41:48.111]  I can just talk about the specific incident that we dealt with last night and the support that we provided to the local law enforcement here in Southern Alabama.
[01:41:48.111 --> 01:41:50.332]  Yeah, but you personally believe in the Second Amendment, don't you?
[01:41:50.959 --> 01:41:54.361]  Sir, you know, my personal opinions have no bearing here whatsoever.
[01:41:54.361 --> 01:42:00.763]  Hey, sir, I appreciate you contacting me and giving me an opportunity to chat with you for a while, but I gotta run.
[01:42:00.763 --> 01:42:05.786]  Okay, Colonel Scott Weil, thanks for joining us from Fort Rucker there in Alabama.
[01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:06.566]  Take care.
[01:42:06.566 --> 01:42:07.926]  Okay, sir.
[01:42:07.926 --> 01:42:09.927]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:09.927 --> 01:42:13.149]  And you see, what they're doing is, with all of this, and this is new,
[01:42:14.455 --> 01:42:16.076]  Is what the Army says.
[01:42:16.076 --> 01:42:18.998]  We're going to be out at car wrecks to help with Jaws of Life.
[01:42:18.998 --> 01:42:21.380]  We're going to be out at DWI checkpoints.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.481]  We're going to be out at mass shootings.
[01:42:23.481 --> 01:42:24.642]  We're going to be out at drug interdiction.
[01:42:24.642 --> 01:42:25.422]  We're going to be out at this.
[01:42:25.422 --> 01:42:26.603]  We're going to be out at that.
[01:42:26.603 --> 01:42:30.626]  And it's the police and military say, well, what's wrong with us helping cordon things?
[01:42:30.626 --> 01:42:32.527]  What's wrong with us stopping drunk drivers?
[01:42:32.527 --> 01:42:38.311]  What's wrong with us with the Jaws of Life getting somebody stuck in a truck that's flipped over?
[01:42:38.311 --> 01:42:41.493]  And it sets the precedent.
[01:42:41.493 --> 01:42:42.534]  You know, we called them up.
[01:42:45.279 --> 01:42:51.342]  We immediately spoke with them and just said we'd like to have you on.
[01:42:51.342 --> 01:42:58.306]  They immediately began saying, we're not involved in law enforcement, we're not involved in law enforcement, we're not involved in law enforcement, we're not involved in law enforcement.
[01:42:58.306 --> 01:43:03.188]  But then the brass themselves are saying they are getting them involved in law enforcement overall.
[01:43:03.188 --> 01:43:04.589]  And you heard him, he's aware of NORTHCOM.
[01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:12.933]  But just in case there was any denials, because I'd gotten some emails, those aren't real photos, there aren't troops there, that's not happening, that's not going on.
[01:43:16.567 --> 01:43:19.890]  Well, we had Colonel Scott Weil on from Fort Rucker.
[01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:21.991]  He's the spokesman there at the base.
[01:43:21.991 --> 01:43:23.492]  Well, no, he's the head of public safety.
[01:43:23.492 --> 01:43:26.635]  He's the director of public safety and the spokesman for public safety.
[01:43:26.635 --> 01:43:30.698]  Dual-headed, as they say.
[01:43:30.698 --> 01:43:39.344]  And we just covered the real issues there for you to document what's happening and how it's all sold as reasonable.
[01:43:39.344 --> 01:43:41.386]  It's all sold to help you.
[01:43:43.097 --> 01:43:44.938]  It's all for your best interest.
[01:43:44.938 --> 01:43:53.242]  Everything's fine except the military on the streets of the United States and everything is going to be alright.
[01:43:53.242 --> 01:43:57.384]  I mean, come on, you're for stopping drunk drivers, aren't you?
[01:43:57.384 --> 01:44:01.125]  First it's earthquakes and forest fires with a regular army.
[01:44:01.125 --> 01:44:03.126]  Then it's, oh, fighting crime.
[01:44:03.126 --> 01:44:08.809]  Now these are the type of
[01:44:10.939 --> 01:44:23.495]  Real issues that happen and then you have Mexico with a complete gun ban for the citizens.
[01:44:23.495 --> 01:44:27.741]  But they have a crime rate just many, many, many, many, many, many.
[01:44:29.918 --> 01:44:33.780]  times what it is in the United States where we have a Second Amendment.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.822]  And you know, the terror watch list has gone up well over a million people.
[01:44:36.822 --> 01:44:47.508]  I'm looking at this photograph, Curt Nemo has posted on Infowars.com for the story, and it's National Guard troops with their black berets, and regular Army troops now, they've been federalized, standing there at the checkpoint as you go to the airport.
[01:44:47.508 --> 01:44:48.688]  It's all about training.
[01:44:48.688 --> 01:44:55.012]  First it's the Super Bowl, and the Kentucky Derby, and the airports in New York, and then Boston, and then Chicago, and then the now
[01:44:55.692 --> 01:45:08.363]  Disgraced Governor, four months ago, comes out in the Chicago Tribune, gives a press conference, we played the audio, the video here, and says, yeah, we're going to use the National Guard to do gun sweeps all over Illinois!
[01:45:08.363 --> 01:45:15.589]  And what did the National Guard do the first time they had a chance to go into New Orleans?
[01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:24.316]  They were blocked from giving aid, the troops wanted to, and they were told to go into the high and dry areas where people had their own food, their own generators,
[01:45:27.165 --> 01:45:34.172]  They were told to go in there and confiscate their firearms.
[01:45:34.172 --> 01:45:37.495]  All the guns will be taken, that's what the police chief said.
[01:45:37.495 --> 01:45:41.578]  Everyone will be disarmed, no one will be allowed to have weapons, even in their own homes.
[01:45:41.578 --> 01:45:46.163]  So this is the reality of what's happening.
[01:45:46.163 --> 01:45:50.607]  And they can try to paper over it, they can try to dress it up all day long, we know how to read.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.121]  The executive orders.
[01:45:56.121 --> 01:45:58.584]  We know how to read what the Pentagon Directives say.
[01:45:58.584 --> 01:46:02.688]  We know how to read what the Army War College is saying.
[01:46:02.688 --> 01:46:10.356]  We know how to study history and understand what's happening and it's all completely public and crystal clear.
[01:46:10.356 --> 01:46:14.480]  You know, I had Ron Paul on yesterday, Congressman Ron Paul, Dr. Ron Paul.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:18.284]  People tried to spin him on Glenn Beck and I did say on air I wasn't
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:29.209]  I'm particularly pleased with his performance when he brought up the FEMA camps and Ron Paul said, well, there's a bill introduced, but I don't know how big a threat it is, but because Washington's so corrupt and out of control, it is a threat.
[01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:38.258]  So he did say it was a threat, but here on air he did agree with the executive orders and the FEMA camp news and did say it was a threat.
[01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:42.262]  And that's on record, and Ron Paul did say that
[01:46:47.159 --> 01:47:06.854]  State grand juries need to start indictments against these different bankers because they didn't just change federal laws so they could do all these derivative Ponzi schemes.
[01:47:06.854 --> 01:47:13.979]  They didn't just change the laws, they even violated their own loopholes you could drive a Mack truck through.
[01:47:13.979 --> 01:47:14.540]  And then looking
[01:47:15.822 --> 01:47:20.966]  At my screen here, I read the mainstream news article about Washington State.
[01:47:20.966 --> 01:47:24.589]  And what is Washington State doing?
[01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:28.372]  What is Washington State up to?
[01:47:28.372 --> 01:47:36.099]  Washington State cops start liaison program with U.S.
[01:47:36.099 --> 01:47:37.279]  Army.
[01:47:37.279 --> 01:47:38.841]  The regular U.S.
[01:47:38.841 --> 01:47:42.163]  Army working and creating relationships
[01:47:42.987 --> 01:47:56.231]  With the local police here in the United States of America.
[01:47:56.231 --> 01:48:01.953]  And now they want to sell the kind of half-awake, mesmerized public on accepting this, but more importantly,
[01:48:04.443 --> 01:48:10.287]  They are selling the police and military who are like, yeah, we work together.
[01:48:10.287 --> 01:48:11.427]  There's a mass shooting.
[01:48:11.427 --> 01:48:16.410]  The regular army comes out and helps us.
[01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:18.232]  Yeah, there's drunk drivers out there.
[01:48:18.232 --> 01:48:19.893]  We can save lives using the army.
[01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:21.914]  They've got the resources we need.
[01:48:21.914 --> 01:48:24.736]  And the army goes out and does these reasonable things on the surface.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.982]  And the wicked precedent is set.
[01:48:28.982 --> 01:48:32.103]  Washington State Cops start liaison program with U.S.
[01:48:32.103 --> 01:48:32.803]  Army.
[01:48:32.803 --> 01:48:39.786]  Fort Lewis and Lakewood Police are working together to build a better understanding of what happens on the other side.
[01:48:39.786 --> 01:48:49.691]  Lakewood Police are enlisting the help of Fort Lewis for times when city cops need to cooperate with the Army, including when soldiers get in trouble off post.
[01:48:51.462 --> 01:48:52.323]  That's always their excuse.
[01:48:52.323 --> 01:49:05.993]  I remember ten years ago, they would have Air Force and Army and Marine, Military Police, on the boardwalk, searching citizens, working with the police, helping handcuff people.
[01:49:05.993 --> 01:49:07.194]  We got video of it.
[01:49:07.194 --> 01:49:07.554]  And they said,
[01:49:08.895 --> 01:49:09.676]  We made a big deal out of it.
[01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:14.100]  They said, oh, well, they're just looking for drunk soldiers because there's a lot of bases around here.
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:23.748]  And then they announced last week in Canada, all over their papers, oh, the army's going to be in the major city bar districts working with police against citizens and also for rowdy soldiers.
[01:49:23.748 --> 01:49:30.514]  And then they announced next week, by the way, we're preparing to lock down the cities and have war with the people of Canada.
[01:49:30.514 --> 01:49:32.496]  And now they're just mixing all the propaganda together.
[01:49:35.612 --> 01:49:40.756]  So see, first the article in the News Tribune tells you, oh, it's to look for troubled people off post.
[01:49:40.756 --> 01:49:52.625]  Then it adds, oh, meanwhile, I'm quoting the article, another partnership will let the local army post receive the city's assistance in civilian police training for soldiers bound for Iraq this fall.
[01:49:52.625 --> 01:49:53.946]  They say, oh, it's for Iraq.
[01:49:54.892 --> 01:49:59.456]  But then you read the Pentagon's own directive to put the troops on the streets.
[01:49:59.456 --> 01:50:01.117]  That's a Pentagon directive!
[01:50:01.117 --> 01:50:09.184]  Joe Schmoe, Sally Sockermom, Joe Sixpack, he isn't reading Pentagon directives that we link to up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:09.184 --> 01:50:16.590]  So he's just going, oh well, for Iraq, you know, the troops will be on the streets looking for bad troops and helping out.
[01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:23.172]  Fort Lewis has assigned a full-time military liaison police officer position to the Lakewood Police Department.
[01:50:23.172 --> 01:50:24.493]  Oh!
[01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:26.234]  Army in the department!
[01:50:26.234 --> 01:50:38.899]  And see, they build these threat integration centers, these FEMA centers, and they're announcing, oh, there'll be emergency medical treatment there, and vaccines there, and local pastors working in the Army, and the Army's giving the police a local, you know, big building for free.
[01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:44.502]  Fort Lewis has assigned a full-time military liaison police officer position to the Lakewood Police Department.
[01:50:44.502 --> 01:50:54.147]  Police Lieutenant Steve Maurer said the soldier won't patrol with city officials, officers, but will serve as a resource.
[01:50:54.147 --> 01:51:02.972]  Fort Lewis and a pair of military police officers to get oriented with the Lakewood Police Department.
[01:51:02.972 --> 01:51:06.934]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[01:51:06.934 --> 01:51:08.515]  Don't rely on others for protection.

[01:52:01.784 --> 01:52:07.010]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.819 --> 01:52:13.703]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.703 --> 01:52:20.187]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.187 --> 01:52:22.168]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.168 --> 01:52:24.630]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:35.377]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.808 --> 01:52:39.469]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.469 --> 01:52:41.329]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.329 --> 01:52:48.252]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.252 --> 01:52:56.515]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.515 --> 01:52:58.075]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.075 --> 01:52:59.276]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.567 --> 01:53:05.609]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[01:53:05.609 --> 01:53:07.510]  You are not alone.
[01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:10.391]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[01:53:10.391 --> 01:53:15.454]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[01:53:15.454 --> 01:53:17.795]  Signs include itching, pulling, tugging.
[01:53:17.995 --> 01:53:18.476]  I don't know.
[01:53:38.058 --> 01:53:38.378]  Let's do it!
[01:54:06.138 --> 01:54:12.645]  I mean, reading this article out of Washington State...
[01:54:27.813 --> 01:54:30.614]  There they are, merging the military with the police, moving them all in together.
[01:54:30.614 --> 01:54:32.796]  It's happening all over the nation.
[01:54:32.796 --> 01:54:34.576]  From Alabama to Washington.
[01:54:34.576 --> 01:54:36.177]  From Texas to Illinois.
[01:54:36.177 --> 01:54:38.138]  From Oklahoma to Florida.
[01:54:38.138 --> 01:54:40.519]  Total federal takeover of everything.
[01:54:40.519 --> 01:54:45.282]  Fort Lewis has assigned a full-time military liaison police officer position to the Lakewood Police Department.
[01:54:45.282 --> 01:54:49.124]  Police Lieutenant Steve Maurer said the soldier won't patrol the city.
[01:54:49.904 --> 01:54:52.627]  Yeah, they're conditioning the public, but we'll serve as a resource.
[01:54:52.627 --> 01:54:57.812]  Fort Lewis sent a pair of military police officers to get oriented with the Lakewood Police Department.
[01:54:58.857 --> 01:55:02.100]  Last week they will split time in the single position.
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:10.486]  The soldier who will work five days a week, including Friday and Saturday nights, will serve as a point of contact for the city police who will get information from Fort Lewis.
[01:55:10.486 --> 01:55:12.788]  They will be inside the police station.
[01:55:12.788 --> 01:55:19.293]  The types of police calls that could benefit from Fort Lewis help include bad behavior at bars and collisions in cars.
[01:55:19.293 --> 01:55:22.256]  See, the Army has said their PR is going to be car wrecks.
[01:55:22.256 --> 01:55:23.337]  We're going to help the car wrecks.
[01:55:25.259 --> 01:55:25.960]  It goes on, Lt.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:26.360]  Col.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:36.609]  Ted Salinar, Fort Lewis Provost Marshal, who helped forge the Law Enforcement Liaison Program, said that post officials want to exchange knowledge with their neighboring city.
[01:55:36.609 --> 01:55:38.170]  And then remember Iowa a few weeks ago?
[01:55:38.170 --> 01:55:45.016]  Oh, we're going to go door-to-door and ask if we can search their home for guns, but it's no big deal and practice looking for gun dealers.
[01:55:45.016 --> 01:55:46.057]  But the town loves it.
[01:55:46.057 --> 01:55:47.018]  Everyone in the town loves it.
[01:55:47.018 --> 01:55:48.259]  We call people in the town, they don't love it.
[01:55:49.713 --> 01:55:56.919]  Solonars at Lakewood Police contacted the Post to see how the two sides could bridge the fence that separates them.
[01:55:56.919 --> 01:55:58.921]  Oh, yeah, the city did it.
[01:55:58.921 --> 01:56:00.662]  Sure they did.
[01:56:00.662 --> 01:56:03.245]  And the Army just magically allowed it to happen.
[01:56:03.245 --> 01:56:09.370]  They decided on the liaison program, which is already used in Army installations such as Fort Carson, Colorado.
[01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:10.971]  And everywhere else.
[01:56:10.971 --> 01:56:13.513]  Secretly until now, I would add.
[01:56:13.513 --> 01:56:16.496]  And you can link through at InfoWars.com, read the whole article, that's just part of it.
[01:56:20.307 --> 01:56:26.933]  I'm just going to continue taking your calls, and I'm going on John Gibson's radio show in about 25 minutes for 6 or 7 minutes.
[01:56:26.933 --> 01:56:29.035]  I'm supposed to go on at 20 after John, so that's good.
[01:56:29.035 --> 01:56:30.536]  We won't burn much air time.
[01:56:30.536 --> 01:56:35.080]  During that break, I'll be on with him, and I'll probably be a few minutes over.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.641]  And so, why don't you do this, John?
[01:56:36.641 --> 01:56:45.389]  Why don't you go up to InfoWars.com and start grabbing the 8-minute clip for the new teaser, excerpts from Obama Deception.
[01:56:48.228 --> 01:56:48.848]  I'm very tired.
[01:56:48.848 --> 01:56:50.189]  I was on coast to coast last night.
[01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:51.750]  We had a lot of stressful things going on here.
[01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:55.593]  That's why I'm probably uncharacteristically calm today.
[01:56:55.593 --> 01:56:58.555]  Being burnt out completely takes the edge off things.
[01:56:58.555 --> 01:57:06.760]  I'm tempted to not even go live at PrisonPlanet.tv because I'm so shot, but we'll go ahead and do it.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:12.663]  We're just going to do one hour of PrisonPlanet.tv today when I have Celente on.
[01:57:12.663 --> 01:57:14.425]  So we're not going to go live next hour.
[01:57:14.425 --> 01:57:16.106]  Oh man, all I want to do is get in bed and go to sleep.
[01:57:22.110 --> 01:57:24.491]  I get to get grilled by John Gibson.
[01:57:24.491 --> 01:57:27.691]  Little snickering jokes in the background.
[01:57:27.691 --> 01:57:38.594]  He told me I was copying, when I yell and scream, the Big Lebowski, and I hadn't seen it, so I went out and got it, and it was a pretty good film.
[01:57:38.594 --> 01:57:39.154]  Oh, man.
[01:57:39.154 --> 01:57:46.936]  I'm sure they'll be playing Big Lebowski clips when I go on.
[01:57:46.936 --> 01:57:48.037]  Yeah, white Russian.
[01:57:48.037 --> 01:57:48.517]  And he says,
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:50.401]  And that's what he does!
[01:57:50.401 --> 01:57:56.387]  That's what he does to your rug!
[01:57:56.387 --> 01:58:00.331]  He goes, he's got it dead on, the big Lebowski imitation.
[01:58:00.331 --> 01:58:02.252]  No, that's somebody upset about tyranny.
[01:58:02.252 --> 01:58:12.603]  In the 30 seconds left in this hour, folks, go to InfoWars.com, pre-order the high-quality DVD of The Obama Deception, starts shipping out next Monday, and it's going to drop very soon at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:15.339 --> 01:58:18.140]  Because of Shark Circling, I'm probably not going to wait until Sunday at 6 p.m.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.500]  to release it.
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:26.201]  I just released again a teaser video and the new trailer up at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:26.201 --> 01:58:31.702]  So we'll come back and blitz through phone calls, so just be ready with your question or comment when we come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:31.702 --> 01:58:35.303]  But don't forget, you can call and order the DVD as well, 888-253-3139.

[01:58:53.029 --> 01:58:57.773]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.773 --> 01:59:00.736]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.736 --> 01:59:03.779]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.779 --> 01:59:08.503]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.723 --> 01:59:09.844]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.844 --> 01:59:13.086]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:13.086 --> 01:59:20.090]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:59:40.517 --> 01:59:42.338]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.979 --> 01:59:56.382]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.382 --> 02:00:05.794]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.794 --> 02:00:07.095]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.095 --> 02:00:08.878]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.878 --> 02:00:10.640]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.202]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.202 --> 02:00:12.963]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.752 --> 02:00:17.935]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.935 --> 02:00:22.859]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.859 --> 02:00:25.781]  Alright, we're going to go into your phone calls for the next 20 minutes.
[02:00:25.781 --> 02:00:28.042]  I'm going to be on John Gibson for 6-7 minutes.
[02:00:28.042 --> 02:00:29.863]  Fox.
[02:00:29.863 --> 02:00:31.765]  Fake neocon radio.
[02:00:31.765 --> 02:00:32.565]  I should be nice to him.
[02:00:32.565 --> 02:00:35.107]  He's having me on about the Obama deception.
[02:00:35.107 --> 02:00:35.768]  And, uh...
[02:00:38.499 --> 02:00:46.662]  We'll also continue with Gerald Cilente in the hour for that, but right now, Simon in Alabama, site of the bizarre shooting with the Army running around now.
[02:00:46.662 --> 02:00:48.943]  Simon, thanks for coming on.
[02:00:48.943 --> 02:00:55.086]  First I should say, I'm in North Alabama, across the state, so I know nothing more than anyone else who has seen the news.
[02:00:55.086 --> 02:01:00.648]  But I got up this morning... North Alabama, South Alabama, and little towns all around this land.
[02:01:00.648 --> 02:01:00.988]  Go ahead.
[02:01:00.988 --> 02:01:03.049]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:03.049 --> 02:01:07.451]  I get up this morning, I look on InfoWars, I see the article about troops on the street down there, right?
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:17.728]  Well, I called the local TV stations and like, first I called WAFF 48 and I go, are you aware there are troops down in the town where the shooting took place?
[02:01:17.728 --> 02:01:19.770]  They're like, no, we'll check it out.
[02:01:19.770 --> 02:01:33.702]  Well, I go down the next one called WHNT 19 and they tell me that the reason why the military was there was because it's a town that only has two peace officers and that people were looting.
[02:01:33.702 --> 02:01:34.603]  Now, I don't buy that.
[02:01:35.302 --> 02:01:36.904]  Oh, it's a completely peaceful town.
[02:01:36.904 --> 02:01:38.165]  I've seen video footage everywhere.
[02:01:38.165 --> 02:01:39.566]  Nothing about looting.
[02:01:39.566 --> 02:01:40.968]  And we just gotta have the army.
[02:01:40.968 --> 02:01:44.731]  Listen, they're now saying they don't want people to be able to have home gardens because you might grow weed.
[02:01:44.731 --> 02:01:47.194]  I mean, we're prisoners.
[02:01:47.194 --> 02:01:50.016]  If they would have been looting, they wouldn't have had tasers.
[02:01:50.016 --> 02:01:51.398]  They would have had firearms.
[02:01:52.045 --> 02:01:53.505]  They had firearms.
[02:01:53.505 --> 02:02:03.547]  And by the way, they are, by the way, I should have asked him, that was one question I didn't ask when the colonel was on, but I can see the photos, they've got .45s on their side, the standard issue sidearm for the army.
[02:02:03.547 --> 02:02:06.708]  But let me just add this.
[02:02:06.708 --> 02:02:16.410]  You know, all over the country they're putting regular army in the police departments to gather intelligence on the citizens and they're working with the intelligence units of the police departments that are also federally funded.
[02:02:16.410 --> 02:02:19.311]  The feds are taking over the police departments and they're putting the army in.
[02:02:19.311 --> 02:02:20.471]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:02:21.337 --> 02:02:22.218]  I'm not denying that.
[02:02:32.904 --> 02:02:46.749]  We just saw photos in Reuters and a photo in the London Guardian, no it was London Telegraph, and so we saw it and it said, from Reuters, U.S.
[02:02:46.749 --> 02:02:48.710]  Army from Fort Rucker, U.S.
[02:02:48.710 --> 02:02:53.391]  Army soldiers from Fort Rucker patrolled the downtown area of Samson, Alabama after the shooting spree March 10, 2009.
[02:02:55.012 --> 02:02:59.714]  And so I guess we then googled it everywhere and found no other video or news reports.
[02:02:59.714 --> 02:03:03.275]  So this is really the first place where you actually heard it from the military here.
[02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:04.695]  Right.
[02:03:04.695 --> 02:03:07.656]  Well, did you hear him when I brought up defending the Second Amendment?
[02:03:07.656 --> 02:03:09.357]  I listened to the whole thing.
[02:03:09.357 --> 02:03:11.618]  Wouldn't he have mentioned that if there would have been looting?
[02:03:11.618 --> 02:03:12.798]  Would he not have mentioned that?
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:19.462]  Yes, he would have mentioned that, but I'm sure they'll teach us the people are bad, you can't have gardens, the Army's here.
[02:03:19.462 --> 02:03:30.946]  I mean, I've got mainstream news, not just out of Oklahoma, but other parts of the country, they're saying, we may not allow citizens to have gardens, because they may grow Mary Jane, and we may have to inspect your gardens.
[02:03:30.946 --> 02:03:33.607]  I mean, this is prison!
[02:03:33.607 --> 02:03:36.449]  A lot of prisons even let a prisoner grow a tomato plant.
[02:03:36.449 --> 02:03:38.429]  They want to make us prisoners!
[02:03:38.429 --> 02:03:39.930]  An occupied country!
[02:03:42.949 --> 02:03:44.511]  Anything else, sir?
[02:03:44.511 --> 02:03:46.192]  Well, no, sir.
[02:03:46.192 --> 02:03:47.673]  I thought they needed to be out there.
[02:03:47.673 --> 02:03:51.917]  If you want to, you can go to their website.
[02:03:51.917 --> 02:03:53.338]  WNHC19.
[02:03:53.338 --> 02:03:55.560]  Maybe y'all could call them or something.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:56.361]  I don't know.
[02:03:56.361 --> 02:04:04.608]  But I don't like them saying that Alabamians are rioting in a small town of 2,000 people.
[02:04:05.458 --> 02:04:09.021]  When something bad happens in a town like that, people come together.
[02:04:09.021 --> 02:04:10.762]  They don't start going, hey, this is our city.
[02:04:10.762 --> 02:04:13.304]  No, you can't have gardens.
[02:04:13.304 --> 02:04:14.765]  No, you can't have gardens.
[02:04:14.765 --> 02:04:17.908]  The Army's got to be in your police department and watch you.
[02:04:17.908 --> 02:04:19.369]  There's Al-Qaeda everywhere.
[02:04:19.369 --> 02:04:25.794]  Every city police force in the country is being trained for IED roadside bombs.
[02:04:25.794 --> 02:04:28.937]  And then they're telling them white Al-Qaeda's about to attack.
[02:04:30.154 --> 02:04:38.758]  Folks, the government carried out the attacks, and notice when I brought up to the Colonel, oh, I noticed the Alabama Defense Force searches little kids at Bay Fest in Alabama.
[02:04:38.758 --> 02:04:40.338]  And he said, I gotta go.
[02:04:40.338 --> 02:04:42.739]  I'm hearing some things I can't talk about.
[02:04:42.739 --> 02:04:44.520]  I gotta go.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.820]  Sir, Simon, stay there.
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:48.001]  I want to talk a little bit more about this because I've been interrupting you.
[02:04:48.001 --> 02:04:49.442]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:49.442 --> 02:04:54.904]  And I want to confirm the TV station specifically who told you, we were doing this because of Luton.
[02:04:54.904 --> 02:04:58.986]  You can't trust the citizens, and they can't have gardens neither.
[02:05:01.434 --> 02:05:10.139]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:05:10.139 --> 02:05:15.282]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:05:15.282 --> 02:05:16.143]  and Canada.
[02:05:16.143 --> 02:05:22.607]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:05:23.231 --> 02:05:26.635]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:05:26.635 --> 02:05:29.077]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:06:01.464 --> 02:06:07.527]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.527 --> 02:06:12.850]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.385 --> 02:06:19.867]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:19.867 --> 02:06:21.848]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:21.848 --> 02:06:24.309]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.309 --> 02:06:35.213]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.503 --> 02:06:39.164]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.164 --> 02:06:41.025]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.025 --> 02:06:47.927]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:06:57.771 --> 02:06:58.952]  The people strike back.
[02:07:00.506 --> 02:07:05.911]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[02:07:05.911 --> 02:07:15.118]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:07:15.118 --> 02:07:18.501]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:07:18.541 --> 02:07:18.901]  I think so.

[02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:12.571]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.571 --> 02:08:14.131]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.131 --> 02:08:18.313]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.313 --> 02:08:23.414]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.414 --> 02:08:32.677]  Ben Bernanke spoke before the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday and said they need a new banking system of the globe to stop the evil bankers, which he is one of the chief minions of.
[02:08:34.756 --> 02:08:38.840]  Rush Limbaugh said CFR didn't exist for over a decade now.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:40.381]  He says it exists but doesn't run anything.
[02:08:40.381 --> 02:08:42.763]  But world government is being set up by the evil liberals.
[02:08:42.763 --> 02:08:44.284]  No, both parties are owned.
[02:08:44.284 --> 02:08:45.025]  So we'll get into that.
[02:08:45.025 --> 02:08:46.606]  We have Gerald Cilente coming up.
[02:08:46.606 --> 02:08:48.107]  I want to continue with your phone calls.
[02:08:48.107 --> 02:08:51.710]  So I have time to get on with John Gibson at about 20 after on Fox Radio.
[02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:54.152]  I'm sure I'll be grilled.
[02:08:54.152 --> 02:09:00.598]  We're going to play a little bit of the audio from the sneak peek that's just gone up on the website of the Obama deception.
[02:09:00.598 --> 02:09:06.723]  And then we'll come back at that 24 After and play some more of it, but I should be back in the middle of that segment.
[02:09:06.723 --> 02:09:09.765]  And we'll continue with phone calls throughout the hour and other top news stories.
[02:09:09.765 --> 02:09:15.610]  But there's no doubt, I mean the Army admits it, but there's no doubt now that the Army and the Marines, they're just taking over.
[02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:18.332]  And they're just running an intelligence operation, an acclimation.
[02:09:19.890 --> 02:09:23.133]  Operation to prepare the police, the military, the citizens for total occupation.
[02:09:23.133 --> 02:09:42.868]  That's now admitted, but when you see the local news spinning it, and you see the propaganda and the 26,000 preachers, you know, telling their flocks to go to the FEMA camps and take the shots and turn in their guns, and the 50,000 InfraGard executives in private industry with shoot-to-kill orders and weapons under FBI control, and you just find out about it all.
[02:09:42.868 --> 02:09:43.909]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:47.572]  And then in Alabama, they have the Army, regular Army, running around with sidearms.
[02:09:49.275 --> 02:09:52.338]  And Simon calls up the local news and says, why is the Army there?
[02:09:52.338 --> 02:09:53.179]  Why didn't you report on it?
[02:09:53.179 --> 02:09:55.521]  And they go, because there was looting!
[02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:56.782]  Well, that'd be big national news.
[02:09:56.782 --> 02:09:59.525]  You've got hundreds of news teams there within hours of it happening.
[02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:00.266]  No news anywhere.
[02:10:00.266 --> 02:10:01.847]  We've Googled it of looting.
[02:10:01.847 --> 02:10:08.274]  Just more, we can't let citizens have gardens now in Tulsa because they might grow weed!
[02:10:08.274 --> 02:10:10.155]  It's all just something might happen!
[02:10:10.155 --> 02:10:11.497]  The Army's got to be here!
[02:10:12.654 --> 02:10:13.655]  You know, after the fact.
[02:10:13.655 --> 02:10:15.756]  It's just, how about the citizens be armed?
[02:10:15.756 --> 02:10:22.420]  That's the only, you know, you can't wait an hour or two for the military to show up.
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:26.542]  You know, Mexico and Communist Russia, they have troops on the streets.
[02:10:26.542 --> 02:10:27.843]  In Venezuela they do.
[02:10:27.843 --> 02:10:28.744]  In Cuba they do.
[02:10:28.744 --> 02:10:30.845]  It isn't what a free country's got.
[02:10:30.845 --> 02:10:33.086]  And again, the bankers are imploding things by design right now.
[02:10:33.086 --> 02:10:34.547]  They're going to use the military against us.
[02:10:34.547 --> 02:10:39.410]  Simon in Alabama, recap the exact news station you called that told you it was looting.
[02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:40.071]  Okay.
[02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:41.512]  I called WAGNT-19.
[02:10:42.833 --> 02:10:47.736]  And I said, are you aware that there are troops down in Santa Ana, Alabama?
[02:10:47.736 --> 02:10:51.579]  And they said, well, they only had two peace officers.
[02:10:51.579 --> 02:10:54.201]  And with what was going on, they were busy.
[02:10:54.201 --> 02:10:56.562]  So the military came in to help, right?
[02:10:56.562 --> 02:11:01.986]  And the lady said on the phone that there was looting going on in that town.
[02:11:01.986 --> 02:11:03.407]  Now, I said, I'm not down there.
[02:11:03.407 --> 02:11:04.348]  I don't know.
[02:11:04.348 --> 02:11:08.290]  But that doesn't sound, you know, it doesn't sound right.
[02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:09.291]  It defies the senses.
[02:11:10.879 --> 02:11:14.623]  Well, yeah, somebody tries to loot in Alabama, they get their butt blown off.
[02:11:14.623 --> 02:11:19.808]  And people, as you said, come together during those type of crises.
[02:11:19.808 --> 02:11:21.830]  And the Colonel would have said something about that when he was on.
[02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:33.261]  But, you know, we have the photos in mainstream news articles, because the Alabama Defense Force posted it themselves, of them searching three-year-old children at football games and to get into the city on major streets, little kids being searched.
[02:11:33.261 --> 02:11:34.623]  That's in my film, Martial Law.
[02:11:35.856 --> 02:11:43.857]  Rise of the Police State, put out in 2005, and you heard when I brought that up, boy, he clammed up fast.
[02:11:43.857 --> 02:11:45.958]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:45.958 --> 02:11:49.078]  We know what's really going on.
[02:11:49.078 --> 02:11:51.679]  Well, God bless you, and keep up the hard work, man.
[02:11:51.679 --> 02:11:52.299]  Thank you.
[02:11:52.299 --> 02:11:55.099]  You know, I'm not whining, but hard work is true.
[02:11:55.099 --> 02:11:56.420]  I have not even eaten.
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:12:00.260]  I am working so much, from the time I wake up in the morning, I don't even see my children anymore.
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:03.721]  I haven't eaten, guys, and my stomach's killing me, and I'm running low here on blood sugar.
[02:12:04.949 --> 02:12:09.291]  Hey, can somebody get me some chow fast?
[02:12:09.291 --> 02:12:12.913]  Just, just, just, I gotta have food here.
[02:12:12.913 --> 02:12:15.394]  I gotta go face John Gibson in a minute.
[02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:21.037]  I'm not whining, I'm just, I am light-headed here.
[02:12:21.037 --> 02:12:25.259]  Probably because I've had three cups of coffee and nothing else.
[02:12:25.259 --> 02:12:29.061]  Oh, man.
[02:12:29.061 --> 02:12:30.582]  David in Wisconsin.
[02:12:30.582 --> 02:12:31.443]  David, you're on the air.
[02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:33.744]  Yeah, how are ya?
[02:12:35.339 --> 02:12:47.825]  Um, you know, Fritz Springmeier talked about all the mind control people he worked with that were programmed for an end time scenario and that if they just triggered them all at once that they could start doing things like this.
[02:12:47.825 --> 02:12:55.089]  And it should show us that this, uh, you know, we're always predicting that they're going to do the martial law, but it's implementing it.
[02:12:55.089 --> 02:13:01.372]  But, you know, it's going to be more complex and mind blowing than, than we just think, you know, on our simple level.
[02:13:01.372 --> 02:13:03.273]  It could, you know, cause they're not stupid.
[02:13:04.113 --> 02:13:06.355]  They've planned this for years.
[02:13:06.355 --> 02:13:16.822]  They've planned to make the military, hey we're helping stop drugs, we're helping at shootings, we're helping at car wrecks, we're moving into your local police department, come on, we're fighting Al Qaeda!
[02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:19.104]  Hey Alex, and then on the Columbine thing,
[02:13:19.976 --> 02:13:25.619]  The first news reports saw UN vehicles at the scene.
[02:13:25.619 --> 02:13:30.661]  They said I'm flying over with a helicopter, and they saw UN vehicles.
[02:13:30.661 --> 02:13:45.308]  I remember that, and they supposedly got 128 bombs into the building, with some of them weighing 100 pounds, and more than half the teachers weren't there that day, and half the students weren't there that day, and the principal wasn't there that day, and the police stood down for hours and hours, what, 4 hours 15 minutes?
[02:13:47.113 --> 02:14:06.785]  Yeah, and the other thing is we're so blessed with the info on the internet and everything, and that generations before us didn't have, and we're going to pass it down to our children, I to my three sons, and they'll never fool us again, even if we have to go through some kind of concentration camp type scenario or anything.
[02:14:06.785 --> 02:14:11.808]  And I wanted to just tell you that that second trailer about the Obama
[02:14:13.151 --> 02:14:16.994]  Deception was really good with KRS-One, Ventura, Cellente.
[02:14:16.994 --> 02:14:18.455]  That was just really good.
[02:14:18.455 --> 02:14:21.137]  This might have a real big effect.
[02:14:21.137 --> 02:14:21.957]  Oh, it's a good film.
[02:14:21.957 --> 02:14:26.080]  Look, we made it in record time and in production quality.
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:29.342]  It's the best film we've ever made, and the material's the most up-to-date and hardcore.
[02:14:29.342 --> 02:14:31.163]  It exposes the bankers and everything.
[02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:34.706]  It'll deprogram the leftists and the right-wingers all in one fell swoop.
[02:14:34.706 --> 02:14:37.647]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:37.647 --> 02:14:40.329]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Illinois.
[02:14:40.329 --> 02:14:41.150]  John, you're on the air.
[02:14:41.906 --> 02:14:43.407]  How's it going today, Alex?
[02:14:43.407 --> 02:14:44.468]  I'm pretty good.
[02:14:44.468 --> 02:14:45.589]  Yeah, you sound a little tired.
[02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:46.630]  I understand.
[02:14:46.630 --> 02:14:53.515]  I was calling to find out, had anybody mentioned that this shooter in Alabama had police training?
[02:14:53.515 --> 02:14:54.777]  I did see a blurb about that.
[02:14:54.777 --> 02:14:55.877]  See, there's so many points.
[02:14:55.877 --> 02:14:57.198]  So give folks the source on that.
[02:14:57.198 --> 02:14:58.840]  It's somewhere here in my stack.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:04.625]  I believe AP reported on it, and then it's just been kind of leaked down to other, you know, media throughout the nation.
[02:15:04.625 --> 02:15:08.728]  But yeah, you know, when I heard about the shooting yesterday, I was like, you know what?
[02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:16.687]  That sounds like this guy's military and it seems to me like almost every single shooter either has, you know, military connections or police connections.
[02:15:16.687 --> 02:15:21.812]  Listen, listen, take the beltway DC snipers.
[02:15:21.812 --> 02:15:27.117]  I mean these guys, I said when they catch them they'll be at a military base under mine control and it turns out that
[02:15:28.097 --> 02:15:30.938]  You know, the older guy was at a base.
[02:15:30.938 --> 02:15:34.039]  All these weird connections have been in Army psychiatric care.
[02:15:34.039 --> 02:15:37.721]  And then witnesses saw white guys shooting out of white vans over and over again.
[02:15:37.721 --> 02:15:39.722]  And they, you know, grab them at this rest stop.
[02:15:39.722 --> 02:15:45.704]  And then they go plead guilty, just like the Patsy's pled guilty, who've been tortured for seven years.
[02:15:45.704 --> 02:15:47.604]  They don't show video of it.
[02:15:47.604 --> 02:15:51.586]  You know, this lying government just says, oh, they've confessed to everything with 9-11.
[02:15:51.586 --> 02:15:53.987]  And said, we are terrorists to the bone.
[02:15:53.987 --> 02:15:56.568]  When Muslims that do attack don't call themselves terrorists.
[02:15:57.088 --> 02:15:57.168]  Yep.
[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:20.882]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[02:16:20.882 --> 02:16:21.642]  Thank you for the call.
[02:16:21.642 --> 02:16:23.644]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:23.644 --> 02:16:25.365]  In fact, if you want to add more, we can put you on hold.
[02:16:25.365 --> 02:16:27.966]  I've got to go to this clip now because I've got to go on John Gibson's show.
[02:16:27.966 --> 02:16:31.048]  Will you go ask the producer, is Gibson calling the cream phone?
[02:16:31.048 --> 02:16:31.689]  I need to know this.
[02:16:31.689 --> 02:16:32.569]  I need to know where he's calling.
[02:16:32.569 --> 02:16:33.110]  Nobody told me.
[02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:34.190]  Thanks.
[02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:38.733]  John, do you have the teaser audio from the film ready?
[02:16:38.733 --> 02:16:41.315]  Let's go ahead and roll with that and we'll be back after the next break.
[02:16:41.315 --> 02:16:43.236]  This is from the Obama Deception.
[02:16:43.236 --> 02:16:45.278]  Stay with us.
[02:16:45.278 --> 02:16:46.038]  America in 2009.
[02:16:47.850 --> 02:16:50.991]  Was desperate for change.
[02:16:50.991 --> 02:16:53.851]  The past eight years have been a disaster.
[02:16:53.851 --> 02:16:57.392]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[02:16:57.392 --> 02:17:07.854]  Maybe under here.
[02:17:07.854 --> 02:17:14.436]  George W. Bush, who had claimed to be a conservative, had tripled the size of the federal government.
[02:17:14.436 --> 02:17:15.656]  Shredded the Constitution.
[02:17:16.724 --> 02:17:19.787]  And destroyed the image of the United States worldwide.
[02:17:19.787 --> 02:17:21.008]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[02:17:21.008 --> 02:17:27.993]  Endless wars.
[02:17:27.993 --> 02:17:30.996]  Over a million dead Iraqis.
[02:17:30.996 --> 02:17:33.358]  And more than 5,000 dead U.S.
[02:17:33.358 --> 02:17:35.299]  troops.
[02:17:35.299 --> 02:17:38.442]  The Patriot Act.
[02:17:38.442 --> 02:17:42.765]  Warrantless domestic wiretapping and spying.
[02:17:42.765 --> 02:17:44.387]  The end of Posse Comitatus.
[02:17:46.141 --> 02:17:51.243]  The rise of the treasonous North American Union.
[02:17:51.243 --> 02:17:56.964]  A deepening recession, sliding towards total economic collapse.
[02:17:56.964 --> 02:18:06.847]  These factors and other abuses had the American people in a state of panic for their future and the very existence of the United States.
[02:18:06.847 --> 02:18:08.628]  The elite were in trouble.
[02:18:08.628 --> 02:18:15.110]  The people were beginning to see through their facade, past their front man, and to the ruling elite behind the throne.
[02:18:17.674 --> 02:18:19.014]  For the first time in U.S.
[02:18:19.014 --> 02:18:22.336]  history, both parties were universally hated.
[02:18:22.336 --> 02:18:24.897]  Congress had a 9% approval rating.
[02:18:24.897 --> 02:18:29.738]  The globalist agenda had stalled.
[02:18:29.738 --> 02:18:34.180]  And then, onto the scene came a man who promised change.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:37.661]  Change we could all believe in.
[02:18:37.661 --> 02:18:40.162]  Barack H. Obama promised to end the war.
[02:18:40.717 --> 02:18:43.960]  In this film we will prove that Obama says one thing and does another.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.522]  And that he works for the very same elite interests that Bush served.
[02:19:07.995 --> 02:19:16.460]  The very interest engineering the financial collapse and formation of a dictatorial world government.
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:18.961]  This film is not about left or right.
[02:19:18.961 --> 02:19:20.262]  It is nonpartisan.
[02:19:20.262 --> 02:19:28.366]  Our past documentary films are among some of the most damning indictments of George W. Bush and his administration that have ever been made.
[02:19:32.333 --> 02:19:44.359]  If humanity has any hope of effecting real change for the better, it will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality makers who have cast Barack Obama as the savior of the world.
[02:19:44.359 --> 02:19:52.203]  To alter our course from tyranny to liberty, to defeat the corrupt elite, we must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet.
[02:20:01.741 --> 02:20:02.621]  You worry.
[02:20:02.621 --> 02:20:04.702]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:20:04.702 --> 02:20:07.343]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:20:07.343 --> 02:20:09.463]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:20:09.463 --> 02:20:11.084]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:20:11.084 --> 02:20:14.665]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:20:14.665 --> 02:20:19.906]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:20:19.906 --> 02:20:23.888]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:20:23.888 --> 02:20:25.568]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:20:25.568 --> 02:20:28.469]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:31.410]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:20:31.909 --> 02:20:40.554]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:20:40.554 --> 02:20:45.376]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:20:45.376 --> 02:20:49.399]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:20:49.399 --> 02:20:53.421]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:53.421 --> 02:20:54.802]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:54.802 --> 02:20:56.523]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:21:02.113 --> 02:21:06.718]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[02:21:06.718 --> 02:21:19.050]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[02:21:19.050 --> 02:21:24.635]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[02:21:24.635 --> 02:21:26.097]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[02:21:26.627 --> 02:21:32.613]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:37.603]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[02:21:37.603 --> 02:21:38.403]  Give me a call.
[02:21:38.403 --> 02:21:43.907]  I'm Peter Kranschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:21:43.907 --> 02:21:47.149]  And allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[02:21:47.149 --> 02:21:48.810]  That's Peter Kranschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:21:48.810 --> 02:21:51.632]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, while you can still purchase gold with paper.
[02:22:01.849 --> 02:22:07.673]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.673 --> 02:22:14.677]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:15.231 --> 02:22:21.437]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.437 --> 02:22:23.799]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.799 --> 02:22:26.301]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:26.301 --> 02:22:37.291]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.879 --> 02:22:39.540]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:41.401]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.401 --> 02:22:48.304]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.304 --> 02:22:56.568]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.568 --> 02:22:58.149]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:58.149 --> 02:22:59.350]  The people strike back.
[02:23:01.678 --> 02:23:09.741]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[02:23:09.741 --> 02:23:11.342]  You need the Paclite!
[02:23:11.342 --> 02:23:19.584]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[02:23:19.584 --> 02:23:23.126]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[02:23:23.126 --> 02:23:27.967]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[02:23:27.967 --> 02:23:29.228]  The Paclite is so durable,
[02:23:29.488 --> 02:23:34.331]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[02:23:34.331 --> 02:23:38.994]  The PackLite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[02:23:38.994 --> 02:23:45.998]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[02:23:45.998 --> 02:23:49.560]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.

[02:23:54.223 --> 02:24:05.053]  This film is not about left or right.
[02:24:05.053 --> 02:24:06.514]  It is non-partisan.
[02:24:06.514 --> 02:24:14.441]  Our past documentary films are among some of the most damning indictments of George W. Bush and his administration that have ever been made.
[02:24:18.408 --> 02:24:30.439]  If humanity has any hope of effecting real change for the better, it will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality makers who have cast Barack Obama as the savior of the world.
[02:24:30.439 --> 02:24:38.307]  To alter our course from tyranny to liberty, to defeat the corrupt elite, we must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet.
[02:24:44.338 --> 02:24:52.903]  Obama pledged in hundreds of speeches and interviews that within six months of being elected, he was going to bring our troops home from Iraq.
[02:24:52.903 --> 02:24:56.164]  But after he was inaugurated, the story changed.
[02:24:56.164 --> 02:25:02.108]  Now he said that they would look at bringing some of the troops home in 16 months.
[02:25:02.108 --> 02:25:05.089]  Two weeks later, his story had changed again.
[02:25:05.089 --> 02:25:10.232]  Now the administration would look at bringing the troops home in 23 months.
[02:25:10.232 --> 02:25:11.993]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:25:12.662 --> 02:25:21.069]  He's fudged since day one of this election, where he first said we're getting out, well now it's a timetable and now it's da-da-da, because they're getting to him.
[02:25:21.069 --> 02:25:27.194]  They're understanding that he ain't going to be able to get them out because people more powerful than him got us in.
[02:25:27.194 --> 02:25:30.857]  When he first ran, remember, he was going to take the troops out.
[02:25:30.857 --> 02:25:33.719]  I get in there, troops come home.
[02:25:33.719 --> 02:25:35.060]  Day one.
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:38.603]  There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was.
[02:25:38.603 --> 02:25:42.386]  I will begin to remove our troops from Iraq immediately.
[02:25:43.154 --> 02:25:46.416]  And then that went to 16 months.
[02:25:46.416 --> 02:25:52.859]  And now he's gonna add this saying another 30,000 or more troops to Afghanistan.
[02:25:52.859 --> 02:26:01.983]  Next, he sent 30,000 more Marines to Afghanistan, doubling the total number of forces in the crosshairs.
[02:26:01.983 --> 02:26:07.586]  Barack then announced that he was going to move missile systems into Eastern Europe to encircle Russia.
[02:26:07.586 --> 02:26:09.567]  But after all, what should we expect?
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.203]  After he kept Bush's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates.
[02:26:14.203 --> 02:26:36.677]  The outcome of this policy is if you're constantly meddling near the Russian borders with these fascist creeps, IMF, NATO agents like Yushchenko of Ukraine, or Saakashvili of Georgia, or these Kachinsky twins in Poland, or various collections of people in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, you're tied to these gangsters and if they decide to start a war,
[02:26:37.059 --> 02:26:40.461]  That rapidly escalates into thermonuclear World War III.
[02:26:40.461 --> 02:26:42.101]  This is worse than the neocons.
[02:26:42.101 --> 02:26:49.145]  Bush and Cheney never got as far as Brzezinski, Soros, and the other people running Obama.
[02:26:49.145 --> 02:26:53.607]  Barack Obama swore that he would vote to repeal the Patriot Act.
[02:26:53.607 --> 02:26:56.828]  But then he voted for its reauthorization.
[02:26:56.828 --> 02:27:02.971]  Obama decried the Bush administration's illegal warrantless wiretapping of the American people.
[02:27:02.971 --> 02:27:04.672]  Then he voted to legalize it.
[02:27:06.829 --> 02:27:20.351]  Obama pledged that he would filibuster any attempt to give retroactive immunity to the telephone companies, the telecom companies, except he then turned around and voted for that bill.
[02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:27.493]  Most people don't know, for example, that he voted to reinstate the Patriot Act and more government wiretapping.
[02:27:27.493 --> 02:27:36.134]  Candidate Obama told desperate factory workers in speech after speech that he was going to renegotiate NAFTA and GATT to make it more fair for American workers.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.163]  It is absolutely true that NAFTA was a mistake.
[02:27:41.163 --> 02:27:49.049]  But then his campaign was caught sending out memos to top corporate leaders, telling them not to worry, and that it was just campaign rhetoric.
[02:27:49.049 --> 02:27:54.012]  We had Obama saying, you know, I'm against free trade, I don't like NAFTA and all those free trade sellouts.
[02:27:54.012 --> 02:28:03.299]  We had Austin Goolsbee going to the Canadian diplomats and saying, don't, don't mind him, he's just popping off, that's just election era rhetoric, doesn't mean anything.
[02:28:03.299 --> 02:28:04.980]  Presidential candidate Barack Obama
[02:28:06.763 --> 02:28:17.189]  He said that he was going to bring us peace in the Middle East.
[02:28:17.189 --> 02:28:23.012]  He said that he was going to bring us transparency and a balanced economy.
[02:28:23.012 --> 02:28:27.395]  He said that he was going to not have lobbyists.
[02:28:27.395 --> 02:28:30.236]  He said he was going to clean up government.
[02:28:30.236 --> 02:28:32.878]  He said he was going to work for the environment.
[02:28:33.655 --> 02:28:52.369]  And point by point by point, within the first month of his inauguration, he has lied and deceived and cheated the American people.
[02:28:52.369 --> 02:28:55.852]  Humankind is at a historic crossroads.
[02:28:55.852 --> 02:29:00.175]  The forces of globalism are marching towards absolute despotism.
[02:29:01.062 --> 02:29:05.824]  Look in the mirror, count the cost, and decide.
[02:29:05.824 --> 02:29:09.486]  Are you going to let history repeat itself?
[02:29:09.486 --> 02:29:17.830]  Or will you stand tall with freedom lovers everywhere and stop the completion of a world dictatorship?
[02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:23.753]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:29:23.753 --> 02:29:29.115]  The information contained in this film is vital to the future of the Republic and to freedom worldwide.

[02:29:38.077 --> 02:29:39.778]  The Obama Deception.
[02:29:39.778 --> 02:29:51.944]  The truth strikes back.
[02:29:51.944 --> 02:29:53.345]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.345 --> 02:29:55.866]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.866 --> 02:29:58.568]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.661 --> 02:30:03.343]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:30:03.343 --> 02:30:05.085]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:30:05.085 --> 02:30:07.767]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:30:07.767 --> 02:30:12.912]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:30:12.912 --> 02:30:16.116]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:30:16.116 --> 02:30:19.579]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:30:20.006 --> 02:30:32.555]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:30:32.555 --> 02:30:34.577]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:30:34.577 --> 02:30:36.278]  I use one every day.
[02:30:36.278 --> 02:30:38.740]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:42.142]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.314 --> 02:31:14.199]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:14.199 --> 02:31:20.705]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.705 --> 02:31:22.686]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.686 --> 02:31:25.129]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:25.129 --> 02:31:36.018]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.323 --> 02:31:39.984]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.984 --> 02:31:41.845]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.845 --> 02:31:48.748]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:57.012 --> 02:31:58.573]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.573 --> 02:31:59.774]  The people strike back.
[02:32:02.071 --> 02:32:05.893]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[02:32:24.901 --> 02:32:27.623]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[02:32:27.623 --> 02:32:29.764]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[02:32:29.764 --> 02:32:30.725]  this fall?
[02:32:30.725 --> 02:32:31.645]  Don't wait.
[02:32:31.645 --> 02:32:35.608]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[02:32:56.801 --> 02:32:57.501]  So much going on.
[02:32:57.501 --> 02:32:58.101]  So much going on.
[02:33:12.754 --> 02:33:27.721]  Alright, I'm going to blitz through your phone calls in a moment, but guess what John Gibson wanted me on about?
[02:33:27.721 --> 02:33:31.623]  He claimed he wanted me on about the Obama deception, but we knew better.
[02:33:31.623 --> 02:33:34.804]  When I heard this this morning, I said it's going to be about the detainees.
[02:33:34.804 --> 02:33:38.986]  They say they planned September 11th.
[02:33:38.986 --> 02:33:40.487]  So I go on Fox Radio.
[02:33:41.977 --> 02:33:43.578]  And I attack Rupert Murdoch.
[02:33:43.578 --> 02:33:47.599]  Never even got to this back on Monday.
[02:33:47.599 --> 02:33:54.262]  Fox News put out a video press release admitting that they plant pro-global warming, pro-global carbon tax.
[02:33:54.262 --> 02:34:00.404]  I think Kurt Nemo did a story on it, or was it Paul Watson?
[02:34:00.404 --> 02:34:03.185]  Propaganda in basically all of their TV shows and films.
[02:34:03.185 --> 02:34:07.546]  In fact, guys, Google that for me, so I can remember the headline again.
[02:34:07.546 --> 02:34:08.467]  Folks, I won't have time to play it.
[02:34:10.868 --> 02:34:16.313]  Rupert Murdoch admits they're planting pro-global warming messages.
[02:34:16.313 --> 02:34:18.815]  I think that's the headline.
[02:34:18.815 --> 02:34:19.656]  Maybe I'll have time to play it.
[02:34:19.656 --> 02:34:20.797]  It's like five minutes long.
[02:34:20.797 --> 02:34:26.262]  All these clips of the TV shows where they say they're implanting it to manipulate you.
[02:34:26.262 --> 02:34:26.982]  I brought that up.
[02:34:26.982 --> 02:34:29.684]  Gibson didn't like that and said, bye-bye, Alex.
[02:34:29.684 --> 02:34:30.165]  Bye-bye.
[02:34:31.274 --> 02:34:32.455]  And he said there's no New World Order.
[02:34:32.455 --> 02:34:33.916]  They're not announcing it in all the newspapers.
[02:34:33.916 --> 02:34:34.937]  He said that was made up.
[02:34:34.937 --> 02:34:36.778]  That they're not setting up a Bank of the World.
[02:34:36.778 --> 02:34:37.839]  It's all made up.
[02:34:37.839 --> 02:34:38.379]  None of it's real.
[02:34:38.379 --> 02:34:40.660]  It doesn't matter if it's in hundreds of newspapers a week.
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:42.562]  Being announced as a savior doesn't exist, Alex!
[02:34:42.562 --> 02:34:43.122]  You're insane!
[02:34:43.122 --> 02:34:43.923]  Ha ha!
[02:34:43.923 --> 02:34:47.926]  Playing helicopter noises in the background.
[02:34:47.926 --> 02:34:52.669]  How's your 401k doing, John Gibson?
[02:34:52.669 --> 02:34:53.750]  You like the New World Order?
[02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:56.051]  Oh, it doesn't exist.
[02:34:56.051 --> 02:34:56.551]  So, um...
[02:34:57.751 --> 02:35:01.313]  I go on, and he says, the 9-11 Truth Movement is dead!
[02:35:01.313 --> 02:35:02.013]  It is dead!
[02:35:02.013 --> 02:35:05.696]  Detainees say they planned September 11th.
[02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:16.902]  Remember, a year and a half ago, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed came out after four years in captivity, and they admittedly threatened his children.
[02:35:16.902 --> 02:35:17.502]  That was in the news.
[02:35:17.502 --> 02:35:22.045]  And we finally got him to talk by threatening his children.
[02:35:22.045 --> 02:35:25.547]  And Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is supposedly the mastermind, number two to bin Laden,
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:37.584]  confessed to carrying out bombings against buildings in the world that weren't built till two years after he was incarcerated.
[02:35:37.584 --> 02:35:39.785]  And we have this gaggle of five people.
[02:35:39.785 --> 02:35:40.826]  No video, no nothing.
[02:35:40.826 --> 02:35:43.687]  I'm sure they're rendering that video out soon.
[02:35:43.687 --> 02:35:44.707]  We'll see that.
[02:35:44.707 --> 02:35:47.528]  Just like you saw Forrest Gump shake hands with JFK.
[02:35:47.528 --> 02:35:48.949]  It must be real!
[02:35:48.949 --> 02:35:55.732]  While you saw Arnold Schwarzenegger fight the T2 and it turned into a silver blob and then it... Not real, folks!
[02:35:57.398 --> 02:36:07.444]  And the Intel Center's been caught loading their logo into the same video layer as the Al Qaeda logo with the grandson of the ADL, Adam Gadahn, running around.
[02:36:07.444 --> 02:36:15.850]  You know what, go ahead and cue up this.
[02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:17.211]  There's a video on this story.
[02:36:17.211 --> 02:36:18.372]  Go ahead and cue it up.
[02:36:18.372 --> 02:36:21.954]  We're not doing PrisonPlanet.tv until next hour, but I can play the audio here.
[02:36:21.954 --> 02:36:25.656]  Yeah, the headline is, Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[02:36:25.656 --> 02:36:26.417]  But let's stop right there.
[02:36:27.588 --> 02:36:29.629]  People, when they admit it, then they say it doesn't exist.
[02:36:29.629 --> 02:36:33.411]  It's a little mind control thing they do to get you off balance.
[02:36:33.411 --> 02:36:46.959]  But, you know, I brought up, I said, well, my goodness, if I get grabbed and I'm held for five, six, seven years, and admittedly where they're tortured, and then it's a secret military tribunal, and then a press release gets put out where I say, I'm proud that I carried out the 9-11 attacks.
[02:36:46.959 --> 02:36:47.820]  I'm very proud.
[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:49.601]  I'm a terrorist to the bone.
[02:36:49.601 --> 02:36:53.563]  I mean, written like a Hollywood script writer would write it for the popcorn-gobbling public.
[02:36:58.570 --> 02:37:00.991]  And it says detainees say they planned September 11th.
[02:37:00.991 --> 02:37:09.115]  The five detainees at Guantanamo Bay charged with planning the September 11, 2001 terror attacks have filed a document with the Military Commission at the United States Naval Base.
[02:37:09.115 --> 02:37:15.198]  They're expressing pride at their accomplishment and accepting full responsibility for killing nearly 3,000 people.
[02:37:15.198 --> 02:37:25.823]  Boy, they couldn't get it for six, seven years, but magically now, and they admit these aren't real courts, they're kangaroo courts, they're secret courts, magically after all these years,
[02:37:29.983 --> 02:37:37.768]  The 9-1-1 Sharia Council comes out wearing their Santa Claus hats and they did it!
[02:37:38.871 --> 02:37:40.592]  Yes, they made NORAD stand down.
[02:37:40.592 --> 02:37:45.395]  Yes, they ran drills with NORAD of the exact targets being attacked at the same time.
[02:37:45.395 --> 02:37:48.077]  They had the Air Force codes.
[02:37:48.077 --> 02:37:50.139]  They could order the stand down.
[02:37:50.139 --> 02:37:54.501]  They made Building 7 collapse when it wasn't hit by an airplane in its own footprint.
[02:37:54.501 --> 02:37:57.363]  And they made the police walk around on camera and say, we've been told to get back.
[02:37:57.363 --> 02:37:58.664]  They're going to blow up Building 7.
[02:37:58.664 --> 02:38:01.646]  And then they made Larry Silverstein come out and say they blew it up.
[02:38:01.646 --> 02:38:06.529]  And then they, they did it all, ladies and gentlemen, because they are like Dr. Manhattan.
[02:38:06.529 --> 02:38:08.511]  They have magical, godlike powers.
[02:38:10.592 --> 02:38:14.013]  And then John Gibson was just like, it's over Alex, it's over.
[02:38:14.013 --> 02:38:14.633]  They've confessed.
[02:38:14.633 --> 02:38:15.834]  Everyone knows the truth now.
[02:38:15.834 --> 02:38:16.374]  It's incredible.
[02:38:16.374 --> 02:38:17.714]  And I said, oh really, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?
[02:38:17.714 --> 02:38:20.395]  Oh, don't say that, don't get into that.
[02:38:20.395 --> 02:38:27.838]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed now has admitted that he didn't do any of that and they admit it was all baloney.
[02:38:27.838 --> 02:38:39.702]  It took him five years to finally cook up a story with Mohammed, four plus years in custody, and now almost seven years, hundreds and hundreds, actually it's in the thousands that have been run through Guantanamo Bay,
[02:38:41.195 --> 02:38:54.605]  I had on the CIA section chief who wrote the book Jawbreaker three years ago, and he admitted that they give $25,000 bonuses and that the Taliban just goes and grabs literal camel herder 14-year-olds out of the hills, who don't even know where the U.S.
[02:38:54.605 --> 02:39:01.711]  is on a map, and then go sell them to the Pentagon for $20,000 to $25,000 a piece, and they're taking the Guantanamo Bay.
[02:39:04.022 --> 02:39:18.002]  And what Guantanamo Bay and the scores of other secret camps are all about, it's come out, is laboratories of torture, but also creating agents, people they say, look, work for us, and they psychologically test them and give them little missions, we'll let you go, and then you can go infiltrate groups.
[02:39:22.813 --> 02:39:24.654]  This is how they do it.
[02:39:24.654 --> 02:39:28.016]  This is how intelligence, I mean, this is how intelligence operations operate.
[02:39:28.016 --> 02:39:30.698]  And I'm saying to Gibson, Gibson, is there, is it not admitted that the U.S.
[02:39:30.698 --> 02:39:32.359]  government staged terror attacks before?
[02:39:32.359 --> 02:39:33.800]  Is that not on record?
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:37.602]  Is it not in official Army field manuals how to stage terror attacks?
[02:39:37.602 --> 02:39:39.683]  No, no, it's not.
[02:39:39.683 --> 02:39:44.546]  And there's no New World Order, it's not all over the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and everywhere else saying, no, no.
[02:39:44.546 --> 02:39:45.787]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:39:50.359 --> 02:39:54.221]  I mean, this is the type of brick wall that we deal with.
[02:39:54.221 --> 02:39:56.803]  Guys in there, go ahead and roll.
[02:39:56.803 --> 02:40:11.291]  This is a video press release by Fox admitting that they plant messages in there to manipulate your mind, this is the conservative Fox, to accept global warming and that we have to have a carbon tax.
[02:40:11.291 --> 02:40:11.651]  Here it is.
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:27.744]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[02:40:27.744 --> 02:40:29.745]  How does April on record?
[02:40:29.745 --> 02:40:30.825]  Global warming.
[02:40:30.825 --> 02:40:31.645]  Probably.
[02:40:31.645 --> 02:40:35.807]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:40.603]  Three years is a long ways away!
[02:40:40.603 --> 02:40:45.607]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[02:40:45.607 --> 02:40:47.789]  Just had another thought.
[02:40:47.789 --> 02:40:50.991]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[02:40:50.991 --> 02:40:59.338]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[02:40:59.338 --> 02:41:00.639]  I don't follow.
[02:41:00.639 --> 02:41:01.240]  Green!
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:02.901]  It means environmentally friendly.
[02:41:03.021 --> 02:41:10.464]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows, and we would accomplish nothing if we compromised that quality.
[02:41:10.464 --> 02:41:13.965]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[02:41:13.965 --> 02:41:14.825]  We're working magic.
[02:41:14.825 --> 02:41:15.526]  Make it fit.
[02:41:15.526 --> 02:41:16.366]  Hey, Brian!
[02:41:16.366 --> 02:41:18.086]  I'm not gonna recycle this aluminum can.
[02:41:18.086 --> 02:41:19.347]  I'm just gonna throw it in the trash.
[02:41:21.991 --> 02:41:23.532]  You're Earth's bitch!
[02:41:23.532 --> 02:41:45.025]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about empowering people to take responsibility.
[02:41:45.025 --> 02:41:47.046]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[02:41:50.254 --> 02:41:57.079]  We're having a green wedding, so after the reception, our guests can plant the programs, grow flowers.
[02:41:57.079 --> 02:42:02.303]  I could live in the sea, make friends with a whale, and we'd live in a sunken pirate ship.
[02:42:02.303 --> 02:42:03.925]  That'd show global warming!
[02:42:03.925 --> 02:42:08.348]  We've come up with, you know, all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint.
[02:42:08.348 --> 02:42:13.972]  Everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production.
[02:42:13.972 --> 02:42:15.313]  Look at all these Hummers.
[02:42:15.313 --> 02:42:16.955]  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[02:42:18.772 --> 02:42:22.915]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[02:42:22.915 --> 02:42:24.616]  Yeah, Rumsfeld!
[02:42:24.616 --> 02:42:29.539]  We're using biodiesel fuel in our generators instead of regular diesel.
[02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:31.420]  No car, no electricity.
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:32.601]  Cough for me?
[02:42:33.849 --> 02:42:35.971]  I got a zero carbon footprint.
[02:42:35.971 --> 02:42:40.234]  We're now frequently getting scripts electronically.
[02:42:40.234 --> 02:42:42.575]  Fluorescent bulbs that use less electricity.
[02:42:42.575 --> 02:42:44.737]  Reusable hemp bags for shopping.
[02:42:44.737 --> 02:42:46.998]  Shampoo that's not tested on animals.
[02:42:46.998 --> 02:42:51.862]  I feel bad for those lab animals running around with dirty hair, but better for the environment.
[02:42:51.862 --> 02:42:53.283]  That's a sacrifice they have to make.
[02:42:54.144 --> 02:42:58.425]  Here at 24, we are committed to reducing our impact on climate change.
[02:42:58.425 --> 02:43:06.707]  Now, we know that we can't solve this problem in 24 hours, but by making energy-conscious decisions on our set, we are contributing to a solution.
[02:43:06.707 --> 02:43:15.770]  Galvanizing that kind of an effort with as many people as it has taken to get on board and sort of help us with this effort, it hasn't been difficult.
[02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:21.071]  On the contrary, it's been rewarding and people have acted swiftly and enthusiastically.
[02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:23.311]  He's powering the blender.
[02:43:23.311 --> 02:43:25.473]  The wheel rim is attached to a generator.
[02:43:25.473 --> 02:43:26.915]  This is rather ingenious.
[02:43:26.915 --> 02:43:28.576]  Stay fit and save energy.
[02:43:28.576 --> 02:43:31.098]  If everyone should do it, I'm sure it'll catch on.
[02:43:31.098 --> 02:43:37.684]  Mr. McKay says that history is past, but saving the Earth is our present to the future.
[02:43:38.264 --> 02:43:39.025]  Oh.
[02:43:39.025 --> 02:43:47.909]  The fact that this company decided to get behind the move to try to bring an end to global warming was really gratifying.
[02:43:47.909 --> 02:43:52.732]  Finally, I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows.
[02:43:52.732 --> 02:43:56.113]  Oh, 20th Century Fox brainwashing everybody.
[02:43:56.113 --> 02:43:58.835]  Ah, Hans Blitz, come on in, buddy.
[02:44:06.358 --> 02:44:09.263]  Ah, Alec Baldwin, you have been very useful for me.
[02:44:09.263 --> 02:44:09.303]  Um...
[02:44:12.239 --> 02:44:13.820]  It just never ends.
[02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:15.540]  This is your conservative Fox News now.
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:23.683]  The NFL, all the major corporations, global warming is real, global tax, new global order, run by a new global bank of the world that we will pay our carbon taxes to.
[02:44:23.683 --> 02:44:28.385]  They will defeat the bankers by giving the bankers unlimited power!
[02:44:28.385 --> 02:44:37.048]  Every publication, everywhere, the Austin American-Statesman, the New York Times, every, I mean, every day you Google the term new world order in the news section.
[02:44:38.308 --> 02:44:49.820]  It is saying world government, of and for and by the bankers, exactly what they said they do decades ago, we've been warning people about, and their counter is, no, no, no, doesn't exist.
[02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:52.763]  Hey, they're moving the army and all the major police departments.
[02:44:52.763 --> 02:44:56.808]  Shut up, doesn't exist, but the army's good and they need to be on the streets, but they don't exist on the streets.
[02:44:59.059 --> 02:45:05.040]  Hey, you can't torture people for six, seven years and then have them confess in a press release in a secret tribunal.
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:07.561]  That's why you don't allow torture, because it gets fake confessions.
[02:45:07.561 --> 02:45:08.721]  Remember the Inquisitors?
[02:45:08.721 --> 02:45:09.442]  Shut up!
[02:45:09.442 --> 02:45:10.122]  Shut up!
[02:45:10.122 --> 02:45:11.742]  Shut up!
[02:45:11.742 --> 02:45:13.222]  Al-Qaeda did it!
[02:45:13.222 --> 02:45:19.984]  Now North Com's gotta be on our streets to fight Al-Qaeda!
[02:45:19.984 --> 02:45:20.864]  Dan in Alabama.
[02:45:20.864 --> 02:45:21.805]  You're on the air, Dan.
[02:45:21.805 --> 02:45:24.045]  Welcome.
[02:45:24.045 --> 02:45:24.645]  Hey, buddy.
[02:45:24.645 --> 02:45:25.986]  It's actually Alaska.
[02:45:25.986 --> 02:45:27.206]  Okay, they told me Alabama.
[02:45:29.002 --> 02:45:29.822]  This is Keebler.
[02:45:29.822 --> 02:45:31.923]  Well, we've got Alabama on the brain.
[02:45:31.923 --> 02:45:32.704]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:45:32.704 --> 02:45:33.144]  I understand.
[02:45:33.144 --> 02:45:55.755]  Hey, man, I listened to you talk to the colonel there, and I want to say that when I took the oath of enlistment, it says, I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear
[02:45:56.610 --> 02:45:57.470]  He said, I can't get into that.
[02:46:24.702 --> 02:46:35.409]  Sir, you are supposed to defend the Constitution of the United States, so when somebody asks you if you support the Second Amendment, your answer should be, yes, I do.
[02:46:35.409 --> 02:46:38.531]  Not, I can't get into that.
[02:46:38.531 --> 02:46:45.956]  Now, and that's not the reason why I called, Alex, but that does irritate me to hear my superiors that I'm supposed to obey... So you're currently in the Army?
[02:46:46.764 --> 02:46:47.744]  I'm in the Air Force, sir.
[02:46:47.744 --> 02:46:49.385]  Okay.
[02:46:49.385 --> 02:46:49.945]  Yeah.
[02:46:49.945 --> 02:46:51.366]  Go ahead.
[02:46:51.366 --> 02:46:56.087]  Anyways, the biggest reason I called you today is because I listened to the show yesterday.
[02:46:56.087 --> 02:46:59.589]  That AN transmitter really sparked my interest.
[02:46:59.589 --> 02:47:03.390]  I want to get one, but I can't do it by myself.
[02:47:03.390 --> 02:47:10.953]  I was hoping that I could spew out my email address so that anybody in the Anchorage area could
[02:47:12.731 --> 02:47:16.933]  Could you contact me and maybe together we can get something going?
[02:47:16.933 --> 02:47:24.376]  That's right, join forces and put in a legal, lawful, FCC certified AM transmitter that will go out 3 miles.
[02:47:24.376 --> 02:47:26.097]  Yes.
[02:47:26.097 --> 02:47:28.658]  Give out your contact info.
[02:47:28.658 --> 02:47:30.279]  It's am4freedom.com
[02:47:32.515 --> 02:47:32.775]  A.M.
[02:47:32.775 --> 02:47:36.516]  for Freedom is one word, of course, at hotmail.com.
[02:47:36.516 --> 02:47:45.518]  I want to stream your show, and then anything else on there that people want to deny, like your buddies over there at Fox that you just got done having in their rear end.
[02:47:45.518 --> 02:47:47.959]  So, thank you, Alex.
[02:47:47.959 --> 02:47:50.579]  You're a huge inspiration.
[02:47:50.579 --> 02:47:53.420]  Please drop the Obama Deception ASAP.
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:55.321]  I'm going to make several copies of it.
[02:47:55.321 --> 02:47:59.802]  Me and another buddy that is also in the Air Force, we're going to make several copies of it.
[02:47:59.802 --> 02:48:00.702]  We're going to pass it out.
[02:48:01.463 --> 02:48:11.666]  And if any of these Obama minions come running around to the house wanting to know whether or not to check our name for a supporter or a non-supporter, we're going to go ahead and pass it out to them as well.
[02:48:11.666 --> 02:48:13.126]  Boy, doesn't that sound like freedom?
[02:48:13.126 --> 02:48:20.929]  Military moving into the police departments, military popping up at drunk driving checkpoints for the citizens, people knocking on your doors asking if you support.
[02:48:20.929 --> 02:48:22.169]  I mean, this is out of control.
[02:48:22.967 --> 02:48:26.350]  Oh, you know, but Alex, they're here to protect us.
[02:48:26.350 --> 02:48:31.395]  Who cares if the Posse Comitatus Act, you know, is there to protect the people?
[02:48:32.323 --> 02:48:34.804]  That don't matter.
[02:48:34.804 --> 02:48:36.844]  The Army is our friend.
[02:48:36.844 --> 02:48:37.584]  Whatever.
[02:48:37.584 --> 02:48:49.947]  Look, they thought the police 15 years ago were so dumb that I have police training manuals where they say if someone talks about the Bill of Rights, if someone says posse comitatus, that's code for racism.
[02:48:49.947 --> 02:48:51.588]  And so people say, hey, why are troops here?
[02:48:51.588 --> 02:48:52.328]  Posse comitatus.
[02:48:52.328 --> 02:48:55.009]  They go, we got one of the racists.
[02:48:55.009 --> 02:48:57.329]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are, police.
[02:48:57.329 --> 02:48:59.490]  Are you that stupid?
[02:48:59.490 --> 02:48:59.990]  Come on, now.
[02:49:01.107 --> 02:49:02.269]  Wake up, people.
[02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:03.291]  Realize what's going on.
[02:49:05.987 --> 02:49:12.452]  Now, I've got to say that, you know, I want to make sure that that Colonel, if he's listening, it's all due respect, sir.
[02:49:12.452 --> 02:49:14.333]  All due respect.
[02:49:14.333 --> 02:49:20.258]  You do support the Constitution, foreign and against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:49:20.258 --> 02:49:21.379]  Maybe folks should call him.
[02:49:21.379 --> 02:49:22.140]  I've got to jump, Dan.
[02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:22.780]  Good to hear from you.
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:32.548]  We're going to come back and take more calls from not just Dan, of course, up in Alaska, but Mike in Kentucky, Ronnie in Texas, Matt in Missouri, Craig
[02:49:33.949 --> 02:49:38.333]  In Philly and others that are patiently holding.
[02:49:38.333 --> 02:49:43.257]  I do want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this show possible and will help you be independent and self-sufficient.
[02:49:43.257 --> 02:49:45.439]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:49:45.439 --> 02:49:47.581]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[02:49:47.581 --> 02:49:51.825]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest-operating food company in the country.
[02:49:51.825 --> 02:49:54.888]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years.
[02:49:55.368 --> 02:50:04.555]  Well, the looming food shortages and current economic collapse is an imperative that you make sure your family are prepared with non-GMO, good, clean, storable foods.
[02:50:04.555 --> 02:50:05.476]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:50:05.476 --> 02:50:05.616]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:50:05.616 --> 02:50:06.757]  Don't procrastinate anymore.
[02:50:06.757 --> 02:50:09.960]  Don't procrastinate about going to buy firearms and ammo either, and water filters.
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:10.600]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:12.101]  They have a great three-day first responder.
[02:50:21.869 --> 02:50:23.991]  Package up there on the side as well.
[02:50:23.991 --> 02:50:24.831]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:50:24.831 --> 02:50:26.953]  Also another great sponsor, Ecolablue.

[02:50:29.414 --> 02:50:30.835]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.

[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:38.941]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.

[02:50:39.642 --> 02:50:43.524]  Sends it through seven filters, including reverse, osmosis, and carbon filter.

[02:50:57.165 --> 02:50:58.046]  Stay with us.
[02:50:58.046 --> 02:50:59.128]  Transmission continues.
[02:51:01.974 --> 02:51:06.556]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[02:51:50.461 --> 02:51:52.163]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:52:05.447 --> 02:52:08.069]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:08.069 --> 02:52:15.053]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.658 --> 02:52:22.244]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:22.244 --> 02:52:24.226]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:24.226 --> 02:52:26.708]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.708 --> 02:52:37.518]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:38.286 --> 02:52:39.948]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.948 --> 02:52:41.810]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.810 --> 02:52:48.737]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:54:04.938 --> 02:54:09.260]  Gerald Salente is coming up at the end after big development just happened during the break.
[02:54:09.260 --> 02:54:14.483]  It'll be good that we're live at prisonplanet.tv so there'll be a visual record of this.
[02:54:14.483 --> 02:54:17.725]  Remember the different terror training manuals that we were just talking about?
[02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:21.563]  We're just talking about before we went to break.
[02:54:21.563 --> 02:54:30.551]  Remember the constitutional terrorist flyer that went out to thousands of police agencies that said those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:54:30.551 --> 02:54:34.315]  Constitution, those that talk about a new world order?
[02:54:34.315 --> 02:54:39.160]  A police officer just sent it to us and Tim's confirmed it and I've seen similar ones before.
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:42.143]  This is an updated version of one I've seen over and over again right here in Austin.
[02:54:43.888 --> 02:54:50.373]  And it states, if you believe they're setting up a North American Union, they show official North American Union maps from the SPP.
[02:54:50.373 --> 02:54:53.216]  They say it doesn't exist, you're insane and dangerous.
[02:54:53.216 --> 02:54:56.058]  And they mention that, you know, there's a new world order being set up by banks.
[02:54:56.058 --> 02:54:58.460]  That doesn't exist, you're insane if it says it does.
[02:54:58.460 --> 02:54:59.761]  This is how it's going to work.
[02:54:59.761 --> 02:55:03.264]  You're going to say you love the World Bank and pay your taxes to it publicly.
[02:55:03.264 --> 02:55:08.609]  And then if you see it on TV, or paying your taxes to it, and say it exists, you're going to be called a terrorist.
[02:55:09.540 --> 02:55:12.041]  Now, if that isn't mind control, I don't know what is.
[02:55:12.041 --> 02:55:21.303]  We're setting up world government, the troops are going to be on the streets, but it doesn't exist, and these crazy conspiracy theorists are dangerous terrorist militias.
[02:55:21.303 --> 02:55:23.024]  So, I was just scanning through during the break.
[02:55:23.024 --> 02:55:24.364]  Amazing information.
[02:55:24.364 --> 02:55:26.565]  We will spend five minutes while Gerald Cilente is on.
[02:55:26.565 --> 02:55:28.165]  This is so important, I almost moved him.
[02:55:28.165 --> 02:55:29.425]  I already moved one guest today.
[02:55:29.425 --> 02:55:33.986]  During the first hour, I had to tell the mass shooting and the troops on the streets in Alabama what happened in Germany.
[02:55:33.986 --> 02:55:35.567]  Clearly, this stinks to high heaven.
[02:55:38.615 --> 02:55:41.958]  Well, we're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv here in just a few minutes.
[02:55:41.958 --> 02:55:45.300]  We'll go live at the start of the next hour.
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:46.521]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:55:46.521 --> 02:55:47.402]  Mike in Kentucky.
[02:55:47.402 --> 02:55:49.003]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:55:49.003 --> 02:55:52.786]  Hi, I was just wanting to call and comment on what you said earlier.
[02:55:52.786 --> 02:55:56.448]  You were talking about earlier how the media has been putting a spin on it.
[02:55:56.448 --> 02:56:03.594]  It seems like everything, pretty much anything that comes out now that relates to guns or any kind of violence like that.
[02:56:04.532 --> 02:56:16.841]  I live here in Bowling Green, Kentucky and I was watching the local news the other day and they were talking about how the Marines had pretty much recruited 20 teachers out of this school.
[02:56:17.904 --> 02:56:18.804]  Well, it wouldn't.
[02:56:18.804 --> 02:56:21.726]  They were saying that it was for recruitment purposes.
[02:56:21.726 --> 02:56:25.808]  Yeah, under federal law, they're all in the schools, threatening children with arrest.
[02:56:25.808 --> 02:56:29.089]  If they don't sign up with the military, saying it's the law, they've got to sign the contract.
[02:56:29.089 --> 02:56:31.751]  Just like they say, it's the law, you've got to take vaccines when it isn't.
[02:56:31.751 --> 02:56:36.173]  And everywhere, they're taking over the schools, the government buildings, they're moving in everywhere.
[02:56:36.173 --> 02:56:37.874]  I mean, this is so off the charts.
[02:56:37.874 --> 02:56:40.915]  They recruited the preachers, they recruited the executives.
[02:56:40.915 --> 02:56:42.016]  It is on.
[02:56:42.016 --> 02:56:44.677]  Right, and I just can't, I mean, I can't believe how obvious the
[02:56:45.461 --> 02:56:46.281]  The media is.
[02:56:46.281 --> 02:56:50.243]  I mean, if people don't understand that something's going on right now, I mean, they're just completely blind.
[02:56:50.243 --> 02:56:52.044]  Well, but most people don't even watch the news.
[02:56:52.044 --> 02:57:02.068]  They watch sitcoms and dramas and TV shows, and they admit it's filled with anti-gun, pro-world government, pro-carbon tax, pro-military on the street.
[02:57:02.068 --> 02:57:04.689]  It's all... And then they just say, no, there's no propaganda.
[02:57:04.689 --> 02:57:07.450]  We go, well, here's the news admitting they're implanting messages.
[02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:08.430]  No!
[02:57:08.430 --> 02:57:09.151]  No!
[02:57:09.151 --> 02:57:11.032]  And see, I don't even watch them shows.
[02:57:11.032 --> 02:57:12.632]  My wife does, you know, pretty much.
[02:57:12.632 --> 02:57:14.333]  She's the one who watches them shows around here.
[02:57:15.191 --> 02:57:31.670]  Me and her have been into it a lot, but anyways, she watches the show Ugly Betty, and she was watching it and I walked into the living room and I seen the show was on, and I sit there and I seen it for a minute, and it just so happened when I started watching it that they were talking about a media bailout.
[02:57:34.065 --> 02:57:34.405]  Right.
[02:57:34.405 --> 02:57:35.906]  I just wanted to comment on that.
[02:57:35.906 --> 02:57:39.087]  It's right there in your face if people don't understand what's going on.
[02:57:54.082 --> 02:57:55.463]  You know, they're never going to.
[02:57:55.463 --> 02:58:08.631]  Mike, that's freedom to have propaganda and troops everywhere, and black helicopters in FEMA camps, and foreign bankers openly stealing $9.7 trillion, and openly announcing world government and then saying it doesn't exist if you criticize it.
[02:58:08.631 --> 02:58:10.232]  I mean, that's normal!
[02:58:10.232 --> 02:58:11.453]  Everything's fine!
[02:58:11.453 --> 02:58:15.696]  Yeah, they're making the drug control, ever since Obama's been elected,
[02:58:16.367 --> 02:58:18.309]  There's been a gun-related issue on the news.
[02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:22.872]  Look, they want to pull a Stalin-style mass operation.
[02:58:22.872 --> 02:58:27.256]  They are going for a red-hot, hot war against free humanity.
[02:58:27.256 --> 02:58:28.537]  This is it.
[02:58:28.537 --> 02:58:30.038]  They are going for broke.
[02:58:30.038 --> 02:58:33.221]  They are pulling out all of the stops.
[02:58:33.221 --> 02:58:36.603]  And I'm just thinking about pulling the trigger right now for the Obama deception.
[02:58:36.603 --> 02:58:38.785]  I mean, it could be up on PrisonPlanet.tv anytime.
[02:58:38.785 --> 02:58:43.128]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.128 --> 02:58:44.850]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.348 --> 02:58:53.050]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.050 --> 02:58:57.794]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.794 --> 02:59:00.756]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.756 --> 02:59:03.799]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.799 --> 02:59:08.523]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.743 --> 02:59:09.863]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.863 --> 02:59:13.105]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.105 --> 02:59:20.108]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.108 --> 02:59:23.369]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.369 --> 02:59:23.629]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:26.050 --> 02:59:28.511]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:59:38.555 --> 02:59:39.916]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:39.916 --> 02:59:40.536]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.317]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.321 --> 02:59:56.726]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.726 --> 03:00:00.513]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:00.513 --> 03:00:00.913]  Engage!
[03:00:11.443 --> 03:00:34.451]  All over the country, the police are openly merging with the military as the military moves into schools, government buildings, police departments, openly running checkpoints at shootings, DWIs, bar districts, Canada, England, Germany, Australia, the United States, troops everywhere, openly making their martial law move to acclimate the public with things that sound reasonable.
[03:00:34.451 --> 03:00:38.653]  Trends forecaster Gerald Cilente, who's been tracking all of this, is going to be joining us and
[03:00:39.693 --> 03:00:46.020]  Go ahead and put up on screen the if you encounter any of the following called the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:47.421]  This was sent out nationwide.
[03:00:47.421 --> 03:00:49.483]  This is the Phoenix version of it in 99.
[03:00:49.483 --> 03:00:51.806]  I have been sent scores of similar manuals.
[03:00:51.806 --> 03:00:58.552]  I've gotten the Austin manuals of them training that if someone makes a frequent reverence to the U.S.
[03:00:58.552 --> 03:01:00.655]  Constitution... Can you guys pull up the reverse side of the flyer?
[03:01:01.854 --> 03:01:02.755]  That's one of those threefold.
[03:01:02.755 --> 03:01:08.439]  I want to show people, it says, those that make frequent references to the Constitution.
[03:01:08.439 --> 03:01:11.182]  So if you talk about that, you're a terrorist.
[03:01:11.182 --> 03:01:13.444]  Second Amendment groups, quote, defenders of the U.S.
[03:01:13.444 --> 03:01:15.505]  Constitution against federal government and U.N.
[03:01:15.505 --> 03:01:16.846]  super patriots.
[03:01:16.846 --> 03:01:19.028]  Groups of individuals engaged in paramilitary training.
[03:01:20.089 --> 03:01:27.337]  And it goes on to say, uh, no driver's license, refuse to identify themselves, request authority for stop, make numerous references to the U.S.
[03:01:27.337 --> 03:01:33.964]  Constitution, claim driving is a right, not a privilege, attempt to police the police, yeah, how dare citizens be involved?
[03:01:33.964 --> 03:01:37.848]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[03:01:37.848 --> 03:01:37.988]  Now,
[03:01:40.638 --> 03:01:45.548]  I just got in and we made some calls and checked it, but I've already seen this very insert.
[03:01:45.548 --> 03:01:47.452]  It goes out every six months.
[03:01:47.452 --> 03:01:49.717]  So I've seen this over and over again.
[03:01:49.717 --> 03:01:50.498]  What you're about to see.
[03:01:51.601 --> 03:01:54.944]  Coming up a little bit later in the interview with Salente, but it's been updated.
[03:01:54.944 --> 03:02:00.949]  And let me tell you, you're a terrorist, folks, if you talk about the North American Union or the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[03:02:00.949 --> 03:02:03.011]  It doesn't exist, that's terrorism.
[03:02:03.011 --> 03:02:09.396]  If you talk about the New World Order banking conspiracy, which is all over the news, openly being announced, the banks are taking over with the New Bank of the World.
[03:02:09.396 --> 03:02:10.857]  Doesn't exist, you're insane.
[03:02:10.857 --> 03:02:12.899]  How dumb do they think the police are?
[03:02:12.899 --> 03:02:17.703]  That they're giving them this when it's all over the news, being announced, and, well, they're letting them know.
[03:02:17.703 --> 03:02:19.604]  This is not acceptable to believe in.
[03:02:20.465 --> 03:02:25.591]  And people that talk about this are dangerous to you and will kill you and that's what this says.
[03:02:25.591 --> 03:02:30.016]  They will try to kill you.
[03:02:30.016 --> 03:02:32.559]  Says right here, threatening to the lives of officers.
[03:02:32.559 --> 03:02:34.741]  Let me find it.
[03:02:34.741 --> 03:02:36.924]  Targeting of law enforcement and emergency personnel.
[03:02:40.390 --> 03:02:42.331]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:02:42.331 --> 03:02:43.452]  I mean, this is what they teach them.
[03:02:43.452 --> 03:02:47.375]  Hey, if somebody tells you there's a new world order taking over, they're a terrorist.
[03:02:47.375 --> 03:02:57.222]  And so Kelly Rushing and other people around the country, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, California, they walk up and go, Officer, I'd like to give you this Ron Paul speech.
[03:02:57.222 --> 03:03:03.387]  And they come arrest him the next day and say that's a terroristic threat, that speech of that congressman saying there's a new world order.
[03:03:03.387 --> 03:03:07.330]  Because they believe it's illegal, and he went to trial and was found not guilty!
[03:03:09.614 --> 03:03:14.581]  On the end of the video is also my film Road to Tyranny.
[03:03:14.581 --> 03:03:17.385]  I mean, they're brainwashed and then I have footage from a squad car.
[03:03:19.972 --> 03:03:29.135]  At a checkpoint in Virginia where Abby Newman, naval veteran, buying canning equipment, lives on a farm, no criminal record, pulls up, says, I'm not going to show you my stuff, this is a warrantless checkpoint.
[03:03:29.135 --> 03:03:39.759]  They drag her out, find a pocket constitution, and it's state police with their microphones on their chest, on their ties, and they've got her in cuffs in the car, and they're going, I can't believe it!
[03:03:39.759 --> 03:03:42.260]  In fact, bring me a pocket constitution out of the, uh...
[03:03:43.340 --> 03:03:44.920]  Bookstore back there, please.
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:46.221]  Out of the warehouse.
[03:03:46.221 --> 03:03:51.382]  And they're just going, oh my gosh, he talks about voluntary Social Security!
[03:03:51.382 --> 03:03:53.223]  I think we got one of them!
[03:03:53.223 --> 03:03:54.383]  I think this is illegal!
[03:03:54.383 --> 03:03:56.663]  Is it illegal to have this or not?
[03:03:56.663 --> 03:03:57.604]  I think that is.
[03:03:57.604 --> 03:04:00.384]  I think that may be.
[03:04:00.384 --> 03:04:01.985]  Oh my goodness gracious!
[03:04:01.985 --> 03:04:05.106]  You people are crazy cult members!
[03:04:05.106 --> 03:04:07.326]  You... We are the normal people!
[03:04:07.326 --> 03:04:10.627]  You have sworn an oath to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:04:11.940 --> 03:04:12.941]  I just had Army Colonel on.
[03:04:12.941 --> 03:04:16.043]  I said, do you swear or protect and defend the Constitution?
[03:04:16.043 --> 03:04:17.344]  He said, I can't.
[03:04:17.344 --> 03:04:19.146]  I can't talk about it.
[03:04:19.146 --> 03:04:19.826]  I gotta go.
[03:04:19.826 --> 03:04:20.887]  Oh my God.
[03:04:20.887 --> 03:04:22.829]  He's mentioning the Constitution.
[03:04:22.829 --> 03:04:24.090]  No, please.
[03:04:24.090 --> 03:04:25.931]  Not that.
[03:04:25.931 --> 03:04:26.972]  Not this.
[03:04:26.972 --> 03:04:27.933]  Please.
[03:04:27.933 --> 03:04:29.054]  Oh, it's so evil.
[03:04:30.523 --> 03:04:34.910]  But I mean, literally, the state police are like, we got one of them!
[03:04:34.910 --> 03:04:36.613]  We got all the training we've had!
[03:04:36.613 --> 03:04:39.497]  We finally found one of them!
[03:04:39.497 --> 03:04:41.641]  One of them!
[03:04:41.641 --> 03:04:42.402]  One of these!
[03:04:44.082 --> 03:04:46.585]  Well, now you say, hey, the firemen are taking over.
[03:04:46.585 --> 03:04:48.386]  I've got one!
[03:04:48.386 --> 03:04:50.048]  Oh, goodness!
[03:04:50.048 --> 03:04:51.469]  Hey, there's a world government they're setting up.
[03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:53.671]  Hey, there's North American Union.
[03:04:53.671 --> 03:04:55.894]  They're trying to kill me!
[03:04:55.894 --> 03:04:58.156]  That dancing rattlesnake right there!
[03:04:58.156 --> 03:04:59.397]  They're dangerous!
[03:04:59.397 --> 03:05:00.438]  Dangerous!
[03:05:00.438 --> 03:05:02.580]  Dangerous, Will Robbins!
[03:05:02.580 --> 03:05:04.482]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[03:05:04.482 --> 03:05:05.463]  Our government has handed
[03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:09.060]  Food.
[03:05:09.060 --> 03:05:09.340]  Food.
[03:05:09.340 --> 03:05:10.521]  The F word that we had all better be
[03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:45.672]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.964 --> 03:06:15.530]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.530 --> 03:06:22.135]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.135 --> 03:06:24.096]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.096 --> 03:06:26.618]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.618 --> 03:06:37.567]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.169 --> 03:06:39.850]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.850 --> 03:06:41.711]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.711 --> 03:06:48.616]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.616 --> 03:06:56.881]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.881 --> 03:06:58.462]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.462 --> 03:06:59.623]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.630 --> 03:07:05.074]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:07:05.074 --> 03:07:09.338]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:07:09.338 --> 03:07:17.306]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[03:07:17.586 --> 03:07:18.006]  We're good to go!
[03:07:49.804 --> 03:07:54.425]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:54.425 --> 03:07:56.406]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.840 --> 03:08:18.661]  We are back live for the next 52 minutes.
[03:08:18.661 --> 03:08:21.703]  We have the top trends forecaster in the world.
[03:08:21.703 --> 03:08:24.705]  That's what USA Today and CNN and Fox have called him.
[03:08:24.705 --> 03:08:26.126]  Incredible predictions.
[03:08:26.126 --> 03:08:29.749]  He's a big part of the Obama deception that comes out in the next few days at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:29.749 --> 03:08:32.190]  You can order the DVD right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:08:32.190 --> 03:08:34.752]  You need to mail Gerald Cilente one of those.
[03:08:34.752 --> 03:08:35.733]  But this just broke.
[03:08:35.733 --> 03:08:41.877]  I just showed you the earlier terror training manual saying those that talk about the Constitution are terrorists and are a danger to police.
[03:08:41.877 --> 03:08:43.638]  Those that are in Second Amendment groups.
[03:08:43.638 --> 03:08:46.080]  Here is the MIAC strategic report.
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:09:00.806]  And this is 2209, the Modern Militia Movement, and they mix in here people that believe there's nine FEMA regions, people that believe there's a Napa Superhighway, and they show the official Napa Superhighway map the government put out.
[03:09:00.806 --> 03:09:02.647]  Doesn't exist.
[03:09:02.647 --> 03:09:07.969]  Those that don't want RFID chips being planted with them, and they mix it in then with white supremacists and others.
[03:09:09.070 --> 03:09:12.634]  And they say, we want you to understand the terrorist symbols.
[03:09:12.634 --> 03:09:15.358]  It's the don't tread on me flag of the Founding Fathers.
[03:09:15.358 --> 03:09:16.679]  Can I have a close shot guys, please?
[03:09:16.679 --> 03:09:19.723]  Instead of that shot, can I have this?
[03:09:19.723 --> 03:09:20.905]  Thanks.
[03:09:20.905 --> 03:09:22.407]  The flag of the Founding Fathers, all of it.
[03:09:22.407 --> 03:09:23.308]  We're going to go over this.
[03:09:23.308 --> 03:09:25.150]  This is amazing propaganda.
[03:09:25.150 --> 03:09:26.252]  And they say in here, there is
[03:09:32.335 --> 03:09:42.582]  They say in there that there is no such thing as a new world order banking takeover as hundreds of newspapers a day say there will be a new bank of the world that you pay carbon taxes to.
[03:09:42.582 --> 03:09:43.623]  It just doesn't exist.
[03:09:43.623 --> 03:09:46.404]  You're an insane terrorist if you believe it.
[03:09:46.404 --> 03:09:50.727]  And now they're announcing troops to be in all major police departments running checkpoints everywhere.
[03:09:50.727 --> 03:09:52.769]  I've read mainstream news articles last hour.
[03:09:52.769 --> 03:09:54.450]  Gerald Cilente, this is getting crazy.
[03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:56.491]  It certainly is.
[03:09:56.491 --> 03:10:08.936]  I heard part of the announcement for your new DVD, and what state-controlled capitalism is, is fascism.
[03:10:08.936 --> 03:10:10.337]  And that's the definition for it.
[03:10:10.337 --> 03:10:13.078]  It's not socialism.
[03:10:13.078 --> 03:10:14.439]  And that's what we're moving toward.
[03:10:15.799 --> 03:10:18.042]  Well, my guys are really impressed getting to meet you in person.
[03:10:18.042 --> 03:10:22.948]  I know you turned down Glenn Beck that day for my guys to come up and interview you for the film with late notice just a few weeks ago.
[03:10:22.948 --> 03:10:26.051]  So we want to thank you for being part of the Obama Deception, sir.
[03:10:26.051 --> 03:10:29.395]  We'll send you a link to it so you can watch it in high quality online in the next 48 hours.
[03:10:31.758 --> 03:10:44.188]  So much is happening, so much of what you predicted, countries collapsing by February, March, all over the world, banks, more and more banks going under, more and more problems unfolding.
[03:10:44.188 --> 03:10:48.752]  Continue with your trend forecast in the short term.
[03:10:48.752 --> 03:10:51.154]  Well, we may see an Obama bounce.
[03:10:51.154 --> 03:10:57.619]  I mean, they're dumping so much money into the system that it's going to be a false flag fiscal recovery.
[03:10:58.457 --> 03:11:04.199]  And it's going to have a lot of people believing that prosperity is just around the corner.
[03:11:04.199 --> 03:11:08.560]  But the reality is, is we're moving into the greatest depression.
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:12.962]  And it really needs to be understood that this is a worldwide meltdown.
[03:11:12.962 --> 03:11:14.642]  I mean, this isn't just the U.S.
[03:11:14.642 --> 03:11:15.303]  The U.S.
[03:11:15.303 --> 03:11:19.064]  is, of course, the originator in many ways of it.
[03:11:19.064 --> 03:11:25.406]  But when you look what's going on around the world, my God, the former Soviet bloc countries
[03:11:26.636 --> 03:11:32.019]  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine.
[03:11:32.019 --> 03:11:34.140]  I mean, they're all underwater.
[03:11:34.140 --> 03:11:37.142]  And we saw what happened with Iceland, for example.
[03:11:37.142 --> 03:11:40.223]  They overthrew that government over there.
[03:11:40.223 --> 03:11:46.146]  We're seeing the once vaunted Celtic Tiger boom has turned to bust.
[03:11:46.146 --> 03:11:52.810]  The Spanish and English building frenzies have been subdued, and their economies are in steep decline.
[03:11:53.430 --> 03:11:59.911]  You look around the world, year-to-date, Taiwan's exports, they're down some 42%.
[03:11:59.911 --> 03:12:01.971]  Japan, 35%.
[03:12:01.971 --> 03:12:03.972]  South Korea, 17%.
[03:12:03.972 --> 03:12:15.614]  Worldwide, Alex, when you look at what's going on, on average, world trade in January has collapsed over 30%.
[03:12:15.614 --> 03:12:20.595]  What do people need to have them say, this is a depression?
[03:12:20.595 --> 03:12:22.895]  These are depression-era fall-offs.
[03:12:23.470 --> 03:12:29.659]  And when you look at other data, I mean, auto sales in the US, what, a week ago?
[03:12:29.659 --> 03:12:32.583]  They came in down 41%.
[03:12:32.583 --> 03:12:35.027]  What, are people waiting for it to go to zero?
[03:12:38.137 --> 03:12:52.847]  Gerald Cilente, they are announcing all over the country, and I read these articles last hour, I won't go back over them, but I'm sure you're probably aware of some of them, that they're going to have army liaison officers in all the police departments, and they're announcing in Canada, England, the U.S., that the army is going to be patrolling America.
[03:12:53.487 --> 03:13:00.373]  You know, we knew this years ago and then months ago the Pentagon announced it, but that was done quietly, just, you know, in government documents.
[03:13:00.373 --> 03:13:04.016]  But now the media, we're seeing the rollout of the PR.
[03:13:04.016 --> 03:13:08.280]  Oh, the Marines are going to be out looking for drunk drivers helping the police this week in California.
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:13.224]  Oh, the Army showed up for the shooting in Alabama and patrolled the streets.
[03:13:13.224 --> 03:13:13.284]  Oh,
[03:13:14.426 --> 03:13:17.908]  I mean, what is the Army going to do patrolling America?
[03:13:17.908 --> 03:13:26.993]  I mean, clearly, the Army War College has said they believe things are going to completely collapse, but they're not doing anything to reverse what's caused the collapse.
[03:13:26.993 --> 03:13:35.857]  No, not only they're not doing anything to reverse the collapse, they're doing more to make the collapse worse.
[03:13:35.857 --> 03:13:42.421]  For example, and again, you know, we're not making this stuff up, it's in the words of
[03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:47.943]  The confidence man in chief, President Obama.
[03:13:47.943 --> 03:13:50.365]  And that's, by the way, that's what this all is.
[03:13:50.365 --> 03:13:51.806]  It's a confidence game.
[03:13:51.806 --> 03:13:58.971]  And as you well know, the term confidence man comes, con man, is they build confidence.
[03:13:58.971 --> 03:14:06.316]  So when you listen to his speech, for example, to Congress, he used the word confidence seven times.
[03:14:06.316 --> 03:14:09.078]  To have confidence in the plans that they're doing.
[03:14:09.634 --> 03:14:16.718]  So when you look around and you see what the scheme is, what is he saying?
[03:14:16.718 --> 03:14:26.483]  He's saying that what they want to do is to loosen credit up again so that people can continue to borrow.
[03:14:26.483 --> 03:14:31.405]  And that's going to somehow regenerate the economy.
[03:14:31.405 --> 03:14:38.469]  Well, it was loose credit and having people borrow that got us into this problem.
[03:14:39.028 --> 03:14:52.396]  The nation is overwhelmed in debt, and now the solution is, well, we have to unfreeze the credit markets so that people can go out and borrow and buy cars and build homes.
[03:14:52.396 --> 03:14:58.399]  So, I mean, this is pure insanity, and no one is saying it.
[03:14:58.399 --> 03:15:02.001]  Instead, they're like these bobblehead dogs on the back of cars.
[03:15:03.587 --> 03:15:07.369]  You know, they're agreeing with it.
[03:15:07.369 --> 03:15:08.990]  And this is a quote from him.
[03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:16.855]  Our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people.
[03:15:16.855 --> 03:15:22.199]  And he goes on, you see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy.
[03:15:22.199 --> 03:15:29.763]  The ability to get a new loan is how you finance the purchase of everything, from a home to a car.
[03:15:29.763 --> 03:15:30.824]  Flow of credit
[03:15:31.348 --> 03:15:36.579]  The ability to get a loan, well all this sounds positive, but what does it mean?
[03:15:41.528 --> 03:15:47.252]  Meanwhile, they're announcing openly that it's socialism, as if that's a good thing, but giving most of the money to the banks.
[03:15:47.252 --> 03:15:50.694]  That's not really socialism, that's just highway robbery or piracy.
[03:15:50.694 --> 03:16:01.681]  But they are giving hundreds of billions of chicken feed, 15 bucks every few weeks, to the general public, selling them on the idea that all this debt is owed by the people when it's a pittance.
[03:16:01.681 --> 03:16:07.785]  I mean, it's just amazing to see them looting and robbing the middle class to give it to the elite and the poor.
[03:16:07.785 --> 03:16:10.147]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[03:16:10.811 --> 03:16:16.313]  So, you know, here we have, I mean, private sector credit market debt is 174% of the GDP.
[03:16:16.313 --> 03:16:17.034]  This is amazing.
[03:16:17.034 --> 03:16:18.834]  There's never been any numbers like this.
[03:16:18.834 --> 03:16:20.975]  In 1962, consumers had 37% less debt than income.
[03:16:20.975 --> 03:16:23.896]  Now, they have, in 2001, they had 1% more debt, and now it's way over that.
[03:16:40.593 --> 03:16:41.333]  The U.S.
[03:16:41.333 --> 03:16:48.576]  debt-to-income ratio rose in the past seven years as much as it did in the past 39 years.
[03:16:48.576 --> 03:16:54.237]  Which means we were already in a predatory economy that was already going into deep recession and depression years ago.
[03:16:54.237 --> 03:16:58.498]  In fact, I saw the headline from the federal government in January of 2007.
[03:16:58.498 --> 03:16:58.979]  They announced
[03:17:00.279 --> 03:17:03.741]  The United States is at the highest level of debt, not just in U.S.
[03:17:03.741 --> 03:17:07.583]  history, or even the depths of the Great Depression, but in world history.
[03:17:07.583 --> 03:17:15.907]  Now we are a negative savings country, and as you said, it is now accelerating way past the record.
[03:17:15.907 --> 03:17:18.068]  And what is the solution?
[03:17:18.068 --> 03:17:29.814]  Print more money, let people borrow more, put them deeper in debt, so they can become more of the indentured servants that they've become, so they can bail out the big guys.
[03:17:30.296 --> 03:17:32.297]  I mean, look at this AIG thing.
[03:17:32.297 --> 03:17:34.498]  It's what, up to $160 billion?
[03:17:34.498 --> 03:17:37.059]  And they're saying they're too big to fail?
[03:17:37.059 --> 03:17:38.680]  Who did the money go to?
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:40.221]  It went to Deutsche Bank.
[03:17:40.221 --> 03:17:42.642]  It went to Goldman Sachs.
[03:17:42.642 --> 03:17:44.563]  It went to the Merrill Lynch mob.
[03:17:44.563 --> 03:17:46.684]  The best, you know, one after another.
[03:17:46.684 --> 03:17:55.568]  Sir, how outrageous is it, I mean, give us your expert take on this, to have Senator Sanders say to private Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, where did the trillions go?
[03:17:56.428 --> 03:17:58.690]  And Bernanke says, I'm not going to tell you.
[03:17:58.690 --> 03:18:00.511]  I mean, total gangster.
[03:18:00.511 --> 03:18:01.832]  I'm not telling you.
[03:18:01.832 --> 03:18:02.753]  Kiss off.
[03:18:02.753 --> 03:18:04.935]  Ron Paul yesterday said they should be arrested.
[03:18:04.935 --> 03:18:07.016]  I think it was very, very bold of him.
[03:18:07.016 --> 03:18:09.858]  I agree with Ron Paul as well.
[03:18:09.858 --> 03:18:12.020]  These are criminal acts.
[03:18:12.020 --> 03:18:19.686]  And I don't know how, you know, the country is getting what it deserves if it stands by and keeps letting this happen.
[03:18:19.686 --> 03:18:23.189]  They keep coming up with this too big to fail mantra.
[03:18:23.189 --> 03:18:24.330]  And what is there?
[03:18:24.330 --> 03:18:26.091]  I can't say this with all certainty.
[03:18:26.502 --> 03:18:28.223]  Their mother's not better than mine.
[03:18:28.223 --> 03:18:29.303]  Yeah.
[03:18:29.303 --> 03:18:31.784]  They're too big to fail.
[03:18:31.784 --> 03:18:35.045]  And everybody else listening out there, it's the same thing.
[03:18:35.045 --> 03:18:36.866]  They're not better than we are.
[03:18:36.866 --> 03:18:38.127]  Well, take Madoff.
[03:18:38.127 --> 03:18:45.870]  This elitist into this whole thing, that if they fail, then we all turn to dust.
[03:18:45.870 --> 03:18:46.730]  And we know what they're really doing.
[03:18:46.730 --> 03:18:50.131]  They've been taking the money out the back door, buying real assets and moving offshore.
[03:18:50.131 --> 03:18:52.953]  I mean, this is just the final looting.
[03:18:52.953 --> 03:18:53.593]  It is.
[03:18:53.593 --> 03:18:56.214]  And as you're well pointing out and alerting the people,
[03:18:56.673 --> 03:19:09.423]  You know, they have the troops in place, the government is ready to put down any resistance whatsoever, and they're going to start cracking down big time.
[03:19:09.423 --> 03:19:22.814]  I cannot begin to tell you the amount of emails we're getting about people warning us that I better keep my mouth closed because we're making a lot of people angry.
[03:19:22.814 --> 03:19:24.475]  And you know, when I call people
[03:19:26.095 --> 03:19:44.650]  Like Sandy Weill, you know, rather than calling him brilliant, the former CEO of Travelers Insurance, who cobbled together Citigroup by doing a deal with Citibank, and then Smith Barney to create a one-stop financial supermarket.
[03:19:44.650 --> 03:19:47.813]  I call him a greedy little pig!
[03:19:47.813 --> 03:19:52.216]  Stay there, I want to talk about threats, because we've been getting them too.
[03:19:53.737 --> 03:19:56.907]  And that's the cherry on top when you really know it's a tyranny.
[03:19:56.907 --> 03:19:59.174]  Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck.
[03:19:59.174 --> 03:19:59.756]  Stay there.
[03:19:59.756 --> 03:20:00.377]  Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:02.233 --> 03:20:07.736]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[03:20:07.736 --> 03:20:08.516]  and the world.
[03:20:08.516 --> 03:20:12.398]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[03:20:12.398 --> 03:20:18.901]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:20:18.901 --> 03:20:20.921]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[03:20:20.921 --> 03:20:28.865]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[03:20:29.145 --> 03:20:33.849]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[03:20:33.849 --> 03:20:39.653]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[03:20:39.653 --> 03:20:41.835]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[03:20:41.835 --> 03:20:44.077]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[03:20:44.417 --> 03:20:45.517]  Free of charge.

[03:20:53.980 --> 03:20:54.940]  Factory direct.

[03:20:57.181 --> 03:20:58.101]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[03:20:58.101 --> 03:21:07.064]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.851 --> 03:21:13.732]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:13.732 --> 03:21:20.214]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.214 --> 03:21:22.194]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.194 --> 03:21:24.655]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:24.655 --> 03:21:35.537]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:37.839 --> 03:21:39.500]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:41.361]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.361 --> 03:21:48.286]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:56.551 --> 03:21:58.112]  The Obama Deception.

[03:22:01.781 --> 03:22:05.905]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[03:23:00.702 --> 03:23:04.883]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[03:23:04.883 --> 03:23:08.544]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[03:23:08.544 --> 03:23:12.364]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[03:23:12.364 --> 03:23:15.605]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[03:23:15.605 --> 03:23:20.346]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology.
[03:23:20.486 --> 03:23:20.846]  I think so.
[03:23:41.408 --> 03:23:41.868]  I don't know.
[03:24:07.677 --> 03:24:19.764]  Yeah, I've been getting a lot of death threats, a lot of other dirty tricks going on, and then the FBI starts calling out the last few days when I'm on air to different extensions, going, hey, where's your office at?
[03:24:19.764 --> 03:24:23.786]  Yeah, this company, it's Alex Jones's company.
[03:24:23.786 --> 03:24:26.847]  Give me a list of where your servers are at, as if they couldn't find that or know that.
[03:24:26.847 --> 03:24:30.970]  It's like the mob calling up going, how's your kids doing when they play in the backyard?
[03:24:32.770 --> 03:24:38.654]  We do get calls like that at the house as well, or women calling my wife up, going, Hi, I'm calling for Alex.
[03:24:38.654 --> 03:24:39.275]  Well, who's this?
[03:24:39.275 --> 03:24:39.875]  This is his wife.
[03:24:39.875 --> 03:24:40.696]  Well, that's impossible.
[03:24:40.696 --> 03:24:41.377]  We're getting married.
[03:24:41.377 --> 03:24:42.257]  I'm pregnant.
[03:24:42.257 --> 03:24:47.662]  He's totally made up, and it's really intensifying right now, the Obama deception.
[03:24:47.662 --> 03:24:51.925]  What does that sound like to you, Mr. Salente, along with the harassment you're getting?
[03:24:51.925 --> 03:25:01.293]  It's about right, you know, and we're also getting a lot of people saying that we need protection services.
[03:25:02.086 --> 03:25:16.438]  And just for a note, I'm a close combat practitioner, and my mentor is John Perkins of attackproof.com, and I've been at this for over 25 years.
[03:25:16.438 --> 03:25:19.341]  So, you know, we're ready for whatever comes at us.
[03:25:19.341 --> 03:25:29.109]  Of course, you know, you never know what could come in the dark of a night, but we're doing our best to stay alert.
[03:25:29.825 --> 03:25:38.150]  And preparing for the worst, because as close combat practitioners, you know, we're survivalists.
[03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:42.712]  And you always could pull back from preparing for the worst.
[03:25:42.712 --> 03:25:49.896]  But the people that are hoping for the best, if the worst happens, they have no room to move back from.
[03:25:49.896 --> 03:25:54.699]  So in these coming times, we're telling people, prepare for the worst.
[03:25:54.699 --> 03:25:59.001]  You know, you always could have room after that, but if you're not, if you're waiting
[03:25:59.417 --> 03:26:03.700]  For somebody to come and save the day, you're going to be in trouble.
[03:26:03.700 --> 03:26:06.122]  Absolutely.
[03:26:06.122 --> 03:26:09.885]  You also are armed, I believe, in the Second Amendment.
[03:26:09.885 --> 03:26:15.610]  But that shows we're getting to them if they're threatening Gerald Solente and Alex Jones.
[03:26:15.610 --> 03:26:27.679]  Oh yeah, look, as I mentioned at the break, I'm calling this Ken Wilde, excuse me, Sandy Wilde, the guy that put together Citigroup.
[03:26:28.058 --> 03:26:29.679]  You know, he's a greedy little pig.
[03:26:29.679 --> 03:26:38.086]  I mean, they put all these local bankers, community bankers out of business, people that had good jobs as branch managers, vice presidents.
[03:26:38.086 --> 03:26:44.392]  They lost them, or else they became clerks for Sandy, so he could make his billion-dollar pluses.
[03:26:44.392 --> 03:26:46.213]  The same thing with Bank of America.
[03:26:46.213 --> 03:26:50.497]  I call him Ken, you know, Greedy Lewis.
[03:26:50.497 --> 03:26:52.138]  Money-grubbing Lewis.
[03:26:52.138 --> 03:26:54.160]  I mean, when do these people have enough?
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:27:03.105]  Or the brilliant Larry Summers, and Ron Paul, yourself, myself, we're calling for their indictment, their investigation, instead of them grandstanding as our saviors.
[03:27:03.105 --> 03:27:06.487]  They can't get us all if we stand up and say, you're the crook, you're the pig.
[03:27:06.487 --> 03:27:08.968]  You know, it's not going to work for them.
[03:27:08.968 --> 03:27:20.895]  Exactly, and that's why, you know, shows like yours particularly, and the people that listen to you, you know, to coin a phrase, you know, now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
[03:27:21.451 --> 03:27:24.714]  Because if people don't stand up, we're going to be mowed down.
[03:27:24.714 --> 03:27:28.717]  And it's as clear as the day.
[03:27:28.717 --> 03:27:29.898]  It's happening.
[03:27:29.898 --> 03:27:32.500]  And again, you know, this began under Bush.
[03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:34.821]  It actually began under Reagan.
[03:27:34.821 --> 03:27:37.003]  Excuse me, under Clinton.
[03:27:37.003 --> 03:27:44.429]  He started taking away our Fourth Amendment rights, and accelerated under Bush, and Obama's carrying it forward.
[03:27:44.429 --> 03:27:46.891]  You know, it's to put us into servitude.
[03:27:46.891 --> 03:27:48.532]  Again, with this whole mantra of
[03:27:48.931 --> 03:27:55.658]  Too big to fail psychologically, that says the rest of us are too small to save.
[03:27:55.658 --> 03:28:01.024]  And it's in the grand tradition of, you know, this whole Titanic mentality.
[03:28:01.024 --> 03:28:02.405]  The lifeboats are there.
[03:28:02.405 --> 03:28:04.868]  The life jackets are there.
[03:28:04.868 --> 03:28:07.471]  You know, the life rafts are there.
[03:28:08.052 --> 03:28:11.917]  But they're not for the little people, they're only for the too wealthy to sink.
[03:28:23.112 --> 03:28:30.215]  It's clear they're going to just keep bankrupting everything, set up their world government system, then try to refinance everything on our backs.
[03:28:30.215 --> 03:28:33.496]  And if we don't like it, NORTHCOM and the militarized police are standing by.
[03:28:33.496 --> 03:28:35.097]  I mean, this is high treason.
[03:28:35.097 --> 03:28:38.278]  The country hijacked, just like the central banks hijacked third world countries.
[03:28:38.278 --> 03:28:41.219]  How do we stop that or is it just going to run its course?
[03:28:41.219 --> 03:28:52.784]  Well, you know, I don't know, you know, how it's going to stop because I have to tell you, Alex, that, you know, I'm a believer, you know, in my moral belief and the way I was raised, the religion that I was raised in.
[03:28:53.863 --> 03:28:57.665]  It's criminal to kill innocent people.
[03:28:57.665 --> 03:29:13.574]  And all the evidence is out there now that the Iraq War was, as we saw with the McClellan and other people coming out with information, that they knew that Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction or ties to Al-Qaeda.
[03:29:13.574 --> 03:29:21.919]  So on the military level, we're killing innocent people, and on the financial situation, we're robbing people blind.
[03:29:22.903 --> 03:29:29.288]  And both of them, you know, whether it's Bush or Obama, they all should be brought up for high treason.
[03:29:29.288 --> 03:29:30.148]  Let's talk about that.
[03:29:30.148 --> 03:29:31.329]  That really is the solution.
[03:29:31.329 --> 03:29:34.071]  Just the emperor is wearing no clothes.
[03:29:34.071 --> 03:29:35.252]  Hey, you're criminals.
[03:29:35.252 --> 03:29:36.173]  You're the ones that did it.
[03:29:36.173 --> 03:29:37.133]  Stop grandstanding.
[03:29:37.133 --> 03:29:38.254]  Stop your carbon taxes.
[03:29:38.254 --> 03:29:39.635]  Stop all your bull.
[03:29:39.635 --> 03:29:43.558]  Gerald Salente, TrendsResearch.com is our guest.
[03:29:43.558 --> 03:29:47.801]  We're going to cover a lot more of what he sees coming up in the near future and solutions.
[03:29:47.801 --> 03:29:49.762]  On the other side of this quick break, I'm going to cover the
[03:29:50.919 --> 03:29:52.082]  Constitutional terrorist manual.
[03:29:52.082 --> 03:29:55.089]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.089 --> 03:29:58.738]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.273 --> 03:30:05.794]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:30:05.794 --> 03:30:11.195]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:30:11.195 --> 03:30:16.336]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:30:16.336 --> 03:30:27.459]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:30:27.859 --> 03:30:33.641]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:30:33.641 --> 03:30:39.904]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:30:39.904 --> 03:30:40.944]  What about you?
[03:30:40.944 --> 03:30:42.865]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[03:30:42.865 --> 03:30:47.387]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:31:02.126 --> 03:31:07.949]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.949 --> 03:31:14.933]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.504 --> 03:31:21.706]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:21.706 --> 03:31:24.066]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.066 --> 03:31:26.567]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.567 --> 03:31:37.470]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:31:38.152 --> 03:31:39.814]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.814 --> 03:31:41.675]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:41.675 --> 03:31:48.601]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:56.848 --> 03:31:58.430]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.430 --> 03:31:59.631]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.545 --> 03:32:07.491]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:32:07.491 --> 03:32:12.296]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:32:12.296 --> 03:32:17.721]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:32:17.721 --> 03:32:21.165]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:32:21.625 --> 03:32:30.150]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:35.953]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:32:35.953 --> 03:32:41.936]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:32:41.936 --> 03:32:44.257]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[03:32:44.517 --> 03:32:44.898]  We're good.

[03:33:13.162 --> 03:33:15.884]  That's Gerald Salente's invaluable website.
[03:33:15.884 --> 03:33:21.388]  Go there and subscribe to his insightful and very valuable reports.
[03:33:21.388 --> 03:33:24.169]  He also consults many Fortune 500 companies.
[03:33:24.169 --> 03:33:28.752]  Yeah, they're not going to catch the midnight rider, folks.
[03:33:28.752 --> 03:33:37.298]  The Obama deception is going to drop a little bit early because the vultures, the carrion crows, are circling.
[03:33:37.298 --> 03:33:38.719]  We've got to get the jump on them.
[03:33:40.692 --> 03:33:43.375]  But it's very, very serious times.
[03:33:43.375 --> 03:33:47.220]  Tyranny is in our face.
[03:33:47.220 --> 03:34:01.356]  Gerald Salenta, you know, isn't that the weakness of these tyrants, though, is that they are so classically corrupt, so classically tyrannical, so classically obviously criminal, bankrupt degenerates who are the enemies of all free people everywhere in the free market?
[03:34:02.947 --> 03:34:07.349]  It is, you know, I began my career just as a little background.
[03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:13.151]  I ran the mayoral campaign in Yonkers, New York in 1971 at a graduate school.
[03:34:13.151 --> 03:34:18.933]  And from there, I worked in Westchester County Politics, and they sent me up to Albany.
[03:34:18.933 --> 03:34:23.415]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[03:34:23.415 --> 03:34:30.298]  And that's when I became really, I started to despise politics, because I saw that the only way you could get up
[03:34:30.714 --> 03:34:33.215]  To the top is suck your way up to the top.
[03:34:33.215 --> 03:34:37.878]  I'd be hanging around the Senate chamber with my pal, you know, chit-chatting about this or that.
[03:34:37.878 --> 03:34:39.179]  I was a young guy.
[03:34:39.179 --> 03:34:45.482]  And a senator would walk in and my buddy would leave me to go pull out the chair to help the senator sit down.
[03:34:45.482 --> 03:34:50.185]  You know, to watch grown men grovel is a disgusting spectacle.
[03:34:50.185 --> 03:35:00.270]  And if the people only knew what a con game all this is, they would overthrow this government in a heartbeat.
[03:35:00.772 --> 03:35:01.733]  All of them.
[03:35:01.733 --> 03:35:07.217]  These people are paper-thin, for the very reasons that you elaborated.
[03:35:07.217 --> 03:35:10.980]  No, all they are, they're just staging.
[03:35:10.980 --> 03:35:12.521]  They're confidence men.
[03:35:12.521 --> 03:35:14.163]  It's a con game.
[03:35:14.163 --> 03:35:18.726]  And once people understand that, they won't buy into the con.
[03:35:18.726 --> 03:35:23.090]  But for some reason, you know, people keep drinking the Kool-Aid.
[03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:24.831]  And it amazes me.
[03:35:24.831 --> 03:35:29.555]  I mean, I have loads of friends that are, you know, these screaming liberals.
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:35.522]  And when you point out, hey, you know, Obama just increased the military budget by 4%.
[03:35:35.522 --> 03:35:38.523]  Oh, they don't want to hear that.
[03:35:38.523 --> 03:35:46.746]  Oh, Obama's sending 17,000 troops to Afghanistan and with another, what, 30,000 on schedule.
[03:35:46.746 --> 03:35:47.987]  They don't want to hear that.
[03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:58.273]  So people, you know, people are living like children and they only want to believe what they want to believe and they stick their heads in the sand to the rest.
[03:35:58.273 --> 03:36:03.941]  So I just think the whole problem comes down to is that people have lost their dignity and self-respect.
[03:36:04.468 --> 03:36:04.948]  Well, that's it.
[03:36:04.948 --> 03:36:16.655]  They've bought into delusions and lies just like it's always the poor, ignorant, hard-working fools that you see lined up on Friday with their paycheck with like hungry kids with snot all over them in their car.
[03:36:16.655 --> 03:36:25.960]  You know, you walk in, you see the snot-covered kids in the broke-down car, and Dad's in there buying lottery tickets, buying scratch-offs, and you want to tell them, buddy, it's a scam.
[03:36:25.960 --> 03:36:26.441]  Don't do it.
[03:36:26.441 --> 03:36:28.562]  They're like, I'm going to win next time.
[03:36:28.562 --> 03:36:29.863]  And they're like, get out of here, Mack.
[03:36:30.683 --> 03:36:35.309]  And you can't even buy some milk because the poor people are all lined up buying the lottery tickets.
[03:36:35.309 --> 03:36:39.013]  And you see him buy right back into Obama as he betrays them.
[03:36:39.013 --> 03:36:40.455]  And at first it was, oh, he'll end the war.
[03:36:40.455 --> 03:36:41.937]  He'll stop the warrantless wiretapping.
[03:36:41.937 --> 03:36:43.399]  He won't hire lobbyists.
[03:36:43.399 --> 03:36:46.082]  And now they attack me and email me and say, so what?
[03:36:46.082 --> 03:36:47.704]  That's how he's got to get things done.
[03:36:47.704 --> 03:36:50.067]  Because they've bought in that they've got a seat at the table.
[03:36:50.287 --> 03:36:53.088]  That they're living big, you know, through Obama.
[03:36:53.088 --> 03:36:59.591]  It's like a five-year-old watching a superhero cartoon and imagining jumping over the couch with pillows, you know, that they're Superman.
[03:36:59.591 --> 03:37:04.633]  That's fine for a five-year-old, but living through Obama, that you're a Superman and he's a Superman.
[03:37:04.633 --> 03:37:10.456]  When Newsweek and others say, confidence man, and they go, oh, it's good he's a confidence man.
[03:37:10.456 --> 03:37:12.957]  You need to buy into the hype, that will save you.
[03:37:12.957 --> 03:37:15.298]  They're openly saying, buy into the fraud.
[03:37:15.298 --> 03:37:18.019]  I mean, this is a high level of PSYOP, isn't it, Gerald Cilente?
[03:37:18.937 --> 03:37:23.500]  Well, it is definitely a con game, as we're saying.
[03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:27.662]  Again, though, there's really no magic behind any of this.
[03:37:27.662 --> 03:37:32.785]  It's so transparent, but the people are afraid to see it.
[03:37:32.785 --> 03:37:34.846]  We know who's behind the curtain.
[03:37:34.846 --> 03:37:37.347]  Look at the people that he has around him.
[03:37:37.347 --> 03:37:42.870]  I mean, I just read this whole big thing on this guy Axelrod in the New York Times, you know?
[03:37:45.888 --> 03:37:49.251]  They're nothing.
[03:37:49.251 --> 03:37:50.952]  They're just blowhards.
[03:37:50.952 --> 03:37:53.855]  And the people buy into it and they bow.
[03:37:53.855 --> 03:38:02.923]  And as I said, until people regain their self-respect and dignity, we're not going to have the changes that we really need in this government.
[03:38:02.923 --> 03:38:13.652]  And people really have to stand up, first by starting at the local level and stopping these stupid taxes that they keep pushing down our throats.
[03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:16.190]  That's the beginning of it.
[03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:17.431]  And that's happening.
[03:38:17.431 --> 03:38:20.252]  You predicted that when you first came on with us three months ago.
[03:38:20.252 --> 03:38:22.073]  You had written about it a year ago.
[03:38:22.073 --> 03:38:36.680]  As now, on time, tax revolts for state income tax, local taxes, carbon taxes, income taxes, you know, these Tea Party rebellions with tens of thousands in some cities are just going wild right now.
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:38.661]  And that's just the beginning.
[03:38:38.661 --> 03:38:40.943]  And that's the hopeful sign.
[03:38:40.943 --> 03:38:41.623]  You know, Alex,
[03:38:42.153 --> 03:38:48.160]  When you hit people in their pocketbook, all of a sudden they start to take notice.
[03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:54.527]  That can be the genesis of this next revolution.
[03:38:54.527 --> 03:39:00.574]  By the way, as your film crew knows, we're right off the most historic corners.
[03:39:01.118 --> 03:39:04.200]  In the United States, the only place on each corner.
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:04.921]  It's gorgeous.
[03:39:04.921 --> 03:39:07.363]  I envy where you are at.
[03:39:07.363 --> 03:39:09.644]  Just beautiful area of New York.
[03:39:09.644 --> 03:39:12.706]  And it was the seed of the revolution.
[03:39:12.706 --> 03:39:27.477]  And I have to tell you, you know, I want to be part of that revolution, and I'm doing everything that I can, and we're all doing here at the Trends Research Institute, the whole team, everything that we can to make this revolution happen.
[03:39:27.910 --> 03:39:34.874]  I mean, I was not raised... My parents didn't put all this work into me to be dictated by a bunch of clowns.
[03:39:34.874 --> 03:39:36.915]  Congressional clowns.
[03:39:36.915 --> 03:39:40.117]  I mean, I love this language that they always use.
[03:39:40.117 --> 03:39:44.259]  You know, we need a bipartisan consensus to push through these packages.
[03:39:44.259 --> 03:39:45.360]  Bipartisan?
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:46.881]  Who are they talking about?
[03:39:46.881 --> 03:39:47.681]  Pelosi?
[03:39:47.681 --> 03:39:48.222]  Reid?
[03:39:48.222 --> 03:39:49.422]  Bonner?
[03:39:49.422 --> 03:39:50.143]  Shelby?
[03:39:50.143 --> 03:39:51.363]  McConnell?
[03:39:51.363 --> 03:39:52.004]  Frank?
[03:39:52.004 --> 03:39:52.924]  Dodd?
[03:39:52.924 --> 03:39:56.026]  You know, as I say, how about Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello?
[03:39:56.286 --> 03:40:04.009]  Hey, Gerald, tell us, because you really, you know, your roots are in your family and anybody who's got their head screwed on straight, that's what it's all about.
[03:40:04.009 --> 03:40:14.474]  We are standing on the shoulders of those that busted their butts and sacrificed and had such dignity and, you know, just look at the photos of your family and your parents and your Aunt Zizzy and everybody.
[03:40:14.474 --> 03:40:21.517]  You know, I can just feel that love of your family and that's why you're willing to sacrifice now for others because you understand that's what it is to be human.
[03:40:21.517 --> 03:40:25.359]  What would your mother, your father, your aunt think of seeing the things that are happening now?
[03:40:26.118 --> 03:40:48.573]  Oh, you'd be heartbroken because, you know, my grandfather, you know, I remember my Aunt Zizi telling me, you know, your grandfather, you know, an Italian immigrant, he was so proud to be part of this country that he was the first person online on Election Day, you know, all dressed up and proud that he had the right to vote.
[03:40:48.573 --> 03:40:50.034]  Their hearts would break.
[03:40:50.034 --> 03:40:52.616]  Matter of fact, before my Aunt Zizi passed on,
[03:40:53.749 --> 03:40:57.231]  Our heart was already broken what happened to this country.
[03:40:57.231 --> 03:40:58.692]  You can see it.
[03:40:58.692 --> 03:41:09.779]  And I think my willingness to speak out and to maintain my dignity was instilled upon me by my mother.
[03:41:09.779 --> 03:41:11.700]  She couldn't stand cowards.
[03:41:12.561 --> 03:41:19.704]  And she couldn't stand politicians, so I was raised the right way.
[03:41:19.704 --> 03:41:29.908]  I remember being a little boy, and a politician was campaigning in Yonkers, New York, in the Old Town, part of the town in those days.
[03:41:29.908 --> 03:41:35.190]  And as he's talking, my mother, as I was pushing my little sister in the stroller, yelled out,
[03:41:35.629 --> 03:41:37.836]  You're all a bunch of liars.
[03:41:37.836 --> 03:41:40.263]  You'll say anything to get elected.
[03:41:40.263 --> 03:41:41.848]  So I came from good stock.
[03:41:45.396 --> 03:41:47.417]  Oh man, you're absolutely right.
[03:41:47.417 --> 03:41:56.464]  And people valued freedom because most people that came to this country, well everybody that came here was from England or Africa or China or Italy or Russia.
[03:41:56.464 --> 03:42:03.068]  They had come from tyranny and thugs and bureaucrats ruling over them and having to go hat in hand to be able to do anything.
[03:42:03.068 --> 03:42:06.410]  The elites trying to suppress society, destroy middle classes.
[03:42:06.410 --> 03:42:14.435]  They recognized tyranny and I think we've just had it so good so long that we forgot that we have to fight for liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said, or you lose it.
[03:42:15.196 --> 03:42:18.457]  Well, the greedy thieves are trying to take it all.
[03:42:18.457 --> 03:42:23.199]  Well, the one thing that I would say, we haven't had it so good for so long.
[03:42:23.199 --> 03:42:26.501]  It's like the frog in the frying pan.
[03:42:26.501 --> 03:42:30.242]  They turn up the heat a little bit at a time, a little bit at a time.
[03:42:30.242 --> 03:42:32.163]  And that's what they've been doing.
[03:42:32.163 --> 03:42:36.965]  I mean, to me, the last great president of this country was Eisenhower.
[03:42:36.965 --> 03:42:37.966]  I mean, this is a man.
[03:42:37.966 --> 03:42:43.668]  Anybody that says Eisenhower is full of baloney, I would have loved to have seen them go up and say that to his face.
[03:42:44.226 --> 03:42:52.832]  You know, he warned us about the military-industrial complex, and then we got that omno-crook Richard Nixon, and it declined since then!
[03:42:52.832 --> 03:42:54.633]  And they've been robbing us blind!
[03:42:54.633 --> 03:42:57.895]  You know, I remember when I first went to college, they had antitrust acts!
[03:42:58.410 --> 03:43:04.897]  You know, if you were a big company, you couldn't buy things cheaper than anybody else because you were buying them in quantity.
[03:43:04.897 --> 03:43:08.040]  So it allowed the mom and pops to stay into business.
[03:43:08.040 --> 03:43:16.208]  Well, just to clarify, just to clarify, I mean, I agree with you that we have been having a lowering standard of living really since the 60s with both the man and woman having to work.
[03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:24.755]  With the children being controlled by the state, with debt rising and savings falling, I agree with you.
[03:43:24.755 --> 03:43:27.437]  I mean, I'm talking about the last hundred years.
[03:43:27.437 --> 03:43:31.701]  We've seen a lot of, you know, power massing through the robber barons, but go ahead.
[03:43:31.701 --> 03:43:32.381]  Oh, no, no.
[03:43:32.381 --> 03:43:34.443]  Yeah, we're on the same page.
[03:43:34.443 --> 03:43:37.265]  And I just wanted to make that, you know, that one point.
[03:43:37.265 --> 03:43:44.451]  And yeah, the last hundred years are going back, you know, that quote that I've read from Lincoln.
[03:43:44.970 --> 03:43:47.893]  I mean, we're becoming indentured servants of the state.
[03:44:01.636 --> 03:44:13.970]  My guys went and interviewed you a month ago, brought back your new book that just came out, and just while we were editing footage or files were rendering and I had time, I read it.
[03:44:13.970 --> 03:44:15.051]  You would think a book about
[03:44:16.633 --> 03:44:17.394]  You know, about your aunt.
[03:44:17.394 --> 03:44:23.258]  It wouldn't be informative, but it was super informative, and I know you've written so many books, so many bestsellers.
[03:44:23.258 --> 03:44:30.603]  Spend a few minutes, and then I want to get into this training manual they're giving police all over the country, demonizing people to talk about a new world order.
[03:44:30.603 --> 03:44:32.144]  Tell us about the new book.
[03:44:32.144 --> 03:44:39.129]  Well, the book is called What Gigi Gave Honey Boy, and Gigi is the Italian dialect, the Neapolitan dialect for auntie.
[03:44:39.129 --> 03:44:44.613]  So she was my aunt, and I realized that, you know, as I spent time with her,
[03:44:45.077 --> 03:44:58.063]  And listening to her kitchen table wisdom that, you know, we really lost a country that was so different than the one that I grew up in and the one so many of us loved.
[03:44:58.063 --> 03:45:00.344]  And that's what the book is really about.
[03:45:00.344 --> 03:45:05.247]  If I were to rename it, I would call it When America Had a Soul.
[03:45:05.247 --> 03:45:11.270]  And it is a trend book in many ways in talking about where things are going.
[03:45:11.270 --> 03:45:13.831]  But more importantly, I think it's a book about
[03:45:14.249 --> 03:45:25.013]  You know, what America was, what America is, and what America can be again, if we reclaim it and take it away from the elites that have usurped so much.
[03:45:25.013 --> 03:45:37.537]  I mean, when I began my career in the workforce, I believe the differential between the CEO of a company and the average worker was about 20 to 1.
[03:45:37.537 --> 03:45:41.458]  Now it's over 500 to 1.
[03:45:41.458 --> 03:45:43.639]  But the things that you're talking about, Alex,
[03:45:44.467 --> 03:45:56.192]  on the on the military moving into our neighborhoods is so frightening and people should really really become aware of this and start doing the best they can to stop this from happening.
[03:45:56.192 --> 03:46:01.994]  Now they should go to all these city councils and say this is a violation of posse comitatus and this is in the police departments it's happening.
[03:46:03.732 --> 03:46:14.015]  You know, I remember my grandfathers and it was normal just when you were at the dinner table or even my dad to explain how governments work and how history worked and they taught the military.
[03:46:14.015 --> 03:46:20.677]  You don't have the military on the streets and we're here to defend the Constitution Bill of Rights, not what the President says if it violates that.
[03:46:20.677 --> 03:46:24.818]  And we've gone from that now to these training manuals.
[03:46:24.818 --> 03:46:26.378]  I'm going to put an old one up on screen.
[03:46:26.378 --> 03:46:28.039]  Okay, well that's the new one.
[03:46:28.039 --> 03:46:30.340]  I've already shown the old one last hour.
[03:46:30.340 --> 03:46:31.380]  Strategic Report.
[03:46:32.677 --> 03:46:35.539]  Two twenty oh nine, the modern militia movement.
[03:46:35.539 --> 03:46:40.121]  And then they mix gun owner groups, pro-gun groups in with white supremacists.
[03:46:40.121 --> 03:46:43.123]  They say those that believe in a new world order.
[03:46:43.123 --> 03:46:49.127]  These theories vary but most always involve a globalist dictatorship and a world government run by banks.
[03:46:50.325 --> 03:46:51.985]  I mean, this is openly being announced.
[03:46:51.985 --> 03:46:54.226]  They show FEMA regions.
[03:46:54.226 --> 03:47:06.509]  They show, and I'm putting on screen right now, official North American Union, SPP maps that have been on CNN of how they're going to have every major highway be an international toll road from Mexico up into the deep north of Canada.
[03:47:06.509 --> 03:47:07.909]  And they just say, it doesn't exist.
[03:47:07.909 --> 03:47:09.209]  These people are insane.
[03:47:09.209 --> 03:47:15.191]  So they're teaching police, as the New York Times, the Washington Post announced, world government, a Bank of the World, Newsweek, Time.
[03:47:15.931 --> 03:47:22.935]  You know, headlines like, in the Times of London, and now for world government, where they say we kept it secret for your own good.
[03:47:22.935 --> 03:47:41.424]  In this training manual that's going out to police everywhere in the country, it has a, you know, don't tread on me flag, it shows America freedom to fascism, and the film Zeitgeist in it, we just showed that, and shows it next to the Turner Diaries, which was a white supremacist thing about killing police.
[03:47:41.424 --> 03:47:44.266]  So see how they do guilt by association.
[03:47:45.470 --> 03:47:50.713]  I mean, this is just off the charts, and this was sent to me by the Missouri Information Analyst Center.
[03:47:50.713 --> 03:47:51.594]  A police officer sent it to me.
[03:47:51.594 --> 03:47:52.515]  That's where they got it from.
[03:47:52.515 --> 03:47:59.719]  And it says on the cover of this, unclassified, law enforcement sensitive.
[03:47:59.719 --> 03:48:02.141]  And I've seen these in Texas versions and others.
[03:48:02.141 --> 03:48:04.002]  It's the same thing, but they're updating it.
[03:48:04.002 --> 03:48:13.648]  I mean, how do they say none of this exists, and then mix in mainstream things that are happening with white supremacists and tell police that people are dangerous if they're into this?
[03:48:14.761 --> 03:48:17.324]  Well, you know, that's the way they always do things, you know.
[03:48:17.324 --> 03:48:21.548]  They lump them all together and it's one size fits all.
[03:48:21.548 --> 03:48:23.750]  I have a question.
[03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:28.315]  Do you believe that the military will fire on its people?
[03:48:30.182 --> 03:48:35.866]  They're going to stage riots, and then it's going to look like, oh, they stopped the riots, it's reasonable to set the precedent.
[03:48:35.866 --> 03:48:43.431]  Like, oh, we do have FEMA camps for medical care where you can stay, you know, the troops are here to help at car wrecks, that's how they're rolling it out.
[03:48:43.431 --> 03:48:48.975]  And I believe that, I think the way they're going to manipulate the military, I think a lot of them are going to fire on U.S.
[03:48:48.975 --> 03:48:51.157]  citizens.
[03:48:51.157 --> 03:48:56.201]  Because that's a question we're going to pose in the Trends Journal in the next edition.
[03:48:56.201 --> 03:48:58.142]  And I happen to agree with you.
[03:48:58.766 --> 03:49:00.427]  They'll stage riots.
[03:49:00.427 --> 03:49:07.673]  We always see these people that they call anarchists, that always have black, you know, always have dressed in black and have masks on.
[03:49:07.673 --> 03:49:10.155]  They've been caught being police in Denver.
[03:49:10.155 --> 03:49:10.876]  It happened in Denver.
[03:49:10.876 --> 03:49:12.177]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:49:12.177 --> 03:49:13.518]  No, no, exactly.
[03:49:13.518 --> 03:49:14.639]  I agree with you.
[03:49:14.639 --> 03:49:18.762]  And I think that they are going to fire on the people, unfortunately.
[03:49:18.762 --> 03:49:25.748]  And the only thing that we think that can happen that can stave this off
[03:49:26.360 --> 03:49:33.482]  Is if that tax revolts take a greater precedence and that we could push in a different direction sooner.
[03:49:33.482 --> 03:49:40.624]  Because we believe that this summer, you're going to start seeing the first outbreaks of major violence.
[03:49:40.624 --> 03:49:50.628]  You know, my saying as originally a Bronx boy is that when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:49:50.628 --> 03:49:55.209]  And people, you know, the white shoe boys, they have no idea what it is.
[03:49:55.851 --> 03:49:58.012]  You know, to be destitute.
[03:49:58.012 --> 03:50:11.517]  And we're going to start seeing riots in major cities that rival, way surpass, actually, those that we saw back in the 1960s, when cities were being burnt down.
[03:50:11.517 --> 03:50:18.340]  You're going to start seeing the same thing happen in the United States, we're forecasting, by this summer.
[03:50:18.340 --> 03:50:21.461]  And we're saying to people, you better prepare for the worst.
[03:50:22.375 --> 03:50:23.715]  You know what's incredible?
[03:50:23.715 --> 03:50:30.897]  This private group, and the ADL, the Department of Law Center put these out, but I've seen these similar ones all over the country.
[03:50:30.897 --> 03:50:34.519]  They end up saying in here, this is sensitive, you can't show anybody this.
[03:50:34.519 --> 03:50:49.403]  It's our free speech to show how you're demonizing the American people and how you're setting up this police state grid and mixing in good patriots and slandering, slandering things like America Freedom to Fascism, anti-freedom
[03:50:50.805 --> 03:50:52.886]  It says anti-income tax film.
[03:50:52.886 --> 03:50:54.488]  How dare them?
[03:50:54.488 --> 03:50:57.990]  And saying, oh my gosh, look at the evil symbols here.
[03:50:57.990 --> 03:50:59.591]  Our founding father's flag.
[03:50:59.591 --> 03:51:01.973]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[03:51:01.973 --> 03:51:11.879]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives, such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, Ka-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.
[03:51:11.879 --> 03:51:15.722]  South Summit has one of the largest selections of self-defense products on the web.

[03:51:54.567 --> 03:51:57.288]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.616 --> 03:52:14.479]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.479 --> 03:52:20.981]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.981 --> 03:52:22.962]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.962 --> 03:52:25.423]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.423 --> 03:52:36.308]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.613 --> 03:52:40.274]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.274 --> 03:52:42.134]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.134 --> 03:52:49.037]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.037 --> 03:52:57.300]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.300 --> 03:52:58.880]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:00.061]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.641 --> 03:53:04.562]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[03:53:04.562 --> 03:53:05.683]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[03:53:05.683 --> 03:53:09.885]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[03:53:09.885 --> 03:53:12.746]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function?
[03:53:12.746 --> 03:53:14.687]  Or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[03:53:14.687 --> 03:53:24.931]  The SinuPlus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[03:53:25.011 --> 03:53:25.311]  We're good.
[03:53:55.031 --> 03:54:12.285]  Folks, tomorrow I'm going to do a whole hour on this, and I can dig through my files.
[03:54:12.285 --> 03:54:13.065]  I've got a bunch of these.
[03:54:13.065 --> 03:54:15.647]  This is just the latest one we've gotten from police.
[03:54:15.647 --> 03:54:22.433]  It says at the top, Jeremiah W. J. Nixon, Governor, John M. Britt, Director, DPS, James F.
[03:54:23.922 --> 03:54:31.387]  Keith Lee, Colonel, MSPH, Van Godsey Director, Missouri State Highway Patrol.
[03:54:31.387 --> 03:54:34.869]  And then they say, oh police, don't you dare show this to anybody.
[03:54:34.869 --> 03:54:36.990]  This is unclassified, law enforcement sensitive.
[03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:40.492]  And they say, we'll go after anybody that covers this.
[03:54:40.492 --> 03:54:44.474]  This is the First Amendment, this is America, this is what the police and military are being trained in.
[03:54:44.474 --> 03:54:45.015]  It says here,
[03:54:45.535 --> 03:54:50.696]  North American Union conspiracy theorists claim the Union would link Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
[03:54:50.696 --> 03:54:59.098]  The NAU would unify its monetary system and trade the dollar for the Amaro, associated with a theory that is concerned over Napa Superhighway, which would fast-track between the three nations.
[03:54:59.098 --> 03:55:01.458]  And it goes on to mix it in with white supremacists.
[03:55:01.458 --> 03:55:03.919]  Well, there's the Wall Street Journal market watch.
[03:55:03.919 --> 03:55:06.560]  How realistic is a North American currency?
[03:55:06.560 --> 03:55:08.220]  It says, uniting US, Canada, Mexico.
[03:55:09.651 --> 03:55:11.532]  Money could result from crisis.
[03:55:11.532 --> 03:55:15.434]  And then they admit what we read out of the Robert Passer CFR public documents.
[03:55:15.434 --> 03:55:17.455]  Judicial Watch sued.
[03:55:17.455 --> 03:55:20.596]  And this is put out by Simon & Schuster in books now.
[03:55:20.596 --> 03:55:21.617]  Jerome Corsi.
[03:55:21.617 --> 03:55:23.278]  You guys look like fools.
[03:55:23.278 --> 03:55:23.938]  Okay?
[03:55:23.938 --> 03:55:26.459]  It's all over the news they're doing this.
[03:55:26.459 --> 03:55:29.781]  We sued and got the documents where they said it's the North American Union.
[03:55:29.781 --> 03:55:33.683]  And then you're saying we're dangerous and it's lies and telling police
[03:55:34.463 --> 03:55:39.467]  Well, the other training manual I said, if you talk about the Constitution, you're a terrorist.
[03:55:39.467 --> 03:55:40.808]  The one from Phoenix.
[03:55:40.808 --> 03:55:44.071]  Gerald Solente, I mean, this is just getting insane.
[03:55:44.071 --> 03:55:50.877]  I think they're going to start also putting in there the people that are looking to secede from the Union, all these secessionist movements.
[03:55:50.877 --> 03:55:52.278]  Oh, no, no, that's in there, that's in there.
[03:55:52.278 --> 03:55:53.659]  Oh, that's in there, okay.
[03:55:53.659 --> 03:55:58.623]  Oh, how dare these states that created the federal government, you know, declare that they're going to bring them to heel.
[03:55:58.623 --> 03:56:00.285]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:56:00.285 --> 03:56:02.687]  And no, no, we're in a very, very dangerous time.
[03:56:03.129 --> 03:56:24.238]  And the other thing that, you know, we should be looking for, because we're calling for the, as you well know, the greatest depression, and we're also looking for the collapse of 09 to begin to happen with the commercial real estate sector, which is going to be a much greater collapse than the subprime and residential sector.
[03:56:24.238 --> 03:56:30.981]  But in the meantime, we're going to start seeing some false flags to get the people's minds off the economy.
[03:56:31.798 --> 03:56:35.762]  And we're very concerned, of course, what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:56:35.762 --> 03:56:57.101]  And we just saw, for example, the one ray of hope from the Obama administration with this new diplomat, Freeman, that was forced to resign under pressure from the lobbies, the Israeli lobby, because he doesn't believe the Palestinians are being treated very well.
[03:56:57.859 --> 03:57:14.453]  And so, we think that being that the Israeli government is in such turmoil, and that there can really be some kind of Middle East conflict, and it keeps pointing to Iran.
[03:57:14.453 --> 03:57:21.859]  And we're warning that if either the United States or Israel attacks Iran in any way,
[03:57:22.446 --> 03:57:25.829]  It could be the beginning of World War III.
[03:57:25.829 --> 03:57:28.071]  Gerald Cilente, we are out of time.
[03:57:28.071 --> 03:57:31.073]  TrendsResearch.com, I appreciate you coming on once a month with us.
[03:57:31.073 --> 03:57:36.478]  I hope you'll accept the interview with Jason Bermas here on the Genesis and Infowars Network soon.
[03:57:36.478 --> 03:57:42.302]  And I want also to get you on the next month to give me a review of the Obama deception that you feature so prominently in.
[03:57:42.302 --> 03:57:44.744]  And I just want to thank you for all you do and for coming on the show.
[03:57:44.744 --> 03:57:46.546]  Oh, thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[03:57:46.926 --> 03:57:48.547]  God bless you, sir.
[03:57:48.547 --> 03:57:50.349]  Folks, I'm just reading this thing.
[03:57:50.349 --> 03:57:58.195]  It mixes white supremacists and things in with protests at the Federal Reserve locations around the country, in the Fed.
[03:57:59.821 --> 03:58:01.402]  I mean, we're not allowed to do that as Americans.
[03:58:01.402 --> 03:58:04.483]  We're not allowed to say, you know, Congress should be able to find out where the money went.
[03:58:04.483 --> 03:58:06.283]  How dare Senator Sanders ask?
[03:58:06.283 --> 03:58:07.504]  How dare Ron Paul?
[03:58:07.504 --> 03:58:12.105]  Look, police and military are sending us this because they know what's going on.
[03:58:12.105 --> 03:58:15.307]  Wake up and don't be fools, those of you out there that work for this system.
[03:58:15.307 --> 03:58:17.227]  The foreign banks have seized the U.S.
[03:58:17.227 --> 03:58:21.309]  They openly, the FEMA camps that they say don't exist in here are all over the news!
[03:58:23.447 --> 03:58:27.591]  I mean, I can go through every line in here and disprove it, and we are going to do it.
[03:58:27.591 --> 03:58:31.735]  We are going to expose this anti-American propaganda for what it is.
[03:58:31.735 --> 03:58:35.118]  It's certified by the state of Missouri, and this is going on nationwide.

[03:58:58.241 --> 03:59:01.202]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.202 --> 03:59:04.244]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.244 --> 03:59:08.967]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.207 --> 03:59:10.328]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.328 --> 03:59:13.570]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.570 --> 03:59:20.576]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
