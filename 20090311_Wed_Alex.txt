[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:31.380]  Texas Alex Jones get ready for more mass shootings all across the world as the
[00:31.380 --> 00:37.980]  bankers attempt to disarm the few slaves but still have firearms they've been
[00:37.980 --> 00:43.080]  saying this was coming you know that chimpanzee a few weeks ago it was on a
[00:43.080 --> 00:49.180]  serotonin re-uptake inhibitor in the prozac family and it had a bad trip and
[00:49.180 --> 00:55.300]  started tearing people's faces off we're gonna rip the lady's jaw and in about
[00:55.300 --> 01:02.580]  99% of the cases I mean I've only seen out of hundreds of cases a few where
[01:02.580 --> 01:11.420]  they were not on serotonin re-uptake inhibitors the prozac family and I'll
[01:11.420 --> 01:15.460]  bet you that probably both of these men had been seeing psychiatrists or
[01:15.460 --> 01:19.820]  psychologists the mass shooting in Alabama last night the mass shooting
[01:19.820 --> 01:24.100]  killing 16 in Germany that just ended with the government conveniently been
[01:24.100 --> 01:32.260]  killed and it doesn't have to be a government mind control operation
[01:32.260 --> 01:36.820]  because copycats are gonna hear about this and the media advertises the place
[01:36.820 --> 01:43.220]  to go when you're having a bad day on your prozac is a school and you go there
[01:43.220 --> 01:51.060]  and you shoot people you see the entire class of drugs known as serotonin
[01:51.060 --> 02:01.980]  re-uptake inhibitors puts you into an hallucinogenic dream world state and you
[02:01.980 --> 02:06.060]  couple that with the fact that most Americans are now in a different brain
[02:06.060 --> 02:13.020]  wave than our predecessors just 50 years ago yo yes the average American is in a
[02:13.020 --> 02:17.180]  lower brainwave mode they're in a sleep state because they watch television that
[02:17.180 --> 02:21.980]  is a scientific fact you just Google it'll be hundreds of mainstream articles
[02:21.980 --> 02:29.260]  admitting television changes brain waves television brain damages and it's
[02:29.260 --> 02:34.500]  gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse all the major studies show the
[02:34.500 --> 02:37.700]  shoot-em-up video games
[02:39.540 --> 02:45.100]  acclimate people to not care if they see real violence in the real world and
[02:45.100 --> 02:50.620]  acclimate people to be prepared to shoot and kill people in cold blood that's
[02:50.620 --> 02:55.300]  what the military uses them and develop them as training aids and that's why a
[02:55.300 --> 02:59.020]  lot of the mass shooters you see are these shoot-em-up game players and to
[02:59.020 --> 03:04.340]  them it's just a game whereas a person in the past would become very upset
[03:04.340 --> 03:10.220]  shooting people now people they don't know there are crimes of passion in the
[03:10.220 --> 03:18.500]  few cases of mass shootings that happen every few years that aren't prozac or
[03:18.500 --> 03:26.100]  drug related some of them are illegal drug related as well there's two classes
[03:26.100 --> 03:30.100]  and that is the spoiled brat live with mommy my wife divorced me so I'm gonna
[03:30.100 --> 03:34.620]  kill her and kill the kids and then kill her family there's the spoiled brat
[03:34.620 --> 03:42.060]  instant gratification mama's boy and then there is the enraged postal employee
[03:42.060 --> 03:46.180]  who goes in and shoots people at an office and those are real and they
[03:46.180 --> 03:50.780]  happen this is a violent society we've killed 50 plus million babies and
[03:50.780 --> 03:54.820]  rationalized it and said I just use it as a form of birth control and now they're
[03:54.820 --> 04:00.500]  legalized stem cell they call it stem cell that means embryonic tissue they're
[04:00.500 --> 04:07.220]  already in Europe growing the vaccines in dead babies I mean large ones they use
[04:07.220 --> 04:11.380]  that and they mix it up with monkey kidneys and a nice puree you can
[04:11.380 --> 04:14.380]  actually go read mainstream articles about that that's now going to happen
[04:14.380 --> 04:17.740]  here you hear about China with the executed convicts and they put into
[04:17.740 --> 04:25.980]  cosmetics BBC you know women pay for it use it here and in France well now you
[04:25.980 --> 04:31.060]  can see just have that this was just making our little green shoots of
[04:31.060 --> 04:35.940]  grass coming up to the ground our new humans are just a byproduct now that's
[04:35.940 --> 04:41.540]  what that is they call it a stem cell and the Patriot acts patriotic and
[04:41.540 --> 04:46.980]  pulling troops out as they build down and I mean they just have all these
[04:46.980 --> 04:51.060]  spinwards for it so we're gonna go over what's happened in Alabama and in

[08:05.180 --> 08:10.260]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:10.260 --> 08:21.540]  propaganda machine is going to overdrive hundreds of news stories this morning I pulled up calling for semi-automatic bans sheriff's
[08:21.540 --> 08:26.460]  deputies in Alabama reporting he had full auto most shootings and crimes
[08:26.460 --> 08:32.740]  aren't even committed with semi-auto and they are moving against the Second
[08:32.740 --> 08:37.540]  Amendment the fact that this nation is a mix of good hard-working intelligent
[08:37.540 --> 08:44.500]  dynamic inventive people full of ingenuity but there's also a lot of
[08:44.500 --> 08:49.060]  spoiled rotten mentally ill scum hopped up on every different type of Prozac
[08:49.060 --> 08:55.660]  hopped up on illegal drugs and that's all the more reason that we should all
[08:55.660 --> 09:01.500]  have firearms I mean I have one right here in my studio because some nut
[09:01.500 --> 09:05.660]  comes around here I'm not gonna get down on my knees and say please please don't
[09:05.660 --> 09:14.020]  blow my brains out I'm gonna defend myself like my forefathers did now more
[09:14.020 --> 09:17.180]  children died an average year of football accidents you can pull those
[09:17.180 --> 09:21.500]  numbers up but a lot of mainstream articles written about that over the
[09:21.500 --> 09:30.180]  years then die in shootings hundreds of times of people die in car wrecks last
[09:30.180 --> 09:33.300]  time I looked in the world almanac it was 12 times as many people die from
[09:33.300 --> 09:40.100]  drowning do we ban swimming do we ban driving and automobiles do we just lock
[09:40.100 --> 09:43.780]  ourselves up in our houses and wear football helmets and in cow or in the
[09:43.780 --> 09:47.540]  closet none of us are gonna make it out of this world alive that's a hundred
[09:47.540 --> 09:53.220]  percent death is the great equalizer every single one of us was born into
[09:53.220 --> 09:58.620]  this world and every single one of us is gonna go right back into dust ashes to
[09:58.620 --> 10:04.740]  dust to dust and I'm gonna break down the psychology of these mass shootings
[10:04.740 --> 10:07.260]  tell you about some of the guests we've got coming up later in the show and I'm
[10:07.260 --> 10:10.740]  gonna open the phones up at the bottom of the hour in 20 minutes here so here's
[10:10.740 --> 10:16.500]  the phone number 1-800-259-9231
[10:16.500 --> 10:24.220]  1-800-259-9231 and I would hope you'd want to talk about the CFR basically
[10:24.220 --> 10:28.060]  announcing world government oven by the banks yesterday on national TV with Ben
[10:28.060 --> 10:30.700]  Bernanke the head of the private Federal Reserve I would hope you'd want to talk
[10:30.700 --> 10:35.020]  about the mass shootings in Alabama and Germany I would hope that you would want
[10:35.020 --> 10:37.420]  to talk about how they're now saying they're going to go ahead and try to
[10:37.420 --> 10:43.420]  pass the assault and span but expand it now on the heels of this I would hope
[10:43.420 --> 10:45.940]  you bring up those you know issues that I think are very important you can talk
[10:45.940 --> 10:51.460]  about whatever you want 1-800-259-9231 by the way yesterday I talked about maybe
[10:51.460 --> 10:56.620]  releasing the Obama deception last night or today but the uploaded versions we
[10:56.620 --> 11:00.780]  have were the low res quality ones you know that we post for folks that have
[11:00.780 --> 11:04.380]  dial-up that are prison planet on TV members and we've completed uploading
[11:04.380 --> 11:10.140]  all of the high res flash and high res div x and a bunch of other stuff we're
[11:10.140 --> 11:15.900]  gonna like seven different formats when we're done I'm gonna leave it open you
[11:15.900 --> 11:21.700]  know I could pull the trigger today I could pull it tomorrow I would imagine
[11:21.700 --> 11:25.060]  it's not gonna end up launching on Sunday at 6 p.m. like I've been saying I
[11:25.060 --> 11:39.220]  always launch about a day early I later in the show I may talk about why why I'm
[11:39.220 --> 11:45.700]  launching an early but I I had to talk to council yesterday and council concurred
[11:45.700 --> 11:51.260]  with me but I had to check and that council is checking with some other
[11:51.260 --> 11:59.540]  council and well you know what I'll just go ahead and tell you what's going on
[11:59.540 --> 12:03.300]  then I'll get into the troops running around in Alabama at the mass shooting
[12:03.300 --> 12:14.980]  I tried US Army regular Army we've had the FBI calling up and calling different
[12:14.980 --> 12:19.660]  extensions in the office trying to talk to employees here at the office and then
[12:19.660 --> 12:23.060]  when I get on the phone and I call them and it is the FBI and it's real agents
[12:23.060 --> 12:26.220]  they say we're not gonna tell you what it's about we're just asking you
[12:26.220 --> 12:30.740]  questions over the phone and I think it's pure harassment because we're like
[12:30.740 --> 12:35.500]  where is your office physically located tell us where your servers are located
[12:35.500 --> 12:43.980]  and I'm like hey pal you need to send me a subpoena so that's where I am right
[12:43.980 --> 12:48.300]  now it's it's not fun to have them calling up and they call up when I'm on
[12:48.300 --> 12:54.300]  air so I can't go to the telephone I've had to refer them to council and it's
[12:54.300 --> 13:01.060]  not fun talking to FBI people and they won't tell you what it's about on some
[13:01.060 --> 13:06.100]  fishing expedition and there's been some snoopy questions surrounding the
[13:06.100 --> 13:13.460]  film and so that's what we listen folks Tommy Chong you know movie star top
[13:13.460 --> 13:24.260]  comedian his son had a pipe company that sold pipes for smoking cannabis hemp and
[13:24.260 --> 13:27.860]  they had it totally legal it's legal in all 50 states there's a few cities in
[13:27.860 --> 13:35.340]  the country over they've passed laws saying you can't sell these here and so
[13:35.340 --> 13:41.060]  they the the FBI and DEA sent in three employees into their company and they
[13:41.060 --> 13:52.660]  kept catching them and firing them trying to mail out a cannabis pipe and the
[13:52.660 --> 13:56.660]  third person they didn't catch and he mailed it out and then it came out in
[13:56.660 --> 14:00.380]  court that the government had sent an informant in done it set him up and
[14:00.380 --> 14:03.700]  they didn't care things are so kangaroo so corrupt even though he had great
[14:03.700 --> 14:08.380]  lawyers he went to jail for what was it two and a half years and he was
[14:08.380 --> 14:11.620]  interviewed in prison like Kevin Booth that's in the film American drug war we
[14:11.620 --> 14:18.820]  carry that I consulted on that info wars calm then he gets out and a separate
[14:18.820 --> 14:26.820]  group of filmmakers make aka Tommy Chong and so the FBI then rage the day
[14:26.820 --> 14:32.060]  before it's going to be shipped they wait to do that they raid and grab of the
[14:32.060 --> 14:36.900]  films saying well this could be evidence of more of Tommy Chong's crimes because
[14:36.900 --> 14:39.860]  he's talking about it in there and then of course it blew up in their face and
[14:39.860 --> 14:43.020]  they got in trouble and then suddenly the film got distributed worldwide it was
[14:43.020 --> 14:47.260]  going to be that big and went on showtime and airs every week and you've got
[14:47.260 --> 14:50.340]  the Liberty dollars there's hundreds of little private mints that put out all
[14:50.340 --> 14:56.700]  sorts of you know silver and gold coins it's totally legal totally lawful any of
[14:56.700 --> 15:00.780]  you could start a little mint and put out copper silver gold coins and there's
[15:00.780 --> 15:06.980]  literally hundreds in the U.S. the guy that I ran the Liberty mint with the
[15:06.980 --> 15:10.860]  Ron Paul Liberty dollars I remember seeing him on TV and infomercials when
[15:10.860 --> 15:15.300]  he ran the Hawaiian they call it the Hawaii mint putting out you know
[15:15.300 --> 15:20.460]  commemorative coins commemorating Ronald Reagan well they rated them and
[15:20.460 --> 15:25.020]  grabbed all their computers all their equipment all their servers all every
[15:25.020 --> 15:28.660]  everything and they never did anything with it it was just we're here to ruin
[15:28.660 --> 15:34.860]  you this is what we're here to do and there's scores of other cases of people
[15:34.860 --> 15:38.940]  like Erwin Schiff writing a book exposing how the IRS collects for the
[15:38.940 --> 15:42.060]  private Federal Reserve and how it's all a fraud and they told him don't publish
[15:42.060 --> 15:44.500]  that book don't sell one more copy or we're gonna arrest you and he was
[15:44.500 --> 15:49.780]  arrested and he's in prison right now I mean I could go on and on and on and on
[15:49.780 --> 15:59.300]  and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on now I have some more
[15:59.300 --> 16:02.780]  promo videos coming out and I have some interviews I did concerning the film and
[16:02.780 --> 16:08.060]  I wanted to release it in that order and if anything did happen to this office
[16:08.060 --> 16:11.300]  in many criminal activity was carried out by the government against the First
[16:11.300 --> 16:16.860]  Amendment this Nazi Soviet degenerate state we live in all it will make the
[16:16.860 --> 16:20.740]  film do is blow up a million times bigger so in a sick way I hope they do
[16:20.740 --> 16:26.100]  something but I just don't want to have to deal with it and and and the other
[16:26.100 --> 16:30.380]  issue is it is uploaded in other locations it's ready to simultaneously
[16:30.380 --> 16:34.740]  go up on a whole bunch of YouTube's and a whole bunch of Googles and because I
[16:34.740 --> 16:40.140]  my gut has always been so accurate it's just scary and I've never been paranoid
[16:40.140 --> 16:45.220]  before I put out a previous film and I've just been man I feel the disturbance
[16:45.220 --> 16:49.740]  here I I'm really worried and then all the sudden ring ring ring hello hello we
[16:49.740 --> 16:58.580]  have questions we won't say what it's about and so it's just mind-blowing so
[16:58.580 --> 17:05.260]  there there you have what's going on and they are not happy about the Obama
[17:05.260 --> 17:10.300]  deception and different employees being called up being quizzed about this and
[17:10.300 --> 17:14.380]  that well what are you asking about well I'm not gonna tell you but so this
[17:14.380 --> 17:17.740]  company's Alex Jones's company and this is the address this is this is where you

[17:23.020 --> 17:25.420]  of those

[17:34.460 --> 17:38.300]  tell you what it's about Alex but
[17:38.300 --> 17:49.460]  and I'm just like here's my lawyer subpoena so I mean I've got FBI fishing
[17:49.460 --> 17:53.340]  lines flying through the windows here at my office basically as a drag net over
[17:53.340 --> 17:58.420]  the office they're circling like sharks and President Obama is not pleased with
[17:58.420 --> 18:08.260]  this film I'd say 98% chance it has to do with the Obama deception and I
[18:08.260 --> 18:17.860] 'm not gonna sit here and lay down and take this there's also things like well
[18:17.860 --> 18:21.700]  it'd be nice if you wouldn't talk about us calling you know we can't tell you

[18:33.700 --> 18:36.660]  telling the truth I know the government's criminal the FBI works for a
[18:36.660 --> 18:39.980]  bunch of Bernie Madoffs to rob the country blind they got the army standing
[18:39.980 --> 18:44.740]  by in case the people try to resist it and we're going to hell in the hand
[18:44.740 --> 18:48.100]  basket and maybe all you FBI agents think it's cute that your mommy and your
[18:48.100 --> 18:51.620]  daddy and your kids have no future in the country totally shot and fried maybe

[24:37.740 --> 24:40.260]  planting gardens and things as they've heard the news saying it's a good thing
[24:40.260 --> 24:47.700]  to do just an example of total tyranny we're all just prisoners and then I was
[24:47.700 --> 24:52.380]  writing in this morning listening to XM radio and I heard it was AP Network
[24:52.380 --> 24:57.180]  News reporting in Connecticut they've introduced a bill for the state to
[24:57.180 --> 25:03.380]  control the what's taught in the Catholic Church and they were saying you
[25:03.380 --> 25:08.820]  could spread to other religions making Christian denominations and others not
[25:08.820 --> 25:14.260]  criticize homosexuals and wherever you are on this issue you should be for the
[25:14.260 --> 25:17.420]  First Amendment and Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
[25:17.420 --> 25:20.620]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof so I forgot to tell the
[25:20.620 --> 25:30.940]  guys will you guys Google Connecticut Bill Catholic Church for me and I heard
[25:30.940 --> 25:36.580]  a lengthy report on it and I want to get to that later because it's just getting
[25:36.580 --> 25:42.420]  crazier and crazier and crazier and there's just so much happening from so
[25:42.420 --> 25:46.660]  many different angles I don't even know what to say anymore
[25:47.500 --> 25:52.140]  in Canada they ban people reading from the Bible you know criticizing
[25:52.140 --> 25:58.300]  certain sexual acts and other things because it's hateful see first it's oh
[25:58.300 --> 26:01.340]  you can't question the Holocaust and whether you agree with that or not it's
[26:01.340 --> 26:05.820]  it's free speech and then it's oh you can't criticize the EU and they fire
[26:05.820 --> 26:10.460]  ministers for it oh and and you know now you can't criticize immigrants and
[26:10.460 --> 26:13.620]  they're passing this all over the world they're trying here in the United States
[26:13.620 --> 26:23.140]  this is unified now remember that they've announced that Marines are running
[26:23.140 --> 26:29.500]  around California in other areas running DWI warrantless checkpoints with the
[26:29.500 --> 26:37.580]  police and then when people criticize they go you're not for drunk drivers are
[26:37.580 --> 26:46.620]  you and then the army has announced that they are going to have 20,000 trips on
[26:46.620 --> 26:49.820]  the streets of America and they're going to be out at car wrecks with the jaws
[26:49.820 --> 26:52.820]  of life well the army's here I mean what's wrong with them with the jaws of
[26:52.820 --> 26:56.260]  life but then you read the Army War College in the Pentagon Directive and it
[26:56.260 --> 27:00.100]  says no we're preparing to engage the American people
[27:04.180 --> 27:12.860]  and then there's another story today posted up on info wars dot com about
[27:12.860 --> 27:20.300]  police in Washington State start liaison program with the US Army now this
[27:20.300 --> 27:23.620]  has already been going on covertly but but now they're announcing it to the
[27:23.620 --> 27:27.860]  slaves this is out of the news tribune Washington State cops start liaison
[27:27.860 --> 27:33.740]  program with the US Army and the Pentagon says North comms lead role will be
[27:33.740 --> 27:37.900]  commanding the states commanding the governors commanding the legislators and
[27:37.900 --> 27:45.300]  the US Congress is secondary to the president and not involved in the
[27:45.300 --> 27:49.900]  continuity of government well I want to get into the terrible shooting leaving

[34:00.940 --> 34:05.180]  setting up a new bank of the world and how we can stop them and his whole
[34:05.180 --> 34:08.900]  agenda of the police state the troops on the streets the FEMA camps the youth
[34:08.900 --> 34:15.580]  brigades the tattletale squads the million person security force the carbon
[34:15.580 --> 34:23.420]  taxes it's all covered in 112 minutes and then there is about 30 minutes of

[34:49.780 --> 34:55.940]  fool to wait with the stuff that's going on around here because dead men tell no
[34:55.940 --> 35:03.220]  tales or in prison men don't tell as many tales once the salvo is launched that
[35:03.220 --> 35:12.900]  kind of puts the kibosh on anything the boys in black are planning so be advised
[35:12.900 --> 35:18.100]  of that okay I know we've got loaded phone lines here we don't have a guest
[35:18.100 --> 35:20.460]  coming on for about an hour and a half so we're gonna play a time to take your
[35:20.460 --> 35:27.140]  calls I am gonna go to them here in a few minutes to Eric and John and Bob and
[35:27.140 --> 35:33.780]  Susie and Mark and actually I just pulled up
[35:33.780 --> 35:37.180]  Burmese's I am from last night from the network in Minnesota I've got to pull up
[35:37.180 --> 35:43.180]  there's two of them named GCN now oh Adam and Australia Charles Rourke
[35:43.180 --> 35:46.540]  Brandon Tony and others okay there we go I was looking at some last night caller
[35:46.540 --> 35:48.660]  list
[35:49.100 --> 35:52.900]  Burmese does the show from 9 to midnight central standard time right here in the
[35:52.900 --> 36:04.700]  seat I now inhabit I now nest in the disheveled blob Alex Jones but the mind
[36:04.700 --> 36:12.020]  is so alive crackling with electricity and thoughts and ideas and plans within
[36:12.020 --> 36:22.700]  plans within plans all right terrible news obviously you know about Alabama
[36:22.700 --> 36:30.340]  you're hearing all the calls to disarm the slaves gunman turns small Alabama
[36:30.340 --> 36:36.380]  town into a slaughterhouse ABC News chief says gunman attacked with AK-47 assault
[36:36.380 --> 36:40.780]  rifle and the police are saying fully auto so low there is a restricted gun but
[36:40.780 --> 36:46.060]  they had it mm-hmm he spared no one not his mother not his grandparents not the
[36:46.060 --> 36:50.060]  children not even the family dogs investigators following the 24-mile
[36:50.060 --> 36:54.540]  trail of death through southern Alabama are still trying to determine what set
[36:54.540 --> 36:59.900]  Michael McLinden on a murderous shooting rampage that led to the deaths of 11
[36:59.900 --> 37:05.220]  people including himself he cleaned his family out Coffee County corner Robert
[37:05.220 --> 37:09.500]  preacher said we don't know what triggered it we don't know what triggered
[37:09.500 --> 37:14.180]  it I mean his he lived with his mother his wife again I guess it divorced him
[37:14.180 --> 37:17.900]  and the children live somewhere else and it looks like he may have lost his job
[37:17.900 --> 37:26.780]  from some factory and he threw a fit and killed mommy then he burned down the
[37:26.780 --> 37:30.260]  house what happens they kill one person and then they heard it advertised in the
[37:30.260 --> 37:34.620]  media a million times the thing to do once you've done this is not turn
[37:34.620 --> 37:40.500]  yourself in or not blow your own head off the thing to do is run around and
[37:40.500 --> 37:44.540]  kill your whole family dress up like Santa Claus go to the front door you're
[37:44.540 --> 37:53.860]  mad your ex-wife left you and took the kids so you kill them because we are a
[37:53.860 --> 38:01.460]  spoiled wicked degenerate culture on average not everybody now remember the
[38:01.460 --> 38:05.060]  chimpanzee a few weeks ago tearing the ladies mandible off ripping her eyeballs
[38:05.060 --> 38:15.700]  out ripping her face off attacking police the chimpanzee was on a prozac drug
[38:15.700 --> 38:19.780]  forget the exact one you can pull it up was all over the nose she had it hopped
[38:19.780 --> 38:25.020]  up on a psychotropic chimpanzees don't normally do that in the cases that they
[38:25.020 --> 38:28.140]  have torn people apart they've been drunk or they've been given cocaine in the
[38:28.140 --> 38:35.420]  past but a hundred pound chimp is as strong as a five hundred pound pure
[38:35.420 --> 38:41.500]  muscle man this sucker weighed 200 pounds he's a biggin he had the strength
[38:41.500 --> 38:49.420]  of a 1000 pound linebacker they're so strong they could take one finger and
[38:49.420 --> 38:57.900]  just rip your nose off with it I've told the stories about my only was my dad
[38:57.900 --> 39:03.500]  great uncle so I guess what would you call him my great great uncle uncle
[39:03.500 --> 39:12.380]  Houston as he was known and he ran away when he was 13 got on ship sell around
[39:12.380 --> 39:17.420]  the world came back ran booze during the depression but the point was he would
[39:17.420 --> 39:20.420]  tell my dad all these stories and now he died I was about five I remember talking
[39:20.420 --> 39:27.220]  to him and he would talk about how they would you know in Galveston how they
[39:27.220 --> 39:31.820]  would have the chimpanzee why am I telling the stories just so interesting
[39:31.820 --> 39:36.060]  how they would have a little champ they get like an 80 pound one looks little
[39:36.060 --> 39:38.500]  looks sweet sitting there and they can put in the boxing ring and they'd have
[39:38.500 --> 39:41.740]  the big fairgrounds and they'd get all these big old country boys in there and
[39:41.740 --> 39:45.740]  guys that could you know throw a steer over no problem or whatever you know
[39:45.740 --> 39:48.900]  thinking they're tough and they are tough watch those guys those rodeos are
[39:48.900 --> 39:53.380]  tough it would always be a rodeo champ and it'd be some big thousand dollar
[39:53.380 --> 39:56.300]  cash prize they build it up all week and he's gonna fight the champ they put
[39:56.300 --> 39:59.300]  gloves on the chimps again tear the guy's face off and he'd you know get
[39:59.300 --> 40:02.220]  some 250 pound good old boy get in there and he'd go right in and the chimp
[40:02.220 --> 40:05.980]  would jump up and down and beg to not be hit and then the guy hit the chimp and
[40:05.980 --> 40:14.180]  the chimp in seconds would punch him like 50 times just out so what have they
[40:14.180 --> 40:20.140]  done now bunch of states are passing laws to ban owning basically any wild
[40:20.140 --> 40:26.220]  animals in some states or chimpanzees see what prozac has done again and I'm
[40:26.220 --> 40:31.100]  not saying it's even a good thing to own a chimp but that's freedom folks
[40:32.660 --> 40:37.260]  the point is you don't put chimpanzees on psychotropic drugs in the hallucinogen
[40:37.260 --> 40:39.620]  class
[40:44.060 --> 40:49.820]  you'll fade or the mixed martial arts world champion one in six billion as they
[40:49.820 --> 41:06.540]  call him fade or a 75 pound chimp with the total destroying so I've said my
[41:06.540 --> 41:13.500]  point on that 99% of the time I mean I can only think of a few cases where in
[41:13.500 --> 41:16.420]  hindsight we find out the person's been in counseling they've been put on a
[41:16.420 --> 41:20.380]  serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug and it just guns you got a band if you want to
[41:20.380 --> 41:23.540]  stop this you know why not ban the prozac which now in its insert admits it
[41:23.540 --> 41:28.580]  causes psychopathic breaks suicidal tendencies violent tendencies every time
[41:28.580 --> 41:34.020]  I see an article where a woman drives her children off into a lake that happened
[41:34.020 --> 41:37.380]  a decade ago or so the first time and women heard about it on TV and then they
[41:37.380 --> 41:41.460]  copycat oh that's what I do I put my three or four kids in I strap them in I
[41:41.460 --> 41:45.740]  tie them down in the car and I drive it off and in every single case they've
[41:45.740 --> 41:51.580]  been on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor every case you know you read about women
[41:51.580 --> 41:56.140]  in just in my own state a woman in Dallas or what was a farmer's branch or a
[41:56.140 --> 42:01.340]  woman in Houston it always happens in clusters because it's on the news and
[42:01.340 --> 42:05.020]  they call that's what I do I better do that and they they come in and they
[42:05.020 --> 42:11.460]  grab their babies and they chop their arms off the butcher knives just Google
[42:11.460 --> 42:15.900]  woman kills baby with butcher knife you know ban butcher knives actually
[42:15.900 --> 42:19.700]  England's talking about doing that no it's the human mind is the problem
[42:19.700 --> 42:25.020]  that's what's going on here and all these cases it happens all it's a favorite
[42:25.020 --> 42:27.780]  thing on one of these serotonin reuptake inhibitors I've seen stories out of
[42:27.780 --> 42:32.900]  Utah stories out of Texas and where women dance naked on roofs I don't know
[42:32.900 --> 42:36.620]  why that's what they do on it it'll pull up in some mansion there'll be some
[42:36.620 --> 42:40.660]  gorgeous you know middle-aged woman naked dancing cutting her breasts off with
[42:40.660 --> 42:44.740]  a butcher knife up on top the house and the cops go we got another prozac head
[42:44.740 --> 42:50.740]  police know this because it's a hallucinogen folks puts you in a
[42:50.740 --> 42:55.940]  hallucinogenic state and when you have a bad trip it's over hey you take PCP take
[42:55.940 --> 43:00.340]  LSD I take it a hundred times you don't have a bad trip but that one time Mike
[43:00.340 --> 43:05.140]  Nelson ought to get him in here Derek Einkauf they were both EMT's previously
[43:05.140 --> 43:11.100]  Mike in San Marcos San Antonio and Derek down in Houston and Derek had to quit
[43:11.100 --> 43:14.580]  because he you know the last time he said he went to some house and this is
[43:14.580 --> 43:18.700]  these drug dealers and left cocaine out in the 18-month-old toddler eating a
[43:18.700 --> 43:22.060]  bunch of it and the baby was blew down on the ground he had to quit but but the
[43:22.060 --> 43:28.180]  issue is they both went to calls with PCP heads just like a chimpanzee the
[43:28.180 --> 43:33.180]  people's ears their noses their faces would be torn off there'd be some guy
[43:33.180 --> 43:41.060]  on PCP out of the park both cases and somebody mess with them and the PCP
[43:41.060 --> 43:48.900]  person in both cases little guys would just tear the person's face off they're
[43:48.900 --> 43:56.260]  on a hardcore hallucinogen there've been cases where somebody's been on PCP with a
[43:56.260 --> 44:00.700]  gun and the police have shot him 20 30 times before they quit attacking back so
[44:00.700 --> 44:04.460]  you've got the American people there were over a hundred million prescriptions
[44:04.460 --> 44:10.260]  for Prozac alone last year 2008 I heard that number on Fox radio news they
[44:10.260 --> 44:16.180]  were announcing it proudly on KLB J 590 a few months ago 100 million
[44:16.180 --> 44:25.340]  prescriptions and they've got all these people on it let's talk about what this
[44:25.340 --> 44:30.500]  is doing you know all these scores of women that have died from the HPV shot
[44:30.500 --> 44:33.500]  you hear national calls to ban it or restrict it no they say give it more
[44:33.500 --> 44:37.540]  make people take it what about people dying of these injections you're talking
[44:37.540 --> 44:40.340]  about restricting them or having a five-day waiting period on them or
[44:40.340 --> 44:45.500]  banning them oh no you've got to take more 23 homeless people are given
[44:45.500 --> 44:50.620]  bird flu vaccine drop dead Google it now there's no talk of restricting that no
[44:50.620 --> 45:02.500]  they decide to hype up and create all this you've got Germany where you can
[45:02.500 --> 45:05.820]  own a gun if you go through all the psychological testing pay all these fees
[45:05.820 --> 45:09.980]  and then keep your gun locked up at a shooting club did that stop this lunatic
[45:09.980 --> 45:14.500]  who I'll I mean Germany even more of them are on Prozac drugs I'll guarantee you
[45:14.500 --> 45:18.740]  one of these two guys if not both it's gonna come out in a few days when
[45:18.740 --> 45:24.860]  nobody's paying attention every mall shooter every per every time I can't
[45:24.860 --> 45:30.420]  even remember anywhere it wasn't he goes in the school copycatting when he heard
[45:30.420 --> 45:35.660]  last night and now you're gonna have more copycats it'll need to have MK ultra
[45:35.660 --> 45:38.500]  you know somebody grabbed in a government laboratory to do this which
[45:38.500 --> 45:42.860]  they can do that's been declassified in the 70s and church hearings and others
[45:42.860 --> 45:47.860]  in Congress it's under Frank Church no the TVs of mind control device the
[45:47.860 --> 45:52.900]  video games the culture the way they advertise this is what you do
[45:52.900 --> 45:59.380]  German school gunman kills 16 people 16 people have been killed by a teenage
[45:59.380 --> 46:03.100]  gunman who went on a rampage in southwest Germany I'll bet my bottom
[46:03.100 --> 46:08.580]  dollar this guy was in psychiatric care and I bet my bottom dollar that it's
[46:08.580 --> 46:15.180]  going to be discovered that somebody gave him the gun with a connection to
[46:15.180 --> 46:20.940]  intelligence services and we've seen this in case after case after case after
[46:20.940 --> 46:28.220]  case after case after case after case after case after case after case and
[46:28.220 --> 46:31.820]  her demos got some very suspicious articles up there dealing with the
[46:31.820 --> 46:40.220]  German case right now 16 people have been killed by a teenage gunman among the
[46:40.220 --> 46:53.660]  dead are himself and it continues here the gunman a 17 year old former people
[46:53.660 --> 46:58.780]  entered the school at about 830 Greenwich meantime dressed in black combat
[46:58.780 --> 47:05.060]  gear and open fire at random always in the black he fled in a stolen car but
[47:05.060 --> 47:09.260]  was later killed in a shootout with police German Chancellor Angela Merkel
[47:09.260 --> 47:13.380]  described the shooting as incomprehensible oh is the million three
[47:13.380 --> 47:16.340]  hundred thousand that Iraq he's is that you know wine and rub your hands together
[47:16.340 --> 47:19.820]  about that yes it's horrible we're sad for these dead people but the point is
[47:19.820 --> 47:26.900]  you've got a disarmed population they got basically a total gunband there and
[47:26.900 --> 47:36.060]  what's the call more gun control this is a day of mourning for the whole of
[47:36.060 --> 47:43.860]  Germany police said the suspect now named as Tim Kretschumer was killed during a
[47:43.860 --> 47:51.700]  shootout with officers in the town about 40 kilometers away from school and you
[47:51.700 --> 47:54.980]  know what every week in Germany and England the US I see where a crazy cop
[47:54.980 --> 47:58.260]  usually on Prozac goes out and shoots his whole family and it goes on a
[47:58.260 --> 48:02.900]  shooting rampage they had one up in Dallas a few months ago or troops come
[48:02.900 --> 48:06.380]  home and do a mass shooting and that's kept kind of quiet so I'm nine dead in
[48:06.380 --> 48:11.060]  the troop of you know not a big dealer oh five dead a killed whole family killed
[48:11.060 --> 48:14.500]  neighbor you know it's just kind of a blur but when it's not a cop or the
[48:14.500 --> 48:17.820]  military going crazy you know are we gonna disarm them they're still gonna go
[48:17.820 --> 48:23.940]  crazy no don't disarm the police and military but don't disarm the American
[48:23.940 --> 48:30.620]  people he had fled in the car he and hijacked at the school shooting killing
[48:30.620 --> 48:37.380]  a passenger as he made his escape police said spokesman Eka Buck Miller said
[48:37.380 --> 48:41.420]  the shootout took place at a car showroom where two bystanders were killed
[48:41.420 --> 48:45.620]  and two police officers were injured the suspect also died as a result of the
[48:45.620 --> 48:49.300]  shooting well at least the Germans went after him in the United States at every
[48:49.300 --> 48:53.700]  mass shooting we've seen for hours like Blacksburg they just stand down as the
[48:53.700 --> 49:00.980]  feds tell them to and whoo same thing a Columbine the Germans stormed in there
[49:00.980 --> 49:04.380]  and two haven't got shot but they killed him
[49:05.500 --> 49:20.460]  oh boy so now they come out every day DWI checkpoints car racks all the army

[54:26.820 --> 54:33.140]  in the world but I wanted to tell you over a month ago we heard from military
[54:33.140 --> 54:38.180]  intel people here at our two police and military associations that you're gonna
[54:38.180 --> 54:42.740]  see more mind control assassins no I know you've you've actually said that here
[54:42.740 --> 54:47.820]  on the show and I've seen your reports on that right and and so I just wanted to
[54:47.820 --> 54:53.060]  tell the people that this is what's going on a month ago we knew that Eric
[54:53.060 --> 54:58.420]  Holder communist Eric Holder and totally anti guns in the hands of the
[54:58.420 --> 55:06.020]  American people and Obamination our phony president he hates guns he's a
[55:06.020 --> 55:10.060]  communist he wants all the guns out of the hands of the people and so our
[55:10.060 --> 55:14.260]  military intel told us that we would see more of these mind control assassins
[55:14.260 --> 55:18.700]  going in and shooting up their families killing their families and killing
[55:18.700 --> 55:24.700]  children and killing masses of people and that's exactly what's happening now
[55:24.700 --> 55:29.100]  brother so you're right on target and I just wanted to tell the people that we
[55:29.100 --> 55:35.020]  have here at our two police and military association that issue that explains
[55:35.020 --> 55:39.820]  government's five easy steps to creating a mind control assassin out of anyone
[55:39.820 --> 55:45.580]  even you you go into your psychologist or psychiatrist and they put you under
[55:45.580 --> 55:50.380]  hypnosis the government can tell them to make you a mind control assassin and
[55:50.380 --> 55:54.540]  only takes an hour for him to put a key in your brain with drugs you know they
[55:54.540 --> 55:57.820]  drug you know they get caught all the time they get caught all the time
[55:57.820 --> 56:04.460]  spiking people's water with the hallucinogens sure and so our spring 2007
[56:04.460 --> 56:08.740]  ain't the best police military newsletter on constitutional issues is the one
[56:08.740 --> 56:12.620]  that they could order through us if they want to share it with their families

[56:47.740 --> 56:51.140]  say how much I respect everything you're doing first of all before I get
[56:51.140 --> 56:54.700]  started now I think you've been responsible for waking up millions of
[56:54.700 --> 56:57.700]  people around the world and I really respect you for that so thank you very
[56:57.700 --> 57:01.660]  much thank you sir one thing I wanted to mention I'm actually from a
[57:01.660 --> 57:06.060]  organization called Truth Movement Australia I know that you have hundreds
[57:06.060 --> 57:10.380]  of thousands of Australians that listen to your show every day and I just wanted
[57:10.380 --> 57:14.820]  to give a shout out to them to let them know that we do exist because I know
[57:14.820 --> 57:19.100]  that a lot of Australians are wondering you know where to go for meet-ups and my
[57:19.100 --> 57:21.820]  thought though you know with the censorship these days which with what's
[57:21.820 --> 57:26.540]  happening in regards to the newspapers the TVs yeah we've got to organize now
[57:26.540 --> 57:29.460]  before they shut the web down which they're already in the process of doing
[57:29.460 --> 57:32.900]  and as you know in Australia the censorship here is getting worse and
[57:32.900 --> 57:37.340]  worse they've announced a Chinese style net censorship being implemented now
[57:37.340 --> 57:40.740]  that's the government has announced their shutting down free speech exactly
[57:40.740 --> 57:44.420]  right and that's why it's so important that we start to get together with
[57:44.420 --> 57:48.100]  networking and meet-ups so what we start to do is to start bringing out bigger
[57:48.100 --> 57:53.140]  speakers that that are well known for their truth information and bring them
[57:53.140 --> 57:56.740]  out to Australia to start speaking I've actually got David Ike speaking in
[57:56.740 --> 58:01.340]  Australia next month to about 1500 people I've also got Peter Joseph coming
[58:01.340 --> 58:04.980]  out and my I wanted to ask you are you interested in coming out to speak in
[58:04.980 --> 58:08.820]  Australia because you know I you know I just can't do it and I appreciate your
[58:08.820 --> 58:12.380]  call I am here producing media doing radio shows that's what we reach the
[58:12.380 --> 58:16.180]  maximum amount that's why I don't do more speaking engagements we get offers

[1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:25.700]  Alex Jones we are continuing with open phones right now responding to the mass
[1:00:25.700 --> 1:00:29.940]  shootings in Alabama and Germany the calls for massive attacks on the Second
[1:00:29.940 --> 1:00:32.940]  Amendment Germany they're already disarmed but they're saying even more gun
[1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:37.740]  control there when it's basically impossible not a gun right now though
[1:00:37.740 --> 1:00:42.820]  let's talk to more callers here let's talk to Charles in Florida Charles you're
[1:00:42.820 --> 1:00:50.180]  on the air Alex I have a question and comment what do you think like substance
[1:00:50.180 --> 1:00:56.380]  abuse treatment how to have what kind of role is that play with eugenics and my
[1:00:56.380 --> 1:01:03.860]  comment is do you think that the feds could use like we shut down free speech
[1:01:03.860 --> 1:01:09.860]  it's just like need random organizations terrorist organizations and then just
[1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:14.980]  like and just like if you are charitable to them they just like a rescue yes I
[1:01:14.980 --> 1:01:17.740]  appreciate your call they're doing that but they're also shutting down that
[1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:21.060]  neutrality they're taxing the internet they're openly saying in the New York
[1:01:21.060 --> 1:01:24.300]  Times everywhere else that they'll quote have a new safer internet where you
[1:01:24.300 --> 1:01:27.980]  don't have any rights and where there's no free speech and so that's the way it's
[1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:30.220]  being done with filtration systems and other things
[1:01:30.220 --> 1:01:39.580]  work in Texas you're on the air I have to say that I disagree with the direction
[1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:44.540]  the movement is heading and I believe the restoration is a cop out because I
[1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:49.340]  haven't seen any state's legislatures that really accept this movement yet well
[1:01:49.340 --> 1:01:54.140]  maybe if everybody has a loser attitude like you it won't happen and just I
[1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:59.860]  don't see anything happening there were 14 states that did pass it in the 90s
[1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:03.740]  there in the process of doing it 30 plus states have introduced at the point is
[1:02:03.740 --> 1:02:08.220]  the idea of state sovereignty is taking place in several states are on the
[1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:14.220]  verge of doing it Rourke yeah but I don't think it can end there well no it
[1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:18.580]  certainly doesn't but I mean it's just one of many solutions like calling for
[1:02:18.580 --> 1:02:22.620]  the indictment of Ben Bernanke and other banksters that engage in all these
[1:02:22.620 --> 1:02:25.980]  crimes you heard Ron Paul talking about it yesterday I mean there's a lot of
[1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:29.820]  solutions we're pushing here and you're welcome to give us your solutions
[1:02:29.820 --> 1:02:36.180]  Rourke well the way that you have set up your audience I don't think they would
[1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:41.340]  be open to them and I think if you do this peacefully and you get these people
[1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:46.780]  who are sort of halfway listening to you that are you know in control of these
[1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:51.580]  state's legislatures and the government to then be in power and and conduct these
[1:02:51.580 --> 1:02:57.020]  trials that you're not going to get all of these people okay well listen you
[1:02:57.020 --> 1:02:59.980]  know you've got a loser attitude and that's your opinion thanks for the call
[1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:06.980]  Brandon in Indiana you're on the air Brandon hey Alex are you good sir I
[1:03:06.980 --> 1:03:14.060]  was trying to figure out where all this bad derivative money is going who who's
[1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:18.940]  gaining from the bad derivative the big private central bank shareholders have
[1:03:18.940 --> 1:03:23.820]  fenced the false derivative Ponzi money into real assets now they're just
[1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:27.300]  blowing out the debt end of the derivative and passing it on to the
[1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:35.300]  people brilliant scheme too bad it's not going to work for much longer well
[1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:38.460]  that's why they they want to implode the economy as they've been in third world
[1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:43.060]  nations over and over again to then cause riots so people see troops on the
[1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:48.020]  streets as the savior to then set the precedent it's a process it looks like
[1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:53.220]  the stimulus bill they're trying to rewrite you know the contract of being
[1:03:53.220 --> 1:03:58.540]  a citizen they're wanting us to sign the paperwork accept the money in and and
[1:03:58.540 --> 1:04:02.460]  usher us into their new deal but it's not going to work for me their new
[1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:08.220]  global new deal with a new global bank of the world that controls every facet

[1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:31.380]  population that watches all these simulated murders and plays all these
[1:08:31.380 --> 1:08:35.300]  violent video games all the studies show it increases it as the tens of millions
[1:08:35.300 --> 1:08:40.140]  of prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitor heads gobble the psychotrobics you're

[1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:48.180]  already exploding Mexico is collapsing they have total gun bans down there for
[1:08:48.180 --> 1:08:51.900]  the citizens but it's just machine gun death every day hand grenades rocket

[1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:05.980]  Brandon and Indiana we just talked to Brandon Tony in Illinois you're on the
[1:09:05.980 --> 1:09:12.980]  air go ahead hey how you doing today Alex good sir hey uh as uh you know it
[1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:18.180]  the Alabama stuff it's funny is that you have that popping off right after the
[1:09:18.180 --> 1:09:24.660]  you know suicide suicide bombings and Baghdad and the stuff and it's like all
[1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:29.740]  these things are happening to sell the other policies and then you have a drill
[1:09:29.740 --> 1:09:35.660]  going on of terrorists trying to attack a base and then suddenly six people at
[1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:40.420]  the base get shot to get killed and the supposed IRA walks up in front of the
[1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:43.780]  guards who have weapons that don't fire back and shoots them then you have an
[1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:48.580]  execution style killing in northern Ireland of a police officer the next
[1:09:48.580 --> 1:09:53.060]  day you have the stage shooting of cricket team and then even mainstream
[1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:56.420]  news says it may be an inside job because right in front of police the
[1:09:56.420 --> 1:10:00.220]  shooters just walk slowly the police stand down don't even aim their guns at
[1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:03.980]  them when they're 20 feet away walking by police trucks and vans full of police
[1:10:03.980 --> 1:10:09.380]  I mean it is just incredible yeah it's like somebody flips a switch and all of
[1:10:09.380 --> 1:10:14.660]  this starts oh yeah and and and you know I've been I actually I had to leave
[1:10:14.660 --> 1:10:19.420]  Chicago for about a month I come down I'm in southeast Missouri there's South

[1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:40.180]  confidence game with Obama on the cover and then you open it up and it says on
[1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:47.100]  the inside Barack Obama confidence man I like to choke on yeah they know the
[1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:54.180]  public is so ignorant that that open insult to everyone oh just just you know

[1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:08.060]  into the delusion and then everything's gonna be alright absolutely I mean the
[1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:13.260]  whole article is just it's not about you know Obama's gonna fix anything because
[1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:17.300]  of course the Lord is not the Lord Obama's not there to fix anything he's
[1:11:17.300 --> 1:11:23.540]  just there to be our Lord of course and you know he's not is that but you know
[1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:29.220]  he'll make it feel better as the country collapses around us you know we'll have

[1:11:49.140 --> 1:11:53.260]  like well you know you ain't gonna take our guns and I'm like he's got like
[1:11:53.260 --> 1:11:58.460]  ten or eleven bills on the floor right now what well I hear your brother they
[1:11:58.460 --> 1:12:01.620]  are under a spell but a lot of people are breaking the spell thanks for the
[1:12:01.620 --> 1:12:12.940]  call did you hear from you Tony look look I'm at info wars dot com prison
[1:12:12.940 --> 1:12:20.100]  planet calm and I'm reading on the site what people are posting some of them in
[1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:23.660]  the comments under the new trailer in the sneak peek that are up there and it's
[1:12:23.660 --> 1:12:30.860]  like oh you evil racist oh you just hate Obama you right wing fascist or your
[1:12:30.860 --> 1:12:37.220]  film is all lies all propaganda and they haven't even seen the film yet and then
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:41.500]  I see on other news articles and message board people saying all right all
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:44.980]  politicians lie he did lie about ending napkin get he did lie about taking the
[1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:48.780]  troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and he did lie about non-hiring lobbyist and
[1:12:48.780 --> 1:12:52.700]  he did lie about ending the warrantless wiretapping and he did but you know
[1:12:52.700 --> 1:12:56.580]  that's just what politicians do well then I guess politicians just let
[1:12:56.580 --> 1:13:00.420]  Bernie Madoff steal your blind and take your pension funds I guess politicians
[1:13:00.420 --> 1:13:04.420]  you know just put troops on the streets I guess you just acquiesce and
[1:13:04.420 --> 1:13:11.540]  capitulate and surrender and roll over yellow belly up and then ask the New
[1:13:11.540 --> 1:13:19.780]  World Order to rub your little yellow belly like your little doggy I mean the
[1:13:19.780 --> 1:13:26.540]  New World Order is not gonna rub your yellow belly and look it was 5% of the
[1:13:26.540 --> 1:13:30.740]  people that started in one the Revolutionary War here and it's we have
[1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:38.180]  more than 5% we have a lot more than that in every major poll you know 90 plus
[1:13:38.180 --> 1:13:46.260]  percent want to control the border 87% when in the wars upwards 87% don't want
[1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:51.500]  any more gun control and want to repeal gun control laws Congress still has a
[1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:57.260]  9% approval rating and Obama's approval rating that was up at 87% is dropping
[1:13:57.260 --> 1:14:06.620]  upwards of 20 points so the public isn't as ignorant as some people put on you
[1:14:06.620 --> 1:14:09.300]  know when you talk to family they kind of want to act cool and act like they're
[1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:12.420]  not gonna be bossed around by you or you're you know you're showing off to
[1:14:12.420 --> 1:14:18.460]  them but you notice at the stores the guns are bare the ammo's bare they're
[1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:21.740]  trying to make as many guns and produce as much ammo as they can and they can't
[1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:25.740]  keep up so somebody out there is listening somebody knows we're in
[1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:31.340]  trouble somebody knows they're coming after the Second Amendment it was 44%
[1:14:31.340 --> 1:14:36.060]  over the previous record of gun sales it's over 120% last numbers I saw from
[1:14:36.060 --> 1:14:45.620]  the FBI 120% above any previous record in gun sales and it's only growing and
[1:14:45.620 --> 1:14:48.940]  they're not gonna be able to get our guns ladies and gentlemen and because
[1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:52.180]  there are a bunch of prozac heads running around a bunch of lunatics and a
[1:14:52.180 --> 1:14:57.900]  bunch of psychos with guns more all the more reason we need our firearms just
[1:14:57.900 --> 1:15:02.700]  like the police if they got criminal shooting at them they need guns and more
[1:15:02.700 --> 1:15:11.220]  guns the answer is more guns we are a violent degenerate society overrun by
[1:15:11.220 --> 1:15:16.500]  criminals if you take the guns away only the lawabiding will be disarmed it's a
[1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:21.580]  very simple equation Chicago's got four times the national average of crime and
[1:15:21.580 --> 1:15:29.060]  shootings almost a complete gunman New York complete gunman they hand out a
[1:15:29.060 --> 1:15:32.220]  few hundred permits a year if you give like a $30,000 political contribution
[1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:39.020]  big scandals there and for you to get a permit turns a right into a privilege the
[1:15:39.020 --> 1:15:42.060]  police and military are finding out now there's plans to actually disarm most of
[1:15:42.060 --> 1:15:46.820]  them and only have paramilitary larger SWAT team forces merged with the
[1:15:46.820 --> 1:15:50.620]  military and that's in the mainstream news today they're coming after
[1:15:50.620 --> 1:15:55.540]  everybody's guns except for Praetorian Guard highly armed paramilitary police
[1:15:55.540 --> 1:16:03.220]  that'll be bivouacked in every city and I tell those paramilitary police you're
[1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:06.100]  working for the New World Order and you know you're violating positive
[1:16:06.100 --> 1:16:08.260]  commentators and you know you're conditioning the public for our for
[1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:15.820]  acclimation so the people can be occupied an occupied nation by military
[1:16:15.820 --> 1:16:22.180]  force so we're here ladies and gentlemen defending the republic getting the
[1:16:22.180 --> 1:16:26.580]  word out defending the Bill of Rights the Constitution Anthony and Georgia you're
[1:16:26.580 --> 1:16:34.180]  on the air go ahead Alex how you doing good first of all take things for
[1:16:34.180 --> 1:16:37.620]  bringing up these subjects because they are vital important to our youth in our
[1:16:37.620 --> 1:16:40.540]  country because I know a lot of people are struggling you know they're on these
[1:16:40.540 --> 1:16:44.820]  Prozac hills and there's one of we have taken inhibitors and so they battle with
[1:16:44.820 --> 1:16:48.340]  these kind of issues every day and nobody really talks about it so that's one
[1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:53.140]  major point I want to bring up about the shootings I mean it's tragic I was
[1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:57.780]  wondering I heard you a couple of weeks ago talking about Columbine you said
[1:16:57.780 --> 1:17:00.700]  that there was federal involvement in that and you said as far as they might
[1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:04.500]  have been inside the schools and you know that was way before I woke up that's
[1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:08.980]  right I'm not I'm not tooting my horn but if you go back two three weeks ago on
[1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:13.500]  show after show I said I feel it in my gut they're gonna start mass shootings at
[1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:17.860]  schools all over the country I know they're MO you know when you say gut
[1:17:17.860 --> 1:17:21.700]  that's hundreds of pieces of data you can really thousands over the years and
[1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:28.180]  then you can make the prime projection and time will tell you know I said hey
[1:17:28.180 --> 1:17:31.780]  it looks like this Ireland situation if the we find out there was a drill of
[1:17:31.780 --> 1:17:35.380]  terrorists attacking the base at the same time if we find out that the
[1:17:35.380 --> 1:17:39.900]  military stood down it's an inside job because over 75% of the time it's come
[1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:43.300]  out mainstream British and Irish news that British intelligence actually
[1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:48.780]  founded and ran the violent IRA groups then boom it came out just as you know
[1:17:48.780 --> 1:17:52.580]  the fingerprint was there the fingerprint we lifted the prince we
[1:17:52.580 --> 1:17:55.900]  said it okay this is who normally does this let's see if we see their signature
[1:17:55.900 --> 1:18:01.860]  their prints their wavelength boom it's there and it's the same thing over and
[1:18:01.860 --> 1:18:06.700]  over again it's too soon to tell the Germany thing looks like a staged event
[1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:14.100]  the Alabama situation there are real punks who throw fits and are unstable
[1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:18.500]  and kill you know one member of the family they go on a rampage that's the
[1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:22.180]  MO that that you know that can happen on its own it does happen on its own
[1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:26.900]  because people don't have impulse control they don't know how to just they
[1:18:26.900 --> 1:18:29.460]  don't know how when their wife gets in their face or slaps them just go get
[1:18:29.460 --> 1:18:35.100]  in their car and leave they don't know how to I mean they don't but because
[1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:38.140]  there's these unstable people that's why we need our second amendment to defend
[1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:42.420]  ourselves right I mean I'm specifically on column bottom because I remember you
[1:18:42.420 --> 1:18:46.540]  mentioned that and you said something about beds or our agents being inside
[1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:49.740]  the school maybe even involved in the shooting and all the pipe bombs weren't
[1:18:49.740 --> 1:18:55.140]  manufactured by the two students there are 100 go ahead yeah I was wondering if
[1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.860]  you would go back into that for people that really don't have all the details
[1:18:58.860 --> 1:19:02.420]  because that was forced never in any kind of mainstream media and also do you
[1:19:02.420 --> 1:19:06.700]  think these shootings today or maybe back then or any of these mass shootings
[1:19:06.700 --> 1:19:11.100]  could be reloaded to the government program MK ultra maybe that ties into a
[1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:15.700]  one in your opinion on that all right I appreciate your call I was sitting at
[1:19:15.700 --> 1:19:18.540]  Charlie Sheen's house about two and a half years ago and I'm saying you know
[1:19:18.540 --> 1:19:21.220]  Columbine stage and he's like well I heard that but what's the evidence and I
[1:19:21.220 --> 1:19:24.740]  sat down this computer in his kitchen and I back then I can remember the exact
[1:19:24.740 --> 1:19:28.980]  number I think it was 128 pipe bombs and I googled it there was CBS News he was
[1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:34.540]  like whoa 120 plus I remember the exact number now I think 128 pipe bombs were
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:37.900]  smuggled in the night before in the day before the school was more than half
[1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:45.260]  empty the police chief and this and the principal were at a subway sandwich
[1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:49.740]  wouldn't all happen most of the teachers were gone Harris and Clybold's parents
[1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:52.580]  were both in black ops and under psychiatric care and on Prozac and
[1:19:52.580 --> 1:19:56.740]  Ritalin and the police stood down once it happened and the students reported
[1:19:56.740 --> 1:20:03.820]  other shooters inside the list goes on and on sir the new world order beast is

[1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:15.580]  Alabama we're able to get them on it's gonna be very informative
[1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:22.060]  Gerald Salente and others are coming up just to finish up on Columbine how did
[1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:27.100]  they get 120 plus some of them weighing over a hundred pounds giant propane
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:34.540]  tanks into the school why were most of the teachers gone why did all of this
[1:24:34.540 --> 1:24:38.980]  happen and then it just goes on and on and then the Rocky Mountain News never
[1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:41.860]  posed reported the SWAT team actually shot three of the students I have those
[1:24:41.860 --> 1:24:47.300]  mainstream news articles it goes on and on they reported four shooters inside
[1:24:47.300 --> 1:24:50.540]  they wouldn't release most of the surveillance camera footage only released
[1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:54.220]  a few seconds the school was all wired up the school was the first school to have
[1:24:54.220 --> 1:25:00.740]  death education you can't make this up 2020 news reported on it ABC in 1991
[1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:10.060]  years before the 99 shooting on Adolf Hitler's birthday April 20th and oh it's
[1:25:10.060 --> 1:25:14.340]  just it's just mind-blowing that they would have the children get in coffins
[1:25:14.340 --> 1:25:19.140]  and simulate dying and even one child got suffocated at the school and did die
[1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:23.060]  and see when they do death education suicide education that causes more
[1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:26.980]  suicide as they teach him how to commit suicide and say don't do this and all
[1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:30.380]  the statistics show that I mean that was a mind-control school and the evidence
[1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:34.100]  just goes on and on from there but yeah they got a hundred and twenty eight I
[1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:38.260]  believe going from memory that time to Google it during the break bombs into
[1:25:38.260 --> 1:25:43.300]  the building they supposedly did this and then things didn't go as planned
[1:25:43.300 --> 1:25:48.260]  though and thank God it was only 15 people 16 people that died but they sure
[1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:51.900]  hyped that in the media didn't they for total gun control but they failed let's
[1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:54.980]  go and then they'll fail as well because the word is out now about what's
[1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:58.820]  really going on here whether this was deliberate mind-control or not or
[1:25:58.820 --> 1:26:02.420]  whether they were prozac head or heads or not people know they need guns to
[1:26:02.420 --> 1:26:06.060]  defend themselves from each other lunatics Andy in Montana you're on the
[1:26:06.060 --> 1:26:10.700]  year how you doing Alex I just wanted to know if you'd heard about the
[1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:16.100]  explosions in Bozeman Montana and Whitehall Montana were two American
[1:26:16.100 --> 1:26:22.460]  legions were blown up when did this happen this happened last week and it's
[1:26:22.460 --> 1:26:25.740]  barely been in our news and it hasn't made news at all I know there have been
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:29.300]  bombings of different corporate offices and banks and police have been killed
[1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:33.340]  and was it in Washington state I know there's all sorts of weird bombings
[1:26:33.340 --> 1:26:39.420]  going on that no one is covering and generally generally that means it's a
[1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:45.180]  real terrorist attack see the MO is during the 70s and 60s and 70s there
[1:26:45.180 --> 1:26:48.060]  were hundreds and hundreds of bombings that killed scores of people and wounded
[1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:53.380]  scores more and because it was real terrorism you don't give real terrorism
[1:26:53.380 --> 1:26:57.660]  if you're the government attention you only give your staged events attention
[1:26:57.660 --> 1:27:03.780]  and so no I was not aware of the veterans they also brought in the
[1:27:03.780 --> 1:27:08.780]  National Guard right away within a couple hours of that and yeah that's their
[1:27:08.780 --> 1:27:13.460]  way they first got their nose under the tent flap was to have the EOD
[1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:17.580]  ordinance disposal and then behind that comes the general policing of the
[1:27:17.580 --> 1:27:22.820]  military but no I will Google that again where were the bombings Whitehall
[1:27:22.820 --> 1:27:28.420]  Montana and Bozeman Montana main business is downtown and guys Google for
[1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:33.020]  me bombings in Montana police and print that see we don't we're not omnipresent
[1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:35.740]  people always ask why aren't you reporting on this because we didn't know
[1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:40.420]  thank you for telling us we will pull that up right now anything else sir that's
[1:27:40.420 --> 1:27:44.060]  about it I just want to also mention that there's major chemtrail spraying

[1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:29.220]  school and I haven't heard the army interviewed on this we saw it in Reuters
[1:33:29.220 --> 1:33:32.620]  and a few other newspapers that they were there after the shooting providing
[1:33:32.620 --> 1:33:39.540]  security and so we thought why not get the regular us army on from Fort Rucker
[1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:43.780]  and we have lieutenant colonel Scott while on with us a colonel I know you're
[1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:47.940]  very busy and I appreciate you giving us the time yes sir yes sir thank you very
[1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:53.860]  much for calling us please I mean from your perspective what happened and what
[1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:58.620]  did the army do well it the incident was very tragic it was you know it the
[1:33:58.620 --> 1:34:03.300]  incident took place and all of the local law enforcement from the state of
[1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:08.260]  Alabama responded it it happened in several different cities it was a you
[1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:14.100]  know very ugly situation and it was going to be a long drawn-out situation so
[1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:17.860]  here in southern Alabama we have mutual aid agreements with all of our
[1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:21.580]  local surrounding communities where they support us when we need help we support
[1:34:21.580 --> 1:34:26.020]  them we've had several natural disasters in the past such as a hurricane and a
[1:34:26.020 --> 1:34:31.380]  tornado and we we support each other where time in times of need so when
[1:34:31.380 --> 1:34:36.340]  this happened we we called down to you know one of the the local police
[1:34:36.340 --> 1:34:40.580]  departments and offered our assistance and when they they said absolutely you
[1:34:40.580 --> 1:34:44.180]  know we could use some military police so we went down and all we did was provide
[1:34:44.180 --> 1:34:50.740]  a support role where we went we took 20 MPs down there we the local law
[1:34:50.740 --> 1:34:55.180]  enforcement and the state law enforcement were establishing a cordone and
[1:34:55.180 --> 1:34:59.980]  taking care of the area so what we just provided support went in and allowed
[1:34:59.980 --> 1:35:04.020]  those the the state and local law enforcement folks to go and take a knee
[1:35:04.020 --> 1:35:08.420]  and drink water go and get some food just rest for a little while we took
[1:35:08.420 --> 1:35:12.420]  their post form and then when they came back we moved on to other places to see
[1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:18.700]  where we could assist so did so the army contacted the police departments was
[1:35:18.700 --> 1:35:25.540]  this while the hour-long rampage was going on over 20 plus miles or or did
[1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:28.980]  you contact them after they'd already after he'd already killed himself yes
[1:35:28.980 --> 1:35:34.260]  or it was after after the event I even when we realized that this was going to
[1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:38.580]  be a major undertaking then what I did was I called and offered my assistance
[1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:44.340]  and the the police chief took me up on it and we called in the soldiers and
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:49.660]  drove down there perhaps you can shed some more likes we're getting conflicting
[1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:53.540]  stories one sheriff's deputy's reporting he had a fully automatic AK-47 or was it
[1:35:53.540 --> 1:35:56.980]  semi-automatic or do you know no sir I don't have any idea I didn't get
[1:35:56.980 --> 1:36:02.420]  involved in any part of the investigation or the active you know part of the law
[1:36:02.420 --> 1:36:06.700]  enforcement piece all we provided was just you know some security at some post
[1:36:06.700 --> 1:36:12.340]  and you know we provided relief forces for the guys that were working it well
[1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:15.260]  being there in Alabama you probably have a clear picture of this and then
[1:36:15.260 --> 1:36:19.820]  having your people on the ground and then we do I mean I mean just boiling it
[1:36:19.820 --> 1:36:25.580]  down what happened yeah that sir I'll tell you you're you're what you're
[1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:28.940]  hearing in the news is the same thing that we heard I didn't I didn't get
[1:36:28.940 --> 1:36:32.860]  involved in any part of the investigation you know that the true heroes
[1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:38.380]  were the local and state law enforcement from Alabama and all we did was just go
[1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:44.940]  down there and and and in the exterior part of the core dome we just you know
[1:36:44.940 --> 1:36:49.260]  relieve the guys that were blocking traffic and and you know protecting the
[1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:58.420]  area now when you talk about mutual agreements with the county previously
[1:36:58.420 --> 1:37:02.580]  you know we hear about hurricanes or earthquakes or things like that and you
[1:37:02.580 --> 1:37:07.900]  know certainly with the National Garden things but under Posse common taught us
[1:37:07.900 --> 1:37:12.180]  I mean that's still in forces in it to have the military out involved in law
[1:37:12.180 --> 1:37:15.860]  enforcement yes sir and we don't and we don't provide any kind of law
[1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:19.860]  enforcement role off of the installation we didn't go down there in a law
[1:37:19.860 --> 1:37:25.140]  enforcement role what we did was we went down and just we took our military
[1:37:25.140 --> 1:37:30.140]  police because we're readily available I just went down and in a support role we
[1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:34.740]  just took up post for folks to to rotate them so that we could you know they
[1:37:34.740 --> 1:37:38.420]  could get out get a place to go sit down get something to eat and then get back
[1:37:38.420 --> 1:37:42.260]  and take their post no I understand we didn't provide any kind of law
[1:37:42.260 --> 1:37:48.300]  enforcement activity at all okay I mean the reason people ask that is we've all
[1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:53.060]  heard about North com and the new 20,000 trips for brigade homeland I'm sure
[1:37:53.060 --> 1:37:57.700]  you've heard about that yes sir and how the Army War College says they are
[1:37:57.700 --> 1:38:03.140]  preparing for civil unrest and so we see more and more reports about the Marines
[1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:07.620]  in California DWI checkpoints and the Army assisting in drug
[1:38:07.620 --> 1:38:10.460]  introduction and things like that inside the United States so that's that's what
[1:38:10.460 --> 1:38:14.180]  we were bringing that up because we see this see this happening more and more
[1:38:14.180 --> 1:38:18.180]  I mean I mean previously if there was a shooting going on in Alabama would the
[1:38:18.180 --> 1:38:23.580]  regular army respond to that well sir I mean we wouldn't respond to it we would
[1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:27.700]  not we would never respond off the installation any law enforcement role what
[1:38:27.700 --> 1:38:32.780]  we get what we will provide though is in support functions I understand we will
[1:38:32.780 --> 1:38:37.100]  provide assistance you know to our partner community sure so military
[1:38:37.100 --> 1:38:40.780]  police though setting up checkpoints stopping traffic going through that is
[1:38:40.780 --> 1:38:44.500]  not a law enforcement role yes sir that is a law enforcement role and that we
[1:38:44.500 --> 1:38:48.900]  would not do here at Fort Rucker I can't speak for what North com or the Army
[1:38:48.900 --> 1:38:53.140]  War College is trying to put together but here at Fort Rucker we would not do
[1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:56.900]  that no no but I mean I'm looking at photographs of police blocking the
[1:38:56.900 --> 1:39:02.620]  military police Army military police blocking the road yes sir we were all
[1:39:02.620 --> 1:39:07.260]  we were doing was is what was enforcing the cordone and just directing traffic
[1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:10.780]  around it we weren't we weren't stopping anybody we weren't engaging anybody we
[1:39:10.780 --> 1:39:15.740]  were just directing traffic okay and what does a Fort Rucker is is a mainly
[1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:21.940]  Army aircraft support isn't it yes sir if it's the home of the Army Aviation
[1:39:21.940 --> 1:39:24.980]  Center well we know the folks in Alabama are great people we know the
[1:39:24.980 --> 1:39:28.180]  military are great people it's just there's been big national debates about
[1:39:28.180 --> 1:39:31.620]  the larger and larger presence of military and it was just interesting to
[1:39:31.620 --> 1:39:36.020]  see this in the report we're glad that that you know more people weren't killed
[1:39:36.020 --> 1:39:41.340]  but sadly 10 people is is quite a lot and how's the community taking this right
[1:39:41.340 --> 1:39:46.700]  now yeah sure as you know that like everything else the community is you
[1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:51.700]  know they're they're supporting each other they're you know taking care of
[1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:55.860]  the families of the of the the affected people and you know that everybody's
[1:39:55.860 --> 1:40:01.060]  pulling together to provide whatever it is that's needed well in closing we're
[1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:05.060]  talking to Colonel Scott Wilde anything else you think it's important to add
[1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:09.460]  here sir or that you can tell us yeah no sir I just like to you know one more
[1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:13.460]  time reinforce that the true heroes in this situation where all of the state
[1:40:13.460 --> 1:40:18.300]  and local and federal law enforcement folks that you know are in the southern
[1:40:18.300 --> 1:40:22.460]  part of Alabama and we were just happy to be able to provide them some assistance
[1:40:22.460 --> 1:40:25.460]  now specifically they cornered him and then had a shootout and he killed
[1:40:25.460 --> 1:40:29.500]  himself or did they shoot him yeah sir I don't have any of the facts of the case
[1:40:29.500 --> 1:40:33.660]  all you like I said I was purely in a support role where we just went down and
[1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:38.900]  and did what we could to help out oh so you were there yourself yes sir Wow
[1:40:38.900 --> 1:40:42.900]  were you on duty then or did you have to throw your uniform on quick and sir
[1:40:42.900 --> 1:40:46.700]  yeah I just had to respond with it I you know as the provost Marshall it's you
[1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:50.660]  know these are all my guys and this was a place that we needed to be and well in
[1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:54.900]  order to make sure that we provided the exact system you know assistance that was
[1:40:54.900 --> 1:41:00.380]  it within our limits you know well we went down and and and took care of
[1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:05.420]  business well we appreciate you sir Colonel all I know is I made a film and
[1:41:05.420 --> 1:41:08.220]  in it we have the photographs and news articles you know during Bayfest in
[1:41:08.220 --> 1:41:12.100]  Alabama where the Alabama Defense Force was out you know searching little kids
[1:41:12.100 --> 1:41:15.980]  bags to go into the city and you know that's the type of stuff that we don't
[1:41:15.980 --> 1:41:19.220]  like under the Constitution and there's a lot of calls restrict the Second
[1:41:19.220 --> 1:41:24.660]  Amendment right now because of this shooting and and I just I just hope
[1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:27.820]  that the military will protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies
[1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:32.140]  foreign and domestic yeah sir I'll tell you that was you just said a great deal
[1:41:32.140 --> 1:41:36.580]  of stuff and I you know I don't have a comment on that I didn't I have nothing
[1:41:36.580 --> 1:41:41.620]  to to say about that I can just talk about the specific incident that you
[1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:45.660]  know we dealt with last night and the support that we provided to the local
[1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:49.540]  enforcement here in southern Alabama yeah but you personally believe in the
[1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:53.820]  Second Amendment don't you sir you know my personal opinions have no bearing here
[1:41:53.820 --> 1:41:57.340]  whatsoever a sir I appreciate you contacting me and giving me an
[1:41:57.340 --> 1:42:02.020]  opportunity to to chat with you for a while but I got a run okay Colonel Scott
[1:42:02.020 --> 1:42:06.740]  while thanks for joining us from Fort Rucker there in Alabama take care okay
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:11.860]  sir there he goes ladies and gentlemen and you see what they're doing is with
[1:42:11.860 --> 1:42:16.900]  all of this and this is new is what the army says we're gonna be out at car
[1:42:16.900 --> 1:42:21.500]  wrecks to help with jaws of life we're gonna be out at DWI checkpoints we're
[1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:24.300]  gonna be out at mass shootings we're gonna be out at drug
[1:42:24.300 --> 1:42:26.980]  introduction we're gonna be out at this we're gonna be out at that and it's the
[1:42:26.980 --> 1:42:30.740]  police and military say well what's wrong with us helping cordon things what's
[1:42:30.740 --> 1:42:34.020]  wrong with us stopping drunk drivers what's wrong with us with the jaws of
[1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:39.160]  life getting somebody stuck in a truck that's flipped over and it sets the
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:50.460]  precedent you know we called them up we immediately spoke with them and just
[1:42:50.460 --> 1:42:52.740]  said we'd like to have you on they immediately began saying we're not
[1:42:52.740 --> 1:42:55.260]  involved in law enforcement we're not involved in law enforcement we're not
[1:42:55.260 --> 1:42:58.740]  involved in law enforcement we're not involved in law enforcement but then the
[1:42:58.740 --> 1:43:02.660]  brass themselves are saying they are getting him involved in law enforcement
[1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:05.900]  overall and you heard him he's aware of Northcom but just in case it was any
[1:43:05.900 --> 1:43:09.580]  denials because I'd gotten some emails and those aren't real photos there aren't
[1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:17.660]  troops there that's not happening that's not going on well we had Colonel Scott
[1:43:17.660 --> 1:43:22.100]  Weil on from Fort Rucker he's the spokesman there at the base and well
[1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:25.060]  he's the head of public safety he's the director of public safety and the
[1:43:25.060 --> 1:43:32.740]  spokesman for public safety dual had it as they say and we just covered the real
[1:43:32.740 --> 1:43:36.700]  issues there for you to document what's happening and how it's all sold is
[1:43:36.700 --> 1:43:45.420]  reasonable it's all sold to help you it's all for your best interest everything's
[1:43:45.420 --> 1:43:52.380]  fine except the military on the streets of the United States and everything is
[1:43:52.380 --> 1:43:55.420]  going to be all right I mean come on you're for stopping drunk drivers aren't
[1:43:55.420 --> 1:44:01.380]  you the first it's earthquakes and forest fires with a regular army then it's
[1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:12.100]  all fighting crime now these are the type of real issues that happen then you
[1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:24.700]  have Mexico with a complete gunman for the citizens but they have a crime rate
[1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:32.620]  just many many many many many times what it is the United States where we have a
[1:44:32.620 --> 1:44:35.980]  second amendment and you know the terror watch list has gone up well over a
[1:44:35.980 --> 1:44:38.780]  million people I'm looking at this photograph Kurt Nemo has posted on
[1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:42.060]  infowars.com for the story and it's National Guard troops with their black
[1:44:42.060 --> 1:44:45.860]  berets and regular army troops now they've been federalized standing there
[1:44:45.860 --> 1:44:48.860]  at the checkpoint as you go to the airport it's all about training first
[1:44:48.860 --> 1:44:52.660]  at the Super Bowl in the Kentucky Derby and the airports in New York and then
[1:44:52.660 --> 1:44:57.580]  Boston and then Chicago and then the now disgraced governor four months ago comes
[1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:00.580]  out the Chicago Tribune gives a press conference we played the audio of the
[1:45:00.580 --> 1:45:04.580]  video here and says yeah we're gonna use the National Guard to do gun sweeps all
[1:45:04.580 --> 1:45:13.420]  over Illinois and what did the National Guard do the first time they had a
[1:45:13.420 --> 1:45:17.420]  chance to go into New Orleans they were blocked from giving aid the troops wanted
[1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:22.900]  to and they were told to go into the high and dry areas where people were had
[1:45:22.900 --> 1:45:32.540]  their own food their own generators they were told to go in there and confiscate
[1:45:32.540 --> 1:45:36.620]  their firearms all the guns will be taken that's what the police chief said
[1:45:36.620 --> 1:45:40.300]  everyone will be disarmed no one will be allowed to have weapons even in their
[1:45:40.300 --> 1:45:46.700]  own homes so this is the reality of what's happening and they could try to
[1:45:46.700 --> 1:45:55.180]  paper over it they can try to dress it up all day long we know how to read the
[1:45:55.180 --> 1:45:58.820]  executive orders we know how to read what the Pentagon Directives say we know
[1:45:58.820 --> 1:46:05.300]  how to read what the Army War College is saying we know how to study history and
[1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:10.420]  understand what's happening and it's all completely public and crystal clear you
[1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:14.620]  know I had Ron Paul on yesterday congressman Ron Paul Dr. Ron Paul people
[1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:19.820]  tried to spin him on Glenn Beck and I did say on there I wasn't particularly
[1:46:19.820 --> 1:46:23.260]  pleased with his performance when he brought up the FEMA camps and Ron Paul
[1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:25.820]  said well there's a bill introduced I don't know how big a threat it is but
[1:46:25.820 --> 1:46:30.060]  because Washington's so corrupted out of control it is a threat so he did say it
[1:46:30.060 --> 1:46:33.060]  was a threat but here on air he did agree with the executive orders and then
[1:46:33.060 --> 1:46:39.580]  FEMA camp knows and did say it was a threat and that's on record and Ron Paul
[1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:54.180]  did say that state grand juries need to start
[1:46:56.620 --> 1:47:00.980]  indictments against these different bankers because they didn't just change
[1:47:00.980 --> 1:47:07.180]  federal laws they could do all these derivative Ponzi schemes they didn't
[1:47:07.180 --> 1:47:11.900]  just change the laws they even violated their own loopholes you could drive a
[1:47:11.900 --> 1:47:17.860]  Mack truck through and then looking at my screen here I read the mainstream news
[1:47:17.860 --> 1:47:24.820]  article about Washington State and what is Washington State doing what is
[1:47:24.820 --> 1:47:35.180]  Washington State up to Washington State cops start a liaison program with U.S.
[1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:44.900]  Army the regular U.S. Army working and creating relationships with the local
[1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:57.740]  police here in the United States of America and now they want to sell the
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:48:04.580]  kind of half-awake mesmerized public on accepting this but more importantly they
[1:48:04.580 --> 1:48:10.460]  are selling the police and military who were like yeah we work together there's
[1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:17.300]  a mass shooting that regular army comes out and helps us yeah there's drunk
[1:48:17.300 --> 1:48:21.220]  drivers out there we can save lives using the army they've got the resources
[1:48:21.220 --> 1:48:24.740]  we need and the army goes out and does these reasonable things on the surface
[1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:30.900]  and the wicked precedent is set Washington State cops start liaison
[1:48:30.900 --> 1:48:35.860]  program with U.S. Army Fort Lewis and Lakewood police are working together to
[1:48:35.860 --> 1:48:40.060]  build a better understanding of what happens on the other side Lakewood
[1:48:40.060 --> 1:48:45.420]  police are enlisting the help of Fort Lewis for times when city cops need to
[1:48:45.420 --> 1:48:51.540]  cooperate with the army including when soldiers get in trouble off post that's
[1:48:51.540 --> 1:48:56.260]  always their excuse I remember 10 years ago they would have Air Force and Army
[1:48:56.260 --> 1:49:04.300]  and Marine military police on the boardwalk searching citizens working
[1:49:04.300 --> 1:49:07.700]  with the police helping handcuff people we got video of it and they said well
[1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:11.340]  we made a big deal out of it they said oh well they're just looking for drunk
[1:49:11.340 --> 1:49:14.900]  soldiers because there's a lot of bases around here and then they announced last
[1:49:14.900 --> 1:49:19.020]  week in Canada all over their papers oh the army is going to be in the major
[1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:23.220]  city bar districts working with police against citizens and also for rowdy
[1:49:23.220 --> 1:49:26.060]  soldiers and then they announced next week by the way we're preparing a lock
[1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:30.980]  down the cities and have war with the people of Canada now they're just
[1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:37.180]  mixing all the propaganda together so see first the article in the new
[1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:41.860]  tribune tells you oh it's to look for troubled people off post then it adds oh
[1:49:41.860 --> 1:49:46.140]  meanwhile I'm quoting the article another partnership will let the local
[1:49:46.140 --> 1:49:50.900]  army post receive the city's assistance and civilian police training for
[1:49:50.900 --> 1:49:55.340]  soldiers bound for Iraq this fall they say oh it's for Iraq but then you read

[1:55:34.380 --> 1:55:37.660]  exchange knowledge with their neighboring city and then remember Iowa a few
[1:55:37.660 --> 1:55:40.540]  weeks ago oh we're gonna go door-to-door and ask if we can search their home for
[1:55:40.540 --> 1:55:45.420]  guns but it's no big deal in practice looking for gun dealers but the town

[1:55:58.220 --> 1:56:03.300]  it sure they did and the army just magically allowed it to happen they
[1:56:03.300 --> 1:56:06.960]  decided on the liaison program which is already used at army installation such
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:13.540]  as Fort Carson Colorado and everywhere else secretly until now I would add and

[2:00:56.420 --> 2:01:03.220]  alabama south alabama little towns all around this land go ahead yes sir I get
[2:01:03.220 --> 2:01:06.860]  up this morning I look on info wars I see the article about troops on the street
[2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:12.620]  down there right well I called the local TV stations like first I called WA FF
[2:01:12.620 --> 2:01:16.820]  48 and I go are you aware there are troops down in the town where the
[2:01:16.820 --> 2:01:20.460]  shooting took place they're like no we'll check it out well I go down the
[2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:25.900]  next one I called the agent T-19 and they tell me that the reason why the
[2:01:25.900 --> 2:01:29.540]  military was there was because it's a town about that only has two peace
[2:01:29.540 --> 2:01:35.660]  officers and that people were looting now I don't buy that oh it's a
[2:01:35.660 --> 2:01:38.980]  completely peaceful town I've seen video footage everywhere nothing about looting
[2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:42.380]  and we just don't have the army listen they're now saying they don't want people
[2:01:42.380 --> 2:01:47.340]  to have home gardens because you might grow weed I mean we're prisoners if they
[2:01:47.340 --> 2:01:50.500]  would have been looting they wouldn't have had tasers they would have had
[2:01:50.500 --> 2:01:55.940]  firearms they had firearms and by the way they are by the way I should have
[2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:58.700]  asked him was one question I didn't ask when the colonel was on but I can see the
[2:01:58.700 --> 2:02:02.500]  photos they've got 45s on their side and the standard issue sidearm for the
[2:02:02.500 --> 2:02:08.260]  army but but let me just add this you know all over the country they're
[2:02:08.260 --> 2:02:11.580]  putting regular army in the police departments to gather intelligence on
[2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:14.540]  the citizens and they're working with the intelligence units of the police
[2:02:14.540 --> 2:02:17.460]  departments that are also federally funded the feds are taken over the
[2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:22.260]  police departments and they're putting the army in I mean it's happening right
[2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:26.980]  in front of us I'm not denying that I just thought that was important and they
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:30.780]  said that tonight they were going to do a full story and tell everyone everything
[2:02:30.780 --> 2:02:38.420]  so well you know what that is well we just saw photos in Reuters and a photo in
[2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:45.620]  a London Guardian no it was London Telegraph and so we saw it and it said
[2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:50.020]  from Reuters US Army from Fort Rucker US Army soldiers from Fort Rucker patrol
[2:02:50.020 --> 2:02:54.540]  the downtown area of Samson, Alabama after the shooting spree March 10 2009 and
[2:02:54.540 --> 2:02:58.820]  so I guess we then googled it everywhere and found no other video or news
[2:02:58.820 --> 2:03:02.500]  reports so this is really the first place where you actually heard it from
[2:03:02.500 --> 2:03:06.860]  the military here right what did you hear him when I brought up the defending
[2:03:06.860 --> 2:03:10.620]  the second amendment listen to the whole thing wouldn't he have mentioned that if
[2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:14.420]  there were been looting would he not have mentioned that yes he would have
[2:03:14.420 --> 2:03:17.700]  mentioned that it but I'm sure they'll teach us the people are bad you can't
[2:03:17.700 --> 2:03:22.460]  have gardens the army's here I mean I've got mainstream news all not just out of
[2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:26.140]  Oklahoma other parts of the country they're saying we may not allow citizens
[2:03:26.140 --> 2:03:30.380]  to have gardens because they may grow Mary Jane and we may have to inspect your
[2:03:30.380 --> 2:03:35.380]  gardens I mean this is prison a lot of prisons even let a prisoner grow a
[2:03:35.380 --> 2:03:41.820]  tomato plant that they want to make us prisoners an occupied country
[2:03:41.820 --> 2:03:47.380]  oh anything else sir well no sir I just I thought they needed to be out there

[2:03:54.660 --> 2:04:00.540]  them or something I don't know but I'm I don't I don't like them saying they

[2:04:33.060 --> 2:04:36.060]  I brought up to the Colonel oh I noticed the Alabama Defense Force searches

[2:09:15.460 --> 2:09:20.420]  they're just running an intelligence operation an acclimation operation to
[2:09:20.420 --> 2:09:23.260]  prepare the police the military the citizens for total occupation that's
[2:09:23.260 --> 2:09:27.900]  now admitted but when you see local news spinning it you see the propaganda and
[2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:32.700]  the 26,000 preachers you know telling their flocks to go to the FEMA cams to
[2:09:32.700 --> 2:09:36.220]  take the shots and turn in their guns and the 50,000 infra guard executives of
[2:09:36.220 --> 2:09:40.380]  in private industry with shoot to kill orders and weapons under FBI control and
[2:09:40.380 --> 2:09:44.940]  you just find out about it all it's just unbelievable and then in Alabama they
[2:09:44.940 --> 2:09:50.500]  have the army regular army running around with sidearms and Simon calls up
[2:09:50.500 --> 2:09:53.340]  the local news and says why is the army there why didn't you report on they go
[2:09:53.340 --> 2:09:58.100]  because there was looting well that'd be big national news you got hundreds of news teams
[2:09:58.100 --> 2:10:01.220]  there with an hours of it happening no news anywhere we've googled it of looting
[2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:06.580]  just more we can't let citizens have gardens now in Tulsa because they might
[2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:12.780]  grow weed it's all just something might happen the army's gonna be here you know
[2:10:12.780 --> 2:10:17.020]  after the fact it's just how about the citizens beyond that's the only you know
[2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:21.380]  you can't wait an hour or two for the military to show up
[2:10:21.380 --> 2:10:26.620]  you know Mexico and communist Russia they have troops on the streets and
[2:10:26.620 --> 2:10:30.260]  Venezuela they do and in Cuba they do you didn't want a free country's got and
[2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:33.460]  again the bankers are imploding things by design right now they're gonna use the
[2:10:33.460 --> 2:10:37.460]  military against us Simon in Alabama recap the exact news station you called
[2:10:37.460 --> 2:10:43.780]  that told you it was looting okay I called W agency 19 and I said are you
[2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:48.380]  aware that there are troops down in Cincinnati Alabama and they said well
[2:10:48.380 --> 2:10:53.220]  they're all they only have two peace officers and what was going on they
[2:10:53.220 --> 2:10:58.380]  were busy so the military came in to help right and the lady said on the phone
[2:10:58.380 --> 2:11:03.300]  that there was looting going on in that town now I said I'm not down there I
[2:11:03.300 --> 2:11:08.620]  don't know but that doesn't sound you know it doesn't sound right it defies
[2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:13.220]  the census well yeah somebody tries to loot in Alabama they get their butt
[2:11:13.220 --> 2:11:18.340]  blown off and people as you said come together during those type of
[2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:21.940]  crises and the Colonel would have said something about that when he was on but
[2:11:21.940 --> 2:11:25.300]  you know we have the photos and main cream news articles because the Alabama
[2:11:25.300 --> 2:11:28.820]  Defense Force posted themselves of them searching three-year-old children at
[2:11:28.820 --> 2:11:32.460]  football games and to get into the city on major streets little kids being
[2:11:32.460 --> 2:11:38.380]  searched that's in my film martial law rise of the police state put out in 2005
[2:11:38.380 --> 2:11:46.580]  and you heard when I brought that up boy he climbed up fast we know we know
[2:11:46.580 --> 2:11:51.860]  what's really going on well God bless you can keep up the hard work man thank
[2:11:51.860 --> 2:11:56.140]  you yeah you know I'm not whining but hard work is true I have not even eaten

[2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:40.980]  know Fritz Springer talked about all the mind control people he worked with that
[2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:44.580]  were programmed for an end-time scenario and that if they just triggered them all
[2:12:44.580 --> 2:12:48.860]  at once that they could start doing things like this and it should show us
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:52.900]  that this you know we're always predicting that they're gonna do the
[2:12:52.900 --> 2:12:57.620]  martial law it's implementing it but you know it's gonna be more complex and
[2:12:57.620 --> 2:13:01.780]  mind-blowing than and we just think you know on our simple level it could you
[2:13:01.780 --> 2:13:07.060]  know because they're not stupid they've planned this for years they've planned to
[2:13:07.060 --> 2:13:10.620]  make the military hey we're helping stop drugs we're helping at shootings we're
[2:13:10.620 --> 2:13:14.340]  helping a car wrecks we're moving into your local police department come on
[2:13:14.340 --> 2:13:20.620]  we're fighting al-qaeda hey Alex and then on the Columbine thing the first news
[2:13:20.620 --> 2:13:27.620]  reports saw UN vehicles at the scene you know then they said I'm flying over with
[2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:32.340]  a helicopter and they saw UN vehicles I remember that and they supposedly got a
[2:13:32.340 --> 2:13:35.660]  hundred and twenty-eight bombs into the building with some of them weighing a
[2:13:35.660 --> 2:13:39.500]  hundred pounds and more than half the teachers weren't there that day and half
[2:13:39.500 --> 2:13:42.820]  the students weren't there that day and the principal wasn't there that day and
[2:13:42.820 --> 2:13:47.900]  the police stood down for hours and hours what four hours 15 minutes and the
[2:13:47.900 --> 2:13:52.860]  other thing is we're so blessed with the info on the internet and that that
[2:13:52.860 --> 2:13:57.140]  generations before us didn't have and we're gonna pass it down to our children
[2:13:57.140 --> 2:14:01.500]  I to my three sons and they'll never fool us again even if we have to go
[2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:07.580]  through some kind of concentration camp type scenario or anything and I wanted
[2:14:07.580 --> 2:14:13.900]  to just tell you that that second trailer you know about the Obama deception was
[2:14:13.900 --> 2:14:19.380]  really good with KRS-1 Ventura Salante that was just really good this this might
[2:14:19.380 --> 2:14:25.220]  have a real big effect oh it's a good look we made it in record time and in
[2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:28.060]  production quality it's the best film we've ever made in the materials the
[2:14:28.060 --> 2:14:31.260]  most up-to-date and hardcore and exposes the bankers and everything it'll

[2:14:55.100 --> 2:14:58.140]  so many points I'll give folks the source on that is somewhere here in my stack
[2:14:58.140 --> 2:15:02.060]  I believe AP reported on it and then it's just been kind of leaked down to
[2:15:02.060 --> 2:15:06.380]  others you know media throughout the nation but yeah you know and I when I
[2:15:06.380 --> 2:15:09.820]  heard about the shooting yesterday I was like you know what this sounds like
[2:15:09.820 --> 2:15:13.420]  this guy's military and it seems to me like almost every single shooter either
[2:15:13.420 --> 2:15:17.900]  has you know military connections or police connections listen take the
[2:15:17.900 --> 2:15:23.540]  these take the beltway DC snipers yep I mean these guys I said when they catch

[2:17:57.100 --> 2:18:01.420]  factors and other abuses had the American people in a state of panic for
[2:18:01.420 --> 2:18:07.620]  their future and the very existence of the United States the elite were in
[2:18:07.620 --> 2:18:12.140]  trouble the people were beginning to see through their facade past their
[2:18:12.140 --> 2:18:18.940]  front man and to the ruling elite behind the throne for the first time in U.S.
[2:18:18.940 --> 2:18:24.340]  history both parties were universally hated Congress had a 9% approval rating
[2:18:24.340 --> 2:18:32.460]  the globalist agenda had stalled and then on to the scene came a man who
[2:18:32.460 --> 2:18:39.460]  promised change change we could all believe in Barack H. Obama promised to
[2:18:39.460 --> 2:18:44.380]  end the war and bring our troops home fast he pledged to uphold the
[2:18:44.380 --> 2:18:48.420]  Constitution and to stop the federal government from spying on the American
[2:18:48.420 --> 2:18:52.780]  people candidate Obama told American workers that he was going to get them
[2:18:52.780 --> 2:18:59.500]  out of NAFTA and get and he's already breaking those promises in this film we
[2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:04.860]  will prove that Obama says one thing and does another and that he works for the
[2:19:04.860 --> 2:19:10.020]  very same elite interests that Bush served the very interest engineering the
[2:19:10.020 --> 2:19:16.980]  financial collapse and formation of a dictatorial world government this film
[2:19:16.980 --> 2:19:21.900]  is not about left or right it is nonpartisan our past documentary films
[2:19:21.900 --> 2:19:26.380]  are among some of the most damning indictments of George W. Bush and his
[2:19:26.380 --> 2:19:34.380]  administration that have ever been made if humanity has any hope of affecting
[2:19:34.380 --> 2:19:37.860]  real change for the better will not come from the Madison Avenue false
[2:19:37.860 --> 2:19:44.460]  reality makers who have cast Barack Obama as the savior of the world to
[2:19:44.460 --> 2:19:48.460]  alter our course from tyranny to liberty to defeat the corrupt elite we
[2:19:48.460 --> 2:19:54.180]  must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet

[2:21:05.060 --> 2:21:08.460]  to share some thoughts with you in today's economy with the government
[2:21:08.460 --> 2:21:13.060]  spending on wild the banking system on the verge of collapse and Wall Street
[2:21:13.060 --> 2:21:16.860]  and continuous freefall we both know that it's critical that you protect your
[2:21:16.860 --> 2:21:21.180]  savings and retirement programs now macroeconomics can be very confusing but
[2:21:21.180 --> 2:21:25.300]  the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple it's purchase of

[2:24:07.900 --> 2:24:12.420]  are among some of the most damning indictments of George W. Bush and his
[2:24:12.420 --> 2:24:20.460]  administration that have ever been made if humanity has any hope of affecting
[2:24:20.460 --> 2:24:23.900]  real change for the better will not come from the Madison Avenue false
[2:24:23.900 --> 2:24:30.900]  reality makers who have cast Barack Obama as the savior of the world to alter
[2:24:30.900 --> 2:24:34.900]  our course from tyranny to liberty to defeat the corrupt elite we must get
[2:24:34.900 --> 2:24:44.220]  past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet
[2:24:44.220 --> 2:24:48.380]  Obama pledged in hundreds of speeches and interviews that within six months of
[2:24:48.380 --> 2:24:53.620]  being elected he was going to bring our troops home from Iraq but after he was
[2:24:53.620 --> 2:24:58.780]  inaugurated the story changed now he said that they would look at bringing
[2:24:58.780 --> 2:25:04.180]  some of the troops home in 16 months two weeks later his story had changed
[2:25:04.180 --> 2:25:09.420]  again now the administration would look at bringing the troops home in 23
[2:25:09.420 --> 2:25:15.060]  months while Obama's already fudging yeah fun since day one in this election
[2:25:15.060 --> 2:25:19.260]  where he first said we're getting out well now it's a timetable and now it's
[2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:23.380]  that up because they're getting to him they're understanding that in he ain't
[2:25:23.380 --> 2:25:27.100]  gonna be able to get him out because people more powerful than him got us in
[2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:31.900]  when he first ran remember he was gonna take the troops out I get in there
[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:37.260]  troops come home day one there is no military solution in Iraq and there
[2:25:37.260 --> 2:25:43.380]  never was I will begin to remove our troops from Iraq immediately and then
[2:25:43.380 --> 2:25:49.660]  that went to 16 months and now he's gonna add this saying another 30,000 or
[2:25:49.660 --> 2:25:56.020]  more troops to Afghanistan next he sent 30,000 more Marines to Afghanistan
[2:25:56.020 --> 2:26:03.060]  doubling the total number of forces in the crosshairs Barak then announced
[2:26:03.060 --> 2:26:06.620]  that he was going to move missile systems into Eastern Europe to encircle
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:12.020]  Russia but after all what should we expect after he kept Bush's secretary of
[2:26:12.020 --> 2:26:16.980]  defense Robert Gates the outcome of this policy is if you're constantly meddling
[2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:22.260]  near the Russian borders with these fascist creeps IMF NATO agents like
[2:26:22.260 --> 2:26:27.220]  Ushenko of Ukraine or Sakashvili or Georgia or these Kaczynski twins in
[2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:32.700]  Poland or various collections of people in Latvia Lithuania Estonia you're tied
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:38.380]  to these gangsters and if they decide to start a war that rapidly escalates into
[2:26:38.380 --> 2:26:42.700]  thermonuclear World War three this is worse than the neocons Bush and Cheney
[2:26:42.700 --> 2:26:48.580]  never got as far as Brzezinski Soros and the other people running Obama
[2:26:48.580 --> 2:26:54.220]  Barack Obama swore that he would vote to repeal the Patriot Act but then he
[2:26:54.220 --> 2:26:59.500]  voted for its reauthorization Obama decried the Bush administration's
[2:26:59.500 --> 2:27:04.340]  illegal warrantless wiretapping of the American people then he voted to legalize
[2:27:04.340 --> 2:27:11.060]  it Obama pledged that he would filibuster any attempt to give
[2:27:11.060 --> 2:27:17.180]  retroactive immunity to the telephone companies the telecom companies except he
[2:27:17.180 --> 2:27:22.140]  then turned around and voted for that bill most people don't know for example
[2:27:22.140 --> 2:27:26.980]  that he voted to reinstate the Patriot Act and more government wiretapping
[2:27:26.980 --> 2:27:31.780]  candidate Obama told desperate factory workers in speech after speech that he
[2:27:31.780 --> 2:27:35.700]  was going to renegotiate NAFTA and GATT to make it more fair for American
[2:27:35.700 --> 2:27:42.420]  workers it is absolutely true that NAFTA was a mistake but then his campaign was
[2:27:42.420 --> 2:27:46.260]  caught sending out memos to top corporate leaders telling them not to
[2:27:46.260 --> 2:27:50.140]  worry and then it was just campaign rhetoric we had Obama saying you know
[2:27:50.140 --> 2:27:54.100]  I'm against free trade I don't like NAFTA and all those free trade sellouts we
[2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:57.580]  had Austin Goolsbee going to the Canadian diplomats and saying don't
[2:27:57.580 --> 2:28:01.900]  don't mind him he's just popping off that's just election era rhetoric
[2:28:01.900 --> 2:28:05.980]  doesn't mean anything presidential candidate Barack Obama was publicly
[2:28:05.980 --> 2:28:09.980]  criticizing the North American free trade agreement in a bid for votes but
[2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:14.620]  privately telling Canadian officials not to worry about it he said that he was
[2:28:14.620 --> 2:28:18.460]  going to bring us peace in the Middle East he said that he was going to bring
[2:28:18.460 --> 2:28:25.500]  us transparency and a balanced economy he said that he was going to not have
[2:28:25.500 --> 2:28:30.860]  have lobbyist he said he was going to clean up government he said he was
[2:28:30.860 --> 2:28:36.900]  going to work for the environment and point by point by point within the

[2:37:12.420 --> 2:37:16.340]  responsibility for killing nearly 3,000 people boy they couldn't get it for six
[2:37:16.340 --> 2:37:21.460]  seven years but magically now and they admit these aren't real courts they're
[2:37:21.460 --> 2:37:30.780]  kangaroo courts they're secret courts magically after all these years the 9-1-1
[2:37:30.780 --> 2:37:39.420]  Sharia council comes out wearing their Santa Claus hats and they did it yes they
[2:37:39.420 --> 2:37:44.020]  made nor at stand down yes they ran drills with nor out of the exact targets
[2:37:44.020 --> 2:37:48.940]  being attacked at the same time they had the Air Force codes they could order the
[2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:52.420]  stand down they made building seven collapse when it wasn't hit by an
[2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:55.900]  airplane and it's own footprint and they made the police walk around on
[2:37:55.900 --> 2:37:58.460]  camera and say we've been told to get back they're gonna blow up building seven
[2:37:58.460 --> 2:38:01.860]  and then they made Larry Silverstein come out and say they blew it up and then
[2:38:01.860 --> 2:38:06.500]  they they did it all ladies and gentlemen because they are like Dr. Manhattan
[2:38:06.500 --> 2:38:12.820]  they have magical godlike powers and then John Gibson was just like it's over
[2:38:12.820 --> 2:38:15.900]  Alex it's over they've confessed everyone knows the truth now it's
[2:38:15.900 --> 2:38:18.820]  incredible and I said oh really Khalid shake Muhammad oh don't don't don't
[2:38:18.820 --> 2:38:22.060]  say that don't get into that Khalid shake Muhammad now has admitted that he
[2:38:22.060 --> 2:38:29.260]  didn't do any of that and they admit it was all baloney it took him five years
[2:38:29.260 --> 2:38:34.540]  to finally cook up a story with Muhammad four plus years in custody and now
[2:38:34.540 --> 2:38:38.500]  almost seven years hundreds and hundreds actually it's in the thousands that
[2:38:38.500 --> 2:38:43.300]  have been run through Guantanamo Bay I had on the CIA section chief who wrote
[2:38:43.300 --> 2:38:47.820]  the book Jawbreaker three years ago and he admitted that they give twenty five
[2:38:47.820 --> 2:38:51.220]  thousand dollar bonuses and that the Taliban just goes and grabs literal
[2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:54.540]  camel herder 14 year olds out of the hills who don't even know where the U.S.
[2:38:54.540 --> 2:38:59.540]  is on a map and then go sell them to the Pentagon for twenty to twenty five
[2:38:59.540 --> 2:39:04.540]  thousand dollars a piece and they're taking the Guantanamo Bay and what
[2:39:04.540 --> 2:39:07.740]  Guantanamo Bay and the scores of other secret camps are all about it's come out
[2:39:07.740 --> 2:39:13.020]  is laboratories of torture but also creating agents people they say look
[2:39:13.020 --> 2:39:15.620]  work for us and they psychologically test them and give them little missions
[2:39:15.620 --> 2:39:24.900]  will let you go they can go infiltrate groups this is how they do it this is
[2:39:24.900 --> 2:39:28.180]  how intelligent I mean this is how intelligence operations operate and I
[2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:31.020]  was saying to Gibson Gibson is there is it not admitted that the U.S. government
[2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:34.900]  stage terror attacks before is that on on record is it not an official army
[2:39:34.900 --> 2:39:40.820]  field manuals how stage terror attacks no no it's not and there's no new world
[2:39:40.820 --> 2:39:43.340]  order it's not all over the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times and
[2:39:43.340 --> 2:39:51.660]  everywhere else saying I know no no no no no no I mean this is the type of brick
[2:39:51.660 --> 2:39:57.940]  wall that we deal with guys in there go ahead and roll this is this is a video
[2:39:57.940 --> 2:40:03.300]  press release by Fox admitting that they plant messages in there to manipulate
[2:40:03.300 --> 2:40:08.940]  your mind this is the conservative Fox to accept global warming and that we
[2:40:08.940 --> 2:40:13.700]  have to have a carbon tax here it is
[2:40:17.220 --> 2:40:23.820]  want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no
[2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:27.260]  matter what the size of your carbon footprint is you can make a difference
[2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:33.300]  how to staple on record global warming probably press button to see what global
[2:40:33.300 --> 2:40:37.180]  warming will do in the next three years
[2:40:37.180 --> 2:40:43.700]  three years is a long ways away what could we do on a practical level to start
[2:40:43.700 --> 2:40:49.580]  making a difference just had another thought what if the scared straight show
[2:40:49.580 --> 2:40:54.860]  had a green message to the biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about
[2:40:54.860 --> 2:41:01.540]  the environment into some of our content I don't follow green it means
[2:41:01.540 --> 2:41:06.380]  environmentally friendly the lifeblood of our company is a quality of our TV shows
[2:41:06.380 --> 2:41:11.060]  and we would accomplish nothing if we compromise that quality going green
[2:41:11.060 --> 2:41:16.340]  doesn't fit with the rest of the show working magic make it fit hey Brian I'm
[2:41:16.340 --> 2:41:22.100]  not gonna recycle this aluminum can I'm just gonna throw it in a trash your
[2:41:22.100 --> 2:41:28.540]  earth's bitch the most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on
[2:41:28.540 --> 2:41:35.140]  behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production as well
[2:41:35.140 --> 2:41:40.660]  as work in a message about global warming about environmental changes and
[2:41:40.660 --> 2:41:45.860]  about empowering people to take responsibility why are your wedding
[2:41:45.860 --> 2:41:53.260]  programs bumpy see we're having a green wedding so after the reception our guests
[2:41:53.260 --> 2:41:59.180]  can plant the programs real cloud I could live in the sea make friends with
[2:41:59.180 --> 2:42:04.020]  the whale we live in a sunken pirate ship that it show global warming we've
[2:42:04.020 --> 2:42:08.100]  come up with you know all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint
[2:42:08.100 --> 2:42:14.180]  everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles in in on our production look at
[2:42:14.180 --> 2:42:19.500]  all these hummers what kind of jerk would drive one of those dude this car
[2:42:19.500 --> 2:42:22.300]  kicks ass
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:29.620]  we're using biodiesel fuel and our generators instead of regular diesel no
[2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:38.700]  car no electricity company I got a zero copy we're now frequently getting
[2:42:38.700 --> 2:42:43.100]  scripts electronically fluorescent bulbs that use less electricity reusable
[2:42:43.100 --> 2:42:47.580]  hemp bags for shopping shampoo that's not tested on animals I feel bad for
[2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:51.020]  those lab animals running around with dirty hair but better for the
[2:42:51.020 --> 2:42:55.780]  environment that's a sacrifice they have to make here at 24 we are committed to
[2:42:55.780 --> 2:42:59.700]  reducing our impact on climate change and we know that we can't solve this
[2:42:59.700 --> 2:43:04.580]  problem in 24 hours but by making energy conscious decisions on our set we are
[2:43:04.580 --> 2:43:09.260]  contributing to a solution galvanizing that kind of an effort with as many
[2:43:09.260 --> 2:43:14.340]  people as it has taken to get on board and and sort of help us with this effort
[2:43:14.340 --> 2:43:19.220]  it hasn't been difficult on the contrary it's been rewarding and people have
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:24.020]  acted swiftly and enthusiastically he's powering the blender the wheel rim is
[2:43:24.020 --> 2:43:28.660]  attached to generator this is rather ingenious stay fit and save energy
[2:43:28.660 --> 2:43:33.420]  everyone should do come sure it'll catch on mr. McKay says that history is past
[2:43:33.420 --> 2:43:39.740]  what's saving the earth is our present to the future oh the fact that this
[2:43:39.740 --> 2:43:45.420]  company decided to get behind the the move to to try to bring an end to
[2:43:45.420 --> 2:43:49.820]  global warming was really gratifying finally I get to save the earth with
[2:43:49.820 --> 2:43:54.540]  deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows

[2:44:50.460 --> 2:44:54.020]  army and all the major police departments shut up doesn't exist but the
[2:44:54.020 --> 2:44:56.460]  armies good and they need to be on the streets but they don't exist on the
[2:44:56.460 --> 2:45:02.220]  streets hey you can't torture people for six seven years and then have them
[2:45:02.220 --> 2:45:05.940]  confess and a press release in a secret tribunal that's why you don't allow
[2:45:05.940 --> 2:45:08.340]  torture because it gets fake confession remember the inquisitors
[2:45:08.340 --> 2:45:15.180]  shut up shut up shut up al-qaeda did it now north comes gotta be on our streets

[2:45:24.580 --> 2:45:30.580]  actually Alaska okay they told me alabama this is a blur but we got alabama
[2:45:30.580 --> 2:45:37.380]  on the brain yeah I understand hey man I listen to you talk to the colonel
[2:45:37.380 --> 2:45:44.860]  there and I want to say that when I took the oath of enlistment it says
[2:45:44.860 --> 2:45:50.060]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the
[2:45:50.060 --> 2:45:55.420]  United States against all enemies foreign and domestic domestic that I will
[2:45:55.420 --> 2:46:01.300]  bear true faith and allegiance to do the same and I will bear obey the orders of
[2:46:01.300 --> 2:46:04.740]  the president of the United States and the orders of the officer to point it
[2:46:04.740 --> 2:46:09.860]  over me according to regulations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice so
[2:46:09.860 --> 2:46:16.820]  help me God now when you asked him if he supported the Second Amendment and he
[2:46:16.820 --> 2:46:21.620]  said that what was his comment exactly Alex said that he said I can't get into
[2:46:21.620 --> 2:46:28.540]  that I can't get sir you are supposed to defend the Constitution of the United
[2:46:28.540 --> 2:46:32.820]  States so when somebody asks you if you support the Second Amendment your
[2:46:32.820 --> 2:46:39.260]  answer should be yes I do not I can't get into that now and that's not the
[2:46:39.260 --> 2:46:43.340]  reason I like called Alex but that does irritate me to hear my superiors that
[2:46:43.340 --> 2:46:47.700]  I'm supposed to obey so you're currently in the army I'm in the Air Force sir
[2:46:47.700 --> 2:46:54.220]  okay yeah go ahead anyways the biggest reason I called today is because I

[2:47:12.860 --> 2:47:18.460]  contact me and maybe together we can get something to join forces and put in a
[2:47:18.460 --> 2:47:24.500]  legal lawful FCC certified AM transmitter that will go out three miles yes

[2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:16.900]  visual record of this remember the different terror training manuals that
[2:54:16.900 --> 2:54:20.900]  we're just talking about we're just talking about where we went to break
[2:54:20.900 --> 2:54:26.900]  remember the constitutional terrorist flyer that went out to thousands of
[2:54:26.900 --> 2:54:30.420]  police agencies that said those that make frequent references to the US
[2:54:30.420 --> 2:54:35.220]  Constitution those are talking about a new world order a police officer just
[2:54:35.220 --> 2:54:39.500]  sent it to us and Tim's confirmed it I've seen similar ones before this is an
[2:54:39.500 --> 2:54:43.700]  updated version of one I've seen over and over again right here in Austin and
[2:54:43.700 --> 2:54:46.900]  it states if you believe they're setting up a North American Union they show
[2:54:46.900 --> 2:54:51.620]  official North American Union maps from the SPP they say it doesn't exist you're
[2:54:51.620 --> 2:54:55.020]  insane and dangerous and they mentioned that you know there's a new order being
[2:54:55.020 --> 2:54:58.660]  set up by banks that doesn't exist you're insane if it says it does this is
[2:54:58.660 --> 2:55:02.020]  how it's gonna work you're gonna say you love the world bank and pay your taxes
[2:55:02.020 --> 2:55:06.660]  to it publicly and then if you see it on TV or paying your taxes to it and say
[2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:11.020]  it exists you're gonna be called a terrorist now if that in mind control I
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:14.060]  don't know what is we're setting up world government the troops are gonna be on
[2:55:14.060 --> 2:55:17.620]  the streets but it doesn't exist and these crazy conspiracy theorists are
[2:55:17.620 --> 2:55:22.820]  dangerous terrorist militias so we I was just scanning through her in the break
[2:55:22.820 --> 2:55:26.620]  amazing information we will spend five minutes while Gerald Salente's on this
[2:55:26.620 --> 2:55:30.140]  is so important I almost moved we've already moved one guest today and in the
[2:55:30.140 --> 2:55:32.700]  first hour I to tell the mass shooting and the troops on the streets in
[2:55:32.700 --> 2:55:38.820]  Alabama what happened in Germany clearly this takes to high heaven but we're
[2:55:38.820 --> 2:55:42.700]  going live at prison planet TV here in just a few minutes we'll go live at the
[2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:47.820]  start of the next hour let's go back to the calls Mike in Kentucky Mike are on
[2:55:47.820 --> 2:55:52.940]  the air hi I was just wondering how and comment on what you said earlier you was
[2:55:52.940 --> 2:55:57.300]  talking earlier how the media has been putting a spin on it seems like everything
[2:55:57.300 --> 2:56:02.740]  that pretty much anything that comes out now that relates to guns or or any kind
[2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:06.780]  of violence like that but I live here in Bowling Green Kentucky and I was
[2:56:06.780 --> 2:56:11.860]  watching the local news the other day and they was talking about how the
[2:56:11.860 --> 2:56:18.180]  Marines had pretty much recruited 20 teachers out of the school well it
[2:56:18.180 --> 2:56:22.900]  wasn't they were saying that it was for recruitment purposes yeah under federal
[2:56:22.900 --> 2:56:25.940]  law they're all in the schools threatening children with arrest if they
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:28.300]  don't sign up for the military saying it's the law they've got a sign the
[2:56:28.300 --> 2:56:31.300]  contract just like I said it's the law you got to take vaccines when it isn't
[2:56:31.300 --> 2:56:34.980]  and everywhere they're taking over the schools the government buildings they're
[2:56:34.980 --> 2:56:38.340]  moving in everywhere I mean this is so off the charts they recruited the
[2:56:38.340 --> 2:56:43.300]  preachers they recruited the executives it is on right and I just can't I mean I
[2:56:43.300 --> 2:56:47.580]  can't believe how obvious the the media is I mean if people don't understand
[2:56:47.580 --> 2:56:50.180]  that something's going on right now I mean they're just completely black but
[2:56:50.180 --> 2:56:53.680]  they most people don't even watch the news they watch sitcoms and dramas and
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:56:58.460]  TV shows and they admit it's filled with anti-gun pro-world government pro
[2:56:58.460 --> 2:57:03.660]  carbon tax pro military on the street it's all and then they just say no
[2:57:03.660 --> 2:57:06.660]  there's no propaganda we go well here's the news admitting they're planting
[2:57:06.660 --> 2:57:12.540]  messages no no I don't even watch them shows my wife does you know pretty much
[2:57:12.540 --> 2:57:16.180]  she's the one who watches them shows right here and I mean hers into a lot
[2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:21.180]  about it but anyways she watches a show ugly Betty and the flat I you know she
[2:57:21.180 --> 2:57:23.700]  was watching and I walked into the living room and I've seen the show was on
[2:57:23.700 --> 2:57:27.620]  and I sit there and I've seen it for a minute and it just so happened when I
[2:57:27.620 --> 2:57:31.620]  had you know started watching it that they was talking about a media bailout
[2:57:31.620 --> 2:57:36.380]  and this was you know days before they even mentioned anything about no
[2:57:36.380 --> 2:57:39.660]  they're now exactly they push and sit-coms what they're about to do in a
[2:57:39.660 --> 2:57:42.980]  few months and that's why they're now announcing the feds are basically going
[2:57:42.980 --> 2:57:47.180]  to pay for the mainstream media and they'll now be publicly federal right
[2:57:47.180 --> 2:57:51.500]  I just I just wanted to comment on that that's just it's right there in your
[2:57:51.500 --> 2:57:54.860]  face if people don't understand what's going on you know they're never going
[2:57:54.860 --> 2:57:58.860]  to because Mike that's freedom to have propaganda and troops everywhere and
[2:57:58.860 --> 2:58:03.940]  black helicopters and FEMA camps and foreign bankers openly stealing 9.7
[2:58:03.940 --> 2:58:07.420]  trillion and openly announcing world government and then saying it doesn't
[2:58:07.420 --> 2:58:12.780]  exist if you criticize it I mean that's normal everything's fine you know they're
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:17.380]  making the gun control ever since Obama's been elected there's been a gun
[2:58:17.380 --> 2:58:23.700]  related issue they want to pull a Stalin style mass operation they are going for
[2:58:23.700 --> 2:58:30.140]  a red-hot hot war against free humanity this is it they are going for broke they
[2:58:30.140 --> 2:58:34.620]  are pulling out all of the stops and I'm just thinking about pulling the trigger

[3:00:51.380 --> 3:00:57.300]  I've gotten the Austin manuals of them training that if someone makes a
[3:00:57.300 --> 3:00:59.740]  frequent reference to the U.S. Constitution you guys pull up the
[3:00:59.740 --> 3:01:04.340]  reverse side of the flyer one of those three-fold I want to show people it
[3:01:04.340 --> 3:01:08.940]  says those that make frequent references to the Constitution so if you talk
[3:01:08.940 --> 3:01:13.180]  about that you're a terrorist second amendment groups quote defenders of the
[3:01:13.180 --> 3:01:17.020]  U.S. Constitution against federal government and UN superpatriots groups
[3:01:17.020 --> 3:01:22.740]  of individuals engaged in paramilitary training and goes on to say no driver's

[3:09:24.580 --> 3:09:31.580]  propaganda and they say in here that you know there is
[3:09:32.300 --> 3:09:35.420]  they say in there that there is
[3:09:35.420 --> 3:09:38.860]  no such thing as a new order banking takeover as hundreds of newspapers a day
[3:09:38.860 --> 3:09:39.580]  say
[3:09:39.580 --> 3:09:42.540]  there will be a new bank of the world that you pay carbon taxes to
[3:09:42.540 --> 3:09:46.260]  it just doesn't exist you're insane terrorist if you believe it
[3:09:46.260 --> 3:09:49.540]  uh... now they're announcing troops to be all in all major police departments
[3:09:49.540 --> 3:09:52.700]  running checkpoints everywhere i've read mainstream news articles last hour
[3:09:52.700 --> 3:09:55.420]  gerald salante this is getting crazy
[3:09:55.420 --> 3:10:00.820]  it certainly is it's not well i i heard uh... part of the uh... announcement
[3:10:00.820 --> 3:10:03.100]  for your new dvd
[3:10:03.100 --> 3:10:08.900]  and what state-controlled uh... capitalism is is fascism
[3:10:08.900 --> 3:10:12.920]  and that's the definition for it's not it's not socialism
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:15.780]  and that's what we're moving toward
[3:10:15.780 --> 3:10:18.820]  well my guys are really impressed in a meeting in person i turned on glenn
[3:10:18.820 --> 3:10:21.860]  back that day for my guys come up and review you for the film and would like
[3:10:21.860 --> 3:10:24.180]  notice just a few weeks ago someone to thank you
[3:10:24.180 --> 3:10:26.020]  being partly obama deception serve
[3:10:26.020 --> 3:10:28.980]  will send you a link to it uh... she can watch it on high quality online in
[3:10:28.980 --> 3:10:31.620]  the next 48 hours
[3:10:31.620 --> 3:10:33.260]  so much is happening
[3:10:33.260 --> 3:10:37.220]  so much of what you predicted cut the country's collapsing by february march
[3:10:37.220 --> 3:10:41.260]  all over the world uh... banks more more banks going under
[3:10:41.260 --> 3:10:44.100]  uh... more more problems unfolding uh...
[3:10:44.100 --> 3:10:48.740]  continue with your trend forecast in the uh... short term
[3:10:48.740 --> 3:10:53.220]  well we may see an obama bounce i mean it's nothing so much money into the
[3:10:53.220 --> 3:10:54.380]  system
[3:10:54.380 --> 3:10:58.260]  that it's going to be a false flag fiscal recovery
[3:10:58.260 --> 3:11:02.700]  and it's going to have a lot of people believing that prosperity is just around
[3:11:02.700 --> 3:11:04.180]  the corner
[3:11:04.180 --> 3:11:08.540]  but the reality is is we're moving into the greatest depression
[3:11:08.540 --> 3:11:12.900]  and it really needs to be understood that this is a worldwide meltdown
[3:11:12.900 --> 3:11:15.860]  i mean this isn't just the u s the u s was
[3:11:15.860 --> 3:11:19.060]  of course the originator in many ways of it
[3:11:19.060 --> 3:11:22.460]  but what you look what's going on around the world like god
[3:11:22.460 --> 3:11:25.940]  uh... the the former sylvia block countries
[3:11:25.940 --> 3:11:29.180]  uh... the stony a lot feel with wania
[3:11:29.180 --> 3:11:31.180]  uh... romania hungry
[3:11:31.180 --> 3:11:32.300]  ukraine
[3:11:32.300 --> 3:11:34.100]  and they're all on the water
[3:11:34.100 --> 3:11:37.060]  and we saw what happened with iceland for example
[3:11:37.060 --> 3:11:39.780]  and they overthrew that government over there
[3:11:39.780 --> 3:11:42.020]  you will be seeing that the the the once
[3:11:42.020 --> 3:11:42.900]  wanted
[3:11:42.900 --> 3:11:46.140]  Celtic tiger boom has turned to bust
[3:11:46.140 --> 3:11:49.020]  the spanish and english building frenzies
[3:11:49.020 --> 3:11:53.380]  uh... they had been subdued in their economies are in steep decline
[3:11:53.380 --> 3:11:57.740]  you look around the world get a date to want taiwan's exports
[3:11:57.740 --> 3:11:59.900]  it down some forty two percent
[3:11:59.900 --> 3:12:01.900]  japan thirty five percent
[3:12:01.900 --> 3:12:05.660]  south korea seventeen percent worldwide alex
[3:12:05.660 --> 3:12:08.660]  when you when you look at what's going on on average
[3:12:08.660 --> 3:12:10.520]  world trade
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:12.140]  in january
[3:12:12.140 --> 3:12:15.460]  has collapsed over thirty percent
[3:12:15.460 --> 3:12:18.500]  what the people need to have them say
[3:12:18.500 --> 3:12:20.580]  this is a depression
[3:12:20.580 --> 3:12:23.340]  these are depression era fall off
[3:12:23.340 --> 3:12:26.020]  and when you look at other data i mean
[3:12:26.020 --> 3:12:29.660]  uh... auto sales in the u.s. what a week ago
[3:12:29.660 --> 3:12:36.660]  they came in down forty one percent what a people waiting for it to go to zero
[3:12:38.100 --> 3:12:41.660]  jero salante they are announcing all over the country and i read these
[3:12:41.660 --> 3:12:44.780]  articles last hour go back over and i'm sure you probably were some of the
[3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:48.900]  they're gonna have army liaison officers in all the police departments
[3:12:48.900 --> 3:12:51.820]  and they're announcing in canada england the u.s. that the army is going to be
[3:12:51.820 --> 3:12:53.500]  patrolling america
[3:12:53.500 --> 3:12:56.500]  you know we knew this years ago and then months ago the pentagon announced it
[3:12:56.500 --> 3:12:58.180]  but that was done quietly
[3:12:58.180 --> 3:13:01.700]  just you know in the government documents but now the media we're seeing
[3:13:01.700 --> 3:13:02.980]  the rollout
[3:13:02.980 --> 3:13:06.340]  of the p r all the marines are going to be out looking for drunk drivers hoping
[3:13:06.340 --> 3:13:08.020]  the police this week in california
[3:13:08.020 --> 3:13:11.460]  all the army showed up for the shooting in alabama
[3:13:11.460 --> 3:13:14.220]  uh... and patrol the streets all
[3:13:14.220 --> 3:13:19.060]  i mean what is the army going to do patrolling america i mean clearly
[3:13:19.060 --> 3:13:22.980]  the army war colleges said they believe things are going to completely collapse
[3:13:22.980 --> 3:13:26.900]  uh... but they're not doing anything to reverse what's caused the collapse
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:29.980]  no not only they're not doing anything that
[3:13:29.980 --> 3:13:31.820]  to reverse the collapse
[3:13:31.820 --> 3:13:33.380]  did doing more
[3:13:33.380 --> 3:13:35.820]  to make the collapse works
[3:13:35.820 --> 3:13:40.580]  for example and again you know that you know we're not making this stuff up
[3:13:40.580 --> 3:13:43.220]  it's it's in the words of uh...
[3:13:43.220 --> 3:13:45.700]  uh... the confidence man in chief
[3:13:45.700 --> 3:13:47.820]  uh... president albama
[3:13:47.820 --> 3:13:50.260]  and that's what by the way that's what this all is
[3:13:50.260 --> 3:13:52.100]  it's a confidence game and
[3:13:52.100 --> 3:13:54.100]  as you well know that the term
[3:13:54.100 --> 3:13:56.120]  uh... confidence man comes
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:13:57.340]  the con man
[3:13:57.340 --> 3:14:01.460]  is big build confidence when you listen to his speech for example
[3:14:01.460 --> 3:14:02.660]  the congress
[3:14:02.660 --> 3:14:04.860]  he used the word confidence
[3:14:04.860 --> 3:14:06.260]  seven times
[3:14:06.260 --> 3:14:09.460]  have confidence in the plans that they're doing
[3:14:09.460 --> 3:14:14.700]  so wait when you look around and you you see what what the scheme is
[3:14:14.700 --> 3:14:16.620]  what is he's saying
[3:14:16.620 --> 3:14:19.420]  he's saying that what they want to do
[3:14:19.420 --> 3:14:20.660]  is to
[3:14:20.660 --> 3:14:22.940]  loosen credit up again
[3:14:22.940 --> 3:14:26.300]  so that people could continue to borrow
[3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:31.260]  and that's going to somehow regenerate the economy
[3:14:31.260 --> 3:14:33.780]  well it was loose credit
[3:14:33.780 --> 3:14:36.180]  and having people borrow
[3:14:36.180 --> 3:14:38.940]  that got us into this problem
[3:14:38.940 --> 3:14:42.020]  the nation is overwhelmed in debt
[3:14:42.020 --> 3:14:44.380]  and now the solution is
[3:14:44.380 --> 3:14:47.740]  well we have to re-unfreeze the credit markets
[3:14:47.740 --> 3:14:52.300]  so that people could go out and borrow and buy cars and build homes
[3:14:52.300 --> 3:14:55.700]  so i mean this is this is pure insanity
[3:14:55.700 --> 3:14:57.260]  and no one is
[3:14:57.260 --> 3:14:58.220]  saying it
[3:14:58.220 --> 3:15:02.380]  instead they're like these bobblehead dogs on the back of
[3:15:02.380 --> 3:15:03.460]  cars
[3:15:03.460 --> 3:15:04.900]  you know that they're
[3:15:04.900 --> 3:15:05.940]  they're uh...
[3:15:05.940 --> 3:15:07.220]  agreeing with it
[3:15:07.220 --> 3:15:11.540]  and this is the quote from him our goal is to quicken the day
[3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:14.180]  when we restart lending
[3:15:14.180 --> 3:15:16.740]  to the american people
[3:15:16.740 --> 3:15:22.140]  and he goes on you see the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy
[3:15:22.140 --> 3:15:24.300]  the ability to get a new loan
[3:15:24.300 --> 3:15:27.420]  is how you finance the purchase of everything
[3:15:27.420 --> 3:15:29.580]  from a home to a car
[3:15:29.580 --> 3:15:31.140]  flow of credit
[3:15:31.140 --> 3:15:33.180]  the ability to get a loan
[3:15:33.180 --> 3:15:35.420]  well all this sounds positive
[3:15:35.420 --> 3:15:36.940]  but what does it mean
[3:15:36.940 --> 3:15:39.380]  it means taking on more debt
[3:15:39.380 --> 3:15:41.380]  and borrowing more money
[3:15:41.380 --> 3:15:45.180]  meanwhile they're announcing openly that it's socialism is if that's a good
[3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:47.180]  thing but giving most money to the banks
[3:15:47.180 --> 3:15:50.660]  that's not really socialism that's just highway robbery or piracy
[3:15:50.660 --> 3:15:53.700]  but they are giving hundreds of billions of chicken feet fifteen bucks
[3:15:53.700 --> 3:15:54.820]  every few weeks
[3:15:54.820 --> 3:15:56.060]  to the general public
[3:15:56.060 --> 3:15:59.980]  selling them on the idea that all this debt is owed by the people when it's a
[3:15:59.980 --> 3:16:01.300]  pittance
[3:16:01.300 --> 3:16:04.900]  uh... i mean it's just amazing to see them looting and robbing the middle class
[3:16:04.900 --> 3:16:06.100]  to give it to the elite
[3:16:06.100 --> 3:16:07.660]  and the poor
[3:16:07.660 --> 3:16:10.660]  it is and that's exactly what they're doing
[3:16:10.660 --> 3:16:14.980]  so you know here we have i mean it is a private private sector credit market
[3:16:14.980 --> 3:16:15.580]  debt
[3:16:15.580 --> 3:16:19.580]  is a hundred and seventy four percent of the gdp
[3:16:19.580 --> 3:16:22.060]  that that he did that this is
[3:16:22.060 --> 3:16:25.780]  this is amazing that there's never been any numbers like this
[3:16:25.780 --> 3:16:30.260]  it did it in nineteen sixty two consumers at thirty seven percent less
[3:16:30.260 --> 3:16:31.900]  debt than income
[3:16:31.900 --> 3:16:32.940]  now
[3:16:32.940 --> 3:16:33.980]  they have
[3:16:33.980 --> 3:16:37.700]  in two thousand and one they had one percent more debt
[3:16:37.700 --> 3:16:40.220]  and now it's it's it's way over that
[3:16:40.220 --> 3:16:43.660]  in the u.s. debt to income ratio rose
[3:16:43.660 --> 3:16:45.060]  in the past seven years
[3:16:45.060 --> 3:16:46.460]  as much as it did
[3:16:46.460 --> 3:16:50.740]  in the past thirty nine years which means we're already in a predatory
[3:16:50.740 --> 3:16:54.060]  economy uh... that was already going into deep recession depression years ago
[3:16:54.060 --> 3:16:54.980]  in fact
[3:16:54.980 --> 3:16:58.540]  i saw the headline from the federal government in uh... january of two
[3:16:58.540 --> 3:17:00.220]  thousand seven they announced
[3:17:00.220 --> 3:17:04.340]  the united states is that the highest level of debt not just in u.s. history
[3:17:04.340 --> 3:17:07.460]  or even the depths of the great depression but in world history
[3:17:07.460 --> 3:17:09.500]  now we are a negative
[3:17:09.500 --> 3:17:11.580]  uh... savings country
[3:17:11.580 --> 3:17:15.820]  and as you said it is now accelerating way past the record
[3:17:15.820 --> 3:17:17.980]  and what is the solution
[3:17:17.980 --> 3:17:19.300]  print more money
[3:17:19.300 --> 3:17:21.380]  let people borrow more
[3:17:21.380 --> 3:17:23.060]  put in deeper in debt
[3:17:23.060 --> 3:17:27.820]  so they could become more of the indention servants that they've become
[3:17:27.820 --> 3:17:32.540]  so they could bail out the big guys i mean look at this a i g thing it's one
[3:17:32.540 --> 3:17:34.860]  up to a hundred and sixty billion dollars
[3:17:34.860 --> 3:17:36.980]  and they're saying they're too big to fail
[3:17:36.980 --> 3:17:38.500]  who did the money go to
[3:17:38.500 --> 3:17:40.060]  i went to do it to bank
[3:17:40.060 --> 3:17:42.500]  it went to it went to go in fact
[3:17:42.500 --> 3:17:44.460]  it went to the merrill lynch mob
[3:17:44.460 --> 3:17:48.140]  the best you know you want after another sir how outrageous is it i mean
[3:17:48.140 --> 3:17:50.260]  give us your expert take on this
[3:17:50.260 --> 3:17:54.140]  to have senator sanders say the private federal reserve chairman bernacky
[3:17:54.140 --> 3:17:56.340]  where did the trillions go
[3:17:56.340 --> 3:17:58.620]  and bernacky says i'm not going to tell you
[3:17:58.620 --> 3:18:02.660]  i mean total gangster i'm not telling you kiss off
[3:18:02.660 --> 3:18:05.820]  ron paul yesterday said they should be arrested i think it was very very bold
[3:18:05.820 --> 3:18:06.820]  of him
[3:18:06.820 --> 3:18:09.780]  i agree with ron paul uh... as well
[3:18:09.780 --> 3:18:11.820]  these are criminal acts
[3:18:11.820 --> 3:18:14.540]  and and and i don't know how well how you know
[3:18:14.540 --> 3:18:18.740]  the country is getting what it deserves if it stands by and keeps letting this
[3:18:18.740 --> 3:18:19.620]  happen
[3:18:19.620 --> 3:18:23.020]  they keep coming up with this too big to fail mantra
[3:18:23.020 --> 3:18:26.460]  and what is there and i can't say this is all certainty
[3:18:26.460 --> 3:18:29.020]  their mother's not better than mine
[3:18:29.020 --> 3:18:31.180]  yeah it's too big to fail
[3:18:31.180 --> 3:18:35.060]  you know and everybody else listening out there it's the same thing
[3:18:35.060 --> 3:18:36.860]  they're not better than we are
[3:18:36.860 --> 3:18:38.140]  will take made off
[3:18:38.140 --> 3:18:40.620]  this is the latest into this this whole thing
[3:18:40.620 --> 3:18:41.980]  that if they fail
[3:18:41.980 --> 3:18:45.820]  then we all turn to dust
[3:18:45.820 --> 3:18:47.560]  and we know what they're really doing they've been taking the money at the
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:51.220]  back door buying real assets and moving offshore i mean this is just the
[3:18:51.220 --> 3:18:52.820]  final looting
[3:18:52.820 --> 3:18:56.660]  it is and as you're well-pointing out alerting the people

[3:18:58.660 --> 3:19:01.140]  they have the troops in place
[3:19:01.140 --> 3:19:06.140]  the government is ready to put down any resistance whatsoever
[3:19:06.140 --> 3:19:11.780]  and they're going to start cracking down big time i cannot begin to tell you
[3:19:11.780 --> 3:19:14.700]  the amount of the emails we're getting
[3:19:14.700 --> 3:19:16.820]  about people wanting us
[3:19:16.820 --> 3:19:19.900]  that we buy better keep my mouth closed because
[3:19:19.900 --> 3:19:22.660]  we're making a lot of people angry
[3:19:22.660 --> 3:19:26.060]  and you know what i what i call what i call people
[3:19:26.060 --> 3:19:30.460]  like sandy while you know rather than calling him brilliant
[3:19:30.460 --> 3:19:31.400]  the former

[3:25:37.540 --> 3:25:43.300]  and and you always could pull back from preparing for the worst but the people
[3:25:43.300 --> 3:25:48.580]  that are hoping for the best if the worst happens they have no room to move

[3:25:56.020 --> 3:25:59.300]  have room after that but if you're not if you're waiting
[3:25:59.300 --> 3:26:03.540]  for somebody to come and save the day you're going to be in trouble
[3:26:03.540 --> 3:26:09.700]  absolutely um you also are armed and believe in the second amendment and
[3:26:09.700 --> 3:26:13.780]  but but that shows we're getting to them if they're threatening gerol selente
[3:26:13.780 --> 3:26:17.780]  and alex jones oh yeah look you know i i i as i
[3:26:17.780 --> 3:26:21.300]  mentioned you know at at the break you know i'm calling
[3:26:21.300 --> 3:26:25.620]  you know this ken wild excuse me sandy wild the
[3:26:25.620 --> 3:26:29.940]  the guy that put together a city group you know he's a greedy little pig
[3:26:29.940 --> 3:26:34.100]  i mean they put all these local bankers community bankers out of business
[3:26:34.100 --> 3:26:38.020]  people that had good jobs as branch managers vice presidents
[3:26:38.020 --> 3:26:41.540]  they lost them or else they became clerks for sandy
[3:26:41.540 --> 3:26:46.420]  so he could make his billion dollar pluses the same thing with bank of america
[3:26:46.420 --> 3:26:50.340]  i call him ken you know uh greedy louis
[3:26:50.340 --> 3:26:54.340]  money-grubbing louis i mean when is these people have enough
[3:26:54.340 --> 3:26:58.740]  or the brilliant larry summers and and and ron paul yourself myself we're
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:00.980]  calling for their indictment their investigation
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:04.180]  instead of them grandstanding as our saviors they can't get us all if we
[3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:06.820]  stand up and say you're the crook you're the pig
[3:27:06.820 --> 3:27:10.660]  uh you know it's not going to work for them exactly and that's why you know
[3:27:10.660 --> 3:27:14.980]  shows like yours particularly and the people that listen to you
[3:27:14.980 --> 3:27:17.940]  you know to coin a phrase you know now is the time
[3:27:17.940 --> 3:27:21.380]  for all good men to come to the aid of their country
[3:27:21.380 --> 3:27:25.300]  because if people don't stand up we're going to be mowed down
[3:27:25.300 --> 3:27:28.580]  and and it's as clear as it's clear as the day
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:32.340]  it's happening and again you know this began under bush
[3:27:32.340 --> 3:27:36.900]  it actually began under reagan uh excuse me on under clinton
[3:27:36.900 --> 3:27:40.020]  he started taking away our fourth amendment rights
[3:27:40.020 --> 3:27:44.340]  and accelerated on the bush and obama's carrying it forward
[3:27:44.340 --> 3:27:48.820]  you know it's to put us into servitude again with this whole mantra of
[3:27:48.820 --> 3:27:53.380]  too big to fail psychologically that says the rest of us
[3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:57.940]  are too small to save and it's in the grand tradition of
[3:27:57.940 --> 3:28:03.060]  you know this whole titanic mentality the lifeboats are there
[3:28:03.060 --> 3:28:07.940]  the life jackets are there you know the life rafts are there
[3:28:07.940 --> 3:28:12.260]  but they're not for the little people they're only for the too wealthy to sink
[3:28:12.260 --> 3:28:16.260]  that's how they lock the poor going on now actually as you know lock the poor in
[3:28:16.260 --> 3:28:19.300]  the bottom so that the elites could all run off and leave the women and
[3:28:19.300 --> 3:28:23.460]  children now expanding on that it's clear
[3:28:23.460 --> 3:28:26.180]  they're going to just keep bankrupting everything set up their world government
[3:28:26.180 --> 3:28:30.020]  system then try to refinance everything on our backs
[3:28:30.020 --> 3:28:33.380]  and if we don't like it north com and the militarized police are standing by i
[3:28:33.380 --> 3:28:36.900]  mean this is high treason the country hijacked just like the central banks
[3:28:36.900 --> 3:28:40.020]  hijacked third world countries how do we stop that or is it just going to run
[3:28:40.020 --> 3:28:43.460]  its course well you know i don't know you know how
[3:28:43.460 --> 3:28:46.260]  it's going to stop because i have to tell you alex that
[3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:49.460]  you know i'm a believer you know in my moral belief
[3:28:49.460 --> 3:28:53.140]  and the way i was raised in religion that i i was raised in
[3:28:53.140 --> 3:28:57.060]  it's it's it's it's criminal to kill innocent people

[3:33:40.580 --> 3:33:47.060]  but it's very very serious times tyranny is in our face
[3:33:47.060 --> 3:33:51.140]  Gerald Salante you know isn't that the weakness of these tyrants though is that
[3:33:51.140 --> 3:33:54.900]  they are so classically corrupt so classically tyrannical
[3:33:54.900 --> 3:33:58.660]  so classically obviously criminal bankrupt degenerates
[3:33:58.660 --> 3:34:02.740]  who are the enemies of all free people everywhere in the free market
[3:34:02.740 --> 3:34:07.620]  it is you know it i i began my career just as a little background i ran the
[3:34:07.620 --> 3:34:12.900]  mayoral campaign in yonkers new york in 1971 at a graduate school
[3:34:12.900 --> 3:34:17.140]  and uh... from there i worked in westchester county politics
[3:34:17.140 --> 3:34:21.460]  and they sent me up to albany i was the uh... assistant to the secretary to
[3:34:21.460 --> 3:34:25.540]  new york state senate and that's when i became really i just
[3:34:25.540 --> 3:34:30.580]  started to despise politics because i saw that the only way you could get up
[3:34:30.580 --> 3:34:34.500]  to the top is suck your way up to the top i'd be hanging around the senate
[3:34:34.500 --> 3:34:38.100]  chamber with my pal you know chit chatting about this or that was a
[3:34:38.100 --> 3:34:41.220]  young guy and a senator would walk in and my buddy would
[3:34:41.220 --> 3:34:45.380]  leave me to go pull out the chair to help the senator sit down
[3:34:45.380 --> 3:34:50.020]  you know to watch grown men grovel is a disgusting spectacle
[3:34:50.020 --> 3:34:55.940]  and if the people only knew what a con game all this is
[3:34:55.940 --> 3:35:00.580]  they would they would overthrow this government in a heartbeat
[3:35:00.580 --> 3:35:04.260]  all of them these people are paper thin
[3:35:04.260 --> 3:35:07.620]  for the very reasons that you elaborated
[3:35:07.620 --> 3:35:12.420]  nor they are they they're just it's staging their confidence men
[3:35:12.420 --> 3:35:16.340]  it's a con game and once people understand that
[3:35:16.340 --> 3:35:20.420]  they won't buy into the con but for some reason
[3:35:20.420 --> 3:35:25.060]  you know people keep drinking the kool-aid and and it amazes me i mean i
[3:35:25.060 --> 3:35:29.860]  have loads of friends that are you know these screaming liberals
[3:35:29.860 --> 3:35:35.060]  and when you point out hey you know obama just increased the military budget
[3:35:35.060 --> 3:35:38.340]  by four percent oh they don't want to hear that
[3:35:38.340 --> 3:35:41.780]  oh obama is sending seventeen thousand troops
[3:35:41.780 --> 3:35:46.660]  to afghanistan and with another what thirty thousand on schedule
[3:35:46.660 --> 3:35:51.620]  they don't want to hear that so people you know people are living the like
[3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:55.460]  children and they only want to believe what they want to believe
[3:35:55.460 --> 3:35:59.380]  and they stick their heads in the sand to the rest so i just think the whole
[3:35:59.380 --> 3:36:02.980]  problem comes down to is that people have lost their dignity and
[3:36:02.980 --> 3:36:06.500]  self-respect well that's it they've bought into delusions
[3:36:06.500 --> 3:36:09.940]  and lies just like it's always the poor ignorant
[3:36:09.940 --> 3:36:13.620]  hard-working fools that you see lined up on friday with their paycheck
[3:36:13.620 --> 3:36:17.300]  with like hungry kids with snot all over them in their car you know you walk in
[3:36:17.300 --> 3:36:20.980]  you see the snot covered kids in the broke down car and dad's in
[3:36:20.980 --> 3:36:24.740]  there buying lottery tickets buying scratch offs and you want to tell my
[3:36:24.740 --> 3:36:28.580]  buddy it's a scam don't do it they're like i i'm gonna win next time and
[3:36:28.580 --> 3:36:31.860]  they're like get out of here macklin you know and you can't even buy some milk
[3:36:31.860 --> 3:36:35.140]  because the poor people are all lined up buying the lottery tickets
[3:36:35.140 --> 3:36:38.820]  and you see him buy right back into obama as he betrays them
[3:36:38.820 --> 3:36:41.860]  and at first was all hill in the war he'll stop the warrantless wiretapping
[3:36:41.860 --> 3:36:45.940]  he'll he won't hire lobbyists now they attack me and email me and say so what
[3:36:45.940 --> 3:36:48.980]  that's how he's got to get things done because they've bought in that they
[3:36:48.980 --> 3:36:52.500]  got a seat at the table that they're living big you know through
[3:36:52.500 --> 3:36:56.260]  obama it's like a five-year-old watching a superhero cartoon and imagining
[3:36:56.260 --> 3:36:59.460]  jumping over the couch with pillows you know that they're superman
[3:36:59.460 --> 3:37:02.900]  that's fine for a five-year-old but living through obama that you're a
[3:37:02.900 --> 3:37:06.660]  superman and he's a superman when newsweek and others say
[3:37:06.660 --> 3:37:10.340]  confidence man and they go oh it's good he's a confidence man
[3:37:10.340 --> 3:37:14.500]  you need to buy into the hype that will save you they're openly saying buy into
[3:37:14.500 --> 3:37:18.660]  the fraud i mean this is a high level of scyop isn't it gerald salente
[3:37:18.660 --> 3:37:23.060]  well well it is definitely a you know it's a con game as we're saying and
[3:37:23.060 --> 3:37:27.540]  you again though you know that there's really no magic behind any of this
[3:37:27.540 --> 3:37:31.700]  it's so transparent but the people are afraid to see it
[3:37:31.700 --> 3:37:34.740]  there's nothing you know we know who's behind the curtain
[3:37:34.740 --> 3:37:39.140]  look at the people that he has around him i mean i just read this whole big
[3:37:39.140 --> 3:37:43.780]  thing on this guy axel rodent of new york times you know i mean
[3:37:43.780 --> 3:37:48.100]  i mean these people i mean they're just they're nothing
[3:37:48.100 --> 3:37:52.420]  you know they're just they're just blowhards and the people buy into it
[3:37:52.420 --> 3:37:56.180]  and they bow and as i said until people regain their
[3:37:56.180 --> 3:38:00.740]  self-respect and dignity you know we're not going to have the changes that we
[3:38:00.740 --> 3:38:04.900]  we really need in this government and people really have to stand up at the
[3:38:04.900 --> 3:38:11.220]  first by starting at the local level and and stopping these stupid taxes
[3:38:11.220 --> 3:38:15.940]  that they keep pushing down our with throats that's the beginning of it
[3:38:15.940 --> 3:38:19.460]  and uh that's happening you predicted that when you first came on with us
[3:38:19.460 --> 3:38:24.100]  three months ago you written about a year ago as you now on time
[3:38:24.100 --> 3:38:28.900]  tax revolts for state income tax local taxes carbon taxes income taxes

[3:38:32.500 --> 3:38:38.660]  some cities are just going wild right now and that's just the beginning and
[3:38:38.660 --> 3:38:43.460]  that's the hopeful sign you know alex when you hit people in their
[3:38:43.460 --> 3:38:47.700]  pocketbook all of a sudden they start to take notice
[3:38:47.700 --> 3:38:50.820]  and that's what was going to that's what that can be
[3:38:50.820 --> 3:38:56.500]  the genesis of this next revolution and by the way you know as you as your film
[3:38:56.500 --> 3:39:00.020]  crew knows you know we're right off the most historic
[3:39:00.020 --> 3:39:04.100]  corners in the united states the only place on each corner

[3:39:35.620 --> 3:39:40.020]  clowns i mean i love this language that they always use
[3:39:40.020 --> 3:39:44.100]  you know we need a bipartisan consensus to push through these packages
[3:39:44.100 --> 3:39:48.100]  by partisan who are they talking about Pelosi read
[3:39:48.100 --> 3:39:53.940]  barter uh shelby mcconnell frank dodd you know as i say how about

[3:40:03.940 --> 3:40:06.820]  we are standing on the shoulders of those that busted their butts and
[3:40:06.820 --> 3:40:09.860]  sacrificed and had such dignity and and you know

[3:40:14.660 --> 3:40:17.380]  you know i could just feel that love of your family that's why you're willing
[3:40:17.380 --> 3:40:21.380]  to sacrifice now for others because you understand that's what it is to be human
[3:40:21.380 --> 3:40:24.740]  what would your mother your father your aunt think of seeing the things that are
[3:40:24.740 --> 3:40:29.780]  happening now uh he has to be heartbroken because you know i can't my grandfather
[3:40:29.780 --> 3:40:33.380]  you know i remember my my aunt zizi telling me you know
[3:40:33.380 --> 3:40:38.100]  your grandfather you know an italian immigrant he was so proud to be part of
[3:40:38.100 --> 3:40:42.020]  this country that he was the first person online
[3:40:42.020 --> 3:40:48.420]  on on election day in all dressed up and proud that he had the right to vote
[3:40:48.420 --> 3:40:52.980]  their hearts would break matter of fact when before my aunt zizi passed on
[3:40:52.980 --> 3:40:57.140]  uh our heart was already broken what happened to this country
[3:40:57.140 --> 3:41:03.780]  you can see it and and i think my my um my willingness to speak out and and to
[3:41:03.780 --> 3:41:08.740]  maintain my dignity was instilled upon me by my mother
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:12.260]  you know uh she couldn't stand cowards
[3:41:12.260 --> 3:41:16.820]  and uh and and she couldn't stand politicians
[3:41:16.820 --> 3:41:21.460]  so i was raised in the right way i remember being a little boy
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:25.700]  and a politician was uh campaigning in yonkers new york
[3:41:25.700 --> 3:41:29.700]  in the old town of the old town part of the town in those days
[3:41:29.700 --> 3:41:33.940]  and my and as he's talking my mother as i was pushing my little sister in the
[3:41:33.940 --> 3:41:37.700]  stroller yelled out you're all a bunch of liars
[3:41:37.700 --> 3:41:43.780]  you'll say anything to get elected so i came from good stock
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:49.620]  oh man you're absolutely right and and and you know people valued freedom
[3:41:49.620 --> 3:41:52.260]  because most people that came to this country well everybody that came with
[3:41:52.260 --> 3:41:56.340]  was from england or africa or china or italy or russia
[3:41:56.340 --> 3:41:59.620]  they had come from tyranny and thugs and bureaucrats
[3:41:59.620 --> 3:42:02.980]  ruling over them and having to go hat in hand to be able to do anything
[3:42:02.980 --> 3:42:06.340]  the elites trying to suppress society destroy middle classes
[3:42:06.340 --> 3:42:09.860]  they recognize tyranny and i think we've just had it so good so long
[3:42:09.860 --> 3:42:13.380]  that we forgot that we have to fight for liberty as thomas jefferson said
[3:42:13.380 --> 3:42:18.020]  uh or you lose it and and and now the greedy thieves are trying to take it all
[3:42:18.020 --> 3:42:22.660]  well well the one thing that i would say we haven't had it so good for so long
[3:42:22.660 --> 3:42:26.180]  you know so it's like the frog in the you know in the frying pan
[3:42:26.180 --> 3:42:30.100]  you know they turn up the heat a little bit at a time a little bit at a time
[3:42:30.100 --> 3:42:33.700]  and that's what they've been doing i mean you know to me the last great
[3:42:33.700 --> 3:42:37.860]  president of this country was eisenhower and i mean this is a man
[3:42:37.860 --> 3:42:40.500]  anybody that says eisenhower was full of baloney
[3:42:40.500 --> 3:42:44.100]  i would have loved to have seen them go up and say that to his face
[3:42:44.100 --> 3:42:47.700]  you know he warned us about the military industrial complex
[3:42:47.700 --> 3:42:50.420]  and then we got that i'm no crook richard nixon
[3:42:50.420 --> 3:42:54.500]  and it declined since then and they've been robbing us blind
[3:42:54.500 --> 3:42:58.260]  you know i remember when i first went to college they had antitrust acts
[3:42:58.260 --> 3:43:01.620]  you know if you were a big company you couldn't buy things cheaper than
[3:43:01.620 --> 3:43:04.740]  anybody else because you were buying him in quantity
[3:43:04.740 --> 3:43:09.140]  so it allowed the mom and pops to stay into business well just to clarify
[3:43:09.140 --> 3:43:11.860]  just to clarify i mean i agree with you that we have been
[3:43:11.860 --> 3:43:15.060]  having a lowering standard of living really since the 60s with both the man
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:18.580]  and woman having to work uh with with the children being
[3:43:18.580 --> 3:43:23.780]  controlled by the state uh with with debt rising and savings falling
[3:43:23.780 --> 3:43:27.060]  i agree with you that i mean i'm talking about the last hundred years
[3:43:27.060 --> 3:43:29.940]  uh we've seen a lot of you know power masses
[3:43:29.940 --> 3:43:33.220]  through the robber barons but go ahead oh no no i yeah we know we're on the
[3:43:33.220 --> 3:43:37.060]  same page and i i just wanted to make that you know that one point
[3:43:37.060 --> 3:43:41.460]  and and uh... yeah the last hundred years are going back you know
[3:43:41.460 --> 3:43:44.740]  that quote that i've read uh... from a linkin
[3:43:44.740 --> 3:43:49.220]  uh... warning about the uh... corporations taking over the country
[3:43:49.220 --> 3:43:52.900]  and so this has been a long downhill slide but now it's just
[3:43:52.900 --> 3:43:57.060]  accelerated to the point where i mean we're becoming indentured servants of
[3:43:57.060 --> 3:43:58.820]  the state
[3:43:58.820 --> 3:44:01.060]  charles salante uh...
[3:44:01.060 --> 3:44:04.740]  well my guys in the interview a month ago brought back your new book that just
[3:44:04.740 --> 3:44:05.940]  came out
[3:44:05.940 --> 3:44:07.620]  uh...
[3:44:07.620 --> 3:44:11.940]  and just while we were editing footage or you know files were rendering and i
[3:44:11.940 --> 3:44:16.500]  had time i read it if you know you would think a book about uh...
[3:44:16.500 --> 3:44:19.620]  you know about your aunt wouldn't be informative but it it it it it was it
[3:44:19.620 --> 3:44:22.420]  was super informative and i know you've written so many books so many best
[3:44:22.420 --> 3:44:23.140]  sellers
[3:44:23.140 --> 3:44:25.940]  spend a few minutes and i want to get into this uh...
[3:44:25.940 --> 3:44:28.900]  training manual they're giving police all over the country demonizing people
[3:44:28.900 --> 3:44:30.260]  to talk about a new world order
[3:44:30.260 --> 3:44:32.020]  uh... but tell us about the new book
[3:44:32.020 --> 3:44:35.460]  well the book is called with jizzy gave honey boy and jizzy
[3:44:35.460 --> 3:44:38.980]  is the italian dialect the neapolitan dialect for auntie
[3:44:38.980 --> 3:44:44.180]  so she was my aunt and and uh... i i realized that you know as i spent time
[3:44:44.180 --> 3:44:44.980]  with her
[3:44:44.980 --> 3:44:48.660]  and listen to a listening to her kitchen table wisdom
[3:44:48.660 --> 3:44:52.020]  that you know we really lost the country that
[3:44:52.020 --> 3:44:54.980]  was so different than the one that i grew up in
[3:44:54.980 --> 3:44:57.620]  and the one so many of us loved
[3:44:57.620 --> 3:45:01.780]  and and that's what the book is really about if they if i were to rename it
[3:45:01.780 --> 3:45:04.940]  i would call it when america had a soul
[3:45:04.940 --> 3:45:06.380]  and uh...
[3:45:06.380 --> 3:45:11.260]  it is a trend book in in many ways and talking about where things are going
[3:45:11.260 --> 3:45:14.220]  but more importantly i think it's it's a book about
[3:45:14.220 --> 3:45:19.300]  you know what america was what america is and what america can be again
[3:45:19.300 --> 3:45:20.820]  if we reclaim it
[3:45:20.820 --> 3:45:23.180]  and take it away from the elite that have
[3:45:23.180 --> 3:45:24.900]  that have you served so much
[3:45:24.900 --> 3:45:27.860]  i mean when i began my career in the workforce
[3:45:27.860 --> 3:45:30.220]  i believe that the the uh...
[3:45:30.220 --> 3:45:32.140]  differential between the
[3:45:32.140 --> 3:45:34.180]  uh... c e o of the company
[3:45:34.180 --> 3:45:37.500]  and the average worker was about twenty to one
[3:45:37.500 --> 3:45:40.060]  now it's over five hundred to one
[3:45:40.060 --> 3:45:41.260]  and uh...
[3:45:41.260 --> 3:45:44.120]  but but the things that you're talking about alex
[3:45:44.120 --> 3:45:47.900]  uh... on the on the military moving into our neighborhoods
[3:45:47.900 --> 3:45:50.540]  is so frightening and people should really
[3:45:50.540 --> 3:45:54.340]  really become aware of this and start doing the best they can
[3:45:54.340 --> 3:45:56.180]  to stop this from happening
[3:45:56.180 --> 3:45:58.620]  now they should go to all the city councils and say this is a violation of
[3:45:58.620 --> 3:46:00.020]  policy commentators
[3:46:00.020 --> 3:46:03.580]  this is in the police departments it's happening
[3:46:03.580 --> 3:46:05.980]  you know i remember my grandfather's
[3:46:05.980 --> 3:46:10.140]  in it it was normal just when you were at the dinner table or or even my dad to
[3:46:10.140 --> 3:46:13.260]  explain how governments work and how history worked and they taught the
[3:46:13.260 --> 3:46:16.340]  military you don't have the military on the streets and we're gonna send the
[3:46:16.340 --> 3:46:17.700]  constitution bill of rights
[3:46:17.700 --> 3:46:20.540]  not what the president says if it violates that
[3:46:20.540 --> 3:46:23.100]  and we've gone from that now
[3:46:23.100 --> 3:46:27.060]  to these training manuals i'm gonna put an old one up on screen
[3:46:27.060 --> 3:46:30.140]  well you know that's the new one i'm already shown the old one last hour
[3:46:30.140 --> 3:46:32.620]  uh... strategic report
[3:46:32.620 --> 3:46:34.260]  to twenty oh nine
[3:46:34.260 --> 3:46:38.620]  the modern militia movement in a mix gun owner groups pro-gun groups in with
[3:46:38.620 --> 3:46:40.100]  white supremacist
[3:46:40.100 --> 3:46:42.860]  they say those that believe in a new world order
[3:46:42.860 --> 3:46:46.740]  uh... these theories very but most always involve a globalist dictatorship
[3:46:46.740 --> 3:46:50.260]  in a in a uh... world government run by banks
[3:46:50.260 --> 3:46:54.300]  i mean this is openly being announced they show fema region say those they
[3:46:54.300 --> 3:46:56.940]  show i'm putting on screen right now official
[3:46:56.940 --> 3:47:00.340]  north american union s p p maps that have been on cnn
[3:47:00.340 --> 3:47:03.860]  of how they're gonna have every major highway be an international toll road
[3:47:03.860 --> 3:47:06.460]  from mexico open to the deep north of canada
[3:47:06.460 --> 3:47:09.180]  and they just say it doesn't exist these people are insane
[3:47:09.180 --> 3:47:12.580]  so they're teaching police as the new york times the washington post announced
[3:47:12.580 --> 3:47:15.820]  world government a bank of the world newsweek time
[3:47:15.820 --> 3:47:19.420]  uh... headlines like in the times of london and now for world government where
[3:47:19.420 --> 3:47:22.020]  they say we kept its secret for your own good
[3:47:22.020 --> 3:47:25.420]  in in in this training manual that's going at police everywhere in the
[3:47:25.420 --> 3:47:26.740]  country
[3:47:26.740 --> 3:47:31.260]  it has a uh... you know don't tread on me flag uh... it shows america freedom to
[3:47:31.260 --> 3:47:34.140]  fascism in the film zeitgeist in it
[3:47:34.140 --> 3:47:35.820]  we just showed that
[3:47:35.820 --> 3:47:40.420]  and shows it next to the turner diaries which was a white supremacist thing
[3:47:40.420 --> 3:47:42.620]  about killing police to see how they do
[3:47:42.620 --> 3:47:45.340]  guilt by association
[3:47:45.340 --> 3:47:48.540]  i mean this is just off the charts and this was sent to me
[3:47:48.540 --> 3:47:51.580]  uh... by the missouri information analyst center police officers into
[3:47:51.580 --> 3:47:53.060]  that's where they got it from
[3:47:53.060 --> 3:47:56.420]  uh... but and it and it says on the cover of this
[3:47:56.420 --> 3:47:59.580]  unclassified law enforcement sensitive
[3:47:59.580 --> 3:48:02.780]  and i've seen these in texas versions and others it's it's the same thing but
[3:48:02.780 --> 3:48:03.980]  they're updating it
[3:48:03.980 --> 3:48:07.220]  i mean how do they say none of this exist
[3:48:07.220 --> 3:48:11.100]  and then mix in mainstream things that are happening with white supremacist
[3:48:11.100 --> 3:48:14.740]  intel police that people are dangerous if they're into this
[3:48:14.740 --> 3:48:18.100]  well you know that's the way they always do things you know they they lump them
[3:48:18.100 --> 3:48:19.300]  all together
[3:48:19.300 --> 3:48:21.460]  and it's one size fits all
[3:48:21.460 --> 3:48:23.740]  i have a question
[3:48:23.740 --> 3:48:25.300]  do you believe
[3:48:25.300 --> 3:48:26.860]  that the military
[3:48:26.860 --> 3:48:30.180]  will fire on its people
[3:48:30.180 --> 3:48:33.820]  they're gonna stage riots and then it's gonna look like all they stop the riots
[3:48:33.820 --> 3:48:35.820]  it's reasonable to set the precedent
[3:48:35.820 --> 3:48:39.420]  like all we do have female camps for medical care where you can stay
[3:48:39.420 --> 3:48:42.220]  you know the troops are here to help at car wrecks that's how they're rolling
[3:48:42.220 --> 3:48:43.260]  it out
[3:48:43.260 --> 3:48:46.020]  and uh... i believe that uh...
[3:48:46.020 --> 3:48:48.380]  i think the way they're going to like the military i think a lot of more than a
[3:48:48.380 --> 3:48:51.140]  far on u.s. citizens
[3:48:51.140 --> 3:48:54.540]  because that's a question we're going to pose in the trends journal in the
[3:48:54.540 --> 3:48:56.100]  next edition
[3:48:56.100 --> 3:48:58.660]  and i i i happen to agree with you
[3:48:58.660 --> 3:49:03.660]  they'll they'll stage riots we always see these people that they call anarchists
[3:49:03.660 --> 3:49:07.620]  that always have black you know i always have dressed in black and have masks on
[3:49:07.620 --> 3:49:11.260]  they've been caught being police in indian it happened in Denver Denver pop
[3:49:11.260 --> 3:49:14.460]  sarah had no no exactly you know i agree with you
[3:49:14.460 --> 3:49:18.500]  and i think that they are going to fire on the people unfortunately
[3:49:18.500 --> 3:49:20.940]  and uh... the the only thing
[3:49:20.940 --> 3:49:23.860]  that can we think that can happen
[3:49:23.860 --> 3:49:24.540]  that this
[3:49:24.540 --> 3:49:26.220]  to stay this off
[3:49:26.220 --> 3:49:30.220]  is that that tax revolts take up a greater precedence
[3:49:30.220 --> 3:49:33.420]  and that we could push in a different direction sooner
[3:49:33.420 --> 3:49:36.180]  because we believe that this summer
[3:49:36.180 --> 3:49:38.780]  you're going to start seeing the first outbreaks
[3:49:38.780 --> 3:49:40.580]  of major violence
[3:49:40.580 --> 3:49:44.180]  you know what my saying is originally a bronx boy is
[3:49:44.180 --> 3:49:46.420]  that when people lose everything
[3:49:46.420 --> 3:49:49.060]  and they have nothing left to lose
[3:49:49.060 --> 3:49:50.540]  they lose it
[3:49:50.540 --> 3:49:55.860]  and people that you know the white shoe boys they have no idea what it is
[3:49:55.860 --> 3:49:57.900]  you know to be destitute
[3:49:57.900 --> 3:50:01.460]  and we're going to start seeing riots in major cities
[3:50:01.460 --> 3:50:04.380]  that rival way surpassed actually
[3:50:04.380 --> 3:50:06.460]  those that we saw
[3:50:06.460 --> 3:50:08.980]  back in the nineteen sixties
[3:50:08.980 --> 3:50:11.500]  when he's with being burnt down
[3:50:11.500 --> 3:50:14.180]  you're gonna start seeing the same thing happened
[3:50:14.180 --> 3:50:17.020]  in the united states we're forecasting
[3:50:17.020 --> 3:50:18.300]  by this summer
[3:50:18.300 --> 3:50:19.900]  and we're saying to people
[3:50:19.900 --> 3:50:22.060]  you better prepare for the worst
[3:50:22.060 --> 3:50:23.660]  you know it's incredible
[3:50:23.660 --> 3:50:25.340]  this private group
[3:50:25.340 --> 3:50:27.900]  in the in the eighty elements of the popular center put these out but i've
[3:50:27.900 --> 3:50:30.900]  seen the summer ones all over the country
[3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:34.460]  they end up saying in here this is sensitive you can't show anybody this
[3:50:34.460 --> 3:50:37.500]  it's our free speech to show how you're demonizing
[3:50:37.500 --> 3:50:40.620]  the american people and how you're setting up this police state grid and
[3:50:40.620 --> 3:50:43.900]  mixing in good patriots and slandering
[3:50:43.900 --> 3:50:48.620]  slandering things like a meh america freedom to fascism
[3:50:48.620 --> 3:50:50.740]  anti-freedom
[3:50:50.740 --> 3:50:53.980]  it says anti-income tax film you know how dare them

[3:55:11.740 --> 3:55:15.180]  they admit what we read out of the Robert Passer C. F. R. public documents
[3:55:15.180 --> 3:55:19.940]  judicial watch sued and this is put out by Simon and Schuster and books now
[3:55:19.940 --> 3:55:25.060]  Jerome Corsi you guys look like fools okay it's all over the news they're
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:28.700]  doing this it we sued and got the documents where they said it's a North
[3:55:28.700 --> 3:55:32.940]  American Union and then you're saying we're dangerous and it's a lies and
[3:55:32.940 --> 3:55:37.500]  telling police look the other training manual I said if you talk about the
[3:55:37.500 --> 3:55:42.140]  Constitution you're a terrorist the one from Phoenix Gerald Salente I mean this

[3:55:54.300 --> 3:55:56.580]  states that created the federal government you know declare that they're
[3:55:56.580 --> 3:56:02.260]  gonna bring them to heal yeah yeah and and now we're in a very very dangerous
[3:56:02.260 --> 3:56:06.860]  time and the other thing that you know we should be looking for because we're
[3:56:06.860 --> 3:56:12.980]  calling for the as you well know the greatest depression and we're also we're
[3:56:12.980 --> 3:56:17.380]  looking for the collapse of oh nine to begin to happen with the commercial
[3:56:17.380 --> 3:56:21.500]  real estate section sector which is going to be much greater collapse than
[3:56:21.500 --> 3:56:26.420]  the subprime and residential sector but in the meantime we're going to start
[3:56:26.420 --> 3:56:32.060]  seeing some false flags to get the people's minds off the economy and we're
[3:56:32.060 --> 3:56:36.540]  very concerned of course what's going on in the Middle East and we just saw a
[3:56:36.540 --> 3:56:43.900]  for example the one ray of hope from the Obama administration with this new
[3:56:43.900 --> 3:56:49.940]  diplomat Freeman that was forced to resign under pressure from the lobbies
[3:56:49.940 --> 3:56:55.500]  the Israeli lobby because you know he doesn't believe the Palestinians are
[3:56:55.500 --> 3:57:01.300]  being treated very well and so we think that being that the Israeli
[3:57:01.300 --> 3:57:09.580]  government is in such turmoil and that they can really be a some kind of
[3:57:09.580 --> 3:57:15.580]  Middle East conflict and it keeps pointing to Iran and we're warning that
[3:57:15.580 --> 3:57:23.060]  if either United States or Israel attacks Iran in any way it could be the
[3:57:23.060 --> 3:57:28.260]  beginning of World War three. Gerald Solente we are out of time friends
